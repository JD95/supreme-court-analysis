TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens,
Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,

The Chief Justice said:
The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive

The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.

Mr. Solicitor General addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
At a meeting of the members of the Bar of the Supreme
Court this afternoon, resolutions memorializing our regard
for the Honorable Warren E. Burger and expressing our profound sorrow at his death were unanimously adopted. With
the Court's leave, and following recent precedent, I shall
read selectively from the resolutions at this time and shall

ask that they be set forth in their entirety in the records ofthe Court.

RESOLUTION
Warren Earl Burger served the Court and the country asChief Justice of the United States from 1969 until his retirement in 1986. Lawyer, administrator, and jurist, WarrenBurger embodied the finest traditions of American law in a
career that spanned 65 years.Chief Justice Burger was very much a product of this
Nation, a practical man with a passion for freedom and anunderstanding of the responsibilities that freedom entails.

As a judge, he understood that the exercise of liberty mustbe guided by our traditions constrained by the rule of law.
As an administrator, he sought tirelessly to improve theways in which the legal system works for the people it is
supposed to serve. Above all, as a lawyer, he knew the im-portance of tempering abstract legal doctrine with common
sense.The resolution describes Burger's birth and early life in
Minnesota, how he worked his way through college and lawschool and quickly established himself as one of the preeminent lawyers in the State's private bar, his marriage to El-vera Stromberg, who would be his lifelong companion, and
commitment to his family, and his increasing involvement inthe affairs of his community.

An incident of that time helps illustrate Burger's personalcommitment to the principles that animate the Constitution.
After Pearl Harbor, there was widespread support for thepolicy of forcibly relocating California's Japanese Americans.
The young St. Paul lawyer's voice was one of the few toargue that these citizens' constitutional rights ought not be
sacrificed to popular passion.He organized a committee of the Council on Human Relations to help resettle some of them in Minnesota, and openedhis home to one family for nearly a year while the father
looked for work.Although Burger refused all requests that he run for public office, he became deeply involved in Minnesota political

viiCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
life. At the 1952 Republican National Convention, he was
instrumental in swinging his State delegation to support
Dwight D. Eisenhower, thereby assuring General Eisenhower the party's nomination.

Following the election, President Eisenhower called him
to Washington to serve as an Assistant Attorney General
of the United States in charge of the Civil Division. The
resolution discusses his outstanding contributions at the
helm of the Civil Division until his appointment, 3 years
later, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia.

At that time, the Federal courts of the District of Columbia had the widest jurisdiction of any courts in the United
States, functioning as the equivalent of State courts for the
District itself, as well as having the regular jurisdiction of
other Federal courts.

Judge Burger quickly found himself embroiled in important controversies regarding the criminal law that were
sweeping both the legal profession and the Nation at the
time. Burger's opinions, whether for the court or in dissent,
grew to the view that solicitude for the rights of the defendant should be tempered by recognition of the need to enforce
the law, yet he was reluctant to press to overrule prior decisions, preferring instead to curtail their reach while preserving their essence.

The resolution then describes aspects of Burger's tenure
at the D. C. Circuit, which established him as a leader on his
court and throughout the Nation.

When Chief Justice Earl Warren retired, President Nixon
turned to Warren E. Burger. With the unanimous endorsement of the Judiciary Committee, Burger was quickly confirmed by the Senate. He was sworn in as Chief Justice of
the United States on June 23, 1969.

There were many who expected that as Chief Justice he
would try to overturn the landmark criminal law decisions
of the Warren Court, but neither those who hoped for this
outcome, nor those who feared it, seemed to have considered

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
viii CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
that one of the hallmarks of this judge was respect forprecedent.

Chief Justice Burger cared too deeply for the great institu-tion that is the Supreme Court of the United States to believe that its decisions, the articulation of our Nation's high-est law, could be tossed aside whenever there was a change
of personnel on the bench.His approach to major criminal law precedents such as
Miranda v. Arizona and Mapp v. Ohio was to leave such
rulings intact, while defining their outer limits.Under his leadership, for instance, the Court held that an

otherwise inadmissible statement could be used to impeacha defendant's credibility at trial. He joined in one opinion
establishing a public safety exception to Miranda and, inanother, deciding that a confession obtained in violation of
Miranda did not taint a second valid confession obtainedlater.

Similarly, the Court he led trimmed the exclusionary rule
enshrined in Mapp by carving out good faith exceptions.Burger's conservatism was of that American strain which

insists that the law protect the individual from the excessesof State power. He was to state clearly and repeatedly that
he would never vote to overrule Miranda because to do sowould be an invitation to lawlessness by law enforcement
authorities.

He concurred in decisions extending to misdemeanor cases
the right of indigent defendants to counsel, and recognizing
a defendant's right to a psychiatrist if necessary for his
defense.

Chief Justice Burger placed a premium on protecting
individual liberties. His strong commitment to the First
Amendment values of freedom of speech and the press can
be seen in many of his opinions.

In Wooley v. Maynard, for example, he authored the opinion holding that a State may not compel an individual to
carry on his license plate a slogan offensive to his deeply
held views.

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n

ixCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
Yet Burger also recognized that our freedoms are notabsolute, that there are limits beyond which we may not

go without trampling on the rights of others. In Miller v.
California, Chief Justice Burger crafted the definition of
obscenity that we use today.Further, in declaring that it was up to local juries applying

contemporary community standards to decide whether a par-ticular work fit the Court's formulation, he put to rest the
idea that there was some uniform national community standard in such matters.The resolution describes The Chief Justice's commitment

to the freedom of conscience exemplified by his opinions forthe Court interpreting the religion clauses in cases such as
Lemon v. Kurtzman and Wisconsin v. Yoder.Turning to Burger's contributions to the area of civil
rights, the resolution observes that, as district courts becameinvolved in complicated questions of quotas, racial balance,
redrawing of school district lines, busing and more, many
doubted the propriety of the Court's involvement at all, andsome believed that Chief Justice Burger was hostile to such

efforts.He put disbelief to rest in

Swann v. Charl ot teMecklenburg Board of Education. Writing for a unanimousCourt, The Chief Justice emphatically affirmed the vital role

of the Federal courts in eliminating all vestiges of racial segregation from public school systems.

In other civil rights cases, he led the Court in upholding
congressional set-asides of a percentage of public works
funds for minority businesses, invalidating State aid to racially segregated private schools, and sustaining the Internal
Revenue Service's denial of tax exemptions to private
schools that practice racial discrimination.

During Chief Justice Burger's tenure, the Court also
adopted a progressive approach to the rights of women and
members of other disadvantaged groups under the Equal
Protection Clause. His own more significant opinions included Reed v. Reed, striking down a State statute giving

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
x CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
preference to men over women in estate administrations, and
Hishon v. King and Spalding, applying Title VII's prohibition of sex discrimination to law firm partnership decisions.He voted to end gender classifications on social security

dependent benefits and jury selection, and to declare invalidState laws restricting aliens' access to public employment
and welfare benefits.After discussing Burger's role in

Roe v. Wade and its
progeny, the resolution turns to The Chief Justice's extraordinary contributions to this Court's separation of powersjurisprudence.

Warren Burger was intensely interested in AmericanGovernment. He understood fully the concerns that had led
the Framers to separate Government power among compet-ing and mutually restraining legislative, executive, and judicial branches. In a case that produced one of his most im-portant opinions,

Immigration and Naturalization Service
v. Chadha, the Court invalidated the device known as the
one-House veto.History will surely view Chief Justice Burger's opinion for

the Court in another separation of powers case as the mostsignificant of his career, indeed as one of the most important
opinions of any justice at any time. United States v. Nixonwas to lead directly to the resignation of a President.

The special prosecutor's indictment of certain defendants
in the Watergate affair was being hampered by PresidentNixon's refusal to turn over tapes and other records of conversations between him and others, including Governmentofficials.

The President, like several of his predecessors, claimed ex-ecutive privilege. The district court had ruled that the special prosecutor had rebutted the presumption of privilegeand ordered an in camera examination of the subpoenaed
material.

The Chief Justice's opinion for the Court upheld the validity of the district court's order. The President's generalized
assertion of privilege could not prevail over the fundamental
demands of due process of law and the fair administration of

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n

xiCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
criminal justice. It would have to yield to the demonstratedspecific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.

Chief Justice Burger's interest in American Governmentalso served him well as the administrative leader of the third
branch. Indeed, he took his title, Chief Justice of the UnitedStates, seriously. In his eyes, its mandate encompassed
stewardship of the entire judicial system, State and Federal.His role in reforming the American judicial system was
profound. He was an active leader of the Federal judiciary
as Chairman of the Judicial Conference of the United States.He turned the Federal Judicial Center, of which he was

Chairman of the Board by statute, into a respected source ofresearch and writing about the courts, and a rich educational
resource. He promoted the idea of circuit executives, offi-cials who now contribute so much to the efficient working of
our courts.In addition to his many contributions toward beneficial
change, Chief Justice Burger revered this Court's history
and saw its building not just as a courtroom and chambers,but as an opportunity to educate the public.

A guiding spirit of the Supreme Court Historical Societyand creator of the position of Curator of the Supreme Court,
Burger helped to fill empty spaces with exhibits and torekindle discussion and debate about our constitutional
heritage.

The resolution finally recounts the qualities that mark TheChief Justice as a man of great warmth and kindness. This

was a man who, for example, conceived and personally super-vised the construction of a ramp to enable Justice Douglas
to take his place at the bench after the latter's stroke. Hewas a man who, for more than 10 years, sent pins garnered in
his world travels to the handicapped child of a former clerk.Many could not comprehend why Warren Burger would
leave one of the most powerful positions in Government to
serve as Chair of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the
United States Constitution.

They did not know the man, with his love of that normal
document, his understanding of our Nation's traditions, his

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
xii CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
appreciation of the lessons of history, and his faith in thepower of education. There was no one in the United States

more suited to the task, and no role more fitting as a cap-stone to his distinguished career.

We cherish this image of Warren Burger as a teacher offundamental democratic values to the Nation's children and
to us all.

Wherefore, it is accordingly
RESOLVED that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of theUnited States, express our profound sorrow that Chief Justice Warren E. Burger is no longer with us, our admirationfor his deep understanding of our history and traditions as a
Nation, and his commitment to those wide restraints thatmake us free, and our gratitude for his ceaseless labors to
improve the administration of the Nation's system of justice;and it is further

RESOLVED that the Solicitor General be asked to pre-sent these resolutions to the Court, and that the Attorney
General be asked to move that they be inscribed upon theCourt's permanent records.

The Chief Justice said:
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. I recognize the Attor-ney General of the United States.

Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory ofWarren Earl Burger, The Chief Justice of the United States

from 1969 to 1986.Born in St. Paul in 1907 to a family of modest means, Warren Burger was raised on a small truck farm in Stacy, Minne-sota. He attended local public schools and in high school

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n

xiiiCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
was president of the Student Council and editor of the schoolnewspaper, and he lettered in football, hockey, swimming,

and track.He then worked his way, selling insurance by day, through
the University of Minnesota and the St. Paul College of Law,now William Mitchell, where he attended nights, receiving
his law degree magna cum laude in 1931. Two years later,he married Elvera Stromberg. Harry Blackmun, his childhood friend and future colleague on this Court, was best
man.After graduating from law school, he soon joined an established firm in St. Paul, where he became a partner. Fromthe beginning, Warren Burger demonstrated in both his public and his private life a deep commitment to just treatmentof individuals of all races.

In the 1940's, he served on St. Paul's first Council onHuman Rights, which he helped organize to fight racial discrimination, and when Japanese Americans were forced to
leave their West Coast homes following the bombing of PearlHarbor, he led a committee to help resettle those who had

been displaced.He became aligned politically with Harold Stassen, managing Stassen's first gubernatorial campaign in 1938, and hiscampaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 1948.

While serving as Stassen's floor manager at the Republican National Convention in 1952, Burger pledged the Minne-sota delegation's support to Dwight Eisenhower, ensuring

Eisenhower's nomination on the first ballot.His energy, abilities, and political acumen did not go unnoticed. In 1953, he left Minnesota for Washington, D. C., ac-cepting President Eisenhower's appointment to serve as an
Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Divisionunder Attorney General Brownell. His distinguished service in that capacity included several appearances before this
Court.

In 1956, President Eisenhower persuaded the Assistant
Attorney General to forgo his return to private practice in
St. Paul and instead to accept the President's nomination to

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
xiv CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia. He would serve with distinction on that influential court for 13 years, developing a national reputation.Judge Burger's express desire to restore greater balance
to the criminal justice system caught the attention of thenewly inaugurated Richard Nixon. Impressed as well with
Judge Burger's reputation as an outstanding jurist, Presi-dent Nixon nominated him to replace the retiring Earl
Warren.

Less than 5 weeks later, on June 23rd, 1969, WarrenBurger was sworn in as this Nation's fifteenth Chief Justice.

He served in that role for 17 years, longer than any otherChief Justice in the 20th Century.

Confounding the expectations of those who hoped, orfeared, that he would immediately set about reversing the
decisions of the Warren era, the new Chief Justice was notan advocate for radical change. His experiences as a practitioner, as Government official, as Federal judge, had instilled in him a skepticism towards rigid doctrinal views ofany stripe.

His jurisprudence was complex and nuanced, but consist-ently reflective of certain core values, a reverence for the
constitutional framework envisioned by the Founders, a deepappreciation of the personal and structural importance of our
fundamental liberties, including those of the people as an organized community, an understanding that the law must takeaccount of realities beyond the courtroom, and a steadfast

dedication to improving the administration of justice.In addition to his contributions as a jurist, Warren Burger's tenure was remarkable for his intensive efforts to im-prove the quality of both the bench and the bar. He implemented the most significant administrative overhaul of thisCourt since the Taft era, directing substantial investments
in systems and modernization and at the same time devoting
significant resources to the preservation and commemoration
of the Court's traditions and history, making the Court a
more accessible and welcoming place for the thousands who
visit its halls.

xvCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
As Chief Justice of the United States, Burger approachedthe task of judicial administration with an appreciation that

how justice is dispensed at every level directly affects thelives of the people.

In 1971, for example, he helped found the National Centerfor State Courts in Williamsburg, Virginia, which provides
information, education, and management services for Courtleaders.

Following a prison riot at Attica, New York, he was instrumental in establishing the National Institute of Corrections,an agency charged with providing specialized correction

service to State and local corrections agencies, and as Chair-man of the Board of the Federal Judicial Center, The Chief
Justice guided the newly established center's growth into afull fledged agency for research and training for the Federal courts.The Chief Justice also visited and studied legal institutions
in various parts of the globe, and participated actively in
symposia with scholars and statesmen from around theworld.

Drawing largely on the British experience, he promotedthe establishment and growth of the American Inns of Court
program, which today has hundreds of local chaptersthroughout the 50 States and the District of Columbia, bringing novice attorneys together with more experienced attorneys and local judges to help the former develop trial skillsand to promote more generally a sense of ethics and fellowship within the profession.Burger's concern for the practical effect of legal rules
played an important part in his jurisprudence. He was, forexample, skeptical that the benefits of the exclusionary rule
justified its cost to society. While the Court has retainedthe exclusionary rule, Chief Justice Burger played a key part
in excepting from its reach classes of cases that do not persuasively implicate the rule's deterrence rationale.

Most noticeably, he delivered the opinion of the Court in
Nix v. Williams, recognizing the inevitable discovery exception. The basis for the exception was explicitly pragmatic.

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
xvi CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
If the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of theevidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would

have been discovered by lawful means, then the deterrencerationale has so little basis that the evidence should be
received.The Chief Justice's reluctance to afford unlimited scope to
abstract doctrine featured prominently in his landmark opin-ion for a unanimous Court in

United States v. Nixon, upholding the special prosecutor's subpoena of the President's
tape-recorded conversations.Although The Chief Justice recognized that the President

has a legitimate need for confidentiality in the performanceof his executive duties, he rejected the contention that the
President is entitled to an absolute privilege from disclosure.The Chief Justice observed that privileges against forced
disclosure are rare exceptions to the demand for every man'sevidence. They are not lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth.

Though skeptical of judgemade rules, Chief Justice Burgerobserved strict fidelity to the dictates of the Constitution,

particularly the structural limitations that inhere in the sep-aration of powers, which he believed critical to the stability
of our system of governance.In 1983, he delivered the landmark opinion in

INS v.
Chadha, striking down on separation of powers grounds a
one-House veto provision in the Immigration and NationalityAct, which permitted either House of Congress unilaterally

to overrule immigration decisions delegated by law to thediscretion of the Attorney General.

Notwithstanding Congress' use of similar provisions in lit-erally hundreds of enactments, the Court held the one-House
veto procedure to be violative of the constitutional require-ments for a valid legislative act, namely, bicameral approval
and presentment to the President.

The Chief Justice's opinion explained: The choices we discern as having been made in the Constitutional Convention
impose burdens on governmental processes that often seem
clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable, but those hard choices

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n

xviiCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
were consciously made by men who had lived under a formof government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts

to go unchecked.

"With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, andpotential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way

to preserve freedom than by making the exercise ofpower subject to the carefully crafted restraints spelled
out in the Constitution."
Toward the end of his tenure, Chief Justice Burger againwrote for the Court in Bowsher v. Synar, striking down provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act that requiredthe President to make budget cuts specified by the Comptroller General under certain emergency conditions.Concluding that the Comptroller General was answerable
to Congress, The Chief Justice rejected the argument thathe was unlikely, in fact, to act as an agent for the legislative
branch. The separation of powers must be strictly enforced,
he wrote, because as the Founders well understood, in thelong term, structural protections against abuse of power are

critical to preserving liberty.To Warren Burger, there was special significance in the
first three words of the Constitution: `We, the People.' Theywere a concise, yet momentous declaration that for the first
time in history, power was created in a Government from the
bottom up, not from the top down.That Government was under the Constitution, therefore

would not always be tidy, was all only natural. Democracy,as The Chief Justice understood it, is people, men and women
with all their virtues and flaws, trying to work together toproduce ordered liberty.

The Chief Justice's abiding faith in the ordinary men andwomen of this Nation is reflected in his belief that along
with the structural safeguards afforded by the separation of
powers, the guarantees of the First Amendment are criticalto the maintenance of ordered liberty.

The link between structural integrity and free speech ismanifest in his several opinions involving the right of the

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n
xviii CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
people to hear, see, and communicate observations concerning criminal proceedings. The Chief Justice explained that
people in an open society do not demand infallibility from
their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what
they are prohibited from observing.

Warren Burger's appreciation of the value of individual
liberties was reflected in many of his constitutional opinions.
In Wisconsin v. Yoder, for example, where the Court upheld
on free exercise grounds the right of Amish parents to except their offspring from uniform State schooling requirements, he recognized as a constitutional imperative the principle that a way of life that is odd or even erratic but
interferes with no rights or interests of others is not to be
condemned because it is different.

In Wooley v. Maynard, he again championed the right not
to conform, authorizing the Court's opinion affirming the
right of Jehovah's Witnesses to refuse to display the motto,
"Live Free or Die," on their New Hampshire license plates.
He explained that where the State's interest is to disseminate an ideology, no matter how acceptable to some, such
interests cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment
right to avoid being the courier for such message.

He recognized at the same time, however, that the claims
of individual liberty do not invariably outweigh the right of
the people as a community to foster and protect common values and needs. Under the now-familiar standard for the
Court articulated by The Chief Justice in Miller v. California, whether speech is obscene and therefore unprotected is
judged from the viewpoint of the average person applying
contemporary community standards.

And in Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, he upheld for the
Court the State's authority to regulate the exhibition of
obscene material in places of public accommodation, recognizing that the State's legitimate interest encompassed the
interest of the public in the quality of life in the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great city
centers, and possibly the public safety itself.

517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:53 PGT * frtbx n

xixCHIEF JUSTICE BURGER
In The Chief Justice's jurisprudence, the balance of individ-ual and community rights is sensitive, as exemplified by his

opinions for the Court in cases involving claims of religiousestablishment. In upholding New York's tax exemption for
property used for religious education or charitable purposesin

Walz v. Tax Commission of New York, he acknowledged
that the test is inescapably one of degree, and explainedthat it is an essential part of adjudication to draw distinctions, including fine ones, in the process of interpreting the
Constitution.In the following year, in

Lemon v. Kurtzman, The Chief
Justice again wrote for the Court, this time striking downState programs providing aid to parochial schools that fostered an excessive degree of entanglement of church andState.

Finally, Warren Burger remained true on the bench to hislifelong commitment to the equal treatment of individuals,
irrespective of race or national origin. In one of his first
major opinions as Chief Justice, he delivered the Court'sunanimous opinion in

Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Board of Education. Affirming the propriety of compre-hensive relief, including busing of students to remedy racial

segregation in education, he was equally vigilant in guardingagainst less direct, but still invidious forms of discrimination.

He wrote opinions for the Court adopting a disparate impact standard for Federal statutory claims of racial discrimi-nation in employment, condemning on equal protection

grounds the provision of State aid to racially segregated pri-vate schools and sustaining the denial of Federal tax exemptions to private schools that practice racial discrimination.Nor were racial minorities the only beneficiaries of The
Chief Justice's abiding belief in equal work. In his opinionin

Reed v. Reed, the Court for the first time struck down
on equal protection grounds a State statute that arbitrarily
discriminated against women, and in Hishon v. King and
Spalding, his opinion for the Court held that the Federal
statutory prohibition of sex discrimination in employment
applies to partnership decisions made by a law firm.

It was because of his dedication to, indeed, reverence for
the principles embodied in our Constitution that Warren
Burger retired from the Supreme Court in 1986 to head the
Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution. He
served in that capacity as a tireless emissary of the Constitution to the ordinary men and women, and particularly the
children of this Nation.

In that role, as in all of the varied contexts in which he
toiled and emerged as a leader in the law, as private lawyer,
Assistant Attorney General, appellate judge, and Chief Justice of the United States, his dedication to liberty and equality, his faith in the citizens of this land, and his commitment
to maintaining the integrity of our constitutional structure,
guided his steps and consequently illuminated the path for
us all.

Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolutions presented to you in honor and
celebration of the memory of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger
be accepted by the Court, and that they, together with the
chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time
in the records of this Court.

The Chief Justice said:
Thank you, Attorney General Reno, and thank you, General Days.

The Court thanks both of you for your presentation today
in memory of our late colleague and friend, Chief Justice
Burger.

We ask that you convey to Chairman John Sexton and
the members of the Committee on Resolutions, Chairman
Charles A. Hobbs and the members of the Arrangements
Committee, and Michael Luttig, Chairman of today's meeting of the Bar, our appreciation for these appropriate
resolutions.

Your motion that these resolutions be made a part of thepermanent records of the Court is granted.

For 17 years, a longer tenure than all but three of his pred-ecessors, Warren Burger presided over this Court. During
that period of time, as might be expected, he authorednumerous important opinions for the Court on a variety of
subjects. The Nixon tapes case, INS v. Chadha, Miller v.
California, Milliken v. Bradley, Nebraska Press Association
were but a few. The resolutions mentioned many others.

He was particularly interested in the constitutional doc-trine of separation of powers, and in the speech and religion

clauses of the First Amendment. He was a person of strongconvictions, who was nonetheless able to work harmoniously
with his colleagues.The English scientist and philosopher, Alfred North
Whitehead said in one of his books, all the world over and atall times, there have been practical men absorbed in irreducible and stubborn facts. All the world over, and at all times,
there have been men of philosophic temperament who havebeen absorbed in the weaving of general principles.

No one, of course, is wholly in one of these camps or theother, but I think one would have to say that Warren Burger
was predominantly in the camp of the practical man, as youhave suggested, General Days.

He was concerned as to how the Court's decisions would
be translated into law at the trial level and at the community.
To that end, he was instrumental in the founding of the
National Center for State Courts, as you have mentioned,
General Reno, an organization devoted to providing administrative and technical assistance to State court systems.

He was instrumental in the founding of the Institute for
Court Management. He pioneered the idea of the Inns of
Court in the United States, where law students, faculty,
practicing lawyers, and judges could dine and meet together
in the pursuit of their common interests.

He was firmly of the view that the English system on
which these Inns were patterned did a better job of disciplin517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:54 PGT * frtbx n

ing practicing lawyers than did the more formal proceduresemployed in this country.

Here at the Court, Warren Burger made changes thatmaterially improved our operation. Take, for example, his
reconfiguration of the bench on which my colleagues and Iare now sitting.

We take for granted the shape of the bench, and after 25years it is understandable, but before the advent of Warren
Burger it was an absolutely straight bench, making it difficult for colleagues on either end to question counsel, difficultfor colleagues in the middle to hear questions from either

end, and difficult for counsel to address their remarks tothose towards the end of the bench.

By simply moving the two wings of the bench slightly for-ward, all of these difficulties were corrected or alleviated,
although others may have been brought about.It can also be said, I think, that he made the Court more
centrist by bringing the left and right wings closer together.

Chief Justice Burger also brought the Court from the daysof a hot lead printing press to automation in the printing of

its opinions. The hot lead press which we had when I be-came a member of the Court some 20 years ago was little
different from the printing press the Court had when I wasa law clerk in the early fifties and, indeed, little different
from the kind of hot lead press on which we set type for our
high school newspaper at the beginning of World War II.And during the June crunch, as we came to know it, you

would have to wait 2 or 3 days between the time you sentan opinion, draft opinion to the printer, and the time you
could get it back.This all changed under Chief Justice Burger's regime, and
major steps toward the kind of automation we have todaywere taken.

Warren Burger was a man of tremendous energy. Often,
when a lawyer takes the bench, he becomes less involved
than previously with the various concerns of the legal profession, but this was not true of Warren Burger. As an appellate judge, he helped to found the Appellate Judges Confer517bv$$$$v 01-28-99 08:37:54 PGT * frtbx n

ence at New York University, and he also played animportant part in the drafting of the standards of criminal

justice for the American Bar Association.When he retired as Chief Justice in 1986, he said that one
of the reasons he did so was that he could not do justice toboth the office of Chief Justice and his position as Chairman
of the Committee on the Bicentennial of the Constitution.When asked why he had chosen his chairmanship over the
Chief Justiceship, he replied that he thought the Presidentwould have no trouble finding someone to be Chief Justice--
but he might have trouble finding someone to be Chairmanof the Committee on the Bicentennial, and after his retirement, he was able to concentrate on the Bicentennial Com-mission and bring that tremendous energy to bear to make
Americans better acquainted with their Constitution.He was on occasion pressed by scholars to devote a large
part of the resources of the Committee to academic forumsand treatises on constitutional law, but he declined to do so.
He saw his job as bringing home to millions of Americansthe significance of their Constitution, and he succeeded magnificently in doing so.Warren Burger and I were good friends from the first time
I met him, when he informally swore me in as an AssociateJustice of this Court in December 1971. I continue to miss
him.I remember stopping in to see him only a few weeks before
his death, and he was very proud of a just-published book hehad written about famous Supreme Court cases entitled,

It
Is So Ordered. Here was a man, 88 years old, who had justfinished writing a book.

Warren Burger, the fifteenth Chief Justice of the UnitedStates, left a large mark on this Court. He also left a large
mark on the legal profession as a whole, a profession in whichhe retained an abiding interest throughout his life.

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1995

WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 94-1614. Argued January 10, 1996--Decided March 20, 1996*
The Constitution's Census Clause vests Congress with the responsibility

to conduct an "actual Enumeration" of the American public every 10
years, with the primary purpose of providing a basis for apportioning
congressional representation among the States. That responsibility
has been delegated to the Secretary of Commerce, who determined that
an "actual Enumeration" would best be achieved in the 1990 census by
not using a postenumeration survey (PES) statistical adjustment designed to correct an undercount in the initial enumeration. In this
action brought by several of the respondents and others, the District
Court concluded that the Secretary's decision not to statistically adjust
the census violated neither the Constitution nor federal law. In reversing and remanding, the Court of Appeals looked to a line of precedent
involving judicial review of intrastate districting decisions, see Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, and its progeny, and held, inter alia, that
a heightened standard of review was required here because the Secretary's decision impacted the fundamental right to have one's vote
counted and had a disproportionate impact upon certain identifiable
minority racial groups.

*Together with No. 94-1631, Oklahoma v. City of New York et al., and
No. 94-1985, Department of Commerce et al. v. City of New York et al.,

2 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Syllabus
Held: Because it was reasonable to conclude that an "actual Enumeration"

could best be achieved in the 1990 census without the PES-based statistical adjustment, the Secretary's decision not to use that adjustment
was well within the constitutional bounds of discretion over the conduct
of the census that is provided to the Federal Government. Pp. 13-24.

(a) The Secretary's decision was not subject to heightened scrutiny.
In two recent decisions, Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S.
442, and Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, this Court rejected
the application of Wesberry's "one person-one vote" standard to Congress, concluding that the Constitution vests Congress with wide discretion over apportionment decisions and the conduct of the census, and
that the appropriate standard of review examines a congressional decision to determine whether it is "consistent with the constitutional language and the constitutional goal of equal representation," see Franklin, supra, at 804. Rather than the strict scrutiny standard applied in
Wesberry and adopted by the Court of Appeals, the standard established in Montana and Franklin applies to the Secretary's decision
here. The Constitution's text vests Congress with virtually unlimited
discretion in conducting the "actual Enumeration," see Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3
(Congress may conduct the census "in such Manner as they shall by
Law direct"), and there is no basis for thinking that such discretion is
more limited than that text provides. Through the Census Act, 13
U. S. C. $ 141(a), Congress has delegated its broad authority over the
census to the Secretary. Hence, so long as the Secretary's conduct of
the census is "consistent with the constitutional language and the constitutional goal of equal representation," it is within the Constitution's
limits. Pp. 13-20.

(b) The Secretary's decision conformed to applicable constitutional and
statutory provisions. In light of the Constitution's broad grant of authority to Congress, that decision need bear only a reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the population,
keeping in mind the census' constitutional purpose of apportioning
congressional representation. The Secretary based the decision upon
three determinations, each of which is well within the bounds of his
constitutional discretion. First, he held that in light of the constitutional purpose, the census' distributive accuracy--i. e., getting most
nearly correct the proportions of people in different areas--was more
important than its numerical accuracy. A preference for distributive
accuracy (even at the expense of some numerical accuracy) is not inconsistent with the constitutional need to determine the apportionment of
the Representatives among the States. Second, the Secretary's determination that the unadjusted census data should be considered the most
distributively accurate absent a showing to the contrary was based on

Syllabus
his well-founded understanding of historical census practice and experience, an important consideration in this context. See, e. g., Montana,
supra, at 465. Respondents misplace their reliance on statistical adjustments that were used in the 1970 and 1980 censuses, since those
adjustments were of an entirely different type than the one at issue
and took place on a dramatically smaller scale, and since a PES-based
adjustment would have been the first time in history that the States'
apportionment was based upon counts in other States. Third, respondents' contention that this Court should review de novo the Secretary's
conclusions on this point fundamentally misapprehends the basis for deference to his determination, which arises not from the highly technical
nature of his decision, but from the wide discretion bestowed by the
Constitution upon Congress, and by Congress upon him. The Secretary's conclusion that the PES-based adjustment would not improve distributive accuracy, which was based on his review of extensive research
and the recommendations of some of his advisers, was a reasonable
choice in an area where technical experts disagree. Pp. 20-24.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the
Court.

In conducting the 1990 United States Census, the Secretary of Commerce decided not to use a particular statistical
adjustment that had been designed to correct an undercount
in the initial enumeration. The Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit held that the Secretary's decision was subject
to heightened scrutiny because of its effect on the right of
individual respondents to have their vote counted equally.
We hold that the Secretary's decision was not subject to
heightened scrutiny, and that it conformed to applicable
constitutional and statutory provisions.

Opinion of the Court

I
The Constitution requires an "actual Enumeration" of thepopulation every 10 years and vests Congress with the authority to conduct that census "in such Manner as they shallby Law direct."

1 Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3. Through the Census Act,

13 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq., Congress has delegated to the Secre-tary of the Department of Commerce the responsibility to

take "a decennial census of [the] population . . . in such formand content as he may determine . . . ." $ 141(a). The Secretary is assisted in the performance of that responsibilityby the Bureau of the Census and its head, the Director of
the Census. See $ 2; $ 21 ("[The] Director shall performsuch duties as may be imposed upon him by law, regulations,
or orders of the Secretary").The Constitution provides that the results of the census
shall be used to apportion the Members of the House of Rep-resentatives among the States. See Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3 ("Representatives . . . shall be apportioned among the several States. . . according to their respective Numbers . . ."); Amdt. 14,

$ 2 ("Representatives shall be apportioned among the severalStates according to their respective numbers, counting the
whole number of persons in each State . . ."). Because theConstitution provides that the number of Representatives
apportioned to each State determines in part the allocationto each State of votes for the election of the President, the
decennial census also affects the allocation of members of theelectoral college. See Art. II, $ 1, cl. 2 ("Each State shall
appoint . . . a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Num-ber of Senators and Representatives to which the State may
be entitled in the Congress . . ."). Today, census data alsohave important consequences not delineated in the Constitution: The Federal Government considers census data in

made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the
United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such
Manner as they shall by Law direct." Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3.

6 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
dispensing funds through federal programs to the States, andthe States use the results in drawing intrastate political

districts.There have been 20 decennial censuses in the history of
the United States. Although each was designed with thegoal of accomplishing an "actual Enumeration" of the population, no census is recognized as having been wholly success-ful in achieving that goal.

2 Cf. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S.

725, 732 (1983) (recognizing that "census data are not per-fect," and that "population counts for particular localities are

outdated long before they are completed"); Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735, 745 (1973) (census data "are inherentlyless than absolutely accurate"). Despite consistent efforts

to improve the quality of the count, errors persist. Personswho should have been counted are not counted at all or are
counted at the wrong location; persons who should not have
been counted (whether because they died before or wereborn after the decennial census date, because they were not

a resident of the country, or because they did not exist) arecounted; and persons who should have been counted only
once are counted twice. It is thought that these errors haveresulted in a net "undercount" of the actual American population in every decennial census. In 1970, for instance, the
Census Bureau concluded that the census results were 2.7%lower than the actual population.

3 Brief for Respondents 12.

2 Indeed, even the first census did not escape criticism. Thomas Jefferson, who oversaw the conduct of that census in 1790 as Secretary of State,
was confident that it had significantly undercounted the young Nation's
population. See C. Wright, History and Growth of the United States
Census 16-17 (1900).

3 One might wonder how the Census Bureau is able to determine

whether there is an undercount and its size. Specifically: Against what
standard are the census results measured? After all, if the actual population of the United States is known, then the conduct of the census would
seem wholly redundant.

For the most part, we are told, the size of the error in a particular
census is determined by comparing the census results not with some defi517us1$35H 02-23-99 16:33:32 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
The undercount is not thought to be spread consistentlyacross the population: Some segments of the population are

"undercounted" to a greater degree than are others, result-ing in a phenomenon termed the "differential undercount."
Since at least 1940, the Census Bureau has thought that theundercount affects some racial and ethnic minority groups to
a greater extent than it does whites. In 1940, for example,when the undercount for the entire population was 5.4%, the
undercount for blacks was estimated at 8.4% (and the under-count for whites at 5.0%).

Ibid. The problem of the differ-ential undercount has persisted even as the census has come

to provide a more numerically accurate count of the popula-tion. In the 1980 census, for example, the overall undercount was estimated at 1.2%, and the undercount of blackswas estimated at 4.9%.

Ibid.The Census Bureau has recognized the undercount and the

differential undercount as significant problems, and in thepast has devoted substantial effort toward achieving their
reduction. Most recently, in its preparations for the 1990census, the Bureau initiated an extensive inquiry into various means of overcoming the impact of the undercount andthe differential undercount. As part of this effort, the Bureau created two task forces: the Undercount Steering Com-mittee, responsible for planning undercount research and policy development; and the Undercount Research Staff (URS),which conducted research into various methods of improving
the accuracy of the census. In addition, the Bureau con-sulted with state and local governments and various outside
experts and organizations.Largely as a result of these efforts, the Bureau adopted
a wide variety of measures designed to reduce the rate of
nite and established measure of the population, but rather with estimates
of the population developed from demographic data. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. in No. 94-1614, pp. 158a-168a, 366a-369a (hereinafter Pet. App.). A
similar procedure traditionally has been used to determine the size and
makeup of the differential undercount, see infra, at 9-10.

error in the 1990 enumeration, including an extensive ad-vertising campaign, a more easily completed census questionnaire, and increased use of automation, which amongother things facilitated the development of accurate maps
and geographic files for the 1990 census. Pet. App. 321a-322a.

4 The Bureau also implemented a number of improvements specifically targeted at eliminating the differentialundercount; these included advertising campaigns developed

by and directed at traditionally undercounted populationsand expanded questionnaire assistance operations for nonEnglish speaking residents. Ibid.In preparing for the 1990 census, the Bureau and the task
forces also looked into the possibility of using large-scalestatistical adjustment to compensate for the undercount and
differential undercount. Although the Bureau had pre-viously considered that possibility (most recently in 1980),
it always had decided instead to rely upon more traditionalmethodology and the results of the enumeration. See
Cuomo v. Baldrige, 674 F. Supp. 1089 (SDNY 1987) (notingthat Bureau rejected large-scale statistical adjustment of the
1980 census). In 1985, preliminary investigations by theURS suggested that the most promising method of statistical
adjustment was the "capture-recapture" or "dual systemestimation" (DSE) approach.

The particular variations of the DSE considered by theBureau are not important for purposes of this opinion, but an
example may serve to make the DSE more understandable.Imagine that one wanted to use DSE in order to determine
the number of pumpkins in a large pumpkin patch. First,one would choose a particular section of the patch as the
representative subset to which the "recapture" phase willbe applied. Let us assume here that it is a section exactly
one-tenth the size of the entire patch that is selected. Then,

Opinion of the Court
at the next step--the "capture" stage--one would conduct a
fairly quick count of the entire patch, making sure to record
both the number of pumpkins counted in the entire patch
and the number of pumpkins counted in the selected section.
Let us imagine that this stage results in a count of 10,000
pumpkins for the entire patch and 1,000 pumpkins for the
selected section. Next, at the "recapture" stage, one would
perform an exacting count of the number of pumpkins in the
selected section. Let us assume that we now count 1,100
pumpkins in that section. By comparing the results of the
"capture" phase and the results of the "recapture" phase for
the selected section, it is possible to estimate that approximately 100 pumpkins actually in the patch were missed for
every 1,000 counted at the "capture" phase. Extrapolating
this data to the count for the entire patch, one would conclude that the actual number of pumpkins in the patch is
11,000.

In the context of the census, the initial enumeration of the
entire population (the "capture") would be followed by the
postenumeration survey (PES) (the "recapture") of certain
representative geographical areas. The Bureau would then
compare the results of the PES to the results of the initial
enumeration for those areas targeted by the PES, in order
to determine a rate of error in those areas for the initial
enumeration (i. e., the rate at which the initial enumeration
undercounted people in those areas). That rate of error
would be extrapolated to the entire population, and thus
would be used to statistically adjust the results of the initial enumeration.

The URS thought that the PES also held some promise
for correcting the differential undercount. The PES would
be conducted through the use of a system called poststratification. Thus, each person counted through the PES
would be placed into one, and only one, of over 1,000 poststrata defined by five categories: geography; age; sex; status

10 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
of housing unit (rent versus own); and race (including Hispanic versus non-Hispanic origin).5 By comparing the poststratified PES data to the results of the initial enumeration,
the Bureau would be able to estimate not only an overall
undercount rate, but also an undercount rate for each poststrata. Hence, the statistical adjustment of the census could
reflect differences in the undercount rate for each poststrata.

Through the mid-1980's, the Bureau conducted a series of
field tests and statistical studies designed to measure the
utility of the PES as a tool for adjusting the census. The
Director of the Bureau decided to adopt a PES-based adjustment, and in June 1987, he informed his superiors in the Department of Commerce of that decision. The Secretary of
Commerce disagreed with the Director's decision to adjust,
however, and in October 1987, the Department of Commerce
announced that the 1990 census would not be statistically
adjusted.

In November 1988, several plaintiffs (including a number
of the respondents in this action) brought suit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,
arguing that the Secretary's decision against statistical adjustment of the 1990 census was unconstitutional and contrary to federal law. The parties entered into an interim
stipulation providing, inter alia, that the Secretary would
reconsider the possibility of a statistical adjustment.

In July 1991, the Secretary issued his decision not to use
the PES to adjust the 1990 census. Pet. App. 135a-415a.
The Secretary began by noting that large-scale statistical

the ages of 20 and 29 who owned a home in either Detroit or Chicago;
nonblack non-Hispanic females, aged 45-64, living in owned or rented
housing in a nonmetropolitan area with a population of 10,000 or more in
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, or Wyoming; and male Asians or Pacific Islanders, aged 65 or above, renting a
home in either the Los Angeles-Long Beach area or another central city in
a metropolitan area in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, or Washington.

Opinion of the Court
adjustment of the census through the PES would "abandon atwo hundred year tradition of how we actually count people."

Id., at 138a. Before taking a "step of that magnitude," heheld, it was necessary to be "certain that it would make the
census better and the distribution of the population more
accurate." Ibid. Emphasizing that the primary purpose ofthe census was to apportion political representation among

the States, the Secretary concluded that "the primary crite-rion for accuracy should be distributive accuracy--that is,
getting most nearly correct the proportions of people in dif-ferent areas."

Id., at 146a-147a.
After reviewing the recommendations of his advisers andthe voluminous statistical research that had been compiled,

the Secretary concluded that although numerical accuracy
(at the national level) might be improved through statisticaladjustment, he could not be confident that the distributive

accuracy of the census--particularly at the state and local
level--would be improved by a PES-based adjustment.6
Id., at 140a-141a, 200a-201a. In particular, the Secretary
noted, the adjusted figures became increasingly unreliable as
one focused upon smaller and smaller political subdivisions.
Id., at 142a.

The Secretary stated that his decision not to adjust was
buttressed by a concern that adjustment of the 1990 census
might present significant problems in the future. Id., at
143a. Because small changes in adjustment methodology
would have a large impact upon apportionment--an impact
that could be determined before a particular methodology
was chosen--the Secretary found that statistical adjustment

6 The distinction between distributive and numerical accuracy becomes
clear with an example. Imagine that the Bureau somehow were able to
determine definitely that the census had failed to count exactly 10 million
people nationwide. If those 10 million "persons" were added to the Nation's total population, and all 10 million were allocated to one particular
State, then the numerical accuracy of the census would be improved, but
the distributive accuracy would almost certainly be significantly impaired.

Opinion of the Court
of the 1990 census might open the door to political tampering
in the future. The Secretary also noted that statistical adjustment might diminish the incentive for state and local political leaders to assist in the conduct of the initial enumeration. See id., at 143a-144a. In conclusion, the Secretary
stated that the Bureau would continue its research into the
possibility of statistical adjustment of future censuses, and
would maintain its efforts to improve the accuracy and inclusiveness of the initial enumeration. Id., at 145a.

The plaintiffs returned to court. The District Court concluded that the Secretary's decision violated neither the Constitution nor federal law. See New York v. United States
Dept. of Commerce, 822 F. Supp. 906 (EDNY 1993).

Respondents appealed, arguing that the District Court
had adopted the wrong standard of review for their constitutional claim,7 and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed by a divided vote. 34 F. 3d 1114 (1994); Pet. App.
1a-40a. The majority looked to a line of precedent involving judicial review of intrastate districting decisions, see,
e. g., Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725 (1983); Wesberry v.
Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), and found that a heightened
standard of review was required here both because the Secretary's decision impacted a fundamental right, viz., the
right to have one's vote counted, and because the decision
had a disproportionate impact upon certain identifiable minority racial groups. 34 F. 3d, at 1128. The court then held
that the plaintiffs had shown that the Secretary had failed
to make a good-faith effort to achieve equal districts as
nearly as possible, id., at 1130, and therefore that the defendants must bear the burden of proving that population deviations were necessary to achieve some legitimate state goal,
id., at 1131. The court remanded for an inquiry into
whether the Secretary could show that the decision not to

The dissenting judge stated that he would have affirmedbased upon the decision of the District Court. See ibid.
He also noted that the majority's decision created a conflictwith two other decisions of the Courts of Appeals. See

De-troit v. Franklin, 4 F. 3d 1367 (CA6 1993), and Tucker v.

United States Dept. of Commerce, 958 F. 2d 1411 (CA7 1992).Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and the United States each filed a
petition for certiorari. We granted those petitions, andconsolidated them for argument. 515 U. S. 1190 (1995).
We now reverse. II

In recent years, we have twice considered constitutionalchallenges to the conduct of the census. In Department of
Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992), the State ofMontana, several state officials, and Montana's Members of
Congress brought suit against the Federal Government,challenging as unconstitutional the method used to determine the number of Representatives to which each State isentitled. A majority of a three-judge District Court looked
to the principle of equal representation for equal numbers ofpeople that was applied to intrastate districting in

Wesberryv.
Sanders, supra, and held it applicable to congressional ap-portionment of seats among the States. Noting a significant

variance between the population of Montana's single districtand the population of the "ideal district," the court found
that Congress' chosen method of apportionment violated theprinciple of Wesberry, and therefore voided the federal statute providing the method of apportionment.In a unanimous decision, this Court reversed. We began
by revisiting Wesberry, a case in which the Court held uncon-stitutional wide disparities in the population of congressional
districts drawn by the State of Georgia. Montana, supra,at 459-460. We recognized that the principle of

Wesberry--" `equal representation for equal numbers of people' "--had

517us1$35H 02-23-99 16:33:33 PAGES OPINPGT
14 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
evolved though a line of cases into a strictly enforced re-quirement that a State " `make a good-faith effort to achieve

precise mathematical equality' " among the populations ofcongressional districts. See

Montana, supra, at 460, quoting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526, 530-531 (1969)
(disparities between congressional districts in Missouri heldunconstitutional); see also

Karcher v. Daggett, supra (1% disparity between population of New Jersey districts held un-constitutional). Returning to Montana's challenge to Congress' apportionment decision, we noted that the Wesberryline of cases all involved intrastate disparities in the population of voting districts that had resulted from a State's
redistricting decisions, whereas Montana had challenged interstate disparities resulting from the actions of Congress.
Montana, supra, at 460.

We found this difference to be significant beyond the simple fact that Congress was due more deference than the
States in this area. Wesberry required a State to make "a
good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality" in
the size of voting districts. Kirkpatrick, supra, at 530-531.
While this standard could be applied easily to intrastate districting because there was no "theoretical incompatibility entailed in minimizing both the absolute and the relative differences" in the sizes of particular voting districts, we observed
that it was not so easily applied to interstate districting decisions where there was a direct tradeoff between absolute and
relative differences in size. Montana, supra, at 461-462.
Finding that Montana demanded that we choose between
several measures of inequality in order to hold the Wesberry
standard applicable to congressional apportionment decisions, we concluded that "[n]either mathematical analysis nor
constitutional interpretation provide[d] a conclusive answer"
upon which to base that choice. Montana, supra, at 463.

We further found that the Constitution itself, by guaranteeing a minimum of one representative for each State, made
it virtually impossible in interstate apportionment to achieve

15Cite as: 517 U. S. 1 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
the standard imposed by Wesberry. Montana, supra, at463. In conclusion, we recognized the historical pedigree of

the challenged method of apportionment, and reemphasizedthat Congress' "good-faith choice of a method of apportionment of Representatives among the several States `according
to their respective Numbers' commands far more deferencethan a state districting decision that is capable of being

reviewed under a relatively rigid mathematical standard."
Montana, supra, at 464.

In Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788 (1992), we re-iterated our conclusion that the Constitution vests Congress

with wide discretion over apportionment decisions and the
conduct of the census. In Franklin, the State of Massachusetts and two of its registered voters sued the Federal Government, arguing that the method used by the Secretary to
count federal employees serving overseas was (among other
things) unconstitutional. Restating the standard of review
established by Montana, we examined the Secretary's decision in order to determine whether it was "consistent with
the constitutional language and the constitutional goal of
equal representation." See Franklin, supra, at 804; Montana, supra, at 459. After a review of the historical practice
in the area, we found that the plaintiffs had not met their
burden of proving that a decision contrary to that made by
the Secretary would "make representation . . . more equal."
Franklin, 505 U. S., at 806. Concluding that the Secretary's
decision reflected a "judgment, consonant with, though not
dictated by, the text and history of the Constitution . . . ,"
we held the Secretary's decision to be well within the constitutional limits on his discretion. Ibid.

In its decision in this action, the Court of Appeals found
that a standard more strict than that established in Montana
and Franklin should apply to the Secretary's decision not to
statistically adjust the census. The court looked to equal
protection principles distilled from the same line of state redistricting cases relied upon by the plaintiffs in Montana,

517us1$35H 02-23-99 16:33:33 PAGES OPINPGT
16 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
and found that both the nature of the right asserted by re-spondents--the right to have one's vote counted equally--

and the nature of the affected classes--"certain identifiableminority groups"--required that the Secretary's decision be
given heightened scrutiny. 34 F. 3d, at 1128. The court
drew from the District Court's decision "implicit" findings:that the census did not achieve equality of voting power as

nearly as practicable; "that for most purposes and for mostof the population [the PES-based] adjustment would result
in a more accurate count than the original census; and thatthe adjustment would lessen the disproportionate undercounting of minorities." Id., at 1129.

The court recognized two significant differences between
the intrastate districting cases and the instant action: first,
that this case involves the federal rather than a state government; and second, that constitutional requirements make it
impossible to achieve precise equality in voting power nationwide. Ibid. But it found these differences nondeterminative, deciding that no deference was owed to the Executive
Branch on a question of law, and that the "impossibility of
achieving precise mathematical equality is no excuse for [the
Federal Government] not making [the] mandated good-faith
effort." Ibid. The court found that the respondents here
had established a prima facie violation of the Wesberry
standard both by showing that the PES-based adjustment
would increase numerical accuracy, and by virtue of the fact
that "the differential undercount in the 1990 enumeration
was plainly foreseeable and foreseen." 34 F. 3d, at 1130-
1131. The court held that the Secretary's decision would
have to be vacated as unconstitutional unless on remand he
could show that the decision not to adjust "(a) furthers a
governmental objective that is legitimate, and (b) is essential
for the achievement of that objective." Id., at 1131.

We think that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the
"one person-one vote" standard of Wesberry and its progeny
applicable to the action at hand. For several reasons, the

517us1$35H 02-23-99 16:33:33 PAGES OPINPGT

17Cite as: 517 U. S. 1 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
"good-faith effort to achieve population equality" required ofa State conducting intrastate redistricting does not translate

into a requirement that the Federal Government conduct acensus that is as accurate as possible. First, we think that
the Court of Appeals understated the significance of the two
differences that it recognized between state redistrictingcases and the instant action. The court failed to recognize

that the Secretary's decision was made pursuant to Con-gress' direct delegation of its broad authority over the census. See Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3 (Congress may conduct the census"in such Manner as they shall by Law direct"). The court
also undervalued the significance of the fact that the Constitution makes it impossible to achieve population equality
among interstate districts. As we have noted before, the
Constitution provides that "[t]he number of Representatives
shall not exceed one for every 30,000 persons; each State
shall have at least one Representative; and district boundaries may not cross state lines." Montana, 503 U. S., at
447-448.

While a court can easily determine whether a State has
made the requisite "good-faith effort" toward population
equality through the application of a simple mathematical
formula, we see no way in which a court can apply the Wesberry standard to the Federal Government's decisions regarding the conduct of the census. The Court of Appeals
found that Wesberry required the Secretary to conduct a
census that would "achieve voting-power equality," which it
understood to mean a census that was as accurate as possible.
34 F. 3d, at 1129. But in so doing, the court implicitly found
that the Constitution prohibited the Secretary from preferring distributive accuracy to numerical accuracy, and that
numerical accuracy--which the court found to be improved
by a PES-based adjustment--was constitutionally preferable
to distributive accuracy. See id., at 1131 ("[T]he Secretary
did not make the required effort to achieve numerical accuracy as nearly as practicable, . . . the burden thus shifted to

18 WISCONSIN v. CITY OF NEW YORK

Opinion of the Court
the Secretary to justify his decision not to adjust . . ."). Asin Montana, where we could see no constitutional basis upon

which to choose between absolute equality and relativeequality, so here can we see no ground for preferring numerical accuracy to distributive accuracy, or for preferring grossaccuracy to some particular measure of accuracy. The Constitution itself provides no real instruction on this point, andextrapolation from our intrastate districting cases is equally
unhelpful. Quite simply, "[t]he polestar of equal represen-tation does not provide sufficient guidance to allow us to
discern a single constitutionally permissible course." Montana, supra, at 463.In

Montana, we held that Congress' "apparently good-faith choice of a method of apportionment of Representatives

among the several States `according to their respective Num-bers' " was not subject to strict scrutiny under Wesberry.
Montana, supra, at 464. With that conclusion in mind, itis difficult to see why or how Wesberry would apply to the
Federal Government's conduct of the census--a context evenfurther removed from intrastate districting than is congressional apportionment. Congress' conduct of the census,even more than its decision concerning apportionment, "commands far more deference than a state districting decisionthat is capable of being reviewed under a relatively rigid
mathematical standard." 8 Montana, supra, at 464.Rather than the standard adopted by the Court of Appeals, we think that it is the standard established by this

8 Nor do we think that strict scrutiny applies here for some other reason.
Strict scrutiny of a classification affecting a protected class is properly
invoked only where a plaintiff can show intentional discrimination by the
Government. Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-245 (1976). Respondents here have not argued that the Secretary's decision not to adjust
was based upon an intent to discriminate on the basis of race. Indeed, in
light of the Government's extraordinary efforts to include traditionally
undercounted minorities in the 1990 census, see Pet. App. 78a, 321a-322a,
we think that respondents here would have had a tough row to hoe had
they set out to prove intentional discrimination by the Secretary.

11 We do not here decide the precise bounds of the authority delegated

to the Secretary through the Census Act. First, because no party here
has suggested that Congress has, in its delegation of authority over the
conduct of the census to the Secretary, constrained the Secretary's authority to decide not to adjust the census, we assume here that the Secretary's
discretion not to adjust the census is commensurate with that of Congress.

did not enact any . . . legislation . . . to compel . . . statistical adjustment"
of the 1990 census). Second, although Oklahoma argues that Congress
has constrained the Secretary's discretion to statistically adjust the decennial census, see 13 U. S. C. $ 195, we need not decide that question in order
to resolve this action.

Opinion of the Court
constitutional language and the constitutional goal of equalrepresentation,"

Franklin, 505 U. S., at 804, it is within the
limits of the Constitution. In light of the Constitution'sbroad grant of authority to Congress, the Secretary's decision not to adjust need bear only a reasonable relationship
to the accomplishment of an actual enumeration of the popu-lation, keeping in mind the constitutional purpose of the

census.In 1990, the Census Bureau made an extraordinary effort
to conduct an accurate enumeration, and was successful incounting 98.4% of the population. See 58 Fed. Reg. 70
(1993); Brief for Federal Parties 28. The Secretary then had
to consider whether to adjust the census using statistical
data derived from the PES. He based his decision not to
adjust the census upon three determinations. First, he held
that in light of the constitutional purpose of the census, its
distributive accuracy was more important than its numerical accuracy. Second, he determined that the unadjusted
census data would be considered the most distributively
accurate absent a showing to the contrary. And finally,
after reviewing the results of the PES in light of extensive
research and the recommendations of his advisers, the
Secretary found that the PES-based adjustment would not
improve distributive accuracy. Each of these three determinations is well within the bounds of the Secretary's constitutional discretion.

As we have already seen, supra, at 18, the Secretary's decision to focus on distributive accuracy is not inconsistent
with the Constitution. Indeed, a preference for distributive
accuracy (even at the expense of some numerical accuracy)
would seem to follow from the constitutional purpose of the
census, viz., to determine the apportionment of the Representatives among the States. Respondents do not dispute
this point. See Brief for Respondents 54 ("Distributive accuracy is an appropriate criterion for judging census accuracy because it calls attention to a concern with the uses

Opinion of the Court
to which census data are put"). Rather, they challenge theSecretary's first determination by arguing that he improperly "regarded evidence of superior numeric accuracy as `notrelevant' to the determination of distributive accuracy."

Id.,
at 39 (quoting Pet. App. 201a); see also Brief for Respondents
51-54. In support of this argument, respondents note thatan enumeration that results in increased numerical accuracy

will also result in increased distributive accuracy.We think that respondents rest too much upon the statement by the Secretary to which they refer. When quotedin full, the statement reads: "While the preponderance of the
evidence leads me to believe that the total population at the
national level falls between the census counts and the adjusted figures, that conclusion is not relevant to the determination of distributive accuracy." Pet. App. 201a. In his
decision, the Secretary found numerical accuracy (in addition to distributive accuracy) to be relevant to his decision
whether to adjust. See id., at 157a. Even if the Secretary
had chosen to subordinate numerical accuracy, we are not
sure why the fact that distributive and numerical accuracy
correlate closely in an improved enumeration would require
the Secretary to conclude that they correlate also for a PESbased statistical adjustment.

Turning to the Secretary's second determination, we previously have noted, and respondents do not dispute, the importance of historical practice in this area. See Franklin,
supra, at 803-806 (noting importance of historical experience
in conducting the census); cf. Montana, 503 U. S., at 465 ("To
the extent that the potentially divisive and complex issues
associated with apportionment can be narrowed by the adoption of both procedural and substantive rules that are consistently applied year after year, the public is well served
. . ."). Nevertheless, respondents challenge the Secretary's
second determination by arguing that his understanding of
historical practice is flawed. According to respondents, the
Secretary assumed that the census traditionally was con517us1$35H 02-23-99 16:33:33 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ducted via a simple "headcount," thereby ignoring the factthat statistical adjustment had been used in both the 1970

and 1980 censuses. See Brief for Respondents 4-5.We need not tarry long with this argument. The Secretary reasonably recognized that a PES-based statistical adjustment would be a significant change from the traditionalmethod of conducting the census. The statistical adjustments in 1970 and 1980 to which respondents refer were ofan entirely different type than the adjustment considered
here, and they took place on a dramatically smaller scale.See

Cuomo v. Baldrige, 674 F. Supp., at 1107 (rejecting argument that Secretary had to conduct PES-like statistical
adjustment of 1980 census and finding that "none of [the]
adjustments in 1970 were even remotely similar to the types
of wholesale adjustments presently suggested . . ."). Moreover, the PES-based adjustment would have been the first
time in history that the States' apportionment would have
been based upon counts in other States. See Pet. App.
251a-252a. Here, the Secretary's understanding of the traditional method of conducting the census was well founded,
as was his establishment of a rebuttable presumption that
the traditional method was the most accurate.

The Secretary ultimately determined that the available
evidence "tends to support the superior distributive accuracy of the actual enumeration," id., at 185a, and it is this
determination at which respondents direct the brunt of their
attack. Respondents contend that the Secretary's review of
the evidence is due no deference from this Court. They
argue that the Secretary's decision is not the sort of "highly
technical" administrative decision that normally commands
judicial deference, and that regardless of its technical complexity, the Secretary's review of the evidence presents a
constitutional issue that deserves no deference. Respondents contend that the Secretary's review of the evidence is
of dubious validity because the Secretary is admittedly "not
a statistician," id., at 139a, and because his conclusion is at

Opinion of the Court
odds with that of the Director of the Census. According torespondents, we should carefully comb the Secretary's decision in order to review his conclusions de novo.Respondents' argument fundamentally misapprehends the
basis for our deference to the Secretary's determination that
the adjusted census results do not provide a more distribu-tively accurate count of the population. Our deference

arises not from the highly technical nature of his decision,but rather from the wide discretion bestowed by the Constitution upon Congress, and by Congress upon the Secretary.Regardless of the Secretary's statistical expertise, it is he to
whom Congress has delegated its constitutional authority
over the census. For that same reason, the mere fact that
the Secretary's decision overruled the views of some of his
subordinates is by itself of no moment in any judicial review
of his decision.

Turning finally to review the Secretary's conclusion that
the PES-based adjustment would not improve distributive
accuracy, we need note only that the Secretary's conclusion
is supported by the reasoning of some of his advisers, and
was therefore a reasonable choice in an area where technical
experts disagree. Cf. Tucker v. United States Dept. of Commerce, 958 F. 2d, at 1418 (Plaintiffs seeking PES-based statistical adjustment "are asking [courts] to take sides in a
dispute among statisticians, demographers, and census officials concerning the desirability of making a statistical adjustment to the census headcount"). The Under Secretary
of Commerce for Economic Affairs and the Administrator
of the Economics and Statistics Administration both voted
against adjustment. Pet. App. 59a, 140a. Moreover, even
those who recommended in favor of adjustment recognized
that their conclusion was not compelled by the evidence: The
Director of the Census Bureau, upon whose recommendation
respondents heavily rely, stated in her report to the Secretary that "[a]djustment is an issue about which reasonable
men and women and the best statisticians and demographers

Opinion of the Court
can disagree." App. 73. And one of the principal statisti-cians at the Bureau, Dr. Robert E. Fay, " `told the Secretary

that . . . reasonable statisticians could differ' " on the ques-tion of adjustment. Pet. App. 91a. Therefore, and because
we find the Secretary's two prior determinations as well tobe entirely reasonable, we conclude that his decision not to
adjust the 1990 census was "consonant with . . . the text andhistory of the Constitution."

Franklin, 505 U. S., at 806.

III
The Constitution confers upon Congress the responsibilityto conduct an "actual Enumeration" of the American public

every 10 years, with the primary purpose of providing abasis for apportioning political representation among the
States. Here, the Secretary of Commerce, to whom Con-gress has delegated its constitutional authority over the census, determined that in light of the constitutional purpose ofthe census, an "actual Enumeration" would best be achieved
without the PES-based statistical adjustment of the resultsof the initial enumeration. We find that conclusion entirely
reasonable. Therefore we hold that the Secretary's decisionwas well within the constitutional bounds of discretion over
the conduct of the census provided to the Federal Govern-ment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

25OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Syllabus

BARNETT BANK OF MARION COUNTY, N. A. v.NELSON, FLORIDA INSURANCE

COMMISSIONER, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 94-1837. Argued January 16, 1996--Decided March 26, 1996
A 1916 federal law (Federal Statute) permits national banks to sell insurance in small towns, but a Florida law (State Statute) prohibits such
banks from selling most types of insurance. When petitioner Barnett
Bank, a national bank doing business in a small Florida town, bought a
state licensed insurance agency, respondent State Insurance Commissioner ordered the agency to stop selling the prohibited forms of insurance. In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, the District
Court held that the State Statute was not pre-empted, but only because
of the McCarran-Ferguson Act's special insurance-related anti-preemption rule. That rule provides that a federal law will not pre-empt
a state law enacted "for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance"--unless the federal statute "specifically relates to the business
of insurance." 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b) (emphasis added). The Court of
Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Federal Statute pre-empts the State Statute. Pp. 30-43.

(a) Under ordinary pre-emption principles, the State Statute would
be pre-empted, for it is clear that Congress, in enacting the Federal
Statute, intended to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to
override contrary state law. The Federal and State Statutes are in
"irreconcilable conflict," Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654,
659, since the Federal Statute authorizes national banks to engage in
activities that the State Statute expressly forbids. Thus, the State's
prohibition would seem to "stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment" of one of the Federal Statute's purposes, Hines v. Davidowitz,
312 U. S. 52, 67, unless, as the State contends, Congress intended to limit
federal permission to sell insurance to those circumstances permitted by
state law. However, by providing, without relevant qualification, that
national banks "may . . . act as the agent" for insurance sales, 12 U. S. C.

$ 92, the Federal Statute's language suggests a broad, not a limited,
permission. That this authority is granted in "addition to the powers
now vested . . . in national [banks]," ibid. (emphasis added), is also significant. Legislative grants of both enumerated and incidental "powers" to national banks historically have been interpreted as grants of

26 BARNETT BANK OF MARION CTY., N. A. v. NELSON

Syllabus
authority not normally limited by, but rather ordinarily pre-empting,
contrary state law. See, e. g., First Nat. Bank of San Jose v. California, 262 U. S. 366, 368-369. Where, as here, Congress has not expressly conditioned the grant of power upon a grant of state permission,
this Court has ordinarily found that no such condition applies. See
Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square v. New York, 347 U. S. 373.
The State's argument that special circumstances surrounding the Federal Statute's enactment demonstrate Congress' intent to grant only a
limited permission is unpersuasive. Pp. 30-37.

(b) The McCarran-Ferguson Act's anti-pre-emption rule does not govern this case, because the Federal Statute "specifically relates to the
business of insurance." This conclusion rests upon the Act's language
and purposes, taken together. The word "relates" is highly general;
and in ordinary English, the Federal Statute--which focuses directly
upon industry-specific selling practices and affects the relation of insured to insurer and the spreading of risk--"specifically" relates to the
insurance business. The Act's mutually reinforcing purposes--that
state regulation and taxation of the insurance business are in the public
interest, and that Congress' "silence . . . shall not be construed to impose
any barrier to [such] regulation or taxation," 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 (emphasis
added)--also support this view. This phrase, especially the word
"silence," indicates that the Act seeks to protect state regulation primarily against inadvertent federal intrusion, not to insulate state insurance regulation from the reach of all federal law. The circumstances
surrounding the Act's enactment also suggest that the Act was passed
to ensure that generally phrased congressional statutes, which do
not mention insurance, are not applied to the issuance of insurance policies, thereby interfering with state regulation in unanticipated ways.
The parties' remaining arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.

Opinion of the Court
state statute enacted "for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance"--unless the federal statute "specifically
relates to the business of insurance." McCarran-Ferguson
Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b) (emphasis added). We decide that
the McCarran-Ferguson Act's special anti-pre-emption rule
does not govern this case, because the federal statute in
question "specifically relates to the business of insurance."
We conclude that, under ordinary pre-emption principles, the
federal statute pre-empts the state statute, thereby prohibiting application of the state statute to prevent a national bank
from selling insurance in a small town.

I
In 1916 Congress enacted a federal statute that says that
certain national banks "may" sell insurance in small towns.
It provides in relevant part:

"In addition to the powers now vested by law in
national [banks] organized under the laws of the United
States any such [bank] located and doing business in

any place [with a population] . . . [of not more than] five
thousand . . . may, under such rules and regulations as
may be prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency,
act as the agent for any fire, life, or other insurance
company authorized by the authorities of the State . . .
to do business [there], . . . by soliciting and selling insurance . . . Provided, however, That no such bank shall . . .
guarantee the payment of any premium . . . And provided further, That the bank shall not guarantee the
truth of any statement made by an assured [when
applying] . . . for insurance." Act of Sept. 7, 1916 (Federal Statute), 39 Stat. 753, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 92
(emphases changed).

In 1974 Florida enacted a statute that prohibits certain
banks from selling most kinds of insurance. It says:

29Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
"No [Florida licensed] insurance agent . . . who isassociated with, . . . owned or controlled by . . . a

financial institution shall engage in insurance agencyactivities . . . ." Fla. Stat. $ 626.988(2) (Supp. 1996)
(State Statute).
The term "financial institution" includes

"any bank . . . [except for a] bank which is not a subsid-iary or affiliate of a bank holding company and is located

in a city having a population of less than 5,000 . . . ."$ 626.988(1)(a).

Thus, the State Statute says, in essence, that banks cannotsell insurance in Florida--except that an unaffiliated small
town bank (i. e., a bank that is not affiliated with a bankholding company) may sell insurance in a small town.

Ibid.In October 1993 petitioner Barnett Bank, an "affiliate[d]"

national bank which does business through a branch in asmall Florida town, bought a Florida licensed insurance
agency. The Florida State Insurance Commissioner, point-ing to the State Statute (and noting that the unaffiliated
small town bank exception did not apply), ordered Barnett'sinsurance agency to stop selling the prohibited forms of
insurance. Barnett, claiming that the Federal Statutepre-empted the State Statute, then filed this action for
declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court.The District Court held that the Federal Statute did
not pre-empt the State Statute, but only because of the spe-cial insurance-related federal anti-pre-emption rule. The
McCarran-Ferguson Act, which creates that rule, says:

"No act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for

the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, orwhich imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless
such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance. . . ." McCarran-Ferguson Act, $ 2(b), 59 Stat. 34, 15

Opinion of the Court
The District Court decided both (1) that the Federal Stat-ute did not fall within the McCarran-Ferguson Act's exception because it did not "specifically relat[e] to the business ofinsurance"; and (2) that the State Statute was a "law enacted
. . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."
Barnett Bank of Marion County, N. A. v. Gallagher, 839F. Supp. 835, 840-841, 843 (MD Fla. 1993) (internal quotation

marks omitted). Consequently, the McCarran-FergusonAct, in the District Court's view, instructs courts not to
"constru[e]" the Federal Statute "to invalidate" the StateStatute. 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b). The Eleventh Circuit Court
of Appeals, for similar reasons, agreed that the Federal Stat-ute did not pre-empt the State Statute.

Barnett Bank ofMarion County, N. A. v. Gallagher, 43 F. 3d 631, 634-637

(1995).We granted certiorari due to uncertainty among lower
courts about the pre-emptive effect of this Federal Statute.See Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Stephens, 44 F. 3d 388 (CA6
1994) (pre-emption of Kentucky statute that prevents na-tional banks from selling insurance in small towns);

FirstAdvantage Ins., Inc. v. Green, 652 So. 2d 562 (La. Ct. App.),

cert. and review denied, 654 So. 2d 331 (1995) (no pre-emption). We now reverse the Eleventh Circuit.

II
We shall put the McCarran-Ferguson Act's special anti-pre-emption rule to the side for the moment, and begin by

asking whether, in the absence of that rule, we should con-strue the Federal Statute to pre-empt the State Statute.
This question is basically one of congressional intent. DidCongress, in enacting the Federal Statute, intend to exercise
its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the lawsof a State? If so, the Supremacy Clause requires courts to
follow federal, not state, law. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2; see
California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272,280-281 (1987) (reviewing pre-emption doctrine).

31Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Sometimes courts, when facing the pre-emption question,find language in the federal statute that reveals an explicit

congressional intent to pre-empt state law. E. g., Jones v.
Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525, 530-531 (1977). More
often, explicit pre-emption language does not appear, or does
not directly answer the question. In that event, courts mustconsider whether the federal statute's "structure and purpose," or nonspecific statutory language, nonetheless reveala clear, but implicit, pre-emptive intent.

Id., at 525; Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141,152-153 (1982). A federal statute, for example, may create

a scheme of federal regulation "so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the
States to supplement it." Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,
331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Alternatively, federal law may be
in "irreconcilable conflict" with state law. Rice v. Norman
Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982). Compliance with
both statutes, for example, may be a "physical impossibility,"
Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S.
132, 142-143 (1963); or, the state law may "stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Hines v. Davidowitz,
312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).

In this case we must ask whether or not the Federal and
State Statutes are in "irreconcilable conflict." The two statutes do not impose directly conflicting duties on national
banks--as they would, for example, if the federal law said,
"you must sell insurance," while the state law said, "you may
not." Nonetheless, the Federal Statute authorizes national
banks to engage in activities that the State Statute expressly
forbids. Thus, the State's prohibition of those activities
would seem to "stan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment"
of one of the Federal Statute's purposes--unless, of course,
that federal purpose is to grant the bank only a very limited
permission, that is, permission to sell insurance to the extent
that state law also grants permission to do so.

32 BARNETT BANK OF MARION CTY., N. A. v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
That is what the State of Florida and its supporting amiciargue. They say that the Federal Statute grants national

banks a permission that is limited to circumstances wherestate law is not to the contrary. In their view, the Federal
Statute removes only federal legal obstacles, not state legal
obstacles, to the sale of insurance by national banks. Butwe do not find this, or the State's related, ordinary preemption arguments, convincing.For one thing, the Federal Statute's language suggests a
broad, not a limited, permission. That language says, with-out relevant qualification, that national banks "may . . . act
as the agent" for insurance sales. 12 U. S. C. $ 92. It specifically refers to "rules and regulations" that will govern
such sales, while citing as their source not state law, but the
federal Comptroller of the Currency. Ibid. It also specifically refers to state regulation, while limiting that reference
to licensing--not of banks or insurance agents, but of the
insurance companies whose policies the bank, as insurance
agent, will sell. Ibid.

For another thing, the Federal Statute says that its grant
of authority to sell insurance is in "addition to the powers
now vested by law in national [banks]." Ibid. (emphasis
added). In using the word "powers," the statute chooses a
legal concept that, in the context of national bank legislation,
has a history. That history is one of interpreting grants of
both enumerated and incidental "powers" to national banks
as grants of authority not normally limited by, but rather
ordinarily pre-empting, contrary state law. See, e. g., First
Nat. Bank of San Jose v. California, 262 U. S. 366, 368-369
(1923) (national banks' "power" to receive deposits pre-empts
contrary state escheat law); Easton v. Iowa, 188 U. S. 220,
229-230 (1903) (national banking system normally "independent, so far as powers conferred are concerned, of state
legislation"); cf. Waite v. Dowley, 94 U. S. 527, 533 (1877)
("[W]here there exists a concurrent right of legislation in the
States and in Congress, and the latter has exercised its

33Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
power, there remains in the States no authority to legislateon the same matter").

Thus, this Court, in a case quite similar to this one, heldthat a federal statute permitting, but not requiring, national
banks to receive savings deposits pre-empts a state statute
prohibiting certain state and national banks from using theword "savings" in their advertising.

Franklin Nat. Bank of
Franklin Square v. New York, 347 U. S. 373, 375-379 (1954)(Federal Reserve Act provision that national banks "may

continue . . . to receive . . . savings deposits" read as "declara-tory of the right of a national bank to enter into or remain
in that type of business"). See also De la Cuesta, supra,
at 154-159 (federal regulation permitting, but not requiring,
national banks to include in mortgage contracts a debt accelerating "due on sale" clause pre-empts a state law forbidding
the use of such a clause); cf. Lawrence County v. LeadDeadwood School Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256 (1985) (federal
statute providing that local government units "may" expend
federal funds for any governmental purpose pre-empts state
law restricting their expenditure).

In defining the pre-emptive scope of statutes and regulations granting a power to national banks, these cases take
the view that normally Congress would not want States to
forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that
Congress explicitly granted. To say this is not to deprive
States of the power to regulate national banks, where (unlike
here) doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere
with the national bank's exercise of its powers. See, e. g.,
Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U. S. 233, 247-252 (1944)
(state statute administering abandoned deposit accounts did
not "unlawful[ly] encroac[h] on the rights and privileges of
national banks"); McClellan v. Chipman, 164 U. S. 347, 358
(1896) (application to national banks of state statute forbidding certain real estate transfers by insolvent transferees
would not "destro[y] or hampe[r]" national banks' functions);
National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 362 (1870)

34 BARNETT BANK OF MARION CTY., N. A. v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
(national banks subject to state law that does not "interferewith, or impair [national banks'] efficiency in performing the

functions by which they are designed to serve [the Federal]Government").

Nor do these cases control the interpretation of federal
banking statutes that accompany a grant of an explicit powerwith an explicit statement that the exercise of that power is

subject to state law. See, e. g., 12 U. S. C. $ 36(c) (McFaddenAct) (authorizing national banks to operate branches, but
only where state law authorizes state banks to do so); $ 92a(a)(Comptroller of Currency may grant fiduciary powers "by
special permit to national banks applying therefor, when not
in contravention of State or local law"). Not surprisingly,
this Court has interpreted those explicit provisions to mean
what they say. See, e. g., First Nat. Bank in Plant City v.
Dickinson, 396 U. S. 122, 131 (1969) (under McFadden Act,
state branching restrictions apply to national banks); First
Nat. Bank of Logan v. Walker Bank & Trust Co., 385 U. S.
252, 260-261 (1966) (same); see also Van Allen v. Assessors, 3
Wall. 573, 586 (1866) (enforcing 1864 amendments to National
Bank Act expressly authorizing state taxation of national
bank shares).

But, as we pointed out, supra, at 32-33, where Congress
has not expressly conditioned the grant of "power" upon a
grant of state permission, the Court has ordinarily found
that no such condition applies. In Franklin Nat. Bank, the
Court made this point explicit. It held that Congress did
not intend to subject national banks' power to local restrictions, because the federal power-granting statute there in
question contained "no indication that Congress [so] intended
. . . as it has done by express language in several other
instances." 347 U. S., at 378, and n. 7 (emphasis added)
(collecting examples).

The Federal Statute before us, as in Franklin Nat. Bank,
explicitly grants a national bank an authorization, permission, or power. And, as in Franklin Nat. Bank, it contains

517us1$36Q 02-16-99 16:42:37 PAGES OPINPGT

35Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
no "indication" that Congress intended to subject that power
to local restriction. Thus, the Court's discussion in Franklin Nat. Bank, the holding of that case, and the other precedent we have cited above, strongly argue for a similar interpretation here--a broad interpretation of the word "may"
that does not condition federal permission upon that of the
State.

Finally, Florida and its supporters challenge this interpretation by arguing that special circumstances surrounding the
enactment of the Federal Statute nonetheless demonstrate
Congress' intent to grant only a limited permission (subject
to state approval). They point to a letter to Congress written by the Comptroller of the Currency in 1916. The Comptroller attached a draft of what became the Federal Statute,
and the letter explains to Congress why the Comptroller
wants Congress to enact his proposal. The letter says that,
since 1900, many small town national banks had failed; that
some States had authorized small town state banks to sell
insurance; that providing small town national banks with
authority to sell insurance would help them financially; and
that doing so would also improve their competitive position
vis-a` -vis state banks. The relevant language in the letter

(somewhat abridged) reads as follows:

"[Since 1900, of 3,084 small national banks, 438] have
either failed or gone into liquidation. . . .
[T]here are many banks located in [small towns] . . .
where the small deposits which the banks receive may
make it somewhat difficult [to earn] . . . a satisfactory
return . . . .

"For some time I have been giving careful consideration to the question as to how the powers of these small
national banks might be enlarged so as to provide them
with additional sources of revenue and place them in a
position where they could better compete with local
State banks and trust companies which are sometimes

authorized under the law to do a class of business notstrictly that of commercial banking. . . .

"[The federal banking laws, while granting nationalbanks certain "incidental powers," do not give them]
either expressly nor by necessary implication the powerto act as agents for insurance companies. . . .

. . . . .
"My investigations lead me respectfully to recommendto Congress an amendment to the national-bank act by

which national banks located in [small towns] . . . may bepermitted to act as agents for insurance companies . . . .

"It seems desirable from the standpoint of public pol-icy and banking efficiency that this authority should be
limited to banks in small communities. This additionalincome will strengthen them and increase their ability
to make a fair return . . . ."I think it would be unwise and therefore undesirable
to confer this privilege generally upon banks in largecities where the legitimate business of banking affords
ample scope for the energies of trained and expert bank-ers . . . .

"I inclose . . . a draft . . . designed to empower nationalbanks located in [small] towns . . . under such regulations
and restrictions as may from time to time be approvedand promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency, to
act as agents for the placing of insurance policies . . . ."53 Cong. Rec. 11001 (1916) (letter from Comptroller Williams to the Chairman of the Senate Bank and Cur-rency Committee).

Assuming for argument's sake that this letter is relevant,and in response to the arguments of Florida and its supporters, we point out that the letter does not significantlyadvance their cause. Although the letter mentions that
enlarging the powers of small national banks will help them"better compete with local State banks," it primarily focuses
upon small town national banks' need for added revenue--

Opinion of the Court
an objective met by a broad insurance-selling authority thatis not limited by state law. The letter refers to limitations

that federal regulation might impose, but it says nothingabout limitations imposed by state regulation or state law.
The letter makes clear that authority to sell insurance insmall towns is an added "incidental power" of a national
bank--a term that, in light of this Court's then-existingcases, suggested freedom from conflicting state regulation.
See Easton, 188 U. S., at 229-230; First Nat. Bank of San
Jose, 262 U. S., at 368-369. The letter sets forth as potentialobjections to the proposal (or to its extension to larger national banks) concerns about distracting banking manage-ment or inhibiting the development of banking expertise--
not concerns related to state regulatory control.We have found nothing elsewhere in the Federal Statute's
background or history that significantly supports the State'sarguments. And as far as we are aware, the Comptroller's
subsequent interpretation of the Federal Statute does notsuggest that the statute provides only a limited authority
subject to similar state approval. Cf. 12 CFR $ 7.7100(1995); OCC Interpretive Letter No. 366, CCH Fed. Banking
L. Rep. || 85,536, p. 77,833 (1986).In light of these considerations, we conclude that the Federal Statute means to grant small town national banks au-thority to sell insurance, whether or not a State grants its
own state banks or national banks similar approval. Werewe to apply ordinary legal principles of pre-emption, the
federal law would pre-empt that of the State.

III
We now must decide whether ordinary legal principles ofpre-emption, or the special McCarran-Ferguson Act antipre-emption rule, governs this case. The lower courts heldthat the McCarran-Ferguson Act's special anti-pre-emption
rule applies, and instructs courts not to "construe" the Fed-eral Statute to "invalidate, impair, or supersede" that of the

Opinion of the Court
State. 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b). By its terms, however, the Act
does not apply when the conflicting federal statute "specifically relates to the business of insurance." Ibid. (emphasis
added). In our view, the Federal Statute in this case "specifically relates to the business of insurance"--therefore the
McCarran-Ferguson Act's special anti-pre-emption rule does
not apply.

Our conclusion rests upon the McCarran-Ferguson Act's
language and purpose, taken together. Consider the language--"specifically relates to the business of insurance."
In ordinary English, a statute that says that banks may act
as insurance agents, and that the Comptroller of the Currency may regulate their insurance-related activities, "relates" to the insurance business. The word "relates" is
highly general, and this Court has interpreted it broadly in
other pre-emption contexts. See, e. g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.
Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47 (1987) (words " `relate to' " have
" `broad common-sense meaning, such that a state law "relate[s] to" a benefit plan ". . . if it has a connection with or
reference to such a plan" ' ") (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 739 (1985), in turn quoting Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 97 (1983));
Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383-384
(1992) (interpreting similarly the words " `relating to' " in the
Airline Deregulation Act of 1978).

More importantly, in ordinary English, this statute "specifically" relates to the insurance business. "Specifically"
can mean "explicitly, particularly, [or] definitely," Black's
Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed. 1990), thereby contrasting a
specific reference with an implicit reference made by more
general language to a broader topic. The general words
"business activity," for example, will sometimes include, and
thereby implicitly refer, to insurance; the particular words
"finance, banking, and insurance" make that reference explicitly and specifically.

39Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Finally, using ordinary English, one would say that this
statute specifically relates to the "business of insurance."
The statute explicitly grants national banks permission to
"act as the agent for any fire, life, or other insurance company," to "solici[t] and sel[l] insurance," to "collec[t] premiums," and to "receive for services so rendered . . . fees
or commissions," subject to Comptroller regulation. 12
U. S. C. $ 92. It also sets forth certain specific rules prohibiting banks from guaranteeing the "payment of any premium
on insurance policies issued through its agency . . ." and the
"truth of any statement made by an assured in filing his
application for insurance." Ibid. The statute thereby not
only focuses directly upon industry-specific selling practices,
but also affects the relation of insured to insurer and the
spreading of risk--matters that this Court, in other contexts,
has placed at the core of the McCarran-Ferguson Act's concern. See Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S.
119, 129 (1982) (citing Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal
Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205 (1979); see also Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U. S. 491, 502-504 (1993).

Consider, too, the McCarran-Ferguson Act's basic purposes. The Act sets forth two mutually reinforcing purposes in its first section, namely, that "continued regulation
and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest," and that "silence on the part
of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier
to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several
States." 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 (emphasis added). The latter
phrase, particularly the word "silence," indicates that the
Act does not seek to insulate state insurance regulation from
the reach of all federal law. Rather, it seeks to protect state
regulation primarily against inadvertent federal intrusion--
say, through enactment of a federal statute that describes an
affected activity in broad, general terms, of which the insurance business happens to constitute one part.

40 BARNETT BANK OF MARION CTY., N. A. v. NELSON

Opinion of the Court
The circumstances surrounding enactment of theMcCarran-Ferguson Act suggest the same. Just prior to

the law's enactment, this Court, in United States v. SouthEastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944), held that
a federal antitrust law, the Sherman Act, applied to the
business of insurance. The Sherman Act's highly generallanguage said nothing specifically about insurance. See 15

U. S. C. $ 1 (forbidding every "contract, combination . . . orconspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the
several States"). The Sherman Act applied only to activi-ties in or affecting interstate commerce.

Hopkins v. United
States, 171 U. S. 578, 586 (1898). Many lawyers and insurance professionals had previously thought (relying, in part,
on this Court's opinion in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 183
(1869), and other cases) that the issuance of an insurance
policy was not a "transaction of commerce," and therefore
fell outside the Sherman Act's scope. South-Eastern Underwriters told those professionals that they were wrong
about interstate commerce, and that the Sherman Act did
apply. And South-Eastern Underwriters' principle meant,
consequently, that other generally phrased congressional
statutes might also apply to the issuance of insurance policies, thereby interfering with state regulation of insurance
in similarly unanticipated ways.

In reaction to South-Eastern Underwriters, Congress
"moved quickly," enacting the McCarran-Ferguson Act "to
restore the supremacy of the States in the realm of insurance
regulation." Fabe, supra, at 500. But the circumstances
we have just described mean that "restor[ation]" of "supremacy" basically required setting aside the unanticipated
effects of South-Eastern Underwriters, and cautiously avoiding similar unanticipated interference with state regulation
in the future. It did not require avoiding federal preemption by future federal statutes that indicate, through
their "specific relat[ion]" to insurance, that Congress had
focused upon the insurance industry, and therefore, in all

Opinion of the Court
likelihood, consciously intended to exert upon the insuranceindustry whatever pre-emptive force accompanied its law.

See also, e. g., insofar as relevant, 91 Cong. Rec. 483 (1945)(statement of Sen. O'Mahoney, floor manager of the Act, that
the Act was intended to be "a sort of catch-all provision to
take into consideration other acts of Congress which mightaffect the insurance industry, but of which we did not have

knowledge at the time"); ibid. (similar statement of Sen.Ferguson).

The language of the Federal Statute before us is not gen-eral. It refers specifically to insurance. Its state regulatory implications are not surprising, nor do we believe them
inadvertent. See Part II, supra. Consequently, considerations of purpose, as well as of language, indicate that the
Federal Statute falls within the scope of the McCarranFerguson Act's "specifically relates" exception to its antipre-emption rule. Cf. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, 510 U. S. 86, 98 (1993) (adopting the United States' view that language in the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 defining a "guaranteed benefit policy" as a certain kind of "insurance" policy
"obviously and specifically relates to the business of insurance") (internal quotation marks omitted).

We shall mention briefly why we are not convinced by several of the parties' remaining arguments. Florida says that
the Federal Statute "specifically relates" to banking, not to
insurance. But a statute may specifically relate to more
than one thing. Just as an ordinance forbidding dogs in city
parks specifically relates to dogs and to parks, so a statute
permitting banks to sell insurance can specifically relate to
banks and to insurance. Neither the McCarran-Ferguson
Act's language, nor its purpose, requires the Federal Statute
to relate predominantly to insurance. To the contrary,
specific detailed references to the insurance industry in
proposed legislation normally will achieve the McCarranFerguson Act's objectives, for they will call the proposed leg517us1$36Q 02-16-99 16:42:37 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
islation to the attention of interested parties, and thereby
normally guarantee, should the proposal become law, that
Congress will have focused upon its insurance-related
effects.

An amicus argues that our interpretation would give
the Act "little meaning," because "whenever a state statute
`regulates' the business of insurance, any conflicting federal
statute necessarily will `specifically relate' to the insurance
business." Brief for American Council of Life Insurance
as Amicus Curiae 4. We disagree. Many federal statutes
with potentially pre-emptive effect, such as the bankruptcy
statutes, use general language that does not appear to "specifically relate" to insurance; and where those statutes conflict with state law that was enacted "for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance," the McCarran-Ferguson
Act's anti-pre-emption rule will apply. See generally Fabe,
supra, at 501 (noting the parties' agreement that federal
bankruptcy priority rules, although conflicting with state
law, do not "specifically relate" to the business of insurance).

The lower courts argued that the Federal Statute's 1916
date of enactment was significant, because Congress would
have then believed that state insurance regulation was beyond its "Commerce Clause" power to affect. The lower
courts apparently thought that Congress therefore could not
have intended the Federal Statute to pre-empt contrary
state law. The short answer to this claim is that there is
no reason to think that Congress believed state insurance
regulation beyond its constitutional powers to affect--insofar as Congress exercised those powers to create, to empower, or to regulate national banks. See McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819); Farmers' and Mechanics'
Nat. Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29, 33 (1875); see also, e. g.,
Easton v. Iowa, 188 U. S., at 238. We have explained, see
Part II, supra, why we conclude that Congress indeed did
intend the Federal Statute to pre-empt conflicting state law.

43Cite as: 517 U. S. 25 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Finally, Florida points to language in Fabe, which statesthat the McCarran-Ferguson Act "imposes what is, in effect,

a clear-statement rule" that forbids pre-emption "unless afederal statute specifically requires otherwise." 508 U. S.,
at 507. Florida believes that this statement in Fabe meansthat the Federal Statute would have to use the words "state
law is pre-empted," or the like, in order to fall within theMcCarran-Ferguson Act exception. We do not believe, however, that Fabe imposes any such requirement. Rather, thequoted language in

Fabe was a general description of theAct's effect. It simply pointed to the existence of the clause

at issue here--the exception for federal statutes that "spe-cifically relat[e] to the business of insurance." But it did not
purport authoritatively to interpret the "specifically relates"clause. That matter was not at issue in

Fabe. We there-fore believe that Fabe does not require us to reach a different

result here.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed.

It is so ordered.

SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLORIDA v. FLORIDA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 94-12. Argued October 11, 1995--Decided March 27, 1996
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, passed by Congress pursuant to the

Indian Commerce Clause, allows an Indian tribe to conduct certain
gaming activities only in conformance with a valid compact between
the tribe and the State in which the gaming activities are located.
25 U. S. C. $ 2710(d)(1)(C). Under the Act, States have a duty to negotiate in good faith with a tribe toward the formation of a compact,

$ 2710(d)(3)(A), and a tribe may sue a State in federal court in order to
compel performance of that duty, $ 2710(d)(7). In this $ 2710(d)(7) suit,
respondents, Florida and its Governor, moved to dismiss petitioner Seminole Tribe's complaint on the ground that the suit violated Florida's
sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. The District Court
denied the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the
Indian Commerce Clause did not grant Congress the power to abrogate
the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity and that Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123, does not permit an Indian tribe to force good-faith negotiations by suing a State's Governor.

Held:

1. The Eleventh Amendment prevents Congress from authorizing
suits by Indian tribes against States to enforce legislation enacted pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause. Pp. 54-73.

(a) The Eleventh Amendment presupposes that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system and that " `[i]t is inherent in the
nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual
without [a State's] consent.' " Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 13.
However, Congress may abrogate the States' sovereign immunity if it
has "unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immunity" and
has acted "pursuant to a valid exercise of power." Green v. Mansour,
474 U. S. 64, 68. Here, through the numerous references to the "State"
in $ 2710(d)(7)(B)'s text, Congress provided an "unmistakably clear"
statement of its intent to abrogate. Pp. 54-57.

(b) The inquiry into whether Congress has the power to abrogate
unilaterally the States' immunity from suit is narrowly focused on a
single question: Was the Act in question passed pursuant to a constitutional provision granting Congress such power? This Court has found
authority to abrogate under only two constitutional provisions: the

Syllabus
Fourteenth Amendment, see, e. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445,
and, in a plurality opinion, the Interstate Commerce Clause, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1. The Union Gas plurality found
that Congress' power to abrogate came from the States' cession of
their sovereignty when they gave Congress plenary power to regulate
commerce. Under the rationale of Union Gas, the Indian Commerce
Clause is indistinguishable from the Interstate Commerce Clause.
Pp. 57-63.

(c) However, in the five years since it was decided, Union Gas has
proved to be a solitary departure from established law. Reconsidering
that decision, none of the policies underlying stare decisis require this
Court's continuing adherence to its holding. The decision has been of
questionable precedential value, largely because a majority of the Court
expressly disagreed with the plurality's rationale. Moreover, the
deeply fractured decision has created confusion among the lower courts
that have sought to understand and apply it. The plurality's rationale
also deviated sharply from this Court's established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated the Court's decision in Hans, since the
plurality's conclusion--that Congress could under Article I expand the
scope of the federal courts' Article III jurisdiction--contradicted the
fundamental notion that Article III sets forth the exclusive catalog of
permissible federal-court jurisdiction. Thus, Union Gas was wrongly
decided and is overruled. The Eleventh Amendment restricts the
judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.
Pp. 63-73.

2. The doctrine of Ex parte Young may not be used to enforce

$ 2710(d)(3) against a state official. That doctrine allows a suit against a
state official to go forward, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment's
jurisdictional bar, where the suit seeks prospective injunctive relief in
order to end a continuing federal-law violation. However, where, as
here, Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court should
hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an Ex
parte Young action. The intricate procedures set forth in $ 2710(d)(7)
show that Congress intended not only to define, but also significantly to
limit, the duty imposed by $ 2710(d)(3). The Act mandates only a modest set of sanctions against a State, culminating in the Secretary of
the Interior prescribing gaming regulations where an agreement is not
reached through negotiation or mediation. In contrast, an Ex parte
Young action would expose a state official to a federal court's full remedial powers, including, presumably, contempt sanctions. Enforcement
through an Ex parte Young suit would also make $ 2710(d)(7) super517us1$37Z 02-23-99 16:36:04 PAGES OPINPGT

fluous, for it is difficult to see why a tribe would suffer through

$ 2710(d)(7)'s intricate enforcement scheme if Ex parte Young's more
complete and more immediate relief were available. The Court is not
free to rewrite the statutory scheme in order to approximate what it
thinks Congress might have wanted had it known that $ 2710(d)(7) was
beyond its authority. Pp. 73-76.

48 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court

I
Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in1988 in order to provide a statutory basis for the operation

and regulation of gaming by Indian tribes. See 25 U. S. C.$ 2702. The Act divides gaming on Indian lands into three
classes--I, II, and III--and provides a different regulatoryscheme for each class. Class III gaming--the type with
which we are here concerned--is defined as "all forms ofgaming that are not class I gaming or class II gaming,"

$ 2703(8), and includes such things as slot machines, casinogames, banking card games, dog racing, and lotteries.

1 It is

the most heavily regulated of the three classes. The Actprovides that class III gaming is lawful only where it is: (1)

authorized by an ordinance or resolution that (a) is adoptedby the governing body of the Indian tribe, (b) satisfies certain statutorily prescribed requirements, and (c) is approvedby the National Indian Gaming Commission; (2) located in
a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by anyperson, organization, or entity; and (3) "conducted in conformance with a Tribal-State compact entered into by the

1 Class I gaming "means social games solely for prizes of minimal value
or traditional forms of Indian gaming engaged in by individuals as a part
of, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations," 25 U. S. C.

$ 2703(6), and is left by the Act to "the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian
tribes," $ 2710(a)(1).

Class II gaming is more extensively defined to include bingo, games
similar to bingo, nonbanking card games not illegal under the laws of the
State, and card games actually operated in particular States prior to the
passage of the Act. See $ 2703(7). Banking card games, electronic games
of chance, and slot machines are expressly excluded from the scope of class
II gaming. $ 2703(B). The Act allows class II gaming where the State
"permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization or entity," and the "governing body of the Indian tribe adopts an ordinance or
resolution which is approved by the Chairman" of the National Indian
Gaming Commission. $ 2710(b)(1). Regulation of class II gaming contemplates a federal role, but places primary emphasis on tribal selfregulation. See $$ 2710(c)(3)-(6).

Indian tribe and the State under paragraph (3) that is ineffect." $ 2710(d)(1).

The "paragraph (3)" to which the last prerequisite of$ 2710(d)(1) refers is $ 2710(d)(3), which describes the permissible scope of a Tribal-State compact, see $ 2710(d)(3)(C), andprovides that the compact is effective "only when notice of
approval by the Secretary [of the Interior] of such compacthas been published by the Secretary in the Federal Register," $ 2710(d)(3)(B). More significant for our purposes,however, is that $ 2710(d)(3) describes the process by which

Sections 2710(d)(7)(B)(ii)-(vii) describe an elaborate remedialscheme designed to ensure the formation of a Tribal-State
compact. A tribe that brings an action under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) must show that no Tribal-State compact has been
entered and that the State failed to respond in good faith tothe tribe's request to negotiate; at that point, the burden
then shifts to the State to prove that it did in fact negotiatein good faith. $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(ii). If the district court concludes that the State has failed to negotiate in good faithtoward the formation of a Tribal-State compact, then it
"shall order the State and Indian Tribe to conclude such acompact within a 60-day period." $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii). If no
compact has been concluded 60 days after the court's order,then "the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a
mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact thatrepresents their last best offer for a compact." $ 2710(d)(7)
(B)(iv). The mediator chooses from between the two pro-posed compacts the one "which best comports with the terms
of [the Act] and any other applicable Federal law and withthe findings and order of the court," ibid., and submits it to
the State and the Indian tribe, $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(v). If theState consents to the proposed compact within 60 days of its
submission by the mediator, then the proposed compact is"treated as a Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3)." $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(vi). If, however, the State doesnot consent within that 60-day period, then the Act provides
that the mediator "shall notify the Secretary [of the Inte-rior]" and that the Secretary "shall prescribe . . . procedures
. . . under which class III gaming may be conducted on theIndian lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction."

"(iii) If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds
that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe
to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe to conclude
such a compact within a 60-day period. In determining in such an action
whether a State has negotiated in good faith, the court--

"(I) may take into account the public interest, public safety, criminality,
financial integrity, and adverse economic impacts on existing gaming activities, and

"(II) shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the
Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not

Opinion of the Court

$ 2710(d)(7)(A), as well as 28 U. S. C. $$ 1331 and 1362, peti-tioner alleged that respondents had "refused to enter into

any negotiation for inclusion of [certain gaming activities] ina tribal-state compact," thereby violating the "requirement
of good faith negotiation" contained in $ 2710(d)(3). Petitioner's Complaint || 24, see App. 18. Respondents moved
to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the suit violated the
State's sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. The
District Court denied respondents' motion, 801 F. Supp. 655
(SD Fla. 1992), and respondents took an interlocutory appeal
of that decision. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993) (collateral order doctrine allows immediate appellate review of
order denying claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity).

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed
the decision of the District Court, holding that the Eleventh
Amendment barred petitioner's suit against respondents.3
11 F. 3d 1016 (1994). The court agreed with the District
Court that Congress in $ 2710(d)(7) intended to abrogate the
States' sovereign immunity, and also agreed that the Act had
been passed pursuant to Congress' power under the Indian
Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. The court
disagreed with the District Court, however, that the Indian

mediator under clause (iv), the provisions of this chapter, and the relevant
provisions of the laws of the State, and

"(II) under which class III gaming may be conducted on the Indian
lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction."

3 The Eleventh Circuit consolidated petitioner's appeal with an appeal

from another suit brought under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) by a different Indian
tribe. Although the District Court in that case had granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, the legal issues presented by the two appeals
were virtually identical. See Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Alabama,
776 F. Supp. 550 (SD Ala. 1991) (Eleventh Amendment bars suit against
State), and 784 F. Supp. 1549 (SD Ala. 1992) (Eleventh Amendment bars
suit against Governor).

Opinion of the Court
Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to abrogate a
State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and concluded therefore that it had no jurisdiction over petitioner's
suit against Florida. The court further held that Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), does not permit an Indian tribe
to force good-faith negotiations by suing the Governor of a
State. Finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction,
the Eleventh Circuit remanded to the District Court with
directions to dismiss petitioner's suit.4

Petitioner sought our review of the Eleventh Circuit's
decision,5 and we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1125 (1995),
in order to consider two questions: (1) Does the Eleventh
Amendment prevent Congress from authorizing suits by Indian tribes against States for prospective injunctive relief to
enforce legislation enacted pursuant to the Indian Commerce
Clause?; and (2) Does the doctrine of Ex parte Young permit
suits against a State's Governor for prospective injunctive
relief to enforce the good-faith bargaining requirement of the
Act? We answer the first question in the affirmative, the
second in the negative, and we therefore affirm the Eleventh
Circuit's dismissal of petitioner's suit.6

4 Following its conclusion that petitioner's suit should be dismissed, the
Court of Appeals went on to consider how $ 2710(d)(7) would operate in
the wake of its decision. The court decided that those provisions of

$ 2710(d)(7) that were problematic could be severed from the rest of the
section, and read the surviving provisions of $ 2710(d)(7) to provide an
Indian tribe with immediate recourse to the Secretary of the Interior from
the dismissal of a suit against a State. 11 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (1994).

5 Respondents filed a cross-petition, No. 94-219, challenging only the

Eleventh Circuit's modification of $ 2710(d)(7), see n. 4, supra. That petition is still pending.

6 While the appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, the District

Court granted respondents' earlier filed summary judgment motion, finding that Florida had fulfilled its obligation under the Act to negotiate in
good faith. The Eleventh Circuit has stayed its review of that decision
pending the disposition of this case.

Opinion of the Court
The Eleventh Amendment provides:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not beconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United Statesby Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects
of any Foreign State."
Although the text of the Amendment would appear to re-strict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal

courts, "we have understood the Eleventh Amendment tostand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition
. . . which it confirms." Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991). That presupposition, first ob-served over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1

(1890), has two parts: first, that each State is a sovereignentity in our federal system; and second, that " `[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to thesuit of an individual without its consent,' " id., at 13 (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Ros-siter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). See also

Puerto Rico Aque-duct and Sewer Authority, supra, at 146 ("The Amendment

is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union,maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity"). For over a century we have reaffirmedthat federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting
States "was not contemplated by the Constitution when es-tablishing the judicial power of the United States."

Opinion of the Court
Here, petitioner has sued the State of Florida and it isundisputed that Florida has not consented to the suit. See

Blatchford, supra, at 782 (States by entering into the Consti-tution did not consent to suit by Indian tribes). Petitioner
nevertheless contends that its suit is not barred by state sov-ereign immunity. First, it argues that Congress through
the Act abrogated the States' sovereign immunity. Alterna-tively, petitioner maintains that its suit against the Governor
may go forward under Ex parte Young, supra. We considereach of those arguments in turn.

II
Petitioner argues that Congress through the Act abro-gated the States' immunity from suit. In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the States' sovereignimmunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has
"unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immu-nity," Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985); and second,
whether Congress has acted "pursuant to a valid exercise ofpower," ibid.

A
Congress' intent to abrogate the States' immunity fromsuit must be obvious from "a clear legislative statement."

Blatchford, supra, at 786. This rule arises from a recogni-tion of the important role played by the Eleventh AmendStates v. Mississippi, 380 U. S. 128, 140 (1965); Employees of Dept. of

does not suffice to show Congress has abrogated all defensesto that claim") (emphases deleted). Rather, as we said in
Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223 (1989):

"To temper Congress' acknowledged powers of abroga-tion with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment's

role as an essential component of our constitutionalstructure, we have applied a simple but stringent test:
`Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally se-cured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language ofthe statute.' "

vests jurisdiction in "[t]he United States district courts . . .over any cause of action . . . arising from the failure of a

State to enter into negotiations . . . or to conduct such nego-tiations in good faith." Any conceivable doubt as to the
identity of the defendant in an action under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i)is dispelled when one looks to the various provisions of

$ 2710(d)(7)(B), which describe the remedial scheme availableto a tribe that files suit under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i). Section
2710(d)(7)(B)(ii)(II) provides that if a suing tribe meets itsburden of proof, then the "burden of proof shall be upon the
State . . ."; $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii) states that if the court "findsthat the State has failed to negotiate in good faith . . . , the
court shall order the State . . ."; $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iv) providesthat "the State shall . . . submit to a mediator appointed
by the court" and subsection (B)(v) of $ 2710(d)(7) states thatthe mediator "shall submit to the State." Sections 2710(d)
(7)(B)(vi) and (vii) also refer to the "State" in a context thatmakes it clear that the State is the defendant to the suit
brought by an Indian tribe under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i). In sum,we think that the numerous references to the "State" in the
text of $ 2710(d)(7)(B) make it indubitable that Congress in-tended through the Act to abrogate the States' sovereign
immunity from suit.9 B

Having concluded that Congress clearly intended to abro-gate the States' sovereign immunity through $ 2710(d)(7), we

Post, at 182. But in light of the plain text of $ 2710(d)(7)(B), we disagree
with the dissent's assertion that the Act can reasonably be read in that
way. "We cannot press statutory construction `to the point of disingenuous evasion' even to avoid a constitutional question." See United States
v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 96 (1985), quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v.

avoiding a constitutional question inapplicable.

Opinion of the Court
turn now to consider whether the Act was passed "pursuantto a valid exercise of power."

Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S.,
at 68. Before we address that question here, however, wethink it necessary first to define the scope of our inquiry.

Petitioner suggests that one consideration weighing in
favor of finding the power to abrogate here is that the Actauthorizes only prospective injunctive relief rather than retroactive monetary relief. But we have often made it clearthat the relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant
to the question whether the suit is barred by the EleventhAmendment. See,

e. g., Cory v. White, 457 U. S. 85, 90 (1982)
("It would be a novel proposition indeed that the Eleventh
Amendment does not bar a suit to enjoin the State itself
simply because no money judgment is sought"). We think
it follows a fortiori from this proposition that the type of
relief sought is irrelevant to whether Congress has power to
abrogate States' immunity. The Eleventh Amendment does
not exist solely in order to "preven[t] federal-court judgments that must be paid out of a State's treasury," Hess v.
Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 48
(1994); it also serves to avoid "the indignity of subjecting a
State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties," Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Author i ty, 506 U. S., at 146 ( internal quotation marks
omitted).

Similarly, petitioner argues that the abrogation power is
validly exercised here because the Act grants the States a
power that they would not otherwise have, viz., some measure of authority over gaming on Indian lands. It is true
enough that the Act extends to the States a power withheld
from them by the Constitution. See California v. Cabazon
Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987). Nevertheless, we do not see how that consideration is relevant to the
question whether Congress may abrogate state sovereign
immunity. The Eleventh Amendment immunity may not be
lifted by Congress unilaterally deciding that it will be re517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

59Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
placed by grant of some other authority. Cf. Atascadero,473 U. S., at 246-247 ("[T]he mere receipt of federal funds

cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in fed-eral court").

Thus our inquiry into whether Congress has the power
to abrogate unilaterally the States' immunity from suit isnarrowly focused on one question: Was the Act in question

passed pursuant to a constitutional provision grantingCongress the power to abrogate? See,

e. g., Fitzpatrick v.
Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 452-456 (1976). Previously, in conduct-ing that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate under

only two provisions of the Constitution. In Fitzpatrick, we
recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding
federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power
struck by the Constitution. Id., at 455. We noted that $ 1
of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that $ 5 of the Amendment
expressly provided that "The Congress shall have power to
enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article." See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted).
We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal
power extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh
Amendment and therefore that $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit
guaranteed by that Amendment.

In only one other case has congressional abrogation of the
States' Eleventh Amendment immunity been upheld. In
Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), a plurality of the Court found that the Interstate Commerce Clause,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, granted Congress the power to abrogate
state sovereign immunity, stating that the power to regulate
interstate commerce would be "incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages." 491 U. S., at
19-20. Justice White added the fifth vote necessary to the
result in that case, but wrote separately in order to express

Opinion of the Court
that he "[did] not agree with much of [the plurality's] reason-ing."

Id., at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part).In arguing that Congress through the Act abrogated the

States' sovereign immunity, petitioner does not challenge the
Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that the Act was passed pursu-ant to neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Interstate

Commerce Clause. Instead, accepting the lower court's con-clusion that the Act was passed pursuant to Congress' power
under the Indian Commerce Clause, petitioner now asks usto consider whether that Clause grants Congress the power
to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity.

Petitioner begins with the plurality decision in Union Gas
and contends that "[t]here is no principled basis for finding
that congressional power under the Indian Commerce Clause
is less than that conferred by the Interstate Commerce
Clause." Brief for Petitioner 17. Noting that the Union
Gas plurality found the power to abrogate from the "plenary" character of the grant of authority over interstate
commerce, petitioner emphasizes that the Interstate Commerce Clause leaves the States with some power to regulate,
see, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186
(1994), whereas the Indian Commerce Clause makes "Indian
relations . . . the exclusive province of federal law." County
of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226,
234 (1985). Contending that the Indian Commerce Clause
vests the Federal Government with "the duty of protect[ing]" the tribes from "local ill feeling" and "the people of
the States," United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383-384
(1886), petitioner argues that the abrogation power is necessary "to protect the tribes from state action denying federally guaranteed rights." Brief for Petitioner 20.

Respondents dispute petitioner's analogy between the Indian Commerce Clause and the Interstate Commerce Clause.
They note that we have recognized that "the Interstate
Commerce and Indian Commerce Clauses have very differ517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ent applications," Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,
490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989), and from that they argue that the
two provisions are "wholly dissimilar." Brief for Respondents 21. Respondents contend that the Interstate Commerce Clause grants the power of abrogation only because
Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce would
be "incomplete" without that "necessary" power. Id., at 23,
citing Union Gas, supra, at 19-20. The Indian Commerce
Clause is distinguishable, respondents contend, because it
gives Congress complete authority over the Indian tribes.
Therefore, the abrogation power is not "necessary" to Congress' exercise of its power under the Indian Commerce
Clause.10

Both parties make their arguments from the plurality decision in Union Gas, and we, too, begin there. We think it
clear that Justice Brennan's opinion finds Congress' power to
abrogate under the Interstate Commerce Clause from the
States' cession of their sovereignty when they gave Congress plenary power to regulate interstate commerce. See
Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 17 ("The important point . . . is
that the provision both expands federal power and contracts
state power"). Respondents' focus elsewhere is misplaced.
While the plurality decision states that Congress' power
under the Interstate Commerce Clause would be incomplete
without the power to abrogate, that statement is made solely
in order to emphasize the broad scope of Congress' authority
over interstate commerce. Id., at 19-20. Moreover, respondents' rationale would mean that where Congress has

10 Respondents also contend that the Act mandates state regulation of
Indian gaming and therefore violates the Tenth Amendment by allowing
federal officials to avoid political accountability for those actions for which
they are in fact responsible. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144
(1992). This argument was not considered below by either the Eleventh
Circuit or the District Court, and is not fairly within the question presented. Therefore we do not consider it here. See this Court's Rule 14.1;
Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519 (1992).

Opinion of the Court
less authority, and the States have more, Congress' meansfor exercising that power must be greater. We read the plurality opinion to provide just the opposite. Indeed, it wasin those circumstances where Congress exercised complete
authority that Justice Brennan thought the power to abrogate most necessary. Id., at 20 ("Since the States may notlegislate at all in [the aforementioned] situations, a conclusion that Congress may not create a cause of action formoney damages against the States would mean that no one
could do so. And in many situations, it is only money dam-ages that will carry out Congress' legitimate objectives
under the Commerce Clause").

Following the rationale of the Union Gas plurality, our
inquiry is limited to determining whether the Indian Commerce Clause, like the Interstate Commerce Clause, is a
grant of authority to the Federal Government at the expense
of the States. The answer to that question is obvious. If
anything, the Indian Commerce Clause accomplishes a
greater transfer of power from the States to the Federal
Government than does the Interstate Commerce Clause.
This is clear enough from the fact that the States still exercise some authority over interstate trade but have been divested of virtually all authority over Indian commerce and
Indian tribes. Under the rationale of Union Gas, if the
States' partial cession of authority over a particular area
includes cession of the immunity from suit, then their virtually total cession of authority over a different area must also
include cession of the immunity from suit. See id., at 42
(Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and
Kennedy, JJ., dissenting) ("[I]f the Article I commerce
power enables abrogation of state sovereign immunity, so do
all the other Article I powers"); see Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma, 37 F. 3d 1422, 1428 (CA10 1994) (Indian

Press, 59 F. 3d 539, 546-547 (CA5 1995) (After Union Gas,Copyright Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8, must grant

Congress power to abrogate). We agree with petitionerthat the plurality opinion in

Union Gas allows no principled
distinction in favor of the States to be drawn between the
Indian Commerce Clause and the Interstate CommerceClause.

Respondents argue, however, that we need not concludethat the Indian Commerce Clause grants the power to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. Instead, they contendthat if we find the rationale of the

Union Gas plurality to
extend to the Indian Commerce Clause, then "Union Gas
should be reconsidered and overruled." Brief for Respondents 25. Generally, the principle of stare decisis, and the
interests that it serves, viz., "the evenhanded, predictable,
and consistent development of legal principles, . . . reliance
on judicial decisions, and . . . the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process," Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.
808, 827 (1991), counsel strongly against reconsideration of
our precedent. Nevertheless, we always have treated stare
decisis as a "principle of policy," Helvering v. Hallock, 309
U. S. 106, 119 (1940), and not as an "inexorable command,"
Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. "[W]hen governing decisions are
unworkable or are badly reasoned, `this Court has never felt
constrained to follow precedent.' " Id., at 827 (quoting
Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944)). Our willingness to reconsider our earlier decisions has been "particularly true in constitutional cases, because in such cases `correction through legislative action is practically impossible.' "
Payne, supra, at 828 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas
Co., 285 U. S. 393, 407 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).

The Court in Union Gas reached a result without an expressed rationale agreed upon by a majority of the Court.
We have already seen that Justice Brennan's opinion received the support of only three other Justices. See Union
Gas, 491 U. S., at 5 (Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.,

joined Justice Brennan). Of the other five, Justice White,who provided the fifth vote for the result, wrote separately

in order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality'srationale,

id., at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), and four Justices joined together in a dissent
that rejected the plurality's rationale, id., at 35-45 (Scalia,
J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and
Kennedy, JJ.). Since it was issued, Union Gas has createdconfusion among the lower courts that have sought to understand and apply the deeply fractured decision. See, e. g.,
Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, supra, at 543-545 ("Justice
White's concurrence must be taken on its face to disavow"
the plurality's theory); 11 F. 3d, at 1027 (Justice White's
"vague concurrence renders the continuing validity of Union
Gas in doubt").

The plurality's rationale also deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated our decision in Hans. See Union Gas, supra, at 36 ("If
Hans means only that federal-question suits for money damages against the States cannot be brought in federal court
unless Congress clearly says so, it means nothing at all")
(Scalia, J., dissenting). It was well established in 1989
when Union Gas was decided that the Eleventh Amendment
stood for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limited the federal courts' jurisdiction under Article
III. The text of the Amendment itself is clear enough on
this point: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not
be construed to extend to any suit . . . ." And our decisions
since Hans had been equally clear that the Eleventh Amendment reflects "the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III,"
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465
U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); see Union Gas, supra, at 38 (" `[T]he
entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not
embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given . . . ' ") (Scalia,

J., dissenting) (quoting Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497(1921)); see also cases cited at n. 7,

supra. As the dissent in
Union Gas recognized, the plurality's conclusion--that Con-gress could under Article I expand the scope of the federal

courts' jurisdiction under Article III--"contradict[ed] our
unvarying approach to Article III as setting forth the
exclusive catalog of permissible federal-court jurisdiction."
Union Gas, supra, at 39.Never before the decision in

Union Gas had we suggested
that the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congressoperating pursuant to any constitutional provision other than

the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction of
the federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). The plurality's citation of prior decisions for support was based upon what we
believe to be a misreading of precedent. See Union Gas,
491 U. S., at 40-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The plurality
claimed support for its decision from a case holding the unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the
States may waive their sovereign immunity, see id., at 14-15
(citing Parden v. Terminal Railway of Ala. Docks Dept., 377
U. S. 184 (1964)), and cited as precedent propositions that had
been merely assumed for the sake of argument in earlier
cases, see 491 U. S., at 15 (citing Welch v. Texas Dept. of
Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S., at 475-476, and
n. 5, and County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,
470 U. S., at 252).

The plurality's extended reliance upon our decision in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), that Congress could
under the Fourteenth Amendment abrogate the States'
sovereign immunity was also, we believe, misplaced. Fitzpatrick was based upon a rationale wholly inapplicable to
the Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that the Fourteenth
Amendment, adopted well after the adoption of the Eleventh
Amendment and the ratification of the Constitution, oper517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and fed-eral power achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment. Id., at 454. As the dissent in Union Gas made clear,Fitzpatrick cannot be read to justify "limitation of the principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment through appealto antecedent provisions of the Constitution."

Union Gas,supra, at 42 (
Scalia, J., dissenting).In the five years since it was decided,

Union Gas hasproved to be a solitary departure from established law. See

Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993). Reconsidering the decision
in Union Gas, we conclude that none of the policies underly-ing

stare decisis require our continuing adherence to its hold-ing. The decision has, since its issuance, been of questionable precedential value, largely because a majority of theCourt expressly disagreed with the rationale of the plurality.
See Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994) (the"degree of confusion following a splintered decision . . . is
itself a reason for reexamining that decision"). The case in-volved the interpretation of the Constitution and therefore
may be altered only by constitutional amendment or revisionby this Court. Finally, both the result in

Union Gas andthe plurality's rationale depart from our established understanding of the Eleventh Amendment and undermine theaccepted function of Article III. We feel bound to conclude
that Union Gas was wrongly decided and that it should be,and now is, overruled.

The dissent makes no effort to defend the decision in
Union Gas, see post, at 100, but nonetheless would find con-gressional power to abrogate in this case.

11 Contending that

our decision is a novel extension of the Eleventh Amend-ment, the dissent chides us for "attend[ing]" to dicta. We

adhere in this case, however, not to mere obiter dicta, butrather to the well-established rationale upon which the

Court based the results of its earlier decisions. When an
opinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but also
those portions of the opinion necessary to that result by
which we are bound. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of
Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 613 (1990) (exclusive
basis of a judgment is not dicta) (plurality); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 668 (1989) ("As a general rule,
the principle of stare decisis directs us to adhere not only to
the holdings of our prior cases, but also to their explications
of the governing rules of law") (Kennedy, J., concurring and
dissenting); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 490
(1986) ("Although technically dicta, . . . an important part of
the Court's rationale for the result that it reache[s] . . . is
entitled to greater weight . . .") (O'Connor, J., concurring).
For over a century, we have grounded our decisions in the
oft-repeated understanding of state sovereign immunity as
an essential part of the Eleventh Amendment. In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), the
Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suit
brought against a State by a foreign state. Chief Justice
Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court:

"[N]either the literal sweep of the words of Clause one
of $ 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in the
letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in
Clause one, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh
Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent.
Thus Clause one specifically provides that the judicial
Power shall extend `to all Cases, in Law and Equity,
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United
States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made,
under their Authority.' But, although a case may arise
under the Constitution and laws of the United States,
the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is

sought to be prosecuted against a State, without herconsent, by one of her own citizens. . . .

"Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal appli-cation of the words of $ 2 of Article III, or assume that
the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts therestrictions upon suits against non-consenting States.
Behind the words of the constitutional provisions arepostulates which limit and control. There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as contemplated,shall be found to be of a justiciable character. There
is also the postulate that States of the Union, still pos-sessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immune
from suits, without their consent, save where there hasbeen a `surrender of this immunity in the plan of the
convention.' " Id., at 321-323 (citations and footnoteomitted).

See id., at 329-330; see also Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 98 ("Inshort, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional
limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art.III"); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 ("[T]he entire
judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embraceauthority to entertain a suit brought by private parties
against a State without consent given . . ."). It is true thatwe have not had occasion previously to apply established
Eleventh Amendment principles to the question whetherCongress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity (save in Union Gas). But consideration of that ques-tion must proceed with fidelity to this century-old doctrine.

The dissent, to the contrary, disregards our case law infavor of a theory cobbled together from law review articles
and its own version of historical events. The dissent citesnot a single decision since Hans (other than Union Gas) that
supports its view of state sovereign immunity, instead rely-ing upon the now-discredited decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47. Its un-documented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of

Opinion of the Court
the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court's traditionalmethod of adjudication. See

post, at 120-123.
The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion. That de-cision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental " `jurisprudence in
all civilized nations.' " Hans, 134 U. S., at 17, quoting Beersv.

Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist
No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereignimmunity "is the general sense and the general practice of

mankind"). The dissent's proposition that the common lawof England, where adopted by the States, was open to change
by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive
rules of law rather than jurisdiction. Cf. Monaco, supra, at
323 (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that
there be a "justiciable" controversy, is a constitutionally
grounded limit on federal jurisdiction). It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands
distinct from other principles of the common law in that only
the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.

Hans--with a much closer vantage point than the dissent--recognized that the decision in Chisholm was contrary
to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution. The
dissent's conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was "reasonable," post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision
created "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted." Monaco, supra,
at 325. The dissent's lengthy analysis of the text of the
Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man--we long
have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is " `to strain the Constitution and the law
to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.' " Monaco,
supra, at 326, quoting Hans, supra, at 15. The text dealt in
terms only with the problem presented by the decision in
Chisholm; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not

Opinion of the Court
have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amend-ment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems

unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect offederal-question jurisdiction over the States.

That same consideration causes the dissent's criticism ofthe views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.
The dissent cites statements made by those three influentialFramers, the most natural reading of which would preclude
all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.12 Strug-gling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immu-nity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.

Post,at 142-150. But the lack of any statute vesting general

federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until muchlater makes the dissent's demand for greater specificity about
a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.13

12 We note here also that the dissent quotes selectively from the Framers' statements that it references. The dissent cites the following, for
instance, as a statement made by Madison: "[T]he Constitution `give[s] a
citizen a right to be heard in the federal courts; and if a state should
condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it.' " Post, at
143 (opinion of Souter, J.). But that statement, perhaps ambiguous when
read in isolation, was preceded by the following: "[J]urisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objected
to, and perhaps without reason. It is not in the power of individuals to
call any state into court. The only operation it can have, is that, if a
state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must be brought
before the federal courts. It appears to me that this can have no operation but this:" See 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 533
(2d ed. 1836).

13 Although the absence of any discussion dealing with federal-question

jurisdiction is therefore unremarkable, what is notably lacking in the
Framers' statements is any mention of Congress' power to abrogate the
States' immunity. The absence of any discussion of that power is particularly striking in light of the fact that the Framers virtually always
were very specific about the exception to state sovereign immunity arising from a State's consent to suit. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 81,
pp. 487-488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("It is inherent in the
nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual with517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
In putting forward a new theory of state sovereign immu-nity, the dissent develops its own vision of the political system created by the Framers, concluding with the statementthat "[t]he Framers' principal objectives in rejecting English
theories of unitary sovereignty . . . would have been impededif a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its place
in federal-question cases, and would have been substantiallythwarted if that new immunity had been held untouchable
by any congressional effort to abrogate it." 14 Post, at 157.This sweeping statement ignores the fact that the Nation
survived for nearly two centuries without the question of theexistence of such power ever being presented to this Court.
And Congress itself waited nearly a century before even con-ferring federal-question jurisdiction on the lower federal
courts.15
out its consent. . . . Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity
in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States and the danger
intimated must be merely ideal") (emphasis in the original); 3 Elliot,
supra, at 533 (J. Madison) ("It is not in the power of individuals to call any
state into court. . . . [The Constitution] can have no operation but this: . . .
if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance
of it").

14 This argument wholly disregards other methods of ensuring the

States' compliance with federal law: The Federal Government can bring
suit in federal court against a State, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143
U. S. 621, 644-645 (1892) (finding such power necessary to the "permanence of the Union"); an individual can bring suit against a state officer in
order to ensure that the officer's conduct is in compliance with federal law,
see, e. g., Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908); and this Court is empowered to review a question of federal law arising from a state-court decision
where a State has consented to suit, see, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.
264 (1821).

15 Justice Stevens, in his dissenting opinion, makes two points that

merit separate response. First, he contends that no distinction may be
drawn between state sovereign immunity and the immunity enjoyed by
state and federal officials. But even assuming that the latter has no constitutional foundation, the distinction is clear: The Constitution specifically
recognizes the States as sovereign entities, while government officials
enjoy no such constitutional recognition. Second, Justice Stevens criti517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT
72 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court
In overruling Union Gas today, we reconfirm that thebackground principle of state sovereign immunity embodied

in the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeral as to dissi-pate when the subject of the suit is an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that is under the exclusive controlof the Federal Government. Even when the Constitution
vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a par-ticular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against uncon-senting States.

16 The Eleventh Amendment restricts the

cizes our prior decisions applying the "clear statement rule," suggesting
that they were based upon an understanding that Article I allowed Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity. His criticism, however, ignores the fact that many of those cases arose in the context of a statute
passed under the Fourteenth Amendment, where Congress' authority to
abrogate is undisputed. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332 (1979).
And a more fundamental flaw of the criticism is its failure to recognize
that both the doctrine requiring avoidance of constitutional questions, and
principles of federalism, require us always to apply the clear statement
rule before we consider the constitutional question whether Congress has
the power to abrogate.

16 Justice Stevens understands our opinion to prohibit federal jurisdiction over suits to enforce the bankruptcy, copyright, and antitrust laws
against the States. He notes that federal jurisdiction over those statutory schemes is exclusive, and therefore concludes that there is "no remedy" for state violations of those federal statutes. Post, at 78, n. 1.

That conclusion is exaggerated both in its substance and in its significance. First, Justice Stevens' statement is misleadingly overbroad.
We have already seen that several avenues remain open for ensuring state
compliance with federal law. See n. 14, supra. Most notably, an individual may obtain injunctive relief under Ex parte Young in order to remedy
a state officer's ongoing violation of federal law. See n. 14, supra. Second, contrary to the implication of Justice Stevens' conclusion, it has not
been widely thought that the federal antitrust, bankruptcy, or copyright
statutes abrogated the States' sovereign immunity. This Court never has
awarded relief against a State under any of those statutory schemes; in the
decision of this Court that Justice Stevens cites (and somehow labels
"incompatible" with our decision here), we specifically reserved the question whether the Eleventh Amendment would allow a suit to enforce the
antitrust laws against a State. See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421

judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be usedto circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon

federal jurisdiction. Petitioner's suit against the State ofFlorida must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.

III
Petitioner argues that we may exercise jurisdiction overits suit to enforce $ 2710(d)(3) against the Governor notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment.Petitioner notes that since our decision in

Ex parte Young,209 U. S. 123 (1908), we often have found federal jurisdiction

over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks onlyprospective injunctive relief in order to "end a continuing
violation of federal law." Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S., at68. The situation presented here, however, is sufficiently
different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex parte
Young action so as to preclude the availability of thatdoctrine.

Here, the "continuing violation of federal law" alleged bypetitioner is the Governor's failure to bring the State into
compliance with $ 2710(d)(3). But the duty to negotiateimposed upon the State by that statutory provision does
not stand alone. Rather, as we have seen, supra, at 49-50,Congress passed $ 2710(d)(3) in conjunction with the careU. S. 773, 792, n. 22 (1975). Although the copyright and bankruptcy laws
have existed practically since our Nation's inception, and the antitrust
laws have been in force for over a century, there is no established tradition
in the lower federal courts of allowing enforcement of those federal statutes against the States. Notably, both Court of Appeals decisions cited
by Justice Stevens were issued last year and were based upon Union
Gas. See Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, 59 F. 3d 539 (CA5 1995); Matter
of Merchants Grain, Inc. v. Mahern, 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995). Indeed,
while the Court of Appeals in Chavez allowed the suit against the State
to go forward, it expressly recognized that its holding was unprecedented.
See Chavez, 59 F. 3d, at 546 ("[W]e are aware of no case that specifically
holds that laws passed pursuant to the Copyright Clause can abrogate
State immunity").

Opinion of the Court
fully crafted and intricate remedial scheme set forth in$ 2710(d)(7).

Where Congress has created a remedial scheme for theenforcement of a particular federal right, we have, in suits
against federal officers, refused to supplement that scheme
with one created by the judiciary. Schweiker v. Chilicky,487 U. S. 412, 423 (1988) ("When the design of a Government

program suggests that Congress has provided what it consid-ers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, wehave not created additional . . . remedies"). Here, of course,
the question is not whether a remedy should be created, but
instead is whether the Eleventh Amendment bar should be
lifted, as it was in Ex parte Young, in order to allow a suit
against a state officer. Nevertheless, we think that the
same general principle applies: Therefore, where Congress
has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court
should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and
permitting an action against a state officer based upon Ex
parte Young.

Here, Congress intended $ 2710(d)(3) to be enforced
against the State in an action brought under $ 2710(d)(7); the
intricate procedures set forth in that provision show that
Congress intended therein not only to define, but also to limit
significantly, the duty imposed by $ 2710(d)(3). For example,
where the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate

order and fail to conclude a compact within the 60-day period, the only sanction is that each party then must submit
a proposed compact to a mediator who selects the one which
best embodies the terms of the Act. Finally, if the State
fails to accept the compact selected by the mediator, the only
sanction against it is that the mediator shall notify the Secre517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

contrast with this quite modest set of sanctions, an ac-tion brought against a state official under Ex parte Young
would expose that official to the full remedial powers of afederal court, including, presumably, contempt sanctions. If

$ 2710(d)(3) could be enforced in a suit under Ex parte Young,$ 2710(d)(7) would have been superfluous; it is difficult to see
why an Indian tribe would suffer through the intricatescheme of $ 2710(d)(7) when more complete and more immediate relief would be available under Ex parte Young.17Here, of course, we have found that Congress does not
have authority under the Constitution to make the State su-able in federal court under $ 2710(d)(7). Nevertheless, the
fact that Congress chose to impose upon the State a liability

17 Contrary to the claims of the dissent, we do not hold that Congress
cannot authorize federal jurisdiction under Ex parte Young over a cause
of action with a limited remedial scheme. We find only that Congress did
not intend that result in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Although
one might argue that the text of $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i), taken alone, is broad
enough to encompass both a suit against a State (under an abrogation
theory) and a suit against a state official (under an Ex parte Young theory), subsection (A)(i) of $ 2710(d)(7) cannot be read in isolation from subsections (B)(ii)-(vii), which repeatedly refer exclusively to "the State."
See supra, at 56-57. In this regard, $ 2710(d)(7) stands in contrast to the
statutes cited by the dissent as examples where lower courts have found
that Congress implicitly authorized suit under Ex parte Young. Compare
28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e) (federal court authorized to issue an "order directed
to an appropriate State official"); 42 U. S. C. $ 11001 (1988 ed.) (requiring
"the Governor" of a State to perform certain actions and holding "the
Governor" responsible for nonperformance); 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a) (authorizing a suit against "any person" who is alleged to be in violation of relevant
water pollution laws). Similarly the duty imposed by the Act--to "negotiate . . . in good faith to enter into" a compact with another sovereign--
stands distinct in that it is not of the sort likely to be performed by an
individual state executive officer or even a group of officers. Cf. State ex
rel. Stephan v. Finney, 836 P. 2d 1169, 251 Kan. 559 (1992) (Governor of
Kansas may negotiate but may not enter into compact without grant of
power from legislature).

that is significantly more limited than would be the liabilityimposed upon the state officer under Ex parte Young

strongly indicates that Congress had no wish to create thelatter under $ 2710(d)(3). Nor are we free to rewrite the
statutory scheme in order to approximate what we thinkCongress might have wanted had it known that $ 2710(d)(7)
was beyond its authority. If that effort is to be made, itshould be made by Congress, and not by the federal courts.
We hold that Ex parte Young is inapplicable to petitioner'ssuit against the Governor of Florida, and therefore that suit
is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and must be dis-missed for a lack of jurisdiction.

IV
The Eleventh Amendment prohibits Congress from mak-ing the State of Florida capable of being sued in federal

court. The narrow exception to the Eleventh Amendmentprovided by the Ex parte Young doctrine cannot be used
to enforce $ 2710(d)(3) because Congress enacted a remedialscheme, $ 2710(d)(7), specifically designed for the enforcement of that right. The Eleventh Circuit's dismissal ofpetitioner's suit is hereby affirmed.

It is so ordered.

This case is about power--the power of the Congress of
the United States to create a private federal cause of actionagainst a State, or its Governor, for the violation of a federal

right. In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), the entireCourt--including Justice Iredell whose dissent provided the
blueprint for the Eleventh Amendment--assumed that Con-gress had such power. In

again assumed that Congress had such power. In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), and Pennsylvania v.
Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (Stevens, J., concur-ring), the Court squarely held that Congress has such power.

In a series of cases beginning with Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238-239 (1985), the Courtformulated a special "clear statement rule" to determine

whether specific Acts of Congress contained an effective exercise of that power. Nevertheless, in a sharp break with
the past, today the Court holds that with the narrow and
illogical exception of statutes enacted pursuant to the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress
has no such power.

The importance of the majority's decision to overrule the
Court's holding in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. cannot be
overstated. The majority's opinion does not simply preclude Congress from establishing the rather curious statutory scheme under which Indian tribes may seek the aid of
a federal court to secure a State's good-faith negotiations
over gaming regulations. Rather, it prevents Congress
from providing a federal forum for a broad range of actions
against States, from those sounding in copyright and patent
law, to those concerning bankruptcy, environmental law, and
the regulation of our vast national economy.1

1 See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989) (holding
that a federal court may order a State to pay cleanup costs pursuant to
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980); In re Merchants Grain, Inc., 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995) (holding
that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a bankruptcy court from issuing a money judgment against a State under the Bankruptcy Code); Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, 59 F. 3d 539 (CA5 1995) (holding that a state
university could be sued in federal court for infringing an author's copyright). The conclusion that suits against States may not be brought in
federal court is also incompatible with our cases concluding that state entities may be sued for antitrust violations. See, e. g., Goldfarb v. Virginia
State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 791-792 (1975).

As federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under
these federal laws, the majority's conclusion that the Eleventh Amend517us1$37I 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
There may be room for debate over whether, in light ofthe Eleventh Amendment, Congress has the power to ensure

that such a cause of action may be enforced in federal courtby a citizen of another State or a foreign citizen. There can
be no serious debate, however, over whether Congress hasthe power to ensure that such a cause of action may be
brought by a citizen of the State being sued. Congress' au-thority in that regard is clear.

As Justice Souter has convincingly demonstrated, theCourt's contrary conclusion is profoundly misguided. Despite the thoroughness of his analysis, supported by soundreason, history, precedent, and strikingly uniform scholarly
commentary, the shocking character of the majority's affrontto a coequal branch of our Government merits additional
comment. I

For the purpose of deciding this case, I can readily assumethat Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.,
at 429-450, and the Court's opinion in Hans v. Louisiana,134 U. S. 1 (1890), correctly stated the law that should govern our decision today. As I shall explain, both of thoseopinions relied on an interpretation of an Act of Congress
rather than a want of congressional power to authorize a suitagainst the State.

In concluding that the federal courts could not entertainChisholm's action against the State of Georgia, Justice Iredell relied on the text of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not theState's assertion that Article III did not extend the judicial
power to suits against unconsenting States. Justice Iredellargued that, under Article III, federal courts possessed only

ment shields States from being sued under them in federal court suggests
that persons harmed by state violations of federal copyright, bankruptcy,
and antitrust laws have no remedy. See Harris & Kenny, Eleventh
Amendment Jurisprudence After Atascadero: The Coming Clash With Antitrust, Copyright, and Other Causes of Action Over Which the Federal
Courts Have Exclusive Jurisdiction, 37 Emory L. J. 645 (1988).

such jurisdiction as Congress had provided, and that the Ju-diciary Act expressly limited federal-court jurisdiction to

that which could be exercised in accordance with " `the prin-ciples and usages of law.' " Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at
434 (quoting $ 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789). He reasonedthat the inclusion of this phrase constituted a command
to the federal courts to construe their jurisdiction in lightof the prevailing common law, a background legal regime
that he believed incorporated the doctrine of sovereign im-munity.

Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 434-436 (dissent-ing opinion).

2

Because Justice Iredell believed that the expansive textof Article III did not prevent Congress from imposing this

common-law limitation on federal-court jurisdiction, he con-cluded that judges had no authority to entertain a suit
against an unconsenting State.3 At the same time, althoughhe acknowledged that the Constitution might allow Congress
to extend federal-court jurisdiction to such an action, he con-cluded that the terms of the Judiciary Act of 1789 plainly had
not done so.

"[Congress'] direction, I apprehend, we cannot super-sede, because it may appear to us not sufficiently extensive. If it be not, we must wait till other remedies areprovided by the same authority. From this it is plain
that the Legislature did not chuse to leave to our own
2 Because Justice Iredell read the Judiciary Act of 1789 to have incorporated the common law, he did not even conclude that Congress would have
to make a clear statement in order to override the common law's recognition of sovereign immunity.

3 Actually, he limited his conclusion to the narrower question whether

an action of assumpsit would lie against a State, which he distinguished
from the more general question whether a State can ever be sued. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 430 (1793). He did so because he recognized
"that in England, certain judicial proceedings not inconsistent with the
sovereignty, may take place against the Crown, but that an action of assumpsit will not lie," and because he had "often found a great deal of
confusion to arise from taking too large a view at once." Ibid.

discretion the path to justice, but has prescribed one ofits own. In doing so, it has, I think, wisely, referred us

to principles and usages of law already well known, andby their precision calculated to guard against that innovating spirit of Courts of Justice, which the Attorney-General in another case reprobated with so much
warmth, and with whose sentiments in that particular,I most cordially join."

Id., at 434 (emphasis added).

For Justice Iredell then, it was enough to assume that Ar-ticle III

permitted Congress to impose sovereign immunityas a jurisdictional limitation; he did not proceed to resolve

the further question whether the Constitution went so far asto prevent Congress from withdrawing a State's immunity.

4

Thus, it would be ironic to construe the Chisholm dissent asprecedent for the conclusion that Article III limits Congress'

power to determine the scope of a State's sovereign immu-nity in federal court.

The precise holding in Chisholm is difficult to state be-cause each of the Justices in the majority wrote his own
opinion. They seem to have held, however, not that theJudiciary Act of 1789 precluded the defense of sovereign
immunity, but that Article III of the Constitution itselfrequired the Supreme Court to entertain original actions

4 In two sentences at the end of his lengthy opinion, Justice Iredell
stated that his then-present view was that the Constitution would not
permit a "compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money." Id.,
at 449. In light of Justice Iredell's express statement that the only question before the Court was the propriety of an individual's action for assumpsit against a State, an action which, of course, results in a money
judgment, see n. 2, supra, this dicta should not be understood to state
the general view that the Constitution bars all suits against unconsenting
States. Moreover, even as to the limited question whether the Constitution permits actions for money judgments, Justice Iredell took pains to
reserve ultimate judgment. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 449. Thus,
nothing in Justice Iredell's two sentences of dicta provides a basis for
concluding that Congress lacks the power to authorize the suit for the
nonmonetary relief at issue here.

against unconsenting States.5 I agree with Justice Iredell
that such a construction of Article III is incorrect; that Article should not then have been construed, and should not now
be construed, to prevent Congress from granting States a
sovereign immunity defense in such cases.6 That reading of
Article III, however, explains why the majority's holding in
Chisholm could not have been reversed by a simple statutory amendment adopting Justice Iredell's interpretation of
the Judiciary Act of 1789. There is a special irony in the
fact that the error committed by the Chisholm majority was
its decision that this Court, rather than Congress, should
define the scope of the sovereign immunity defense. That,
of course, is precisely the same error the Court commits
today.

In light of the nature of the disagreement between Justice
Iredell and his colleagues, Chisholm's holding could have
been overturned by simply amending the Constitution to restore to Congress the authority to recognize the doctrine.
As it was, the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment would
seem to go further and to limit the judicial power itself in a
certain class of cases. In doing so, however, the Amend5 In this respect, Chisholm v. Georgia should be understood to be of a
piece with the debate over judicial power famously joined in Martin v.
Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 337 (1816). There, too, the argument centered on whether Congress had the power to limit the seemingly expansive jurisdictional grant that Article III had conferred, not on whether
Article III itself provided the relevant limitation.

6 The contention that Article III withdrew Georgia's sovereign immunity had special force precisely because Chisholm involved an action premised on the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. While Article III
leaves it to Congress to establish the lower federal courts, and to make
exceptions to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, it specifically
mandates that there be a Supreme Court and that it shall be vested with
original jurisdiction over those actions in which "a State shall be Party."
Art. III, $ 2. In light of that language, the Chisholm majority's conclusion
that the Supreme Court had a constitutional obligation to take jurisdiction
of all suits against States was not implausible.

ment's quite explicit text establishes only a partial bar toa federal court's power to entertain a suit against a State.

7

Justice Brennan has persuasively explained that the Elev-enth Amendment's jurisdictional restriction is best understood to apply only to suits premised on diversity jurisdic-tion, see

Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at247 (dissenting opinion), and

Justice Scalia has agreed thatthe plain text of the Amendment cannot be read to apply to

federal-question cases. See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas,491 U. S., at 31 (dissenting opinion).

8 Whatever the precise

dimensions of the Amendment, its express terms plainly do
not apply to all suits brought against unconsenting States.9

7 It should be remembered that at the time of Chisholm, there was a
general fear of what Justice Iredell termed the "innovating spirit" of the
Federal Judiciary. See, e. g., 3 A. Beveridge, The Life of John Marshall
19-30 (1919) (discussing the consternation that the federal courts' creation
of common-law felonies engendered). Thus, there is good reason to believe that the reaction to Chisholm reflected the popular hostility to
the Federal Judiciary more than any desire to restrain the National
Legislature.

8 Of course, even if the Eleventh Amendment applies to federal-question

cases brought by a citizen of another State, its express terms pose no bar
to a federal court assuming jurisdiction in a federal-question case brought
by an in-state plaintiff pursuant to Congress' express authorization. As
that is precisely the posture of the suit before us, and as it was also precisely the posture of the suit at issue in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, there
is no need to decide here whether Congress would be barred from authorizing out-of-state plaintiffs to enforce federal rights against States in federal court. In fact, Justice Brennan left open that question in his dissent
in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 288, n. 41 (1985).
"When the Court is prepared to embark on a defensible interpretation of
the Eleventh Amendment consistent with its history and purposes, the
question whether the Amendment bars federal-question or admiralty suits
by a noncitizen or alien against a State would be open." Ibid.

9 Under the "plain text" of the Eleventh Amendment, I note that there

would appear to be no more basis for the conclusion that States may
consent to federal-court jurisdiction in actions brought by out-of-state or
foreign citizens than there would be for the view that States should be
permitted to consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in a case that
poses no federal question. See, e. g., Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v.

The question thus becomes whether the relatively modest
jurisdictional bar that the Eleventh Amendment imposes
should be understood to reveal that a more general jurisdictional bar implicitly inheres in Article III.

The language of Article III certainly gives no indication
that such an implicit bar exists. That provision's text specifically provides for federal-court jurisdiction over all cases
arising under federal law. Moreover, as I have explained,
Justice Iredell's dissent argued that it was the Judiciary Act
of 1789, not Article III, that prevented the federal courts
from entertaining Chisholm's diversity action against Georgia. Therefore, Justice Iredell's analysis at least suggests
that it was by no means a fixed view at the time of the founding that Article III prevented Congress from rendering
States suable in federal court by their own citizens. In sum,
little more than speculation justifies the conclusion that the
Eleventh Amendment's express but partial limitation on the
scope of Article III reveals that an implicit but more general
one was already in place.

II

The majority appears to acknowledge that one cannot deduce from either the text of Article III or the plain terms of

Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 377, n. 21 (1978); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398

v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934); Jackson v. Ashton, 8 Pet. 148, 149

apply only to unconsenting States. See, e. g., Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S.
436, 447 (1883). In so doing, we of course left it for Congress to determine
whether federal courts should entertain any claim against a State in federal court. A departure from the text to expand the class of plaintiffs to
whom the Eleventh Amendment's bar applies would, however, limit Congress' authority to exercise its considered judgment as to the propriety of
federal-court jurisdiction. The absence of a textual warrant for imposing
such a broad limitation on the legislative branch counsels against this
Court extratextually imposing one.

the Eleventh Amendment that the judicial power does not
extend to a congressionally created cause of action against a
State brought by one of that State's citizens. Nevertheless,
the majority asserts that precedent compels that same conclusion. I disagree. The majority relies first on our decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), which involved
a suit by a citizen of Louisiana against that State for a
claimed violation of the Contracts Clause. The majority
suggests that by dismissing the suit, Hans effectively held
that federal courts have no power to hear federal-question
suits brought by same-state plaintiffs.

Hans does not hold, however, that the Eleventh Amendment, or any other constitutional provision, precludes federal
courts from entertaining actions brought by citizens against
their own States in the face of contrary congressional direction. As I have explained before, see Pennsylvania v.
Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 25-26 (Stevens, J., concurring),
and as Justice Souter effectively demonstrates, Hans instead reflects, at the most, this Court's conclusion that, as a
matter of federal common law, federal courts should decline
to entertain suits against unconsenting States. Because
Hans did not announce a constitutionally mandated jurisdictional bar, one need not overrule Hans, or even question its
reasoning, in order to conclude that Congress may direct the
federal courts to reject sovereign immunity in those suits
not mentioned by the Eleventh Amendment. Instead, one
need only follow it.

Justice Bradley's somewhat cryptic opinion for the Court
in Hans relied expressly on the reasoning of Justice Iredell's
dissent in Chisholm, which, of course, was premised on the
view that the doctrine of state sovereign immunity was a
common-law rule that Congress had directed federal courts
to respect, not a constitutional immunity that Congress was
powerless to displace. For that reason, Justice Bradley explained that the State's immunity from suit by one of its own

citizens was based not on a constitutional rule but rather onthe fact that Congress had not, by legislation, attempted to

overcome the common-law presumption of sovereign immu-nity. His analysis so clearly supports the position rejected
by the majority today that it is worth quoting at length.

"But besides the presumption that no anomalous andunheard of proceedings or suits were intended to be

raised up by the Constitution--anomalous and unheardof when the Constitution was adopted--an additional
reason why the jurisdiction claimed for the CircuitCourt does not exist, is the language of the act of Congress by which its jurisdiction is conferred. The wordsare these: `The circuit courts of the United States shall
have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts ofthe several States, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, . . . arising under the Constitutionor laws of the United States, or treaties,' etc.--`Concurrent with the courts of the several States.' Does notthis qualification show that Congress, in legislating to
carry the Constitution into effect, did not intend to in-vest its courts with any new and strange jurisdictions?
The state courts have no power to entertain suits byindividuals against a State without its consent. Then
how does the Circuit Court, having only concurrent ju-risdiction, acquire any such power? It is true that the
same qualification existed in the judiciary act of 1789,which was before the court in

Chisholm v. Georgia, and
the majority of the court did not think that it was suffi-cient to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Justice Iredell thought differently. In view of the manner
in which that decision was received by the country, theadoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the light of history and the reason of the thing, we think we are atliberty to prefer Justice Iredell's views in this regard."

As this passage demonstrates, Hans itself looked to seewhether Congress had displaced the presumption that sovereign immunity obtains. Although the opinion did go togreat lengths to establish the quite uncontroversial historical
proposition that unconsenting States generally were not subject to suit, that entire discussion preceded the opinion'sstatutory analysis. See

id., at 10-18. Thus, the opinion's
thorough historical investigation served only to establish apresumption against jurisdiction that Congress must overcome, not an inviolable jurisdictional restriction that inheresin the Constitution itself.

Indeed, the very fact that the Court characterized the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a "presumption" confirms its
assumption that it could be displaced. The Hans Court's
inquiry into congressional intent would have been wholly inappropriate if it had believed that the doctrine of sovereign
immunity was a constitutionally inviolable jurisdictional
limitation. Thus, Hans provides no basis for the majority's
conclusion that Congress is powerless to make States suable
in cases not mentioned by the text of the Eleventh Amendment. Instead, Hans provides affirmative support for the
view that Congress may create federal-court jurisdiction
over private causes of action against unconsenting States
brought by their own citizens.

It is true that the underlying jurisdictional statute involved in this case, 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, does not itself purport
to direct federal courts to ignore a State's sovereign immunity any more than did the underlying jurisdictional statute
discussed in Hans, the Judiciary Act of 1875. However, unlike in Hans, in this case Congress has, by virtue of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, affirmatively manifested its intention to "invest its courts with" jurisdiction beyond the
limits set forth in the general jurisdictional statute. 134
U. S., at 18. By contrast, because Hans involved only an
implied cause of action based directly on the Constitution,
the Judiciary Act of 1875 constituted the sole indication as

to whether Congress intended federal-court jurisdiction to
extend to a suit against an unconsenting State.10

Given the nature of the cause of action involved in Hans,
as well as the terms of the underlying jurisdictional statute,
the Court's decision to apply the common-law doctrine of
sovereign immunity in that case clearly should not control
the outcome here. The reasons that may support a federal
court's hesitancy to construe a judicially crafted constitutional remedy narrowly out of respect for a State's sovereignty do not bear on whether Congress may preclude a
State's invocation of such a defense when it expressly establishes a federal remedy for the violation of a federal right.

No one has ever suggested that Congress would be powerless to displace the other common-law immunity doctrines
that this Court has recognized as appropriate defenses to
certain federal claims such as the judicially fashioned remedy in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403

10 In his dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 36-37,
Justice Scalia contended that the existence of the Judiciary Act of 1875
at the time of Hans requires one to accept the "gossamer distinction between cases in which Congress has assertedly sought to eliminate state
sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers to create and organize courts,
and cases in which it has assertedly sought to do so pursuant to some of
its other powers," in order to conclude that, in spite of Hans, Congress
may authorize federal courts to hear a suit against an unconsenting State.
I rely on no such "gossamer distinction" here.

Congress has the authority to withdraw sovereign immunity in cases
not covered by the Eleventh Amendment under all of its various powers.
Nothing in Hans is to the contrary. As the passage quoted above demonstrates, Hans merely concluded that Congress, in enacting the Judiciary
Act of 1875, did not manifest a desire to withdraw state sovereign immunity with sufficient clarity to overcome the countervailing presumption.
Therefore, I rely only on the distinction between a statute that clearly
directs federal courts to entertain suits against States, such as the one
before us here, and a statute that does not, such as the Judiciary Act of
1875. In light of our repeated application of a clear-statement rule in
Eleventh Amendment cases, from Hans onward, I would be surprised to
learn that such a distinction is too thin to be acceptable.

284 (1980). There is no reason why Congress' undoubted
power to displace those common-law immunities should be
either greater or lesser than its power to displace the
common-law sovereign immunity defense.

Some of our precedents do state that the sovereign immunity doctrine rests on fundamental constitutional "postulates" and partakes of jurisdictional aspects rooted in Article
III. See ante, at 67-70. Most notably, that reasoning
underlies this Court's holding in Principality of Monaco v.
Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934).

Monaco is a most inapt precedent for the majority's holding today. That case barred a foreign sovereign from suing
a State in an equitable state-law action to recover payments
due on state bonds. It did not, however, involve a claim
based on federal law. Instead, the case concerned a purely
state-law question to which the State had interposed a federal defense. Id., at 317. Thus, Monaco reveals little about
the power of Congress to create a private federal cause of
action to remedy a State's violation of federal law.

Moreover, although Monaco attributes a quasiconstitutional status to sovereign immunity, even in cases
not covered by the Eleventh Amendment's plain text, that
characterization does not constitute precedent for the proposition that Congress is powerless to displace a State's immu517us1$37I 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

nity. Our abstention doctrines have roots in both the TenthAmendment and Article III, and thus may be said to rest

on constitutional "postulates" or to partake of jurisdictionalaspects. Yet it has not been thought that the Constitution
would prohibit Congress from barring federal courts from
abstaining. The majority offers no reason for making thefederal common-law rule of sovereign immunity less susceptible to congressional displacement than any other quasi-jurisdictional common-law rule.

In this regard, I note that Monaco itself analogized sover-eign immunity to the prudential doctrine that "controversies" identified in Article III must be "justiciable" in order tobe heard by federal courts.

Id., at 329. The justiciability
doctrine is a prudential rather than a jurisdictional one, and
thus Congress' clearly expressed intention to create federaljurisdiction over a particular Article III controversy necessarily strips federal courts of the authority to decline ju-risdiction on justiciability grounds. See

Allen v. Wright,
468 U. S. 737, 791 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Flastv.

Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 100-101 (1968). For that reason,
Monaco, by its own terms, fails to resolve the question be-fore us.

11

More generally, it is quite startling to learn that the reasoning of Hans and Monaco (even assuming that it did not
undermine the majority's view) should have a stare decisiseffect on the question whether Congress possesses the authority to provide a federal forum for the vindication of a
federal right by a citizen against its own State. In light of
the Court's development of a "clear-statement" line of juris11 Indeed, to the extent the reasoning of Monaco was premised on the
ground that a contrary ruling might permit foreign governments and
States indirectly to frustrate Congress' treaty power, 292 U. S., at 331, the
opinion suggests that its outcome would have been quite different had
Congress expressly authorized suits by foreign governments against individual States as part of its administration of foreign policy.

prudence, see, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,
473 U. S., at 238-239; Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), I would have thought
that Hans and Monaco had at least left open the question
whether Congress could permit the suit we consider here.
Our clear-statement cases would have been all but unintelligible if Hans and Monaco had already established that Congress lacked the constitutional power to make States suable
in federal court by individuals no matter how clear its intention to do so.12

Finally, the particular nature of the federal question involved in Hans renders the majority's reliance upon its rule
even less defensible. Hans deduced its rebuttable presumption in favor of sovereign immunity largely on the basis of
its extensive analysis of cases holding that the sovereign
could not be forced to make good on its debts via a private
suit. See Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711 (1883); Hagood
v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52 (1886); In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443
(1887). Because Hans, like these other cases, involved a suit
that attempted to make a State honor its debt, its holding
need not be read to stand even for the relatively limited
proposition that there is a presumption in favor of sovereign
immunity in all federal-question cases.13

12 Moreover, they would have most unnecessarily burdened Congress.
For example, after deciding that Congress had not made sufficiently explicit its intention to withdraw the state sovereign immunity defense in
certain bankruptcy actions, see Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income
Maintenance, 392 U. S. 96 (1989), Congress understandably concluded that
it could correct the confusion by amending the relevant statute to make
its intentions to override such a defense unmistakably clear. See In re
Merchants Grain, Inc., 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995). Congress will no doubt
be surprised to learn that its exercise in legislative clarification, which
it undertook for our benefit, was for naught because the Constitution
makes it so.

13 Significantly, Chief Justice Marshall understood the Eleventh Amendment's bar to have been designed primarily to protect States from being
sued for their debts. See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406 (1821).

In Hans, the plaintiff asserted a Contracts Clause claimagainst his State and thus asserted a federal right. To show

that Louisiana had impaired its federal obligation, however,Hans first had to demonstrate that the State had entered
into an enforceable contract as a matter of state law. ThatHans chose to bring his claim in federal court as a Contract
Clause action could not change the fact that he was, at bot-tom, seeking to enforce a contract with the State. See
Burnham, Taming the Eleventh Amendment Without Over-ruling

Hans v. Louisiana, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 931(1990).

Because Hans' claimed federal right did not arise inde-pendently of state law, sovereign immunity was relevant to
the threshold state-law question of whether a valid contractexisted.

14 Hans expressly pointed out, however, that an individual who could show that he had an enforceable contractunder state law would not be barred from bringing suit in

federal court to prevent the State from impairing it.

"To avoid misapprehension it may be proper to addthat, although the obligations of a State rest for their

performance upon its honor and good faith, and cannotbe made the subject of judicial cognizance unless the
State consents to be sued, or comes itself into court; yetwhere property or rights are enjoyed under a grant or
contract made by a State, they cannot wantonly be in-vaded. Whilst the State cannot be compelled by suit to
perform its contracts, any attempt on its part to violateproperty or rights acquired under its contracts, may be

14 Significantly, many of the cases decided after Hans in which this Court
has recognized state sovereign immunity involved claims premised on the
breach of rights that were rooted in state law. See Ford Motor Co. v.
Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945); Great Northern Life
Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900).
In such cases, the Court's application of the state-law immunity appears
simply to foreshadow (or follow) the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64 (1938), not to demark the limits of Article III.

judicially resisted; and any law impairing the obligation
of contracts under which such property or rights are
held is void and powerless to affect their enjoyment."
Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S., at 20-21.

That conclusion casts doubt on the absolutist view that
Hans definitively establishes that Article III prohibits federal courts from entertaining federal-question suits brought
against States by their own citizens. At the very least,
Hans suggests that such suits may be brought to enjoin
States from impairing existing contractual obligations.

The view that the rule of Hans is more substantive than
jurisdictional comports with Hamilton's famous discussion of
sovereign immunity in The Federalist Papers. Hamilton offered his view that the federal judicial power would not extend to suits against unconsenting States only in the context
of his contention that no contract with a State could be enforceable against the State's desire. He did not argue that
a State's immunity from suit in federal court would be
absolute.

"[T]here is no color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of [the plan of convention],
be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in
their own way, free from every constraint but that which
flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts
between a nation and individuals are only binding on the
conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to
a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will." The Federalist No. 81,
p. 488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

Here, of course, no question of a State's contractual obligations is presented. The Seminole Tribe's only claim is that
the State of Florida has failed to fulfill a duty to negotiate
that federal statutory law alone imposes. Neither the Fed517us1$37I 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

eralist Papers, nor Hans, provides support for the view thatsuch a claim may not be heard in federal court.

III
In reaching my conclusion that the Constitution does notprevent Congress from making the State of Florida suable

in federal court for violating one of its statutes, I emphasizethat I agree with the majority that in all cases to which the
judicial power does not extend--either because they are notwithin any category defined in Article III or because they
are within the category withdrawn from Article III by theEleventh Amendment--Congress lacks the power to confer
jurisdiction on the federal courts. As I have previously in-sisted: "A statute cannot amend the Constitution."

Penn-sylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 24.

It was, therefore, misleading for the Court in Fitzpatrickv.

Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), to imply that $ 5 of the Four-teenth Amendment authorized Congress to confer jurisdiction over cases that had been withdrawn from Article IIIby the Eleventh Amendment. Because that action had been
brought by Connecticut citizens against officials of the Stateof Connecticut, jurisdiction was not precluded by the Eleventh Amendment. As Justice Brennan pointed out in hisconcurrence, the congressional authority to enact the provisions at issue in the case was found in the Commerce Clauseand provided a sufficient basis for refusing to allow the State
to "avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient doctrineof sovereign immunity."

Id., at 457 (opinion concurring injudgment).

In confronting the question whether a federal grant of ju-risdiction is within the scope of Article III, as limited by the
Eleventh Amendment, I see no reason to distinguish among
statutes enacted pursuant to the power granted to Congressto regulate commerce among the several States, and with

the Indian tribes, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, the power to establish

uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 4,
the power to promote the progress of science and the arts
by granting exclusive rights to authors and inventors, Art.
I, $ 8, cl. 8, the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, $ 5, or indeed any other provision of the
Constitution. There is no language anywhere in the constitutional text that authorizes Congress to expand the borders
of Article III jurisdiction or to limit the coverage of the
Eleventh Amendment.

The Court's holdings in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445
(1976), and Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1
(1989), do unquestionably establish, however, that Congress
has the power to deny the States and their officials the right
to rely on the nonconstitutional defense of sovereign immunity in an action brought by one of their own citizens. As
the opinions in the latter case demonstrate, there can be legitimate disagreement about whether Congress intended a
particular statute to authorize litigation against a State.
Nevertheless, the Court there squarely held that the Commerce Clause was an adequate source of authority for such
a private remedy. In a rather novel rejection of the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court today demeans that holding
by repeatedly describing it as a "plurality decision" because
Justice White did not deem it necessary to set forth the reasons for his vote. As Justice Souter's opinion today demonstrates, the arguments in support of Justice White's position are so patent and so powerful that his actual vote should
be accorded full respect. Indeed, far more significant than
the "plurality" character of the three opinions supporting the
holding in Union Gas is the fact that the issue confronted
today has been squarely addressed by a total of 13 Justices,
8 of whom cast their votes with the so-called "plurality." 15

15 It is significant that Justice Souter's opinion makes it perfectly
clear that Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and he did not consider
it necessary to rely on the holding in Union Gas to support their conclu517us1$37I 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

The fundamental error that continues to lead the Courtastray is its failure to acknowledge that its modern embodiment of the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity "has ab-solutely nothing to do with the limit on judicial power contained in the Eleventh Amendment." Id., at 25 (Stevens,
J., concurring). It rests rather on concerns of federalismand comity that merit respect but are nevertheless, in cases

such as the one before us, subordinate to the plenary powerof Congress.

IV
As I noted above, for the purpose of deciding this case, it
is not necessary to question the wisdom of the Court's deci-sion in

Hans v. Louisiana. Given the absence of precedent
for the Court's dramatic application of the sovereign immu-nity doctrine today, it is nevertheless appropriate to identify

the questionable heritage of the doctrine and to suggest thatthere are valid reasons for limiting, or even rejecting that
doctrine altogether, rather than expanding it.

Except insofar as it has been incorporated into the text ofthe Eleventh Amendment, the doctrine is entirely the product of judge-made law. Three features of its English ances-try make it particularly unsuitable for incorporation into the
law of this democratic Nation.First, the assumption that it could be supported by a belief
that "the King can do no wrong" has always been absurd;the bloody path trod by English monarchs both before and
after they reached the throne demonstrated the fictional
character of any such assumption. Even if the fiction hadbeen acceptable in Britain, the recitation in the Declaration

of Independence of the wrongs committed by George IIImade that proposition unacceptable on this side of the
Atlantic.
sion. I find today's decision particularly unfortunate because of its failure
to advance an acceptable reason for refusing to adhere to a precedent upon
which the Congress, as well as the courts, should be entitled to rely.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Second, centuries ago the belief that the monarch served
by divine right made it appropriate to assume that redress
for wrongs committed by the sovereign should be the exclusive province of still higher authority.16 While such a justification for a rule that immunized the sovereign from suit in
a secular tribunal might have been acceptable in a jurisdiction where a particular faith is endorsed by the government,
it should give rise to skepticism concerning the legitimacy
of comparable rules in a society where a constitutional wall
separates the State from the Church.

Third, in a society where noble birth can justify preferential treatment, it might have been unseemly to allow a
commoner to hale the monarch into court. Justice Wilson
explained how foreign such a justification is to this Nation's
principles. See Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 455. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall early on laid to rest the view
that the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment was to protect
a State's dignity. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406-407
(1821). Its purpose, he explained, was far more practical.

"That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty
of a State from the degradation supposed to attend a
compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the nation,
may be inferred from the terms of the amendment. . . .
We must ascribe the amendment, then, to some other
cause than the dignity of a State. There is no difficulty
in finding this cause. Those who were inhibited from
commencing a suit against a State, or from prosecuting
one which might be commenced before the adoption of
the amendment, were persons who might probably be
its creditors. There was not much reason to fear that
foreign or sister States would be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason to retain the juris16 See Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121, 1124-

Nevertheless, this Court later put forth the interest inpreventing "indignity" as the "very object and purpose of
the [Eleventh] Amendment." In re Ayers, 123 U. S., at 505.That, of course, is an "embarrassingly insufficient" rationale
for the rule. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Author-ity v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 151 (1993) (

Stevens, J., dissenting).Moreover, I find unsatisfying Justice Holmes' explanation

that "[a] sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of anyformal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and
practical ground that there can be no legal right as againstthe authority that makes the law on which the right depends." Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353(1907). As I have explained before, Justice Holmes' justification fails in at least two respects.

"First, it is nothing more than a restatement of the obvi-ous proposition that a citizen may not sue the sovereign

unless the sovereign has violated the citizen's legalrights. It cannot explain application of the immunity
defense in cases like Chisholm, in which it is assumedthat the plaintiff 's rights have in fact been violated--
and those cases are, of course, the only ones in whichthe immunity defense is needed. Second, Holmes's
statement does not purport to explain why a generalgrant of jurisdiction to federal courts should not be
treated as an adequate expression of the sovereign'sconsent to suits against itself as well as to suits against

17 Interestingly, this passage demonstrates that the Court's application
of a common-law sovereign immunity defense in Principality of Monaco
v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), was quite probably justified. There a
foreign state sued a State as a substantial creditor, and thus implicated
the very purpose of the Eleventh Amendment.

ordinary litigants." Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121, 1126 (1993).

In sum, as far as its common-law ancestry is concerned,there is no better reason for the rule of sovereign immunity
"than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV."Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469
(1897). That "reason" for the perpetuation of this ancientdoctrine certainly cannot justify the majority's expansion of
it.In this country the sovereignty of the individual States is
subordinate both to the citizenry of each State and to thesupreme law of the federal sovereign. For that reason, Justice Holmes' explanation for a rule that allows a State toavoid suit in its own courts does not even speak to the question whether Congress should be able to authorize a federalcourt to provide a private remedy for a State's violation of
federal law. In my view, neither the majority's opiniontoday, nor any earlier opinion by any Member of the Court,
has identified any acceptable reason for concluding that theabsence of a State's consent to be sued in federal court
should affect the power of Congress to authorize federalcourts to remedy violations of federal law by States or their
officials in actions not covered by the Eleventh Amendment'sexplicit text.

18

While I am persuaded that there is no justification for per-manently enshrining the judge-made law of sovereign immunity, I recognize that federalism concerns--and even the in18 Because Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), was the first case in
which the Court held that a State could not be sued in federal court by
one of its citizens, this comment is of interest:

"It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the
reason or the expediency of the rule which exempts a sovereign State
from prosecution in a court of justice at the suit of individuals. This is
fully discussed by writers on public law. It is enough for us to declare its
existence." Id., at 21.

So it is today.

terest in protecting the solvency of the States that was atwork in Chisholm and Hans--may well justify a grant of

immunity from federal litigation in certain classes of cases.Such a grant, however, should be the product of a reasoned
decision by the policymaking branch of our Government.For this Court to conclude that timeworn shibboleths iterated and reiterated by judges should take precedence overthe deliberations of the Congress of the United States is
simply irresponsible. V

Fortunately, and somewhat fortuitously, a jurisdictionalproblem that is unmentioned by the Court may deprive its
opinion of precedential significance. The Indian GamingRegulatory Act establishes a unique set of procedures for
resolving the dispute between the Tribe and the State. Ifeach adversary adamantly adheres to its understanding of
the law, if the District Court determines that the State's in-flexibility constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith, and
if the State thereafter continues to insist that it is actingwithin its rights, the maximum sanction that the Court can

does not tell us whether it agrees or disagrees with thatdisposition.) In my judgment, it is extremely doubtful that
the obviously dispensable involvement of the judiciary in theintermediate stages of a procedure that begins and ends in
the Executive Branch is a proper exercise of judicial power.See Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. Appx. 697, 702-703

soning in Justice Souter's far wiser and far more scholarlyopinion will surely be the law one day.

For these reasons, as well as those set forth in Justice
Souter's opinion, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In holding the State of Florida immune to suit under the
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the Court today holds for
the first time since the founding of the Republic that Congress has no authority to subject a State to the jurisdiction
of a federal court at the behest of an individual asserting
a federal right. Although the Court invokes the Eleventh
Amendment as authority for this proposition, the only sense
in which that amendment might be claimed as pertinent here
was tolerantly phrased by Justice Stevens in his concurring opinion in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1,
23 (1989). There, he explained how it has come about that
we have two Eleventh Amendments, the one ratified in 1795,
the other (so-called) invented by the Court nearly a century
later in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890). Justice
Stevens saw in that second Eleventh Amendment no bar to
the exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce
Clause in providing for suits on a federal question by individuals against a State, and I can only say that after my own
canvass of the matter I believe he was entirely correct in
that view, for reasons given below. His position, of course,
was also the holding in Union Gas, which the Court now
overrules and repudiates.

The fault I find with the majority today is not in its decision to reexamine Union Gas, for the Court in that case
produced no majority for a single rationale supporting congressional authority. Instead, I part company from the
Court because I am convinced that its decision is fundamentally mistaken, and for that reason I respectfully dissent.

It is useful to separate three questions: (1) whether the
States enjoyed sovereign immunity if sued in their owncourts in the period prior to ratification of the National Constitution; (2) if so, whether after ratification the States wereentitled to claim some such immunity when sued in a federal
court exercising jurisdiction either because the suit was be-tween a State and a nonstate litigant who was not its citizen,
or because the issue in the case raised a federal question;and (3) whether any state sovereign immunity recognized in
federal court may be abrogated by Congress.

The answer to the first question is not clear, although someof the Framers assumed that States did enjoy immunity in

their own courts. The second question was not debated atthe time of ratification, except as to citizen-state diversity
jurisdiction; 1 there was no unanimity, but in due course theCourt in

Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), answered
that a state defendant enjoyed no such immunity. As tofederal-question jurisdiction, state sovereign immunity

seems not to have been debated prior to ratification, thesilence probably showing a general understanding at the
time that the States would have no immunity in such cases.

The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment soon changed
the result in Chisholm, not by mentioning sovereign immunity, but by eliminating citizen-state diversity jurisdiction
over cases with state defendants. I will explain why the

Citizens of another State; . . . and between a State, or the Citizens thereof,

his opinion in Union Gas, Justice Stevens referred to these Clauses as
the "citizen-state" and "alien-state" Clauses, respectively, Pennsylvania
v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (concurring opinion). I have
grouped the two as "Citizen-State Diversity Clauses" for ease in frequent
repetition here.

Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question juris-diction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it

casts on the soundness of Hans's holding that States didenjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits. The
Hans Court erroneously assumed that a State could pleadsovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under
federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that aState must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its
citizens. The error of Hans's reasoning is underscored byits clear inconsistency with the Founders' hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, andwith the Founders' conception of sovereign power as divided
between the States and the National Government for thesake of very practical objectives.

The Court's answer today to the third question is likewiseat odds with the Founders' view that common law, when it
was received into the new American legal system, was al-ways subject to legislative amendment. In ignoring the
reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of theratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law
rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under ArticleI, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief
before in our history, and promises to do so again.Beyond this third question that elicits today's holding,
there is one further issue. To reach the Court's result, itmust not only hold the

Hans doctrine to be outside the reachof Congress, but must also displace the doctrine of

Ex parteYoung, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), that an officer of the government

may be ordered prospectively to follow federal law, in casesin which the government may not itself be sued directly.
None of its reasons for displacing Young 's jurisdictional doc-trine withstand scrutiny.

not bound by the law's provisions; the other provides thatthe King or Crown, as the font of justice, is not subject to

suit in its own courts. See, e. g., Jaffe, Suits Against Gov-ernments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L. Rev.
1, 3-4 (1963).2 The one rule limits the reach of substantivelaw; the other, the jurisdiction of the courts. We are concerned here only with the latter rule, which took its
common-law form in the high Middle Ages. "At least asearly as the thirteenth century, during the reign of Henry

III (1216-1272), it was recognized that the king could not besued in his own courts." C. Jacobs, Eleventh Amendment
and Sovereign Immunity 5 (1972). See also 3 W. Blackstone,Commentaries *244-*245; Jaffe,

supra, at 2 ("By the time of
Bracton (1268) it was settled doctrine that the King couldnot be sued

eo nomine in his own courts").
The significance of this doctrine in the nascent American
law is less clear, however, than its early development and
steady endurance in England might suggest. While some
colonial governments may have enjoyed some such immunity,
Jacobs, supra, at 6-7, the scope (and even the existence) of
this governmental immunity in pre-Revolutionary America
remains disputed. See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment
and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83
Colum. L. Rev. 1889, 1895-1899 (1983).

2 The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that "the King can
do no wrong." See, e. g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *244. Professor
Jaffe has argued this expression "originally meant precisely the contrary
to what it later came to mean," that is, " `it meant that the king must not,
was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.' " Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at
4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42,
in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921),
p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to
mean that "the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury").
In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it,
being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See,
e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v.
Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).

Souter, J., dissenting
Whatever the scope of sovereign immunity might have
been in the Colonies, however, or during the period of Confederation, the proposal to establish a National Government
under the Constitution drafted in 1787 presented a prospect
unknown to the common law prior to the American experience: the States would become parts of a system in which
sovereignty over even domestic matters would be divided or
parcelled out between the States and the Nation, the latter
to be invested with its own judicial power and the right to
prevail against the States whenever their respective substantive laws might be in conflict. With this prospect in
mind, the 1787 Constitution might have addressed state sovereign immunity by eliminating whatever sovereign immunity the States previously had, as to any matter subject to
federal law or jurisdiction; by recognizing an analogue to the
old immunity in the new context of federal jurisdiction, but
subject to abrogation as to any matter within that jurisdiction; or by enshrining a doctrine of inviolable state sovereign
immunity in the text, thereby giving it constitutional protection in the new federal jurisdiction. See Field, The Eleventh Amendment and Other Sovereign Immunity Doctrines:
Part One, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 515, 536-538 (1977).

The 1787 draft in fact said nothing on the subject, and it
was this very silence that occasioned some, though apparently not widespread, dispute among the Framers and others
over whether ratification of the Constitution would preclude
a State sued in federal court from asserting sovereign immunity as it could have done on any matter of nonfederal law
litigated in its own courts. As it has come down to us, the
discussion gave no attention to congressional power under
the proposed Article I but focused entirely on the limits of
the judicial power provided in Article III. And although
the jurisdictional bases together constituting the judicial
power of the national courts under $ 2 of Article III included
questions arising under federal law and cases between States

and individuals who are not citizens,3 it was only upon thelatter citizen-state diversity provisions that preratification questions about state immunity from suit or liabilitycentered.

Later in my discussion I will canvass the details of thedebate among the Framers and other leaders of the time, see

infra, at 142-150; for now it is enough to say that there wasno consensus on the issue. See

Atascadero State Hospitalv. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 263-280 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 419 (1979); Jacobs,supra, at 40 ("[T]he legislative history of the Constitution
hardly warrants the conclusion drawn by some that therewas a general understanding, at the time of ratification, that
the states would retain their sovereign immunity"). Therewas, on the contrary, a clear disagreement, which was left
to fester during the ratification period, to be resolved onlythereafter. One other point, however, was also clear: the

3 The text reads that "[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in
Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United
States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies
between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another
State;--between Citizens of different States,--between Citizens of the
same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between
a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects."

4 The one statement I have found on the subject of States' immunity in

federal-question cases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate,
stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good
on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement
of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby "show the world
that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of
the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for
the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let
the legislatures of the different states do what they may." 2 J. Elliot,
Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot's Debates).

debate addressed only the question whether ratification ofthe Constitution would, in diversity cases and without more,

abrogate the state sovereign immunity or allow it to havesome application. We have no record that anyone argued
for the third option mentioned above, that the Constitutionwould affirmatively guarantee state sovereign immunity
against any congressional action to the contrary. Nor wouldthere have been any apparent justification for any such argument, since no clause in the proposed (and ratified) Constitu-tion even so much as suggested such a position. It may have
been reasonable to contend (as we will see that Madison,Marshall, and Hamilton did) that Article III would not alter
States' pre-existing common-law immunity despite its un-qualified grant of jurisdiction over diversity suits against
States. But then, as now, there was no textual support forcontending that Article III or any other provision would
"constitutionalize" state sovereign immunity, and no one ut-tered any such contention.

B
The argument among the Framers and their friends aboutsovereign immunity in federal citizen-state diversity cases,

in any event, was short lived and ended when this Court, inChisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), chose between the
constitutional alternatives of abrogation and recognition ofthe immunity enjoyed at common law. The 4-to-1 majority
adopted the reasonable (although not compelled) interpreta-tion that the first of the two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses
abrogated for purposes of federal jurisdiction any immunitythe States might have enjoyed in their own courts, and Georgia was accordingly held subject to the judicial power in acommon-law assumpsit action by a South Carolina citizen
suing to collect a debt.5 The case also settled, by implica5 This lengthy discussion of the history of the Constitution's ratification,

tion, any question there could possibly have been about recognizing state sovereign immunity in actions depending on
the federal question (or "arising under") head of jurisdiction

ated a great "shock of surprise" misread the history. See Principality of
Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934). The Court's response to this
historical analysis is simply to recite yet again Monaco's erroneous assertion that Chisholm created "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh
Amendment was at once proposed and adopted," 292 U. S., at 325. See
ante, at 69. This response is, with respect, no response at all.

Monaco's ipse dixit that Chisholm created a "shock of surprise" does
not make it so. This Court's opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the
same way that our interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.
In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 434 (1902), which was, like
Monaco, decided a century after the event it purported to recount, the
Court baldly stated that "in September 1790, General Washington, on the
advice of Mr. Adams, did refuse to permit British troops to march through
the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was an attack on
New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the Mississippi." Modern
historians agree, however, that there was no such request, see J. Daly,
The Use of History in the Decisions of the Supreme Court: 1900-1930,
pp. 65-66 (1954); W. Manning, The Nootka Sound Controversy, in Annual
Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 429, 58th
Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 415-423 (1905), and it would of course be absurd for
this Court to treat the fact that Tucker asserted the existence of the request as proof that it actually occurred. Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64, 72-73 (1938) ("But it was the more recent research of a competent
scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the
construction given to [the Judiciary Act of 1789] by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that,
in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the
federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases
would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as
well as written").

Moreover, in this case, there is ample evidence contradicting the "shock
of surprise" thesis. Contrary to Monaco's suggestion, the Eleventh
Amendment was not "at once proposed and adopted." Congress was in
session when Chisholm was decided, and a constitutional amendment in
response was proposed two days later, but Congress never acted on it, and
in fact it was not until two years after Chisholm was handed down that

as well. The constitutional text on federal-question juris-diction, after all, was just as devoid of immunity language as

it was on citizen-state diversity, and at the time of Chisholmany influence that general common-law immunity might have
had as an interpretive force in construing constitutional lan-guage would presumably have been no greater when addressing the federal-question language of Article III than itsDiversity Clauses. See Sherry, The Eleventh Amendment
and Stare Decisis: Overruling Hans v Louisiana, 57 U. Chi.L. Rev. 1260, 1270 (1990).

Although Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm seems attimes to reserve judgment on what I have called the third
question, whether Congress could authorize suits against theStates, Chisholm, supra, at 434-435, his argument is largely
devoted to stating the position taken by several federaliststhat state sovereign immunity was cognizable under the
Citizen-State Diversity Clauses, not that state immunity wassomehow invisibly codified as an independent constitutional
defense. As Justice Stevens persuasively explains ingreater detail,

ante, at 78-81, Justice Iredell's dissent fo-cused on the construction of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not

Article III. See also Orth, The Truth About Justice Ire-dell's Dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), 73 N. C. L. Rev.
255 (1994). This would have been an odd focus, had he be-lieved that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to
impose liability. Instead, on Justice Iredell's view, Statessued in diversity retained the common-law sovereignty
"where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be inforce in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by
any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the coun-try." 2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted). While in at least
some circumstances States might be held liable to "the au-thority of the United States,"

id., at 436, any such liability

an Amendment was ratified. See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and
State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889,

would depend upon "laws passed under the Constitution andin conformity to it," ibid.

abrogating Georgia's common-law immunity, Justice Iredellconcluded that the State should not be liable to suit.

C
The Eleventh Amendment, of course, repudiated Chisholmand clearly divested federal courts of some jurisdiction as to

cases against state parties:

"The Judicial power of the United States shall not beconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United Statesby Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects
of any Foreign State."
There are two plausible readings of this provision's text.Under the first, it simply repeals the Citizen-State Diversity

6 See also 2 Dall., at 435 ("[I]t is certain that in regard to any common
law principle which can influence the question before us no alteration has
been made by any statute"); id., at 437 (if "no new remedy be provided
. . . we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of the preexistent laws, which must remain in force till superseded by others");
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 283 (1985) (Brennan,
J., dissenting). But see Justice Iredell's dicta suggesting that the Constitution would not permit suits against a State. Chisholm, supra, at
449 (dissenting opinion); Atascadero, supra, at 283, n. 34 (Brennan, J.,
dissenting).

7 Of course, even if Justice Iredell had concluded that state sovereign

immunity was not subject to abrogation, it would be inappropriate to assume (as it appears the Court does today, and Hans v. Louisiana, 134
U. S. 1 (1890), did as well) that the Eleventh Amendment (regardless of
what it says) "constitutionalized" Justice Iredell's dissent, or that it simply
adopted the opposite of the holding in Chisholm. It is as odd to read the
Eleventh Amendment's rejection of Chisholm (which held that States may
be sued in diversity) to say that States may not be sued on a federal
question as it would be to read the Twenty-Sixth Amendment's rejection
of Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970) (which held that Congress could
not require States to extend the suffrage to 18-year-olds) to permit Congress to require States to extend the suffrage to 12-year-olds.

Clauses of Article III for all cases in which the State appears
as a defendant. Under the second, it strips the federal
courts of jurisdiction in any case in which a state defendant
is sued by a citizen not its own, even if jurisdiction might
otherwise rest on the existence of a federal question in the
suit. Neither reading of the Amendment, of course, furnishes authority for the Court's view in today's case, but we
need to choose between the competing readings for the light
that will be shed on the Hans doctrine and the legitimacy of
inflating that doctrine to the point of constitutional immutability as the Court has chosen to do.

The history and structure of the Eleventh Amendment
convincingly show that it reaches only to suits subject to
federal jurisdiction exclusively under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.8 In precisely tracking the language in Article III providing for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction, the
text of the Amendment does, after all, suggest to common

While a minority has adopted the second view set out above, see, e. g.,
Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh Amendment, 102 Harv. L.
Rev. 1342 (1989); Massey, State Sovereignty and the Tenth and Eleventh
Amendments, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61 (1989), and others have criticized the
diversity theory, see, e. g., Marshall, The Diversity Theory of the Eleventh
Amendment: A Critical Evaluation, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1372 (1989), I have
discovered no commentator affirmatively advocating the position taken by
the Court today. As one scholar has observed, the literature is "remarkably consistent in its evaluation of the historical evidence and text of the
amendment as not supporting a broad rule of constitutional immunity for
states." Jackson, supra, at 44, n. 179.

sense that only the Diversity Clauses are being addressed.If the Framers had meant the Amendment to bar federalquestion suits as well, they could not only have made theirintentions clearer very easily, but could simply have adopted
the first post-Chisholm proposal, introduced in the House ofRepresentatives by Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts on
instructions from the Legislature of that Commonwealth.Its provisions would have had exactly that expansive effect:

"[N]o state shall be liable to be made a party defendant,in any of the judicial courts, established, or which shall
be established under the authority of the United States,at the suit of any person or persons, whether a citizen
or citizens, or a foreigner or foreigners, or of any bodypolitic or corporate, whether within or without the
United States." Gazette of the United States 303 (Feb.20, 1793).

With its references to suits by citizens as well as non-citizens, the Sedgwick amendment would necessarily have
been applied beyond the Diversity Clauses, and for a reasonthat would have been wholly obvious to the people of the
time. Sedgwick sought such a broad amendment becausemany of the States, including his own, owed debts subject to
collection under the Treaty of Paris. Suits to collect suchdebts would "arise under" that Treaty and thus be subject to
federal-question jurisdiction under Article III. Such a suit,indeed, was then already pending against Massachusetts,
having been brought in this Court by Christopher Vassal, anerstwhile Bostonian whose move to England on the eve of
revolutionary hostilities had presented his former neighborswith the irresistible temptation to confiscate his vacant mansion. 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of theUnited States, 1789-1800, pp. 352-449 (M. Marcus ed. 1994).

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the marshal for the district
of Massachusetts served a subpoena on Governor John Hancock and Attor517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

Congress took no action on Sedgwick's proposal, however,
and the Amendment as ultimately adopted two years later
could hardly have been meant to limit federal-question jurisdiction, or it would never have left the States open to
federal-question suits by their own citizens. To be sure, the
majority of state creditors were not citizens, but nothing in
the Treaty would have prevented foreign creditors from selling their debt instruments (thereby assigning their claims)
to citizens of the debtor State. If the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment had meant it to immunize States from
federal-question suits like those that might be brought to
enforce the Treaty of Paris, they would surely have drafted
the Amendment differently. See Fletcher, The Diversity
Explanation of the Eleventh Amendment: A Reply to Critics,
56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1261, 1280-1282 (1989).

It should accordingly come as no surprise that the weightiest commentary following the Amendment's adoption described it simply as constricting the scope of the CitizenState Diversity Clauses. In Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.
264 (1821), for instance, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for
the Court, emphasized that the Amendment had no effect on
federal courts' jurisdiction grounded on the "arising under"
provision of Article III and concluded that "a case arising
under the constitution or laws of the United States, is cognizable in the Courts of the Union, whoever may be the parties
to that case." Id., at 383. The point of the Eleventh
Amendment, according to Cohens, was to bar jurisdiction in
suits at common law by Revolutionary War debt creditors,

ney General James Sullivan, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not
appear by the original return date of August 1793, and the case was continued to the February 1794 Term. Massachusetts never did appear, and
the case was "simply continued from term to term through 1796." 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, at 369. In
February 1797 the suit was "dismissed with Costs, for reasons unknown,"
ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), perhaps because "Vassall failed
to prosecute it properly," ibid.

not "to strip the government of the means of protecting, bythe instrumentality of its courts, the constitution and laws

from active violation." Id., at 407.The treatment of the Amendment in Osborn v. Bank of
United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), was to the same effect.The Amendment was held there to be no bar to an action
against the State seeking the return of an unconstitutionaltax. "The eleventh amendment of the constitution has exempted a State from the suits of citizens of other States, oraliens," Marshall stated, omitting any reference to cases that
arise under the Constitution or federal law. Id., at 847.The good sense of this early construction of the Amendment as affecting the diversity jurisdiction and no more hasthe further virtue of making sense of this Court's repeated
exercise of appellate jurisdiction in federal-question suitsbrought against States in their own courts by out-of-staters.
Exercising appellate jurisdiction in these cases would havebeen patent error if the Eleventh Amendment limited
federal-question jurisdiction, for the Amendment's uncondi-tional language ("shall not be construed") makes no distinction between trial and appellate jurisdiction.10 And yet,again and again we have entertained such appellate cases,
even when brought against the State in its own name by a

10 We have generally rejected Eleventh Amendment challenges to our
appellate jurisdiction on the specious ground that an appeal is not a "suit"
for purposes of the Amendment. See, e. g., McKesson Corp. v. Division
of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation,
496 U. S. 18, 27 (1990). Although Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 412
(1821), is cited for this proposition, that case involved a State as plaintiff.
See generally Jackson, 98 Yale L. J., at 32-35 (rejecting the appeal/suit
distinction). The appeal/suit distinction, in any case, makes no sense.
Whether or not an appeal is a "suit" in its own right, it is certainly a
means by which an appellate court exercises jurisdiction over a "suit" that
began in the courts below. Cf. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount
Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam) ("The filing of a notice of appeal
is an event of jurisdictional significance--it confers jurisdiction on the
court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those
aspects of the case involved in the appeal").

private plaintiff for money damages. See, e. g., Common-wealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981); Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue,460 U. S. 575 (1983). The best explanation for our practice
belongs to Chief Justice Marshall: the Eleventh Amendment
bars only those suits in which the sole basis for federal juris-diction is diversity of citizenship. See

Atascadero State
Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 294 (Brennan, J., dissent-ing); Jackson, The Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1, 44(1988).

In sum, reading the Eleventh Amendment solely as a limiton citizen-state diversity jurisdiction has the virtue of coherence with this Court's practice, with the views of John Marshall, with the history of the Amendment's drafting, and withits allusive language. Today's majority does not appear to

disagree, at least insofar as the constitutional text is con-cerned; the Court concedes, after all, that "the text of the
Amendment would appear to restrict only the Article IIIdiversity jurisdiction of the federal courts."

Ante, at 54.11
Thus, regardless of which of the two plausible readings oneadopts, the further point to note here is that there is no possible argument that the Eleventh Amendment, by its terms,deprives federal courts of jurisdiction over all citizen law11 See also Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 31 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("If this text [of the Eleventh
Amendment] were intended as a comprehensive description of state sovereign immunity in federal courts . . . then it would unquestionably be most
reasonable to interpret it as providing immunity only when the sole basis
of federal jurisdiction is the diversity of citizenship that it describes (which
of course tracks some of the diversity jurisdictional grants in U. S. Const.,
Art. III, $ 2). For there is no plausible reason why one would wish to
protect a State from being sued in federal court for violation of federal
law . . . when the plaintiff is a citizen of another State or country, but
to permit a State to be sued there when the plaintiff is citizen of the
State itself").

suits against the States. Not even the Court advances thatproposition, and there would be no textual basis for doing

so.12 Because the plaintiffs in today's case are citizens of the

12 The Court does suggest that the drafters of the Eleventh Amendment
may not have had federal-question jurisdiction in mind, in the apparent
belief that this somehow supports its reading. Ante, at 69-70. The possibility, however, that those who drafted the Eleventh Amendment intended to deal "only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm" would demonstrate, if any demonstration beyond the clear language
of the Eleventh Amendment were necessary, that the Eleventh Amendment was not intended to address the broader issue of federal-question
suits brought by citizens.

Moreover, the Court's point is built on a faulty foundation. The Court
is simply incorrect in asserting that "the federal courts did not have
federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed."
Ibid. Article III, of course, provided for such jurisdiction, and early
Congresses exercised their authority pursuant to Article III to confer
jurisdiction on the federal courts to resolve various matters of federal law.

circuit courts respectively shall have cognizance of . . . all cases in law or
equity, arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and
treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority"). It is, of
course, true that this statute proved short lived (it was repealed by the
Act of Mar. 8, 1802, 2 Stat. 132), and that Congress did not pass another
statute conferring general federal jurisdiction until 1875, but the drafters
of the Eleventh Amendment obviously could not have predicted such
things. The real significance of the 1801 Act is that it demonstrates the
awareness among the Members of the early Congresses of the potential
scope of Article III. This, in combination with the pre-Eleventh Amendment statutes that conferred federal-question jurisdiction on the federal
courts, cast considerable doubt on the Court's suggestion that the issue of
federal-question jurisdiction never occurred to the drafters of the Elev517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT

State that they are suing, the Eleventh Amendment simplydoes not apply to them. We must therefore look elsewhere

for the source of that immunity by which the Court saystheir suit is barred from a federal court.

13

II
The obvious place to look elsewhere, of course, is Hans v.Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), and Hans was indeed a leap in

the direction of today's holding, even though it does not takethe Court all the way. The parties in

Hans raised, and theCourt in that case answered, only what I have called the

second question, that is, whether the Constitution, without

enth Amendment; on the contrary, just because these early statutes underscore the early Congresses' recognition of the availability of federalquestion jurisdiction, the silence of the Eleventh Amendment is all the
more deafening.

13 The majority chides me that the "lengthy analysis of the text of the

Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man," ante, at 69. But plain
text is the Man of Steel in a confrontation with "background principle[s]"
and " `postulates which limit and control,' " ante, at 68, 72. An argument
rooted in the text of a constitutional provision may not be guaranteed of
carrying the day, but insubstantiality is not its failing. See, e. g., Monaghan, Our Perfect Constitution, 56 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 353, 383-384 (1981)
("For the purposes of legal reasoning, the binding quality of the constitutional text is itself incapable of and not in need of further demonstration");
cf. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 178 (1987) (Rehnquist, C. J.)
("It would be extraordinary to require legislative history to confirm the
plain meaning of [Federal Rule of Evidence] 104"); Garcia v. United States,
469 U. S. 70, 75 (1984) (Rehnquist, J.) ("[O]nly the most extraordinary
showing of contrary intentions from [the legislative history] would justify
a limitation on the `plain meaning' of the statutory language"). This is
particularly true in construing the jurisdictional provisions of Article III,
which speak with a clarity not to be found in some of the more opentextured provisions of the Constitution. See National Mut. Ins. Co. v.
Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U. S. 582, 646-647 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Schauer, Easy Cases, 58 S. Cal. L. Rev. 399, 424 (1985) (noting
the "seemingly plain linguistic mandate" of the Eleventh Amendment).
That the Court thinks otherwise is an indication of just how far it has
strayed beyond the boundaries of traditional constitutional analysis.

more, permits a State to plead sovereign immunity to barthe exercise of federal-question jurisdiction. See id., at 9.

Although the Court invoked a principle of sovereign immu-nity to cure what it took to be the Eleventh Amendment's
anomaly of barring only those state suits brought by nonciti-zen plaintiffs, the

Hans Court had no occasion to considerwhether Congress could abrogate that background immunity

by statute. Indeed (except in the special circumstance ofCongress's power to enforce the Civil War Amendments),
this question never came before our Court until Union Gas,and any intimations of an answer in prior cases were mere
dicta. In Union Gas the Court held that the immunity rec-ognized in

Hans had no constitutional status and was subjectto congressional abrogation. Today the Court overrules

Union Gas and holds just the opposite. In deciding how tochoose between these two positions, the place to begin is
with Hans's holding that a principle of sovereign immu-nity derived from the common law insulates a State from
federal-question jurisdiction at the suit of its own citizen. Acritical examination of that case will show that it was
wrongly decided, as virtually every recent commentator hasconcluded.

14 It follows that the Court's further step today

of constitutionalizing Hans's rule against abrogation by Con-gress compounds and immensely magnifies the century-old

mistake of Hans itself and takes its place with other historicexamples of textually untethered elevations of judicially derived rules to the status of inviolable constitutional law.

industrial development. E. Foner, Reconstruction: Ameri-ca's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, pp. 383-384 (1988);

Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1976 -1977. As Recon-structi on governments collapsed, however, the postReconstruction regimes sought to repudiate these debts,
and the Hans litigation arose out of Louisiana's attempt torenege on its bond obligations.

Hans sued the State in federal court, asserting that theState's default amounted to an impairment of the obligation
of its contracts in violation of the Contract Clause. ThisCourt affirmed the dismissal of the suit, despite the fact that
the case fell within the federal court's "arising under," or
federal-question, jurisdiction. Justice Bradley's opinion did
not purport to hold that the terms either of Article III or of
the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, but that the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity that had inspired adoption of the Eleventh Amendment applied to cases beyond
the Amendment's scope and otherwise within the federalquestion jurisdiction. Indeed, Bradley explicitly admitted
that "[i]t is true, the amendment does so read [as to permit
Hans's suit], and if there were no other reason or ground for
abating his suit, it might be maintainable." Hans, 134 U. S.,
at 10. The Court elected, nonetheless, to recognize a
broader immunity doctrine, despite the want of any textual
manifestation, because of what the Court described as the
anomaly that would have resulted otherwise: the Eleventh
Amendment (according to the Court) would have barred a
federal-question suit by a noncitizen, but the State would
have been subject to federal jurisdiction at its own citizen's
behest. Id., at 10-11. The State was accordingly held to
be free to resist suit without its consent, which it might grant
or withhold as it pleased.

Hans thus addressed the issue implicated (though not directly raised) in the preratification debate about the CitizenState Diversity Clauses and implicitly settled by Chisholm:
whether state sovereign immunity was cognizable by federal

courts on the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction. Ac-cording to Hans, and contrary to Chisholm, it was. But

that is all that Hans held. Because no federal legislationpurporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot
fairly be said that Hans held state sovereign immunity tohave attained some constitutional status immunizing it
from abrogation.15Taking

Hans only as far as its holding, its vulnerabilityis apparent. The Court rested its opinion on avoiding the

supposed anomaly of recognizing jurisdiction to entertain acitizen's federal-question suit, but not one brought by a noncitizen. See Hans, supra, at 10-11. There was, however,no such anomaly at all. As already explained, federalquestion cases are not touched by the Eleventh Amendment,which leaves a State open to federal-question suits by citizens and noncitizens alike. If Hans had been from Massa-chusetts the Eleventh Amendment would not have barred
his action against Louisiana.Although there was thus no anomaly to be cured by

Hans,the case certainly created its own anomaly in leaving federal

courts entirely without jurisdiction to enforce paramountfederal law at the behest of a citizen against a State that
broke it. It destroyed the congruence of the judicial powerunder Article III with the substantive guarantees of the
Constitution, and with the provisions of statutes passed byCongress in the exercise of its power under Article I: when
a State injured an individual in violation of federal law nofederal forum could provide direct relief. Absent an alternative process to vindicate federal law (see Part IV, infra)John Marshall saw just what the consequences of this anomaly would be in the early Republic, and he took that conse-quence as good evidence that the Framers could never have
intended such a scheme.

15 Indeed, as Justice Stevens suggests, there is language in Hans
suggesting that the Court was really construing the Judiciary Act of
1875 rather than the Constitution. See ante, at 84-87.

Souter, J., dissenting
"Different States may entertain different opinions onthe true construction of the constitutional powers of congress. We know that, at one time, the assumption ofthe debts contracted by the several States, during the
war of our Revolution, was deemed unconstitutional bysome of them. . . . States may legislate in conformity to
their opinions, and may enforce those opinions by penal-ties. It would be hazarding too much to assert that the
judicatures of the States will be exempt from the preju-dices by which the legislatures and people are influenced, and will constitute perfectly impartial tribunals.In many States the judges are dependent for office and
for salary on the will of the legislature. The constitu-tion of the United States furnishes no security against
the universal adoption of this principle. When we ob-serve the importance which that constitution attaches to
the independence of judges, we are the less inclined tosuppose that it can have intended to leave these constitutional questions to tribunals where this independ-ence may not exist."

Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.,at 386-387.

And yet that is just what Hans threatened to do.How such a result could have been threatened on the basis
of a principle not so much as mentioned in the Constitutionis difficult to understand. But history provides the explanation. As I have already said, Hans was one episode in along story of debt repudiation by the States of the former
Confederacy after the end of Reconstruction. The turningpoint in the States' favor came with the Compromise of 1877,
when the Republican Party agreed effectively to end Recon-struction and to withdraw federal troops from the South in
return for Southern acquiescence in the decision of the Elec-toral Commission that awarded the disputed 1876 presidential election to Rutherford B. Hayes. See J. Orth, JudicialPower of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in
American History 53-57 (1987); Gibbons, supra, at 1978-

1982; see generally Foner, Reconstruction, at 575-587 (de-scribing the events of 1877 and their aftermath). The troop

withdrawal, of course, left the federal judiciary "effectivelywithout power to resist the rapidly coalescing repudiation
movement." Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1981. ContractClause suits like the one brought by Hans thus presented
this Court with "a draconian choice between repudiation ofsome of its most inviolable constitutional doctrines and the
humiliation of seeing its political authority compromised asits judgments met the resistance of hostile state governments." Id., at 1974. Indeed, Louisiana's brief in Hans un-mistakably bore witness to this Court's inability to enforce
a judgment against a recalcitrant State: "The solemn obliga-tion of a government arising on its own acknowledged bond
would not be enhanced by a judgment rendered on suchbond. If it either could not or would not make provision for
paying the bond, it is probable that it could not or wouldnot make provision for satisfying the judgment." Brief for
Respondent in No. 4, O. T. 1889, p. 25. Given the likelihoodthat a judgment against the State could not be enforced, it
is not wholly surprising that the Hans Court found a way toavoid the certainty of the State's contempt.

16

16 See Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 2000 ("Without weakening the contract clause, which over the next two decades the Fuller Court might need
both in its fight against government regulation of business and as a
weapon against defaulting local governments, the justices needed a way
to let the South win the repudiation war. The means Bradley chose was
to rewrite the eleventh amendment and the history of its adoption"). The
commentators' contention that this Court's inability to enforce the obligation of Southern States to pay their debts influenced the result in Hans v.
Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), is substantiated by three anomalies of this
Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence during that period. First, this
Court held in 1885 that Virginia's sovereign immunity did not allow it to
abrogate its bonds. Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S. 269. The difference from the situation in other States, however, was that Virginia had
made its bond coupons receivable in payment of state taxes; "[u]nder these
circumstances federal courts did not need to rely on the political branches
of government to enforce their orders but could protect creditors by a

So it is that history explains, but does not honor, Hans.
The ultimate demerit of the case centers, however, not on its
politics but on the legal errors on which it rested.17 Before

judgment that their taxes had in fact been paid. In these cases the Eleventh Amendment faded into the background." J. Orth, Judicial Power of
the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 9
(1987); see generally id., at 90-109. Second, at the same time that this
Court was articulating broad principles of immunity for States, we refused
to recognize similar immunity for municipalities and similar state political
subdivisions. See, e. g., Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890).
Professor Orth suggests that this seeming inconsistency is traceable to
the enforcement difficulties arising from the withdrawal of federal troops
from the South. "It just so happened," he points out, "that counties had
tended to issue bonds in the West, while in the South, states had usually
done the job. Property in the form of bonds could be defended in the
mid-West and West, but similar property in the South had to be sacrificed
to the higher politics of the Compromise of 1877." Orth, supra, at 111.
Finally, Professor Orth attributes this Court's recognition (or revival) of
the Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), action as a way around state
sovereign immunity to the fact that, by 1908, "the problem of repudiated
Southern bonds was clearly a specter from an increasingly distant past."
Orth, supra, at 128. See also Gibbons, supra, at 2002 (arguing that the
Court's unanimous revival of its power to grant equitable relief against
state officers in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1 (1891), was made
possible by the fact that the case "did not involve Southern State bonds").
I am reluctant, to be sure, to ascribe these legal developments to a single,
extralegal cause, and at least one commentator has suggested that the
Southern debt crisis may not have been the only factor driving the Court's
Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence during this period. See generally
Collins, The Conspiracy Theory of the Eleventh Amendment, 88 Colum.
L. Rev. 212 (1988) (reviewing Orth). But neither would I ignore the pattern of the cases, which tends to show that the presence or absence of
enforcement difficulties significantly influenced the path of the law in this
area. See id., at 243 (acknowledging that "[i]t is perfectly conceivable
that Compromise-related politics exerted their influence at the margin--
in doubtful cases in which the Court might have gone either way").

17 Today's majority condemns my attention to Hans's historical circumstances as "a disservice to the Court's traditional method of adjudication."
Ante, at 69. The point, however, is not that historical circumstance
may undermine an otherwise defensible decision; on the contrary, it is just
because Hans is so utterly indefensible on the merits of its legal analysis

considering those errors, it is necessary to address theCourt's contention that subsequent cases have read into

Hans what was not there to begin with, that is, a backgroundprinciple of sovereign immunity that is constitutional in stature and therefore unalterable by Congress.

B
The majority does not dispute the point that Hans v. Loui-siana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), had no occasion to decide whether

Congress could abrogate a State's immunity from federal-question suits. The Court insists, however, that the negative answer to that question that it finds in Hans and subse-quent opinions is not "mere obiter dicta, but rather . . . the
well-established rationale upon which the Court based theresults of its earlier decisions."

Ante, at 66-67. The exactrationale to which the majority refers, unfortunately, is not

easy to discern. The Court's opinion says, immediatelyafter its discussion of stare decisis, that "[f]or over a century,
we have grounded our decisions in the oft-repeated under-standing of state sovereign immunity as an essential part of
the Eleventh Amendment." Ante, at 67. This cannot bethe "rationale," though, because this Court has repeatedly
acknowledged that the Eleventh Amendment standing alone
that one is forced to look elsewhere in order to understand how the Court
could have gone so far wrong. Nor is there anything new or remarkable
in taking such a look, for we have sought similar explanations in other
cases. In Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219 (1987), for example, we
suggested that the Court's holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66
(1861), that "the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no
power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel
him to perform it," id., at 107, was influenced by "the looming shadow of
a Civil War," Branstad, supra, at 227, and we ultimately determined that
Dennison should be overruled, 483 U. S., at 230. The author of the
Court's opinion today joined that analysis, as did the other Members of
today's majority who were then on the Court. See ibid. (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (joining the relevant portion of the majority opinion); id., at 231 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (same).

cannot bar a federal-question suit against a State brought by
a state citizen. See, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651,
662 (1974) (acknowledging that "the Amendment by its
terms does not bar suits against a State by its own citizens").18 Indeed, as I have noted, Justice Bradley's opinion
in Hans conceded that Hans might successfully have pursued
his claim "if there were no other reason or ground [other
than the Amendment itself] for abating his suit." 134 U. S.,
at 10. The Hans Court, rather, held the suit barred by a nonconstitutional common-law immunity. See supra, at 116-117.

The "rationale" which the majority seeks to invoke is, I
think, more nearly stated in its quotation from Principality
of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 321-323 (1934).
There, the Court said that "we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of $ 2 of Article III, or assume
that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the
restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States." Id.,
at 322.19 This statement certainly is true to Hans, which

18 See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U. S. 299,
304 (1952) (same); Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 (1899) (same). Even
Justice Scalia's dissent in Union Gas, the reasoning of which the majority adopts today, acknowledged that its view of sovereign immunity depended upon "some other constitutional principle beyond the immediate
text of the Eleventh Amendment." 491 U. S., at 31 (opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part). To the extent that our prior cases do
refer to Hans immunity as part of the Eleventh Amendment, they can
only be referring to Justice Stevens's "other" Eleventh Amendment.

(Stevens, J., concurring); see also Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., supra,
at 23-29 (Stevens, J., concurring) (same).

19 See also Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 31-32 (Scalia, J., concurring in part

and dissenting in part) ("What we said in Hans was, essentially, that the
Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for
what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, for
States as well as for the Federal Government, was part of the understood
background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its
jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away"); Nevada v. Hall,

clearly recognized a pre-existing principle of sovereign im-munity, broader than the Eleventh Amendment itself, that

will ordinarily bar federal-question suits against a noncon-senting State. That was the "rationale" which was sufficient to decide Hans and all of its progeny prior to Union
Gas. But leaving aside the indefensibility of that rationale,which I will address further below, that was as far as it went.

The majority, however, would read the "rationale" of Hansand its line of subsequent cases as answering the further
question whether the "postulate" of sovereign immunity that"limit[s] and control[s]" the exercise of Article III jurisdiction, Monaco, supra, at 322, is constitutional in stature andtherefore unalterable by Congress. It is true that there are
statements in the cases that point toward just this conclusion. See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984) ("In short, the principle
of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the
federal judicial power established in Art. III"); Ex parte New
York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921) ("[T]he entire judicial power
granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to
entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State
without consent given . . ."). These statements, however,
are dicta in the classic sense, that is, sheer speculation about
what would happen in cases not before the court.20 But this

"rel[ying] on precepts underlying but not explicit in Art. III and the
Eleventh Amendment").

20 There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too

seriously. Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion
in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that "[a]
state's freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right
through the Eleventh Amendment" obviously ignores a State's liability to
suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S.
286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v.
Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892). See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19
(noting that "the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions"). Similarly, statements
such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497, that "the entire judicial

is not the only weakness of these statements, which are coun-terbalanced by many other opinions that have either stated

the immunity principle without more, see, e. g., Dellmuth v.Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 229, n. 2 (1989) (noting that "an unconsenting State is immune from liability for damages in a suitbrought in federal court by one of its own citizens," without
suggesting that the immunity was unalterable by Con-gress),

21 or have suggested that the Hans immunity is not

of constitutional stature. The very language quoted by themajority from

Monaco, for example, likens state sovereignimmunity to other "essential postulates" such as the rules

of justiciability. 292 U. S., at 322. Many of those rules, as
Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature andtherefore not unalterable by Congress. See

ante, at 88-90.22More generally, the proponents of the Court's theory have

repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a "back-ground principle,"

ante, at 72, "postulate," Nevada v. Hall,440 U. S., at 437 (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or "implicitlimitation,"
Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and PublicTransp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (

Scalia, J., concurring inpart and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the "inherent nature of sovereignty," Great Northern Life Ins. Co.v.

Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit conpower granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent
given" should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself
incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine. How else to explain Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Hans, which stated, practically in the
same breath, that "a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens
is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends," and
that Chisholm "was based upon a sound interpretation of the Constitution
as that instrument then was"? 134 U. S., at 21.

stitutional provision.23 But whatever set of quotations onemay prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in

assessing the contents of federal common law is a very differ-ent thing from reading them into the Founding Document
itself.

The most damning evidence for the Court's theory that
Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by
Congress, however, is the Court's proven tendency to disre-gard the postHans dicta in cases where that dicta would
have mattered.24 If it is indeed true that "private suitsagainst States [are] not permitted under Article III (by

virtue of the understanding represented by the EleventhAmendment),"

Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to seehow a State's sovereign immunity may be waived any more

than it may be abrogated by Congress. See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238 (recognizing
that immunity may be waived). After all, consent of a party
is in all other instances wholly insufficient to create subject23 Indeed, The Chief Justice could hardly have been clearer in Fry v.
United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), where he explained that "[t]he Court's
decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), offers impressive authority for the principle that the States as such were regarded by the Framers
of the Constitution as partaking of many attributes of sovereignty quite
apart from the provisions of the Tenth Amendment. . . .

"As it was not the Eleventh Amendment by its terms which justified the
result in Hans, it is not the Tenth Amendment by its terms that prohibits
congressional action which sets a mandatory ceiling on the wages of all
state employees. Both Amendments are simply examples of the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution that the States
were sovereign in many respects, and that although their legislative authority could be superseded by Congress in many areas where Congress
was competent to act, Congress was nonetheless not free to deal with a

matter jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist. See,
e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); see also E.
Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction $ 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed. 1994)(noting that "allowing such waivers seems inconsistent with

viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a restriction on the
federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction"). Likewise, theCourt's broad theory of immunity runs doubly afoul of the

appellate jurisdiction problem that I noted earlier in reject-ing an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment's text that
would bar federal-question suits. See supra, at 109-116.If "the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority
to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own State
without its consent," Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313
(1920), and if consent to suit in state court is not sufficient
to show consent in federal court, see Atascadero, supra, at
241, then Article III would hardly permit this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over issues of federal law arising
in lawsuits brought against the States in their own courts.
We have, however, quite rightly ignored any post-Hans dicta
in that sort of case and exercised the jurisdiction that the
plain text of Article III provides. See, e. g., Fulton Corp. v.
Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996); see also supra, at 113-114.

If these examples were not enough to distinguish Hans's
rationale of a pre-existing doctrine of sovereign immunity
from the post-Hans dicta indicating that this immunity is
constitutional, one would need only to consider a final set of
cases: those in which we have assumed, without deciding,
that congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity exists even when $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has
no application. A majority of this Court was willing to
make that assumption in Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of
Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101 (1989) (plurality
opinion), in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public
Transp., supra, at 475 (plurality opinion), and in County of

(1985).25 Although the Court in each of these cases failed tofind abrogation for lack of a clear statement of congressional

intent, the assumption that such power was available wouldhardly have been permissible if, at that time, today's majority's view of the law had been firmly established. It is onething, after all, to avoid an open constitutional question by
assuming an answer and rejecting the claim on anotherground; it is quite another to avoid a settled rationale (an
emphatically settled one if the majority is to be taken seri-ously) only to reach an issue of statutory construction that
the Court would otherwise not have to decide. Even worse,the Court could not have been unaware that its decision of
cases like Hoffman and Welch, on the ground that the stat-utes at issue lacked a plain statement of intent to abrogate,
would invite Congress to attempt abrogation in statutes likethe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. $ 2701 et seq.
(IGRA). Such a course would have been wholly irresponsi-ble if, as the majority now claims, the constitutionally unalterable nature of Hans immunity had been well establishedfor a hundred years.

Hans itself recognized that an "observation [in a prior casethat] was unnecessary to the decision, and in that sense

extrajudicial . . . ought not to outweigh" present reasoning that

points to a different conclusion. 134 U. S., at 20. That isgood advice, which Members of today's majority have been
willing to heed on other occasions. See, e. g., Kokkonen v.
Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U. S. 375, 379 (1994) ("It is tothe holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta, that we

so. See id., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Likewise, in Welch, the

congressional power of abrogation. See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J.,

must attend"); Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 450 (1996).But because the Court disregards this norm today, I must

consider the soundness of Hans's original recognition of abackground principle of sovereign immunity that applies
even in federal-question suits, and the reasons that counselagainst the Court's extension of

Hans's holding to the pointof rendering its immunity unalterable by Congress.

III
Three critical errors in Hans weigh against constitutional-izing its holding as the majority does today. The first we

have already seen: the Hans Court misread the EleventhAmendment, see supra, at 118-123. It also misunderstood
the conditions under which common-law doctrines werereceived or rejected at the time of the founding, and it fundamentally mistook the very nature of sovereignty in theyoung Republic that was supposed to entail a State's immunity to federal-question jurisdiction in a federal court.While I would not, as a matter of

stare decisis, overruleHans today, an understanding of its failings on these points

will show how the Court today simply compounds alreadyserious error in taking Hans the further step of investing its
rule with constitutional inviolability against the consideredjudgment of Congress to abrogate it.

A
There is and could be no dispute that the doctrine of sover-eign immunity that Hans purported to apply had its origins

in the "familiar doctrine of the common law," The Siren,7 Wall. 152, 153 (1869), "derived from the laws and practices
of our English ancestors," United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196,205 (1882).

26 Although statutes came to affect its impor26 The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine,
and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and
159-164, by asserting that Hans "found its roots not solely in the common
law of England, but in the much more fundamental ` "jurisprudence in all

tance in the succeeding centuries, the doctrine was neverreduced to codification, and Americans took their understanding of immunity doctrine from Blackstone, see 3 W.Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, ch. 17
(1768). Here, as in the mother country, it remained a
common-law rule. See generally Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at2-19; Borchard, Governmental Responsibility in Tort, VI, 36

Yale L. J. 1, 17-41 (1926).

This fact of the doctrine's common-law status in the period
covering the founding and the later adoption of the Eleventh
Amendment should have raised a warning flag to the Hans
Court and it should do the same for the Court today. For

civilized nations." ' " Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 17). The
Hans Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against
the State by its own citizen was "not known . . . at the common law" and
was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the
Constitution. Id., at 15. Moreover, Hans explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm, see 134 U. S., at 18-19, and
that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the
common law. "The only principles of law . . . which can affect this case,"
Justice Iredell wrote, "[are] those that are derived from what is properly
termed `the common law,' a law which I presume is the ground-work of
the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is
applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed
in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement
of the country." 2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted). See also Employees
of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public
Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 288 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) ("Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine that long
predates our Constitution and the Eleventh Amendment, although it has,
of course, been carried forward in our jurisprudence"); R. Watkins, The
State as a Party Litigant 51-52 (1927) ("It thus seems probable that the
doctrine of state immunity was accepted rather as an existing fact by the
people of the states, than adopted as a theory. It was a matter of universal practice, and was accepted from the mother country along with the
rest of the common law of England applicable to our changed state and
condition").

have functioned as a limitation on their understanding of thenew Nation's constitutional powers, this turns out not to be

so at all. One of the characteristics of the founding genera-tion, on the contrary, was its joinder of an appreciation of its
immediate and powerful common-law heritage with cautionin settling that inheritance on the political systems of the
new Republic. It is not that the Framers failed to see them-selves to be children of the common law; as one of their contemporaries put it, "[w]e live in the midst of the common law,we inhale it at every breath, imbibe it at every pore . . . [and]
cannot learn another system of laws without learning at thesame time another language." P. Du Ponceau, A Dissertation on the Nature and Extent of Jurisdiction of Courts ofthe United States 91 (1824). But still it is clear that the
adoption of English common law in America was not takenfor granted, and that the exact manner and extent of the
common law's reception were subject to careful considerationby courts and legislatures in each of the new States.

27 An

examination of the States' experience with common-law re-ception will shed light on subsequent theory and practice at

the national level, and demonstrate that our history is en-tirely at odds with Hans's resort to a common-law principle
to limit the Constitution's contrary text.

This American reluctance to import English common lawwholesale into the New World is traceable to the early colonial period. One scholar of that time has written that "[t]he

United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791, 796 (1951) ("Whether we emphasize
the imitation by the colonists of the practices of English local courts or
whether we say the early colonial judges were really applying their own
common-sense ideas of justice, the fact remains that there was an incomplete acceptance in America of English legal principles, and this indigenous law which developed in America remained as a significant source of
law after the Revolution").

process which we may call the reception of the English com-mon law by the colonies was not so simple as the legal theory

would lead us to assume. While their general legal concep-tions were conditioned by, and their terminology derived
from, the common law, the early colonists were far fromapplying it as a technical system, they often ignored it or
denied its subsidiary force, and they consciously departedfrom many of its most essential principles." P. Reinsch,
English Common Law in the Early American Colonies 58(1899).

28 For a variety of reasons, including the absence of

trained lawyers and judges, the dearth of law books, the reli-gious and ideological commitments of the early settlers, and

the novel conditions of the New World, the colonists turnedto a variety of other sources in addition to principles of
common law.29It is true that, with the development of colonial society
and the increasing sophistication of the colonial bar, Englishcommon law gained increasing acceptance in colonial practice. See id., at 7-8; Hall, The Common Law: An Accountof its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791,

28 See also Jones, The Common Law in the United States: English
Themes and American Variations, in Political Separation and Legal Continuity 95-98 (H. Jones ed. 1976) (Jones) (acknowledging that a true
common-law system had not yet developed in the early colonial period);
Stoebuck, Reception of English Common Law in the American Colonies,
10 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 393, 406-407 (1968) (same).

29 See, e. g., Reinsch, English Common Law in the Early American Colonies, at 7 (finding that the colonists developed their own "rude, popular,
summary" system of justice despite professed adhesion to the common
law); C. Hilkey, Legal Development in Colonial Massachusetts, 1630-1686,

797 (1951).30 But even in the late colonial period, Americans
insisted that

"the whole body of the common law . . . was not transplanted, but only so much as was applicable to the colonists in their new relations and conditions. Much of the
common law related to matters which were purely local,
which existed under the English political organization,
or was based upon the triple relation of king, lords and
commons, or those peculiar social conditions, habits and
customs which have no counterpart in the New World.
Such portions of the common law, not being applicable
to the new conditions of the colonists, were never recognised as part of their jurisprudence." Dale, The Adoption of the Common Law by the American Colonies, 30
Am. L. Reg. 553, 554 (1882).31

The result was that "the increasing influx of common-law
principles by no means obliterated the indigenous systems
which had developed during the colonial era and that there
existed important differences in law in action on the two
sides of the Atlantic." Hall, supra, at 797.

30 See also Stoebuck, supra, at 411-412 (indicating that the Colonies became significantly more receptive to the common law after 1700, in part
because of a British desire to regularize colonial legal systems).

31 See also Jones 98 ("The selective nature of the reception is evident in

any examination of the state of law in the colonies in the years immediately preceding the Revolution"). An example is Trott's law, adopted by
South Carolina in 1712, which declared which English statutes were in
force in the Colony. Many laws of England, Trott conceded, were "altogether useless" in South Carolina "by reason of the different way of agriculture and the differing productions of the earth of this Province from
that of England"; others were "impracticable" because of differences in
institutions. L. Friedman, A History of American Law 90-93 (2d ed.
1985); see also C. Warren, History of the American Bar 122-123 (1911)
(quoting North Carolina statute, passed in 1715, providing that the common law would be in force " `so far as shall be compatible with our way of
living and trade' ").

Understandably, even the trend toward acceptance of thecommon law that had developed in the late colonial period

was imperiled by the Revolution and the ultimate break be-tween the Colonies and the old country. Dean Pound has
observed that, "[f]or a generation after the Revolution, . . .political conditions gave rise to a general distrust of English
law. . . . The books are full of illustrations of the hostilitytoward English law simply because it was English which prevailed at the end of the eighteenth and in the earlier yearsof the nineteenth century." R. Pound, The Formative Era
of American Law 7 (1938); see also C. Warren, A Historyof the American Bar 224-225 (1911) (noting a "prejudice
against the system of English Common Law" in the yearsfollowing the Revolution). James Monroe went so far as to
write in 1802 that " `the application of the principles of theEnglish common law to our constitution' " should be considered " `good cause for impeachment.' " Letter from JamesMonroe to John Breckenridge, Jan. 15, 1802 (quoted in 3 A.
Beveridge, The Life of John Marshall: Conflict and Construc-tion 1800-1815, p. 59 (1919)).

32 Nor was anti-English senti32 American hostility to things English was so pronounced for a time
that Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Kentucky proscribed by statute the
citation of English decisions in their courts, and the New Hampshire
courts promulgated a rule of court to the same effect. See Hall, 4 Vand.
L. Rev., at 806; Warren, supra, at 227. This hostility may appear somewhat paradoxical in view of the colonists' frequent insistence during the
revolutionary crisis that they were entitled to common-law rights. See,
e. g., First Continental Congress Declaration and Resolves (1774), in Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union of the American States,
H. R. Doc. No. 398, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 3 (C. Tansill ed. 1927) ("That
the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England"). In
this context, however, the colonists were referring "not to the corpus of
English case-law doctrine but to such profoundly valued common law procedures as trial by jury and the subjection of governmental power to what
John Locke had called the `standing laws,' " such as Magna Carta, the
Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights of 1689, and the Act of Settlement of
1701. Jones 110; see also Jay, Origins of Federal Common Law: Part Two,
133 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1231, 1256 (1985) (Jay II) (noting that "Antifederalists

ment the only difficulty; according to Dean Pound, "[s]ocialand geographical conditions contributed also to make the

work of receiving and reshaping the common law exception-ally difficult." Pound, supra, at 7.

The consequence of this anti-English hostility and aware-ness of changed circumstances was that the independent
States continued the colonists' practice of adopting only somuch of the common law as they thought applicable to their
local conditions.33 As Justice Story explained, "[t]he comused the term common law to mean the great rights associated with due
process"). The cardinal principles of this common-law vision were parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law, conceived as the axiom that "all
members of society, government officials as well as private persons, are
equally responsible to the law and . . . `equally amenable to the jurisdiction
of ordinary tribunals.' " Jones 128-129 (quoting A. Dicey, Introduction to
Study of the Law of Constitution 192 (9th ed. 1939)). It is hard to imagine
that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, so profoundly at odds with both
these cardinal principles, could have been imported to America as part of
this more generalized common-law vision.

33 See, e. g., Conner v. Shepherd, 15 Mass. 164 (1818) (rejecting English

common-law rule regarding assignment of dower rights as inapplicable to
the state and condition of land in Massachusetts); Parker & Edgarton v.
Foote, 19 Wend. 309, 318 (N. Y. 1838) (rejecting English rule entitling a

mon law of England is not to be taken in all respects to bethat of America. Our ancestors brought with them its general principles, and claimed it as their birthright; but theybrought with them and adopted only that portion which was
applicable to their situation." Van Ness v. Pacard, 2 Pet.137, 144 (1829). In 1800, John Marshall had expressed the
similar view that "our ancestors brought with them the lawsof England, both statute & common law as existing at the
settlement of each colony, so far as they were applicable toour situation." Letter from John Marshall to St. George
Tucker, Nov. 27, 1800, reprinted in Jay II, App. A, at 1326,1327. Accordingly, in the period following independence,
"[l]egislatures and courts and doctrinal writers had to testthe common law at every point with respect to its applicability to America." Pound, supra, at 20; see also Jones 103(observing that "suitab[ility] to local institutions and conditions" was "incomparably the most important" principle ofreception in the new States).

While the States had limited their reception of Englishcommon law to principles appropriate to American conditions, the 1787 draft Constitution contained no provision foradopting the common law at all. This omission stood in
sharp contrast to the state constitutions then extant, virtu-ally all of which contained explicit provisions dealing with
common-law reception. See n. 55, infra. Since the experi-ence in the States set the stage for thinking at the national
level, see generally G. Wood, Creation of the American Re-public, 1776-1787, p. 467 (1969) (Wood), this failure to address the notion of common-law reception could not havebeen inadvertent. Instead, the Framers chose to recognize
only particular common-law concepts, such as the writ of hasooner or later to be repeated in practically every American jurisdiction,
that only those principles of the common law were received which were
applicable to the local situation").

reference in the constitutional text. See 1 J. Goebel, OliverWendell Holmes Devise History of the Supreme Court of the
United States, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, pp. 229-230 (1971).

34 This approach reflected widespread agreement

that ratification would not itself entail a general reception ofthe common law of England. See Letter from John Marshall

to St. George Tucker, Nov. 27, 1800, reprinted in Jay II, App.
A, at 1326 ("I do not believe one man can be found" whomaintains "that the common law of England has . . . been

adopted as the common law of America by the Constitutionof the United States"); Jay II, at 1255 (noting that the use of
the term "laws" in Article III "could not have been meant
to accomplish a general reception of British common law").Records of the ratification debates support Marshall's understanding that everyone had to know that the new Consti-tution would not draw the common law in its train. Antifederalists like George Mason went so far as to object that

34 See also Jones 123-124 (noting that the common-law institutions of
habeas corpus and jury trial were "not merely received as ordinary law,"
but rather "received by [specific textual provisions] of the Constitution
itself, as part of the supreme law of the land"). Sovereign immunity, of
course, was not elevated to constitutional status in this way; such immunity thus stands on the same footing as any other common-law principle
which the Framers refused to place beyond the reach of legislative change.
That such principles were and are subject to legislative alteration is confirmed by our treatment of other forms of common-law immunities, such
as the immunity enjoyed under certain circumstances by public officials.
Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 508 (1978) (officer immunity is derived
from the common law); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976)
(same). In this context, "our immunity decisions have been informed by
the common law" only "in the absence of explicit . . . congressional guidance." Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 747 (1982). See generally
ante, at 87-88 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Jackson, 98 Yale L. J., at 75-104.
Surely no one would deny Congress the power to abrogate those immunities if it should so choose.

under the proposed Constitution the people would not be
"secured even in the enjoyment of the benefit of the common
law." Mason, Objections to This Constitution of Government, in 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 637
(M. Farrand ed. 1911) (Farrand); see also 3 Elliot's Debates
446-449 (Patrick Henry, Virginia Convention). In particular, the Antifederalists worried about the failure of the proposed Constitution to provide for a reception of "the great
rights associated with due process" such as the right to a
jury trial, Jay II, at 1256, and they argued that "Congress's
powers to regulate the proceedings of federal courts made
the fate of these common-law procedural protections uncertain," id., at 1257.35 While Federalists met this objection by
arguing that nothing in the Constitution necessarily excluded the fundamental common-law protections associated
with due process, see, e. g., 3 Elliot's Debates 451 (George
Nicholas, Virginia Convention), they defended the decision
against any general constitutional reception of the common
law on the ground that constitutionalizing it would render it
"immutable," see id., at 469-470 (Edmund Randolph, Virginia Convention), and not subject to revision by Congress,
id., at 550 (Edmund Pendleton, Virginia Convention); see also
infra, at 163-164.

The Framers also recognized that the diverse development
of the common law in the several States made a general federal reception impossible. "The common law was not the
same in any two of the Colonies," Madison observed; "in
some the modifications were materially and extensively different." Report on the Virginia Resolutions, House of Delegates, Session of 1799-1800, Concerning Alien and Sedition

(Alien and Sedition Laws).36 In particular, although there
is little evidence regarding the immunity enjoyed by the various colonial governments prior to the Revolution, the profound differences as to the source of colonial authority between chartered colonies, royal colonies, and so on seems
unlikely, wholly apart from other differences in circumstance,
to have given rise to a uniform body of immunity law.
There was not, then, any unified "Common Law" in America
that the Federal Constitution could adopt, Jay I, at 1056;
Stoebuck, Reception of English Common Law in the American Colonies, 10 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 393, 401 (1968) ("The
assumption that colonial law was essentially the same in all
colonies is wholly without foundation"), and, in particular,
probably no common principle of sovereign immunity, cf.
Alien and Sedition Laws 376. The Framers may, as Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall argued, have contemplated that
federal courts would respect state immunity law in diversity
cases, but the generalized principle of immunity that today's
majority would graft onto the Constitution itself may well
never have developed with any common clarity and, in any
event, has not been shown to have existed.

Finally, the Framers' aversion to a general federal reception of the common law is evident from the Federalists' re36 See also Justice Jay's Charge to the Grand Jury for the District of
New York (Apr. 4, 1790) (observing that at the time the Nation was

sponse to the Antifederalist claim that Article III grantedan unduly broad jurisdiction to the federal courts. That response was to emphasize the limited powers of the NationalGovernment. See, e. g., 3 Elliot's Debates 553 (John Marshall, Virginia Convention) ("Has the government of theUnited States power to make laws on every subject? . . . Can
they make laws affecting the mode of transferring property,or contracts, or claims, between citizens of the same state?
Can they go beyond the delegated powers?"); Jay II, at1260.

37 That answer assumes, of course, no generalized reception of English common law as federal law; otherwise,"arising under" jurisdiction would have extended to any subject comprehended by the general common law.Madison made this assumption absolutely clear during the
subsequent debates over the Alien and Sedition Acts, whichraised the issue of whether the Framers intended to recognize a general federal jurisdiction to try common-law crimes.Rejecting the idea of any federal reception, Madison insisted that

"the consequence of admitting the common law as thelaw of the United States, on the authority of the individual States, is as obvious as it would be fatal. As thislaw relates to every subject of legislation, and would be
paramount to the Constitutions and laws of the States,the admission of it would overwhelm the residuary sovereignty of the States, and by one constructive opera-tion new model the whole political fabric of the country."

Framers' resistance, the Court's reception of the English common law into
the Constitution itself in the very name of state sovereignty goes beyond
the limits of irony.

Framers intended a general reception of the English common law through the Constitution); Jay II, at 1254 (arguing
that "[i]t would have been untenable to maintain that the
body of British common law had been adopted by the Constitution . . . "). Madison concluded that

"[i]t is . . . distressing to reflect that it ever should have
been made a question, whether the Constitution, on the
whole face of which is seen so much labor to enumerate
and define the several objects of Federal power, could
intend to introduce in the lump, in an indirect manner,
and by a forced construction of a few phrases, the vast
and multifarious jurisdiction involved in the common
law--a law filling so many ample volumes; a law overspreading the entire field of legislation; and a law that
would sap the foundation of the Constitution as a system
of limited and specified powers." Alien and Sedition
Laws 382.

B

Given the refusal to entertain any wholesale reception of
common law, given the failure of the new Constitution to
make any provision for adoption of common law as such, and
given the protests already quoted that no general reception
had occurred, the Hans Court and the Court today cannot
reasonably argue that something like the old immunity doctrine somehow slipped in as a tacit but enforceable background principle. But see ante, at 72. The evidence is even
more specific, however, that there was no pervasive understanding that sovereign immunity had limited federalquestion jurisdiction.

As I have already noted briefly, see supra, at 105-106, the
Framers and their contemporaries did not agree about the

place of common-law state sovereign immunity even as tofederal jurisdiction resting on the Citizen-State Diversity

Clauses. Edmund Randolph argued in favor of ratificationon the ground that the immunity would not be recognized,
leaving the States subject to jurisdiction.38 Patrick Henryopposed ratification on the basis of exactly the same reading.
See 3 Elliot's Debates 543. On the other hand, James Madi-son, John Marshall, and Alexander Hamilton all appear to
have believed that the common-law immunity from suit
would survive the ratification of Article III, so as to be at aState's disposal when jurisdiction would depend on diversity.

This would have left the States free to enjoy a traditionalimmunity as defendants without barring the exercise of judicial power over them if they chose to enter the federal courts
as diversity plaintiffs or to waive their immunity as diversitydefendants. See

id., at 533 (Madison: the Constitution
"give[s] a citizen a right to be heard in the federal courts;and if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may

take cognizance of it"); 39 id., at 556 (Marshall: "I see a diffi38 See 3 Elliot's Debates 573 (the Constitution would "render valid and
effective existing claims" against the States). See also 2 id., at 491
(James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate: "When a citizen
has a controversy with another state, there ought to be a tribunal where
both parties may stand on a just and equal footing"). Wilson, as I noted
above, took a similar position in addressing the federal question, or arising
under, clause, remarking that the effect of the clause would be to require
States to honor pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants, as
had been promised in the Treaty of 1783. See n. 4, supra.

39 The Court accuses me of quoting this statement out of context, ante,

at 70, n. 12, but the additional material included by the Court makes no
difference. I am conceding that Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall all
agreed that Article III did not of its own force abrogate the States' preexisting common-law immunity, at least with respect to diversity suits.
None of the statements offered by the Court, however, purports to deal
with federal-question jurisdiction or with the question whether Congress,
acting pursuant to its Article I powers, could create a cause of action
against a State. As I explain further below, the views of Madison and his

culty in making a state defendant, which does not preventits being plaintiff "). As Hamilton stated in The Federalist

No. 81:

"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty, not to beamenable to the suit of an individual

without its consent.This is the general sense and the general practice of

mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes ofsovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every
state in the Union. Unless therefore, there is a surren-der of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will
remain with the states, and the danger intimated mustbe merely ideal." The Federalist No. 81, pp. 548-549
(J. Cooke ed. 1961).
See generally Fletcher, A Historical Interpretation of theEleventh Amendment: A Narrow Construction of an Affirmative Grant of Jurisdiction Rather than a ProhibitionAgainst Jurisdiction, 35 Stan. L. Rev. 1033, 1045-1054 (1983)
(discussing the adoption of the Citizen-State DiversityClauses); Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1902-1914. The
majority sees in these statements, and chiefly in Hamilton'sdiscussion of sovereign immunity in The Federalist No. 81,
an unequivocal mandate "which would preclude all federaljurisdiction over an unconsenting State."

Ante, at 70. Butthere is no such mandate to be found.

As I have already said, the immediate context of Hamil-ton's discussion in Federalist No. 81 has nothing to do with
federal-question cases. It addresses a suggestion "that anassignment of the public securities of one state to the citizens
of another, would enable them to prosecute that state in thefederal courts for the amount of those securities." The Federalist No. 81, at 548. Hamilton is plainly talking about a
allies on this more difficult question can be divined, if at all, only by reference to the more extended discussions by Hamilton in The Federalist
No. 32, and by Justice Iredell in his Chisholm dissent. Both those discussions, I submit, tend to support a congressional power of abrogation.

suit subject to a federal court's jurisdiction under theCitizen-State Diversity Clauses of Article III.

The general statement on sovereign immunity emphasizedby the majority then follows, along with a reference back
to The Federalist No. 32. The Federalist No. 81, at 548.
What Hamilton draws from that prior paper, however, is nota general conclusion about state sovereignty but a particular

point about state contracts:

"A recurrence to the principles there established willsatisfy us, that there is no colour to pretend that the

state governments, would by the adoption of that plan,
be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts intheir own way, free from every constraint but that which

flows from the obligations of good faith. The contractsbetween a nation and individuals are only binding on the
conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensionsto a compulsive force. They confer no right of action
independent of the sovereign will." Id., at 549.
The most that can be inferred from this is, as noted above,
that in diversity cases applying state contract law the immu-nity that a State would have enjoyed in its own courts is

carried into the federal court. When, therefore, the HansCourt relied in part upon Hamilton's statement, see 134
U. S., at 20, its reliance was misplaced; Hamilton was addressing diversity jurisdiction, whereas Hans involvedfederal-question jurisdiction under the Contracts Clause.

No general theory of federal-question immunity can be in-ferred from Hamilton's discussion of immunity in contract
suits. But that is only the beginning of the difficulties that
accrue to the majority from reliance on The Federalist No.
81.

Hamilton says that a State is "not . . . amenable to the suit
of an individual without its consent . . . . [u]nless . . . there is
a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention."
The Federalist No. 81, at 548-549 (emphasis deleted). He

immediately adds, however, that "[t]he circumstances which
are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty,
were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and
need not be repeated here." Id., at 549. The reference is
to The Federalist No. 32, also by Hamilton, which has this to
say about the alienation of state sovereignty:

"[A]s the plan of the Convention aims only at a partial
Union or consolidation, the State Governments would
clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they
before had and which were not by that act exclusively
delegated to the United States. This exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of State sovereignty would
only exist in three cases; where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union;
where it granted in one instance an authority to the
Union and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority
to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States
would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant. I use these terms to distinguish this last case
from another which might appear to resemble it; but
which would in fact be essentially different; I mean
where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be
productive of occasional interferences in the policy of
any branch of administration, but would not imply any
direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority." Id., at 200 (emphasis in original).

As an instance of the last case, in which exercising concurrent jurisdiction may produce interferences in "policy,"
Hamilton gives the example of concurrent power to tax
the same subjects:

"It is indeed possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a State which might render it inexpedient
that thus a further tax should be laid on the same article

Souter, J., dissenting
by the Union; but it would not imply a constitutionalinability to impose a further tax. The quantity of the

imposition, the expediency or inexpediency of an in-crease on either side, would be mutually questions of
prudence; but there would be involved no direct contra-diction of power. The particular policy of the national
and of the State systems of finance might now and thennot exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal forbearances. It is not however a mere possibility of in-convenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate
constitutional repugnancy, that can by implication alien-ate and extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty."
Id., at 202 (emphasis in original).
The first embarrassment Hamilton's discussion creates forthe majority turns on the fact that the power to regulate

commerce with Indian tribes has been interpreted as making
"Indian relations . . . the exclusive province of federal law."
County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470
U. S., at 234.40 We have accordingly recognized that "[s]tatelaws generally are not applicable to tribal Indians on an Indian reservation except where Congress has expressly provided that State laws shall apply." McClanahan v. Arizona
State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, 170-171 (1973) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Rice v. Olson, 324 U. S.

can have no force. . . . The whole intercourse between the United States
and this nation, is, by our Constitution and laws, vested in the government
of the United States"). This Court has repeatedly rejected state attempts to assert sovereignty over Indian lands. See, e. g., The New York
Indians, 5 Wall. 761, 769 (1867) (rejecting state attempt to tax reservation
lands); Worcester, supra, at 561-563 (nullifying an attempted prosecution
by the State of Georgia of a person who resided on Indian lands in violation of state law).

history").41 We have specifically held, moreover, that theStates have no power to regulate gambling on Indian lands.

California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S.202, 221-222 (1987). In sum, since the States have no sovereignty in the regulation of commerce with the tribes, on
Hamilton's view there is no source of sovereign immunityto assert in a suit based on congressional regulation of that

commerce. If Hamilton is good authority, the majority ofthe Court today is wrong.

Quite apart, however, from its application to this particu-lar Act of Congress exercising the Indian commerce power,
Hamilton's sovereignty discussion quoted above places theCourt in an embarrassing dilemma. Hamilton posited four
categories: congressional legislation on (a) subjects committed expressly and exclusively to Congress, (b) subjectsover which state authority is expressly negated, (c) subjects

over which concurrent authority would be impossible (as
"contradictory and repugnant"), and (d) subjects over which
concurrent authority is not only possible, but its exercise by
both is limited only by considerations of policy (as when one
taxing authority is politically deterred from adding too much
to the exaction the other authority is already making). But
what of those situations involving concurrent powers, like
the power over interstate commerce, see, e. g., Cooley v.
Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for
Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299 (1852) (recognizing
power of States to engage in some regulation of interstate
commerce), when a congressional statute not only binds the
States but even creates an affirmative obligation on the State

41 Although we have rejected a per se bar to state jurisdiction, it is clear
that such jurisdiction remains the exception and not the rule. See New
Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U. S. 324, 331-332 (1983) (footnotes
omitted) ("[U]nder certain circumstances a State may validly assert
authority over the activities of nonmembers on a reservation, and . . .
in exceptional circumstances a State may assert jurisdiction over the
on-reservation activities of tribal members").

as such, as in this case? Hamilton's discussion does not
seem to cover this (quite possibly because, as a good political
polemicist, he did not wish to raise it). If in fact it is fair to
say that Hamilton does not cover this situation, then the
Court cannot claim him as authority for the preservation of
state sovereignty and consequent immunity. If, however, on
what I think is an implausible reading, one were to try to
shoehorn this situation into Hamilton's category (c) (on the
theory that concurrent authority is impossible after passage
of the congressional legislation), then any claim of sovereignty and consequent immunity is gone entirely.

In sum, either the majority reads Hamilton as I do, to say
nothing about sovereignty or immunity in such a case, or it
will have to read him to say something about it that bars any
state immunity claim. That is the dilemma of the majority's
reliance on Hamilton's The Federalist No. 81, with its reference to No. 32. Either way, he is no authority for the
Court's position.

Thus, the Court's attempt to convert isolated statements
by the Framers into answers to questions not before them
is fundamentally misguided.42 The Court's difficulty is far
more fundamental, however, than inconsistency with a particular quotation, for the Court's position runs afoul of the
general theory of sovereignty that gave shape to the Framers' enterprise. An enquiry into the development of that
concept demonstrates that American political thought had so
revolutionized the concept of sovereignty itself that calling

partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties"); S. Elkins &

amount of attention and discussion given to the judiciary in the Constitutional Convention was only a fraction of that devoted to the executive and
legislative branches," and that the Framers deliberately left many questions open for later resolution).

We said in Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501U. S. 775, 779 (1991), that "the States entered the federal

system with their sovereignty intact," but we surely did notmean that they entered that system with the sovereignty
they would have claimed if each State had assumed inde-pendent existence in the community of nations, for even the
Articles of Confederation allowed for less than that. SeeArticles of Confederation, Art. VI, $ 1 ("No State without
the consent of the United States in Congress assembled,shall send any embassy to, or receive any embassy from, or
enter into any conference, agreement, alliance or treaty withany king, prince or state . . ."). While there is no need here
to calculate exactly how close the American States came tosovereignty in the classic sense prior to ratification of the
Constitution, it is clear that the act of ratification affectedtheir sovereignty in a way different from any previous political event in America or anywhere else. For the adoption ofthe Constitution made them members of a novel federal system that sought to balance the States' exercise of some sov-ereign prerogatives delegated from their own people with
the principle of a limited but centralizing federal supremacy.As a matter of political theory, this federal arrangement
of dual delegated sovereign powers truly was a more revolu-tionary turn than the late war had been. See, e. g., U. S.
Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995)(

44 Cf., e. g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 49, 160-162 (Cooper ed. 1803).

This modern notion of sovereignty is traceable to the writings of Jean
Bodin in the late 16th century. See J. Bodin, Six Books of the Commonwealth, bk. 2, ch. I, pp. 52-53 (M. Tooley, abr. & transl. 1967) (1576); see

were free to parcel them out to different governments anddifferent branches of the same government as they saw fit.

See F. McDonald, Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Or-igins of the Constitution 278 (1985). As James Wilson emphasized, the location of ultimate sovereignty in the People
meant that "[t]hey can distribute one portion of power to themore contracted circle called State governments; they can

also furnish another proportion to the government of theUnited States." 1 Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788, supra, at 302.46Under such a scheme, Alexander Hamilton explained, "[i]t
does not follow . . . that each of the portions of powers dele-gated to [the national or state government] is not sovereign
with regard to its proper objects." Hamilton, Opinion on theConstitutionality of an Act to Establish a Bank, in 8 Papers
of Alexander Hamilton 98 (Syrett ed. 1965) (emphasis in orig-inal).

47 A necessary consequence of this view was that "the

Government of the United States has sovereign power as to
its declared purposes & trusts." Ibid. Justice Iredell was
to make the same observation in his Chisholm dissent, commenting that "[t]he United States are sovereign as to all the
powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State in
the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved." 2
Dall., at 435. And to the same point was Chief Justice Mar46 See also U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995)
(Kennedy, J., concurring) (the Constitution "created a legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government,
each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual
rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it").

47 See Amar, 96 Yale L. J., at 1434-1435 ("The ultimate American answer

[to the British notion that the sovereign was by definition above the law],
in part, lay in a radical redefinition of governmental `sovereignty.' Just
as a corporation could be delegated limited sovereign privileges by the
King-in-Parliament, so governments could be delegated limited powers to
govern. Within the limitations of their charters, governments could be
sovereign, but that sovereignty could be bounded by the terms of the
delegation itself" (footnote omitted)).

shall's description of the National and State Governments as"each sovereign, with respect to the objects committed to it,

and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committedto the other." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 410
(1819).Given this metamorphosis of the idea of sovereignty in the
years leading up to 1789, the question whether the old immu-nity doctrine might have been received as something suitable for the new world of federal-question jurisdiction is acrucial one.

48 The answer is that sovereign immunity as it

would have been known to the Framers before ratificationthereafter became inapplicable as a matter of logic in a federal suit raising a federal question. The old doctrine, afterall, barred the involuntary subjection of a sovereign to the
system of justice and law of which it was itself the font, sinceto do otherwise would have struck the common-law mind
from the Middle Ages onward as both impractical and ab-surd. See, e. g., Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349,
353 (1907) (Holmes, J.) ("A sovereign is exempt from suit . . .on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal
right as against the authority that makes the law on whichthe right depends").

49 But the ratification demonstrated

48 See, e. g., Amar, supra, at 1436 ("By thus relocating true sovereignty
in the People themselves . . . Americans domesticated government power
and decisively repudiated British notions of `sovereign' governmental omnipotence" (footnote omitted)). That this repudiation extended to traditional principles of sovereign immunity is clear from Justice Wilson's opinion in Chisholm, in which he blasted "the haughty notions of state
independence, state sovereignty and state supremacy" as allowing "the
state [to] assum[e] a supercilious pre-eminence above the people who have
formed it." 2 Dall., at 461.

49 See also Hobbes, supra, at 130 ("The sovereign of a Commonwealth,

be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil laws. . . . For he

that state governments were subject to a superior regime oflaw in a judicial system established, not by the State, but by

the people through a specific delegation of their sovereignpower to a National Government that was paramount within
its delegated sphere. When individuals sued States to enforce federal rights, the Government that corresponded tothe "sovereign" in the traditional common-law sense was not

the State but the National Government, and any state immu-nity from the jurisdiction of the Nation's courts would have
required a grant from the true sovereign, the people, in theirConstitution, or from the Congress that the Constitution had
empowered. We made a similar point in Nevada v. Hall,440 U. S., at 416, where we considered a suit against a State
in another State's courts:

"This [traditional] explanation [of sovereign immunity]
adequately supports the conclusion that no sovereign
may be sued in its own courts without its consent, but
it affords no support for a claim of immunity in another
sovereign's courts. Such a claim necessarily implicates
the power and authority of a second sovereign; its source
must be found either in an agreement, express or implied, between the two sovereigns, or in the voluntary
decision of the second to respect the dignity of the first
as a matter of comity."

Cf. United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 646 (1892) (recognizing that a suit by the National Government against a State
"does no violence to the inherent nature of sovereignty").
Subjecting States to federal jurisdiction in federal-question
cases brought by individuals thus reflected nothing more
than Professor Amar's apt summary that "[w]here governments are acting within the bounds of their delegated `sovereign' power, they may partake of sovereign immunity; where

will. . . . It follows of necessity that the king cannot be subject to his
own laws").

not, not." Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 YaleL. J. 1425, 1490-1491, n. 261 (1987).

State immunity to federal-question jurisdiction would,moreover, have run up against the common understanding
of the practical necessity for the new federal relationship.According to Madison, the "multiplicity," "mutability," and
"injustice" of then-extant state laws were prime factors re-quiring the formation of a new government. 1 Farrand 318-
319 (remarks of J. Madison).50 These factors, Madison wroteto Jefferson, "contributed more to that uneasiness which
produced the Convention, and prepared the Public mind fora general reform, than those which accrued to our national
character and interest from the inadequacy of the Confedera-tion to its immediate objects." 5 Writings of James Madison
27 (G. Hunt ed. 1904). These concerns ultimately found con-crete expression in a number of specific limitations on state
power, including provisions barring the States from enactingbills of attainder or ex post facto laws, coining money or
emitting bills of credit, denying the privileges and immuni-ties of out-of-staters, or impairing the obligation of contracts.
But the proposed Constitution also dealt with the old prob-lems affirmatively by granting the powers to Congress enumerated in Article I, $ 8, and by providing through the Su-premacy Clause that Congress could pre-empt state action
in areas of concurrent state and federal authority.Given the Framers' general concern with curbing abuses
by state governments, it would be amazing if the scheme ofdelegated powers embodied in the Constitution had left the
National Government powerless to render the States judi-cially accountable for violations of federal rights. And of
course the Framers did not understand the scheme to leave

50 See also Wood 466 ("[O]nce men grasped, as they increasingly did in
the middle [1780's], that reform of the national government was the best
means of remedying the evils caused by the state governments, then the
revision of the Articles of Confederation assumed an impetus and an importance that it had not had a few years earlier").

the Government powerless. In The Federalist No. 80, at
535, Hamilton observed that "[n]o man of sense will believe
that such prohibitions [running against the States] would be
scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in the
government to restrain or correct the infractions of them,"
and that "an authority in the federal courts, to over-rule such
as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of
union" was the Convention's preferred remedy. By speaking in the plural of an authority in the federal "courts," Hamilton made it clear that he envisioned more than this Court's
exercise of appellate jurisdiction to review federal questions
decided by state courts. Nor is it plausible that he was
thinking merely of suits brought against States by the National Government itself, which The Federalist's authors did
not describe in the paternalistic terms that would pass without an eyebrow raised today. Hamilton's power of the Government to restrain violations of citizens' rights was a power
to be exercised by the federal courts at the citizens' behest.
See also Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh
Amendment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1342, 1367-1371 (1989) (discussing the Framers' concern with preserving as much state
accountability as possible even in the course of enacting the
Eleventh Amendment).

This sketch of the logic and objectives of the new federal
order is confirmed by what we have previously seen of the
preratification debate on state sovereign immunity, which in
turn becomes entirely intelligible both in what it addressed
and what it ignored. It is understandable that reasonable
minds differed on the applicability of the immunity doctrine
in suits that made it to federal court only under the original
Diversity Clauses, for their features were not wholly novel.
While they were, of course, in the courts of the new and, for
some purposes, paramount National Government, the law
that they implicated was largely the old common law (and in
any case was not federal law). It was not foolish, therefore,

to ask whether the old law brought the old defenses with it.But it is equally understandable that questions seem not to

have been raised about state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases. The very idea of a federal question depended on the rejection of the simple concept of sovereigntyfrom which the immunity doctrine had developed; under the
English common law, the question of immunity in a systemof layered sovereignty simply could not have arisen. Cf.,
e. g., Jay II, at 1282-1284; Du Ponceau, A Dissertation on theNature and Extent of Jurisdiction of Courts of the United
States, at 6-7.51 The Framers' principal objectives in re-jecting English theories of unitary sovereignty, moreover,
would have been impeded if a new concept of sovereign im-munity had taken its place in federal-question cases, and
would have been substantially thwarted if that new immu-nity had been held to be untouchable by any congressional
effort to abrogate it.52

51 Cf. Jay I, at 1033-1034 ("English common law might afford clues to
the meaning of some terms in the Constitution, but the absence of any
close federal model was recognized even at the Convention"); F. Coker,
Commentary, in R. Pound, C. McIlwain, & R. Nichols, Federalism as a
Democratic Process 81-82 (1942).

52 See, e. g., Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537, 543 (1903) (acknowledging the

immunity recognized in Hans and other cases, but observing that "[i]t
would, indeed, be most unfortunate if the immunity of the individual
States from suits by citizens of other States, provided for in the Eleventh
Amendment, were to be interpreted as nullifying those other provisions
which confer power on Congress . . . all of which provisions existed before
the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which still exist, and which
would be nullified and made of no effect, if the judicial power of the United
States could not be invoked to protect citizens affected by the passage of
state laws disregarding these constitutional limitations"). The majority
contends that state compliance with federal law may be enforced by other
means, ante, at 71, n. 14, but its suggestions are all pretty cold comfort:
the enforcement resources of the Federal Government itself are limited;
appellate review of state court decisions is contingent upon state consent
to suit in state court, and is also called into question by the majority's
rationale, see supra, at 114; and the Court's decision today illustrates

Today's majority discounts this concern. Without citing asingle source to the contrary, the Court dismisses the historical evidence regarding the Framers' vision of the relation-ship between national and state sovereignty, and reassures
us that "the Nation survived for nearly two centuries without the question of the existence of [the abrogation] power
ever being presented to this Court." Ante, at 71.53 But we
are concerned here not with the survival of the Nation but
the opportunity of its citizens to enforce federal rights in a
way that Congress provides. The absence of any general
federal-question statute for nearly a century following ratification of Article III (with a brief exception in 1800) hardly
counts against the importance of that jurisdiction either in
the Framers' conception or in current reality; likewise, the
fact that Congress has not often seen fit to use its power of
abrogation (outside the Fourteenth Amendment context, at
least) does not compel a conclusion that the power is not
important to the federal scheme. In the end, is it plausible

the uncertainty that the Court will always permit enforcement of federal
law by suits for prospective relief against state officers. Moreover, the
majority's position ignores the importance of citizen suits to enforcement
of federal law. See, e. g., Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 263 (1975) (acknowledging that, in many instances, "Congress has opted to rely heavily on private enforcement to implement public
policy"); see also S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 2 (Civil Rights Attorney's Fees
Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. $ 1988) (recognizing that "[a]ll of these civil
rights laws depend heavily upon private enforcement"); Pennsylvania v.
Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711, 737 (1987)
(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (noting importance of citizens' suits under federal environmental laws).

53 The Court's further assertion, that "Congress itself waited nearly a

century before even conferring federal-question jurisdiction on the lower
federal courts," ante, at 71, is simply incorrect. As I have noted, numerous early statutes conferred federal-question jurisdiction on the federal
courts operating under the original Judiciary Act in particular kinds of
cases, and the Judiciary Act of 1800 provided for general federal-question
jurisdiction in the brief period before its repeal in 1801. See n. 12, supra.

to contend that the plan of the convention was meant to leave
the National Government without any way to render individuals capable of enforcing their federal rights directly against
an intransigent State?

C

The considerations expressed so far, based on text, Chisholm, caution in common-law reception, and sovereignty theory, have pointed both to the mistakes inherent in Hans and,
even more strongly, to the error of today's holding. Although for reasons of stare decisis I would not today disturb
the century-old precedent, I surely would not extend its
error by placing the common-law immunity it mistakenly
recognized beyond the power of Congress to abrogate. In
doing just that, however, today's decision declaring state
sovereign immunity itself immune from abrogation in
federal-question cases is open to a further set of objections
peculiar to itself. For today's decision stands condemned
alike by the Framers' abhorrence of any notion that such
common-law rules as might be received into the new legal
systems would be beyond the legislative power to alter or
repeal, and by its resonance with this Court's previous essays in constitutionalizing common-law rules at the expense
of legislative authority.

1

I have already pointed out how the views of the Framers
reflected the caution of state constitutionalists and legislators over reception of common-law rules, a caution that the
Framers exalted to the point of vigorous resistance to any
idea that English common-law rules might be imported
wholesale through the new Constitution. The state politicians also took pains to guarantee that once a common-law
rule had been received, it would always be subject to legislative alteration, and again the state experience was reflected
in the Framers' thought. Indeed, the Framers' very insist517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT
160 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDA

Souter, J., dissenting
ence that no common-law doctrine would be received by virtue of ratification was focused in their fear that elements of
the common law might thereby have been placed beyond the
power of Congress to alter by legislation.

The imperative of legislative control grew directly out of
the Framers' revolutionary idea of popular sovereignty. According to one historian, "[s]hared ideas about the sovereignty of the people and the accountability of government to
the people resulted at an early date in a new understanding
of the role of legislation in the legal system. . . . Whereas a
constitution had been seen in the colonial period as a body
of vague and unidentifiable precedents and principles of common law origin that imposed ambiguous restrictions on the
power of men to make or change law, after independence it
came to be seen as a written charter by which the people
delegated powers to various institutions of government and
imposed limitations on the exercise of those powers. . . .
[T]he power to modify or even entirely to repeal the common
law . . . now fell explicitly within the jurisdiction of the legislature." W. Nelson, Americanization of the Common Law
90 (1975).54

Virtually every state reception provision, be it constitutional or statutory, explicitly provided that the common law
was subject to alteration by statute. See Wood 299-300;
Jones 99. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776, for instance, provided that "the common law of England, as well
as so much of the statute law, as have been heretofore practised in this Colony, shall still remain in force, until they shall

54 Considering the example of Massachusetts, Professor Nelson observes
that "the clearest illustration that legislation was coming to rest on the
arbitrary power of a majoritarian legislature rather than on its conformity
with past law and principle was the ease with which statutes altering
common law rights were enacted and repealed in the 1780s in response to
changing election results." Nelson, Americanization of the Common Law,
at 91-92.

Connecticut, which did not enact any reception statute or constitutional
provision, adopted the common law by judicial decision insofar as it was
appropriate for local conditions. See 1 Powell & Rohan, supra, || 52, at
140-141, and n. 77; Hall, 4 Vand. L. Rev., at 800; Fitch v. Brainerd, 2 Day
163 (Conn. 1805). Maryland's position appears to have been articulated in
an oath prescribed by the Assembly in 1728 for justices of the Provincial
Court. The oath required that the justices act "according to the Laws,
Customs, and Directions of the Acts of Assembly of this Province; and
where they are silent, according to the Laws, Statutes, and reasonable
Customs of England, as have been used and practiced in this Province
. . . ." M. Andrews, History of Maryland 227 (1929). Finally, although
Pennsylvania's reception statute did not state that the common law could
be altered by legislative enactment in so many words, it may be read as
assuming the primacy of legislative enactments, see 9 Statutes at Large
of Pennsylvania 29-30 (Mitchell & Flanders eds. 1903) (Act of Jan. 28,
1777) (declaring prior Acts of the general assembly to still be in force, as
well as "the common law and such of the statute laws of England as have
heretofore been in force in the said province . . ."), and the state assembly
seems to have believed it had the power to depart from common law even
prior to independence. See Warren, History of the American Bar, at 103;
cf. Kirk v. Dean, 2 Binn. 341, 345 (Pa. 1810) (interpreting the state constitution as permitting departures from common-law rules where local circumstances required it).

56 It bears emphasis that, in providing for statutory alteration of the

common law, the new States were in no way departing from traditional
understandings. It is true that the colonial charters had generally rendered colonial legislation void to the extent that it conflicted with English
common law, but this principle was simply indicative of the Colonies' legal

I have already indicated that the Framers did not forgetthe state-law examples. When Antifederalists objected that

the 1787 draft failed to make an explicit adoption of certaincommon-law protections of the individual, part of the Federalists' answer was that a general constitutional reception ofthe common law would bar congressional revision. Madison
was particularly concerned with the necessity for legislativecontrol, noting in a letter to George Washington that "every
State has made great inroads & with great propriety on this
monarchical code." Letter from James Madison to GeorgeWashington (Oct. 18, 1787), reprinted in 3 Farrand 130, App.

A (emphasis in original).57 Madison went on to insist that
subjugation to the mother country and, in any event, seldom enforced in
practice. See Stoebuck, 10 Wm. & Mary L. Rev., at 396-398, 419-420.
The traditional conception of the common law as it developed in England
had always been that it was freely alterable by statute. T. Plucknett, A
Concise History of the Common Law 336-337 (5th ed. 1956); see also T.
Plucknett, Statutes and Their Interpretation in the First Half of the Fourteenth Century 26-31 (1922) (finding no historical support for the claim
that common law was "fundamental" or otherwise superior to statutes).
Coke appears to have attempted at one time to establish a paramount
common law, see, e. g., Dr. Bonham's Case, 8 Co. Rep. 107a, 118a, 77 Eng.
Rep. 638, 652 (C. P. 1610), but that attempt never took root in England.
See Plucknett, Concise History of the Common Law, at 337; Jones 130; J.
Gough, Fundamental Law in English Constitutional History 202 (1955)
(observing that "[b]y the nineteenth century the overriding authority of
statute-law had become the accepted principle in the courts"). And although Coke's dictum was to have a somewhat greater influence in
America, that influence took the form of providing an early foundation for
the idea that courts might invalidate legislation that they found inconsistent with a written constitution. See Jones 130-132; Gough, supra, at 206-
207 (noting that Coke's view of fundamental law came to be transformed
and subsumed in American practice by treatment of the written constitution as fundamental law in the exercise of judicial review). As I demonstrate infra, the idea that legislation may be struck down based on principles of common law or natural justice not located within the constitutional
text has been squarely rejected in this country. See infra, at 165-168.

would be "destructive to republican principles"). Indeed, one reason for

"[t]he Common law is nothing more than the unwritten law,and is left by all the Constitutions equally liable to legislative

alterations." Ibid.58 Indeed, Madison anticipated, and re-jected, the Court's approach today when he wrote that if "the
common law be admitted as . . . of constitutional obligation,it would confer on the judicial department a discretion little
short of a legislative power . . . [which] would be permanentand irremediable by the Legislature." Alien and Sedition
Laws 380. "A discretion of this sort," he insisted, "has al-ways been lamented as incongruous and dangerous . . . ."
Id., at 381.59
Madison's suspicion of the common law was that it included "a thousand
heterogeneous & antirepublican doctrines." Letter from Madison to
Washington (Oct. 18, 1787), reprinted in 3 Farrand 130, App. A. "[I]t will
merit the most profound consideration," Madison was later to warn in his
Report on the Virginia Resolutions Concerning the Alien and Sedition
Laws, "how far an indefinite admission of the common law . . . might draw
after it the various prerogatives making part of the unwritten law of England." Alien and Sedition Laws 380. Such an admission, Madison feared,
would mean that "the whole code, with all its incongruities, barbarisms,
and bloody maxims, would be inviolably saddled on the good people of the
United States." Ibid. See also Amar, 96 Yale L. J., at 1490 ("[The] sole
basis [of absolute government immunity from all suits] is the British idea
that the sovereign government, as the source of all law, cannot itself be
bound by any law absent its consent. . . . [L]iterally every article of the
Federalist Constitution and every amendment in the Bill of Rights rests
on the repudiation of the British view" (footnote omitted)).

History confirms the wisdom of Madison's abhorrence ofconstitutionalizing common-law rules to place them beyond

the reach of congressional amendment. The Framers fearedjudicial power over substantive policy and the ossification of
law that would result from transforming common law intoconstitutional law, and their fears have been borne out every
time the Court has ignored Madison's counsel on subjectsthat we generally group under economic and social policy.
It is, in fact, remarkable that as we near the end of this
risdiction," ante, at 69, however; it is abundantly clear that we have drawn
both sorts of principles from the common law. See, e. g., Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 609 (1990) (plurality
opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting that American notion of personal jurisdiction
is a "common-law principle" that predates the Fourteenth Amendment).
Nothing in the history, moreover, suggests that common-law rules were
more immutable when they were jurisdictional rather than substantive in
nature. Nor is it true that "the principle of state sovereign immunity
stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the
former prompted a specific constitutional amendment." Ante, at 69. The
Seventh Amendment, after all, was adopted to respond to Antifederalist
concerns regarding the right to jury trial. See n. 34, supra. Indeed, that
Amendment vividly illustrates the distinction between provisions intended to adopt the common law (the Amendment specifically mentions
the "common law" and states that the common-law right "shall be preserved") and those provisions, like the Eleventh Amendment, that may
have been inspired by a common-law right but include no language of
adoption or specific reference. Finally, the Court's recourse to a vague
"jurisprudence in all civilized nations," ante, at 69, rather than the common law of England is unavailing. When the Constitution has received
such general principles into our law, for example, in the Admiralty Clause's
adoption of the general "law of nations" or "law of the sea," those principles have always been subject to change by congressional enactment.
See, e. g., Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 386 (1924) (noting that
although "the principles of the general maritime law, sometimes called the
law of the sea," were "embodied" in Art. III, $ 2, of the Constitution, they
remained "subject to power in Congress to alter, qualify or supplement");
The Nereide, 9 Cranch 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that the

century the Court should choose to open a new constitutional
chapter in confining legislative judgments on these matters
by resort to textually unwarranted common-law rules, for it
was just this practice in the century's early decades that
brought this Court to the nadir of competence that we identify with Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905).60

It was the defining characteristic of the Lochner era, and
its characteristic vice, that the Court treated the commonlaw background (in those days, common-law property rights
and contractual autonomy) as paramount, while regarding
congressional legislation to abrogate the common law on
these economic matters as constitutionally suspect. See,
e. g., Adkins v. Childrens Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525, 557
(1923) (finding abrogation of common-law freedom to contract for any wage an unconstitutional "compulsory exaction"); see generally Sunstein, Lochner's Legacy, 87 Colum.
L. Rev. 873 (1987). And yet the superseding lesson that
seemed clear after West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S.
379 (1937), that action within the legislative power is not
subject to greater scrutiny merely because it trenches upon
the case law's ordering of economic and social relationships,
seems to have been lost on the Court.

The majority today, indeed, seems to be going Lochner
one better. When the Court has previously constrained the
express Article I powers by resort to common-law or background principles, it has done so at least in an ostensible
effort to give content to some other written provision of the
Constitution, like the Due Process Clause, the very object of

60 Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 606 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting) ("The fulcrums of judicial review in [the Lochner cases] were the
notions of liberty and property characteristic of laissez-faire economics,
whereas the Commerce Clause cases turned on what was ostensibly a
structural limit of federal power, but under each conception of judicial
review the Court's character for the first third of the century showed itself
in exacting judicial scrutiny of a legislature's choice of economic ends and
of the legislative means selected to reach them").

which is to limit the exercise of governmental power. See,e. g., Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161 (1908). Some textual argument, at least, could be made that the Court wasdoing no more than defining one provision that happened to
be at odds with another. Today, however, the Court is notstruggling to fulfill a responsibility to reconcile two arguably
conflicting and Delphic constitutional provisions, nor is itstruggling with any Delphic text at all. For even the Court
concedes that the Constitution's grant to Congress of plenarypower over relations with Indian tribes at the expense of
any state claim to the contrary is unmistakably clear, andthis case does not even arguably implicate a textual trump
to the grant of federal-question jurisdiction.I know of only one other occasion on which the Court has
spoken of extending its reach so far as to declare that theplain text of the Constitution is subordinate to judicially discoverable principles untethered to any written provision.Justice Chase once took such a position almost 200 years ago:

"There are certain vital principles in our free Republi-can governments, which will determine and over-rule an
apparent and flagrant abuse of legislative power. . . .An act of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great first principles of the social compact,cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative
authority." Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (em-phasis deleted).

This position was no less in conflict with American consti-tutionalism in 1798 than it is today, being inconsistent with
the Framers' view of the Constitution as fundamental law.Justice Iredell understood this, and dissented (again) in an
opinion that still answers the position that "vital" or "back-ground" principles, without more, may be used to confine a
clear constitutional provision:

"[S]ome speculative jurists have held, that a legislativeact against natural justice must, in itself, be void; but I

cannot think that, under such a government, any Court
of Justice would possess a power to declare it so. . . .

". . . [I]t has been the policy of the American states,
. . . and of the people of the United States . . . to define
with precision the objects of the legislative power, and
to restrain its exercise within marked and settled
boundaries. If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions,
it is unquestionably void. . . . If, on the other hand, the
Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any
member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their
judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.
The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed
standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed
upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly
say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature
(possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an
act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent
with the abstract principles of natural justice." Id.,
at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in
part).

Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell's view, and
the idea that "first principles" or concepts of "natural justice"
might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law "all but disappeared in American discourse." J. Ely,
Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980). It should take more
than references to "background principle[s]," ante, at 72, and
"implicit limitation[s]," Welch, 483 U. S., at 496 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive
the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any
other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an
almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and
the constitutionalists of their generation.

The Court's holding that the States' Hans immunity may
not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in
this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to
order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take
the action required by the federal law. Just as with the
issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here
whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious
argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe. Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any
way on one's views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or Hans and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state
officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that
action directly against the State is barred. The answer to
this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit
under the rule in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), and
the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point
alone.

A

In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court
has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself
may be immune. Under Young, "a federal court, consistent
with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to
conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal
law." Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also
Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).

The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under
Young. Milliken, for example, was a suit, under the authority of Young, brought against Michigan's Governor, Attorney
General, Board of Education, Superintendent of Public In517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

struction, and Treasurer, which resulted in an order obligat-ing the State of Michigan to pay money from its treasury to

fund an education plan. The relief requested (and obtained)by the plaintiffs effectively ran against the State: state moneys were to be removed from the state treasury, and they
were to be spent to fund a remedial education program thatit would be the State's obligation to implement. To take

another example, Quern v. Jordan involved a court orderrequiring state officials to notify welfare beneficiaries of the
availability of past benefits. Once again, the defendantswere state officials, but it was the obligation of the State
that was really at issue: the notices would be sent from the
state welfare agency, to be returned to the state agency, and
the state agency would pay for the notices and any ensuing
awards of benefits. Indeed, in the years since Young was
decided, the Court has recognized only one limitation on the
scope of its doctrine: under Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651
(1974), Young permits prospective relief only and may not be
applied to authorize suits for retrospective monetary relief.

It should be no cause for surprise that Young itself appeared when it did in the national law. It followed as a matter of course after the Hans Court's broad recognition of
immunity in federal-question cases, simply because "[r]emedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are
necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the
supremacy of that law." Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68
(1985). Young provided, as it does today, a sensible way to
reconcile the Court's expansive view of immunity expressed
in Hans with the principles embodied in the Supremacy
Clause and Article III.

If Young may be seen as merely the natural consequence
of Hans, it is equally unsurprising as an event in the longer
history of sovereign immunity doctrine, for the rule we
speak of under the name of Young is so far inherent in the
jurisdictional limitation imposed by sovereign immunity as
to have been recognized since the Middle Ages. For that

long it has been settled doctrine that suit against an officerof the Crown permitted relief against the government despite the Crown's immunity from suit in its own courts andthe maxim that the King could do no wrong. See Jaffe, 77
Harv. L. Rev., at 3, 18-19; Ehrlich, No. XII: ProceedingsAgainst the Crown (1216-1377), pp. 28-29, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921).An early example, from "time immemorial" of a claim "affecting the Crown [that] could be pursued in the regularcourts [without consent since it] did not take the form of a
suit against the Crown," Jaffe, supra, at 1, was recognizedby the Statute of Westminster I, 1275, which established a
writ of disseisin against a King's officers. When a King'sofficer disseised any person in the King's name, the wrongfully deprived party could seek the draconian writ of attaintagainst the officer, by which he would recover his land.
Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 9. Following this example for-ward, we may see how the writ of attaint was ultimately
overtaken by the more moderate common-law writs of cer-tiorari and mandamus, "operat[ing] directly on the government; [and commanding] an officer not as an individual butas a functionary."

Id., at 16. Thus the Court of King'sBench made it clear in 1701 that "wherever any new jurisdiction is erected, be it by private or public Act of Parliament,they are subject to the inspections of this Court by writ
of error, or by certiorari and mandamus." The Case of
Cardiffe Bridge, 1 Salk. 146, 91 Eng. Rep. 135 (K. B.).

B
This history teaches that it was only a matter of coursethat once the National Constitution had provided the opportunity for some recognition of state sovereign immunity, thenecessity revealed through six centuries or more of history
would show up in suits against state officers, just as Hanswould later open the door to

Ex parte Young itself. Once,then, the Eleventh Amendment was understood to forbid suit

Souter, J., dissenting
against a State eo nomine, the question arose "which suitsagainst officers will be allowed and which will not be."

Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 20.

"It early became clear that a suit against an officer was
not forbidden simply because it raised a question as tothe legality of his action as an agent of government or

because it required him, as in mandamus, to perform anofficial duty. These as we know had been well established before the eleventh amendment as not necessarilyrequiring consent. To be sure the renewed emphasis
on immunity given by the eleventh amendment might
conceivably have been taken so to extend the doctrineas to exclude suits against state officers even in cases

where the English tradition would have allowed them.There was a running battle as to where the line would
be drawn. The amendment was appealed to as an argu-ment for generous immunity. But there was the vastly
powerful counterpressure for the enforcement of constitutional limits on the states. The upshot . . . was toconfine the amendment's prohibition more or less to the

occasion which gave it birth, to wit, the enforcement ofcontracts and to most (though not all) suits involving
the title and disposition of a state's real and personalproperty."

Id., at 20-21.

The earliest cases, United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115(1809), and

Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738
(1824), embrace the English practice of permitting suitsagainst officers, see Orth, Judicial Power of the United

States, at 34-35, 40-41, 122, by focusing almost exclusively
on whether the State had been named as a defendant. Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 123-124 (1828),
shifted this analysis somewhat, finding that a Governor could
not be sued because he was sued "not by his name, but by
his title," which was thought the functional equivalent of
suing the State itself. Madrazo did not, however, erase the

Souter, J., dissenting
fundamental principle of Osborn that sovereign immunitywould not bar a suit against a state officer. See,

e. g., Davis
v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203 (1873) (applying Osborn by enjoiningthe Governor of Texas to interfere with the possession of

land granted by the State); United States v. Lee, 106 U. S.
196 (1882) (applying Osborn in context of federal sovereignimmunity).

This simple rule for recognizing sovereign immunity with-out gutting substantial rights was temporarily muddled in
Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711 (1883), where the Court,although it "did not clearly say why," refused to hear a suit
that would have required a state treasurer to levy taxes to
pay interest on a bond. Currie, Sovereign Immunity and
Suits Against Government Officers, 1984 S. Ct. Rev. 149, 152.
(One recalls the circumstances of Hans itself, see supra, at
117-121.) The Court, however, again applied Osborn in the
Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S. 269 (1885) (permitting injunctions, restitution, and damages against state officers who
seized property to collect taxes already paid with interest
coupons the State had agreed to accept). In re Ayers, 123
U. S. 443, 502 (1887), sought to rationalize the competing
strands of doctrine on the ground that an action may be "sustained only in those instances where the act complained of,
considered apart from the official authority alleged as its justification, and as the personal act of the individual defendant,
constituted a violation of right for which the plaintiff was
entitled to a remedy at law or in equity against the wrongdoer in his individual character."

Ex parte Young restored the old simplicity by complementing In re Ayers with the principle that state officers
never have authority to violate the Constitution or federal
law, so that any illegal action is stripped of state character
and rendered an illegal individual act. Suits against these
officials are consequently barred by neither the Eleventh
Amendment nor Hans immunity. The officer's action "is
simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in at517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

tempting by the use of the name of the State to en-force a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional. . . . The State has no power to impart to himany immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States." Ex parte Young, 209 U. S., at
159-160.The decision in

Ex parte Young, and the historic doctrine
it embodies, thus plays a foundational role in American con-stitutionalism, and while the doctrine is sometimes called a

"fiction," the long history of its felt necessity shows it to besomething much more estimable, as we may see by considering the facts of the case. "Young was really and truly about
to damage the interest of plaintiffs. Whether what he was
about to do amounted to a legal injury depended on the
authority of his employer, the state. If the state could constitutionally authorize the act then the loss suffered by
plaintiffs was not a wrong for which the law provided
a remedy. . . . If the state could not constitutionally authorize
the act then Young was not acting by its authority." Orth,
Judicial Power of the United States, at 133. The doctrine
we call Ex parte Young is nothing short of "indispensable to
the establishment of constitutional government and the rule
of law." C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 292 (4th ed.
1983). See also Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction, at 393.

A rule of such lineage, engendered by such necessity,
should not be easily displaced, if indeed it is displaceable at
all, for it marks the frontier of the enforceability of federal
law against sometimes competing state policies. We have in
fact never before inferred a congressional intent to eliminate
this time-honored practice of enforcing federal law. That, of
course, does not mean that the intent may never be inferred,
and where, as here, the underlying right is one of statutory
rather than constitutional dimension, I do not in theory reject the Court's assumption that Congress may bar enforcement by suit even against a state official. But because in
practice, in the real world of congressional legislation, such

an intent would be exceedingly odd, it would be equally oddfor this Court to recognize an intent to block the customary

application of Ex parte Young without applying the rule rec-ognized in our previous cases, which have insisted on a clear
statement before assuming a congressional purpose to "af-fec[t] the federal balance,"

United States v. Bass, 404 U. S.336, 349 (1971). See also Will v. Michigan Dept. of State

Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989) ("[I]f Congress intends to alterthe `usual constitutional balance between the States and the
Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so`unmistakably clear in the language of the statute' ") (quoting
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 242);
Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-461 (1991). Our ha-bitual caution makes sense for just the reason we mentioned

in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S., at 230-231: it is "difficult tobelieve that . . . Congress, taking careful stock of the state
of Eleventh Amendment law, decided it would drop coy hintsbut stop short of making its intention manifest."

C
There is no question that by its own terms Young 's indis-pensable rule authorizes the exercise of federal jurisdiction

over respondent Chiles. Since this case does not, of course,involve retrospective relief,

Edelman's limit is irrelevant,and there is no other jurisdictional limitation. Obviously,

for jurisdictional purposes it makes no difference in principlewhether the injunction orders an official not to act, as in
Young, or requires the official to take some positive step, asin Milliken or Quern. Nothing, then, in this case renders
Young unsuitable as a jurisdictional basis for determining onthe merits whether petitioner is entitled to an order against
a state official under general equitable doctrine. The Courtdoes not say otherwise, and yet it refuses to apply

Young.There is no adequate reason for its refusal.

No clear statement of intent to displace the doctrine ofEx parte Young occurs in IGRA, and the Court is instead

Souter, J., dissenting
constrained to rest its effort to skirt Young on a series of
suggestions thought to be apparent in Congress's provision
of "intricate procedures" for enforcing a State's obligation
under the Act. The procedures are said to implicate a rule
against judicial creativity in devising supplementary procedures; it is said that applying Young would nullify the statutory procedures; and finally the statutory provisions are said
simply to reveal a congressional intent to preclude the application of Young.

1

The Court cites Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 423
(1988), in support of refraining from what it seems to think
would be judicial creativity in recognizing the applicability
of Young. The Court quotes from Chilicky for the general
proposition that when Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for violations of federal
law, this Court should not "creat[e]" additional remedies.
Ante, at 74. The Court reasons that Congress's provision in
IGRA of "intricate procedures" shows that it considers its
remedial provisions to be adequate, with the implication that
courts as a matter of prudence should provide no "additional" remedy under Ex parte Young. Ante, at 73-76.

Chilicky's remoteness from the point of this case is, however, apparent from its facts. In Chilicky, Congress had addressed the problem of erroneous denials of certain government benefits by creating a scheme of appeals and awards
that would make a successful claimant whole for all benefits
wrongly denied. The question was whether this Court
should create a further remedy on the model of Bivens v. Six
Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), for
such harms as emotional distress, when the erroneous denial
of benefits had involved a violation of procedural due process.
The issue, then, was whether to create a supplemental remedy, backward looking on the Bivens model, running against
a federal official in his personal capacity, and requiring an

517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

177Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)
Souter, J., dissenting
affirmative justification (as Bivens does). See Bivens,supra; FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484-486 (1994).

The Bivens issue in Chilicky (and in Meyer) is differentfrom the Young issue here in every significant respect.
Young is not an example of a novel rule that a proponent hasa burden to justify affirmatively on policy grounds in every
context in which it might arguably be recognized; it is a gen-eral principle of federal equity jurisdiction that has been recognized throughout our history and for centuries before ourown history began.

Young does not provide retrospectivemonetary relief but allows prospective enforcement of federal law that is entitled to prevail under the SupremacyClause. It requires not money payments from a government employee's personal pocket, but lawful conduct by apublic employee acting in his official capacity.

Young wouldnot function here to provide a merely supplementary regime

of compensation to deter illegal action, but the sole jurisdic-tional basis for an Article III court's enforcement of a clear
federal statutory obligation, without which a congressionalact would be rendered a nullity in a federal court. One cannot intelligibly generalize from Chilicky's standards for im-posing the burden to justify a supplementary scheme of tort
law to the displacement of Young's traditional and indispen-sable jurisdictional basis for ensuring official compliance
with federal law when a State itself is immune from suit.

2
Next, the Court suggests that it may be justified in dis-placing Young because Young would allow litigants to ignore

the "intricate procedures" of IGRA in favor of a menu ofstreamlined equity rules from which any litigant could order
as he saw fit. But there is no basis in law for this sugges-tion, and the strongest authority to reject it.

Young did notestablish a new cause of action and it does not impose any

particular procedural regime in the suits it permits. Itstands, instead, for a jurisdictional rule by which paramount

517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT
178 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDA

Souter, J., dissenting
federal law may be enforced in a federal court by substitut-ing a nonimmune party (the state officer) for an immune one

(the State itself). Young does no more and furnishes noauthority for the Court's assumption that it somehow
pre-empts procedural rules devised by Congress for particular kinds of cases that may depend on Young for federaljurisdiction.

61

If, indeed, the Court were correct in assuming that Con-gress may not regulate the procedure of a suit jurisdictionally dependent on Young, the consequences would be revolu-tionary, for example, in habeas law. It is well established
that when a habeas corpus petitioner sues a state official al-leging detention in violation of federal law and seeking the
prospective remedy of release from custody, it is the doctrineidentified in

Ex parte Young that allows the petitioner to
evade the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment (or,
more properly, the Hans doctrine). See Young, 209 U. S., at
167-168; Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp.,
337 U. S. 682, 689-690 (1949).62 And yet Congress has im61 The Court accuses me of misrepresenting its argument. Ante, at 75,
n. 17. The Court's claim, as I read it, is not that Congress cannot authorize federal jurisdiction under Ex parte Young over a cause of action with
a limited remedial scheme, but rather that remedial limitations on the
underlying cause of action do not apply to a claim based on Ex parte
Young. Otherwise, the existence of those remedial limitations would provide no reason for the Court to assume that Congress did not intend to
permit an action under Young; rather, the limitations would apply regardless of whether the suit was brought against the State or a state officer.

posed a number of restrictions upon the habeas remedy, see,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) (requiring exhaustion of state remedies prior to bringing a federal habeas petition), and thisCourt has articulated several more, see, e. g., McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Teague v. Lane,489 U. S. 288 (1989) (limiting applicability of "new rules" on
habeas); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993) (apply-ing a more deferential harmless-error standard on habeas
review). By suggesting that Ex parte Young provides afree-standing remedy not subject to the restrictions otherwise imposed on federal remedial schemes (such as habeascorpus), the Court suggests that a state prisoner may circumvent these restrictions by ostensibly bringing his suitunder Young rather than 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. The Court's
view implies similar consequences under any number ofsimilarly structured federal statutory schemes.

63

This, of course, cannot be the law, and the plausible ra-tionale for rejecting the Court's contrary assumption is that

Congress has just as much authority to regulate suits whenjurisdiction depends on Young as it has to regulate when
Young is out of the jurisdictional picture. If Young does notpreclude Congress from requiring state exhaustion in habeas
cases (and it clearly does not), then Young does not bar theapplication of IGRA's procedures when effective relief is
sought by suing a state officer.

3
The Court's third strand of reasoning for displacing Exparte Young is a supposed inference that Congress so in63 Many other federal statutes impose obligations on state officials, the
enforcement of which is subject to "intricate provisions" also statutorily
provided. See, e. g., Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C.

environmental law); Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know
Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 11001 (privately enforceable requirement that States
form commissions, appointed by the Governor, to generate plans for

tended. Since the Court rests this inference in large parton its erroneous assumption that the statute's procedural

limitations would not be applied in a suit against an officerfor which Young provided the jurisdictional basis, the error
of that assumption is enough to show the unsoundness of anyinference that Congress meant to exclude

Young's applica-tion. But there are further reasons pointing to the utter

implausibility of the Court's reading of the congressionalmind.

IGRA's jurisdictional provision reads as though it hadbeen drafted with the specific intent to apply to officer liability under Young. It provides that "[t]he United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over . . . any cause ofaction . . .

arising from the failure of a State to enter into
negotiations . . . or to conduct such negotiations in goodfaith." 25 U. S. C. $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) (emphasis added). This

language does not limit the possible defendants to States andis quite literally consistent with the possibility that a tribe
could sue an appropriate state official for a State's failure tonegotiate.

64 The door is so obviously just as open to jurisdiction over an officer under Young as to jurisdiction over aState directly that it is difficult to see why the statute would

have been drafted as it was unless it was done in anticipationthat

Young might well be the jurisdictional basis for enforcement action.But even if the jurisdictional provision had spoken narrowly of an action against the State itself (as it subsequently
speaks in terms of the State's obligation), that would be noindication that Congress had rejected the application of

Young. An order requiring a "State" to comply with federal

64 In order for any person (whether individual or entity) to be a proper
defendant under $ 2710(d)(7) (and in order for standing to exist, since one
of its requirements is redressability), that person, of course, would need
to have some connection to the State's negotiations. See Young, 209 U. S.,
at 157; Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 803 (1992). The obvious
candidates are the responsible state officials.

law can, of course, take the form of an order directed to theState in its sovereign capacity. But as

Ex parte Young and
innumerable other cases show, there is nothing incongruousabout a duty imposed on a "State" that Congress intended

to be effectuated by an order directed to an appropriate state
official. The habeas corpus statute, again, comes to mind.It has long required "the State," by "order directed to an

appropriate State official," to produce the state-court recordwhere an indigent habeas petitioner argues that a state
court's factual findings are not fairly supported in the record.See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e) ("the State shall produce such part
of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to
do so by order directed to an appropriate State official"). If,
then, IGRA's references to "a State's" duty were not enforceable by order to a state official, it would have to be for some
other reason than the placement of the statutory duty on
"the State."

It may be that even the Court agrees, for it falls back to
the position, see ante, at 75, n. 17, that only a State, not
a state officer, can enter into a compact. This is true but
wholly beside the point. The issue is whether negotiation
should take place as required by IGRA and an officer (indeed, only an officer) can negotiate. In fact, the only case
cited by the Court, State ex rel. Stephan v. Finney, 251 Kan.
559, 836 P. 2d 1169 (1992), makes that distinction abundantly clear.

Finally, one must judge the Court's purported inference
by stepping back to ask why Congress could possibly have
intended to jeopardize the enforcement of the statute by excluding application of Young's traditional jurisdictional rule,
when that rule would make the difference between success
or failure in the federal court if state sovereign immunity
was recognized. Why would Congress have wanted to go
for broke on the issue of state immunity in the event the
State pleaded immunity as a jurisdictional bar? Why would
Congress not have wanted IGRA to be enforced by means of

Souter, J., dissenting
a traditional doctrine giving federal courts jurisdiction overstate officers, in an effort to harmonize state sovereign immunity with federal law that is paramount under the Supremacy Clause? There are no plausible answers to these
questions.

D

There is, finally, a response to the Court's rejection of
Young that ought to go without saying. Our longstanding
practice is to read ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional
infirmity, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988)
(" `every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in
order to save a statute from unconstitutionality' ") (quoting
Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895)). This practice alone (without any need for a clear statement to displace
Young) would be enough to require Young 's application. So,
too, would the application of another rule, requiring courts
to choose any reasonable construction of a statute that would
eliminate the need to confront a contested constitutional
issue (in this case, the place of state sovereign immunity in
federal-question cases and the status of Union Gas). NLRB
v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500-501 (1979).
Construing the statute to harmonize with Young, as it
readily does, would have saved an Act of Congress and rendered a discussion on constitutional grounds wholly unnecessary. This case should be decided on this basis alone.

V
Absent the application of Ex parte Young, I would, of
course, follow Union Gas in recognizing congressional power
under Article I to abrogate Hans immunity. Since the reasons for this position, as explained in Parts II-III, supra,
tend to unsettle Hans as well as support Union Gas, I should
add a word about my reasons for continuing to accept Hans's
holding as a matter of stare decisis.

The Hans doctrine was erroneous, but it has not pre-viously proven to be unworkable or to conflict with later doctrine or to suffer from the effects of facts developed since itsdecision (apart from those indicating its original errors). I
would therefore treat Hans as it has always been treated infact until today, as a doctrine of federal common law. For,
as so understood, it has formed one of the strands of thefederal relationship for over a century now, and the stability
of that relationship is itself a value that stare decisis aimsto respect.

In being ready to hold that the relationship may still bealtered, not by the Court but by Congress, I would tread
the course laid out elsewhere in our cases. The Court hasrepeatedly stated its assumption that insofar as the relative
positions of States and Nation may be affected consistentlywith the Tenth Amendment,

65 they would not be modified

without deliberately expressed intent. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460-461. The plain-statement rule, which
"assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intendedto bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision," United States v. Bass, 404 U. S., at 349, is par-ticularly appropriate in light of our primary reliance on "[t]he
effectiveness of the federal political process in preservingthe States' interests,"

Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan
Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 552 (1985).66 Hence, we

65 The scope of the Tenth Amendment's limitations of congressional
power remains a subject of debate. New York v. United States, 505 U. S.
144 (1992), holds that principles of federalism are "violated by a formal
command from the National Government directing the State to enact a
certain policy." United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring). Some suggest that the prohibition extends further than barring the Federal Government from directing the creation of state law.
The views I express today should not be understood to take a position on
that disputed question.

66 See also The Federalist No. 46, at 319 (J. Madison) (explaining that the

Federal Government "will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States],
to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the pre517us1$37M 02-23-99 16:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

have required such a plain statement when Congress pre-empts the historic powers of the States, Rice v. Santa Fe

Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947), imposes a conditionon the grant of federal moneys, South Dakota v. Dole, 483
U. S. 203, 207 (1987), or seeks to regulate a State's ability todetermine the qualifications of its own officials,

Gregory,supra, at 464.

When judging legislation passed under unmistakable Arti-cle I powers, no further restriction could be required. Nor
does the Court explain why more could be demanded. Inthe past, we have assumed that a plain-statement requirement is sufficient to protect the States from undue federalencroachments upon their traditional immunity from suit.
See, e. g., Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways & Public
Transp., 483 U. S., at 475; Atascadero State Hospital v. Scan-lon, 473 U. S., at 239-240. It is hard to contend that this

rule has set the bar too low, for (except in Union Gas) wehave never found the requirement to be met outside the context of laws passed under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.The exception I would recognize today proves the rule,
moreover, because the federal abrogation of state immunitycomes as part of a regulatory scheme which is itself designed
to invest the States with regulatory powers that Congressneed not extend to them. This fact suggests to me that the
political safeguards of federalism are working, that a plain-statement rule is an adequate check on congressional overreaching, and that today's abandonment of that approach iswholly unwarranted.

There is an even more fundamental "clear statement" prin-ciple, however, that the Court abandons today. John Marshall recognized it over a century and a half ago in the verycontext of state sovereign immunity in federal-question
cases:

MORSE et al. v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OFVIRGINIA

et al.

appeal from the united states district court forthe western district of virginia

No. 94-203. Argued October 2, 1995--Decided March 27, 1996
Appellee Republican Party of Virginia (Party) invited all registered Virginia voters willing to declare their support for the Party's nominees at
the 1994 general election to become delegates to a convention to nominate the Party's candidate for United States Senator upon payment of
a registration fee. Appellants Bartholomew and Enderson desired, and
were qualified, to become delegates, but were rejected because they
refused to pay the fee; appellant Morse paid the fee with funds advanced
by supporters of the eventual nominee. Alleging, inter alia, that the
imposition of the fee violated $$ 5 and 10 of the Voting Rights Act of
1965, appellants filed a complaint seeking an injunction preventing the
Party from imposing the fee and ordering it to return the fee paid by
Morse. The three-judge District Court convened to consider the $ 5
and $ 10 claims granted the Party's motion to dismiss, concluding that
the "general rule" that $ 5 covers political parties to the extent that
they are empowered to conduct primary elections is inapplicable to the
selection of nominating convention delegates under a regulation promulgated by the Attorney General of the United States and under this
Court's summary decision in Williams v. Democratic Party of Georgia,
409 U. S. 809; and that only the Attorney General has authority to enforce $ 10.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
853 F. Supp. 212, reversed and remanded.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concluded:
1. The Party's decision to exact the registration fee was subject to

$ 5, which, among other things, prohibits Virginia and other covered jurisdictions from enacting or enforcing "any voting qualification
or prerequisite . . . different from that in force . . . on" a specified
date unless the change has been precleared by the Attorney General.
Pp. 193-229.

(a) The District Court erred in its application of the Attorney General's regulation, which unambiguously requires $ 5 preclearance when
a political party makes a change affecting voting if, inter alia, the party
is "acting under authority explicitly or implicitly granted by a covered
jurisdiction." Because Virginia law provides that the nominees of the

two major political parties shall automatically appear on the general
election ballot, without the need to declare their candidacy or to demonstrate their support with a nominating petition, and authorizes the two
parties to determine for themselves how they will select their nominees,
whether by primary, nominating convention, or some other method, the
Party "act[ed] under authority" of Virginia when it picked its candidate
at the convention and certified the nominee for automatic placement on
the general election ballot. Cf. Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 653,
n. 6, 660, 663. Because the conclusion that the Party's activities fall
directly within the regulation's scope is not contradicted, but is in fact
supported, by this Court's narrow holding in Williams, supra, the District Court also erred when it based its dismissal of appellants' complaint on that case. Pp. 194-203.

(b) The Act's language and structure compel the conclusion that $ 5
of its own force covers changes such as the Party's filing fee when the
electoral practice at issue is a nominating convention. This Court has
consistently construed the Act to require preclearance of any change
bearing on the "effectiveness" of a vote cast in a primary, special, or
general election, including changes in the composition of the electorate
that votes for a particular office. See, e. g., Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 570. By limiting the opportunity for voters to participate in the convention, the Party's filing fee undercuts their influence
on the field of candidates whose names will appear on the ballot, and
thus weakens the "effectiveness" of their votes cast in the general election itself. That $ 5 covers nonprimary nomination methods is also supported by Whitley v. Williams, decided with Allen, supra; by the text
and legislative history of $ 14, which defines the terms "vote" or "voting" to include "all action necessary to make a vote effective in any . . .
election," including the selection of persons for "party office"; and by the
text of $ 2, which bans any racially discriminatory voting qualification or
prerequisite if "the political processes leading to nomination or election . . . are not equally open to . . . [protected group] members." (Emphasis added.) Pp. 203-210.

(c) Consideration of the historical background which informed the
89th Congress when it passed the Act--particularly Terry v. Adams,
345 U. S. 461, and the other "White Primary Cases," in which the Court
applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a succession of measures by Texas authorities to exclude minority voters from their nomination processes--confirms the conclusion that $ 5 applies here. None of
the reasons offered to support appellees' contention that the White Primary Cases have no bearing on the Act's proper interpretation--(1) that
the Party's convention did not operate in a racially discriminatory manner; (2) that, although the Act was meant to enforce the Fifteenth

Syllabus
Amendment, the 89th Congress did not intend to legislate to that
Amendment's "outer limit"; and (3) that present-day Virginia is not a
one-party Commonwealth, unlike post-Reconstruction Texas--is persuasive. Pp. 210-219.

(d) None of the dissents' arguments for rejecting the foregoing construction of $ 5--that a political party is not a "State or political subdivision" within $ 5's literal meaning because it is not a governmental unit;
that the Court should not defer to the Attorney General's regulation
when construing $ 5's coverage; that a major political party is not a
"state actor" under the Court's decisions unless its nominees are virtually certain to win the general election; and that the construction
amounts to adoption of a "blanket rule" that all political parties must
preclear all of their internal procedures--is convincing. Pp. 220-226.

(e) Appellees' practical objections to the foregoing construction of

$ 5--(1) that it will create an administrative nightmare for political parties and the Justice Department, and (2) that it threatens to abridge
First Amendment associational rights--are rejected. Pp. 227-229.

2. Section 10 of the Act--which does not expressly mention private
actions when it authorizes the Attorney General to file suit against racially motivated poll taxes--does not preclude appellants from challenging the Party's registration fee as a prohibited poll tax. Evaluation of
congressional action must take into account its contemporary legal context. See, e. g., Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 698-
699. Because the Act was passed against a "backdrop" of decisions in
which implied causes of action were regularly found, see id., at 698, and
nn. 22-23, private parties may sue to enforce $ 10, just as they may
enforce $ 5, see Allen, supra, at 556, 557, n. 23, or $ 2, see, e. g., Chisom
v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380. Appellees' argument to the contrary was rejected in Allen, supra, at 556, n. 20, and is also refuted by $$ 3 and 14(e)
of the Act, both of which recognize the existence of a private $ 10 right
of action. Appellees' argument that a delegate registration fee is not a
poll tax addresses the merits and should be considered by the District
Court in the first instance. Pp. 230-235.

Justice Breyer, joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter, concluded:

1. In light of the legislative history demonstrating that, in 1965, Congress was well aware of the White Primary Cases, the failure of caseby-case enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment, and Mississippi's
then-recent efforts to use an "all-white" convention process to help nominate a Democratic candidate for President, and that the Act's "party
office" provision was adopted to cover the latter type of situation, the
Act cannot be interpreted to contain a loophole excluding all political
party activity, but must be read to apply to certain convention-based

practices and procedures with respect to voting. That is as far as the
Court need go to answer the statutory question presented by this case.
Indeed, it is as far as the Court should go, given the difficult First
Amendment questions about the extent to which the Federal Government, through preclearance procedures, can regulate the workings of a
political party convention, and about the limits imposed by the stateaction doctrine. Such questions are properly left for a case that
squarely presents them. The fee imposed here, however, is within the
scope of $ 5, and well outside the area of greatest associational concern. Pp. 235-240.

2. Congress intended to establish a private right of action to enforce

$ 10, no less than it did to enforce $$ 2 and 5. See Allen v. State Bd. of
Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 556-557. Justice Breyer expressed no view
as to the merits of the underlying $ 10 claim. P. 240.

190 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Justice Stevens announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

Justice Ginsburg joins.

In 1994, all registered voters in Virginia who were willingto declare their intent to support the Republican Party's

nominees for public office at the next election could partici-pate in the nomination of the Party's candidate for the office
of United States Senator if they paid either a $35 or $45registration fee. Appellants contend that the imposition of
that fee as a condition precedent to participation in the can-didate selection process was a poll tax prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The questions we must decide arewhether $ 5 of the Act required preclearance of the Party's
decision to exact the fee and whether appellants were per-mitted to challenge it as a poll tax prohibited by $ 10.

I
On December 16, 1993, the Republican Party of Virginia(Party) issued a call for a state convention to be held on June

3, 1994, to nominate the Republican candidate for UnitedStates Senator. The call invited all registered voters in
Virginia to participate in local mass meetings, canvasses,or conventions to be conducted by officials of the Party.
Any voter could be certified as a delegate to the stateconvention by a local political committee upon payment of
a registration fee of $35 or $45 depending on the date ofcertification. Over 14,000 voters paid the fee and took part
in the convention.In response to the call, appellants Bartholomew, Enderson,
and Morse sought to become delegates to the convention.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
As a registered voter in Virginia willing to declare his or
her intent to support the Party's nominee, each was eligible
to participate upon payment of the registration fee. Bartholomew and Enderson refused to pay the fee and did not
become delegates; Morse paid the fee with funds advanced
by supporters of the eventual nominee.

On May 2, 1994, appellants filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Virginia
alleging that the imposition of the registration fee violated

$$ 5 and 10 of the Voting Rights Act, 79 Stat. 439, 442, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973c 1 and 1973h, as well as the

which the prohibitions set forth in section 4(a) are in effect shall enact or
seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that
in force or effect on November 1, 1964, such State or subdivision may
institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification, prerequisite,
standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not
have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of
race or color, and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure: Provided, That
such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be
enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or
other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty
days after such submission, except that neither the Attorney General's
failure to object nor a declaratory judgment entered under this section
shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification,
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure. Any action under this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the United States

the Twenty-fourth Amendment 3 to the Constitution. Theysought an injunction preventing the Party from imposing the

fee and ordering it to return the fee paid by Morse. As $$ 5and 10 require, a three-judge District Court was convened
to consider the statutory claims. See Morse v. Oliver North
for U. S. Senate Comm., Inc., 853 F. Supp. 212 (WD Va. 1994).That court remanded the two constitutional claims to a

single-judge District Court,4 and, after expedited briefingand argument, granted the Party's motion to dismiss the $ 5
and $ 10 claims.After noting "a general rule" that political parties are subject to $ 5 to the extent that they are empowered to conductprimary elections, the court gave two reasons for concluding
that the rule did not apply to the selection of delegates toa state nominating convention. First, it read a regulation
promulgated by the Attorney General as disavowing $ 5coverage of political party activities other than the conduct
of primary elections. Second, it relied on our summary af-firmance of the District Court's holding in

Williams v. Dem-ocratic Party of Georgia, Civ. Action No. 16286 (ND Ga.,

Apr. 6, 1972), that $ 5 does not cover a party's decision tochange its method of selecting delegates to a national convention. See 409 U. S. 809 (1972). Its dismissal of the $ 10claim rested on its view that only the Attorney General has
authority to enforce that section of the Act. 853 F. Supp.,at 215-217.

II
In the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress enacted a com-plex scheme of remedies for racial discrimination in voting

that were to be applied in areas where such discriminationhad been most flagrant. Section 4 of the Act sets forth the
formula for identifying the jurisdictions in which such dis-crimination had occurred, see

not in effect on November 1, 1964. It is also undisputed thatif the candidate had been selected in a primary election, the

Party could not have enforced a voting qualification or proce-dure different from those in effect on November 1, 1964,
without first preclearing it under $ 5. Finally, we under-stand the Party to agree that if the registration fee had been
mandated by state law, or by a state election official, pre-clearance would have been required.

What is in dispute is whether the coverage of $ 5 encom-passes the Party's voting qualifications and procedures when
its nominees are chosen at a convention. In answering thatquestion, we first note that the District Court's decision is
not supported either by the Attorney General's regulation orby the narrow holding in the Williams case. We then explain why coverage is mandated by our consistent construc-tion of the text and history of the Act. Finally, we discuss
the $ 10 private cause of action issue.

The Party does not question the validity of the AttorneyGeneral's regulation. That regulation unambiguously provides that when a political party makes a change affectingvoting, $ 5 requires preclearance if two conditions are satisfied: The change must relate to "a public electoral functionof the party" and the party must be "acting under authority
explicitly or implicitly granted by a covered jurisdiction." 7

7 The regulation, which was adopted in 1981, provides:
"Political parties. Certain activities of political parties are subject to
the preclearance requirement of section 5. A change affecting voting
effected by a political party is subject to the preclearance requirement:
(a) If the change relates to a public electoral function of the party and (b)
if the party is acting under authority explicitly or implicitly granted by
a covered jurisdiction or political subunit subject to the preclearance requirement of section 5. For example, changes with respect to the recruitment of party members, the conduct of political campaigns, and the
drafting of party platforms are not subject to the preclearance require517us1$38I 02-23-99 16:40:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The Party does not deny that the delegate fee is a changethat relates to a public electoral function of the Party. It

argues, instead, that the regulation did not apply when itselected its nominee for United States Senator at a convention because it was not "acting under authority" granted by
Virginia. We disagree. The District Court erred in its
application of the regulation, because the Party exercised
delegated state power when it certified its nominee for automatic placement on Virginia's general election ballot.

Virginia law creates two separate tracks for access to the
ballot, depending on the affiliation of the candidate. An independent candidate for a statewide office must comply with
several requirements. The candidate must file a declaration
of candidacy with the State Board of Elections. He or she
must also file a petition signed by a predetermined number
of qualified voters. For elections to the United States Senate, that number is equal to one-half of one percent of the
registered voters in the Commonwealth, with at least 200
signatures from each of the 11 congressional districts. Va.
Code Ann. $ 24.2-506 (1993). In 1994, the required number
of signatures was 14,871.8

By contrast, the election code provides that the nominees
of the two major political parties 9 shall automatically appear

ment. Changes with respect to the conduct of primary elections at which
party nominees, delegates to party conventions, or party officials are chosen are subject to the preclearance requirement of section 5. Where appropriate the term `jurisdiction' (but not `covered jurisdiction') includes
political parties." 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995).

8 Virginia had 2,974,149 registered voters on January 1, 1994. See State

Bd. of Elections, Commonwealth of Virginia, Number of Precincts and
Registered Voters as of January 1, 1994, p. 4 (rev. Jan. 10, 1994). One-half
of one percent of that figure is 14,871.

9 Virginia law defines the term "political party" to include an organization of Virginia citizens "which, at either of the two preceding statewide
general elections, received at least ten percent of the total vote cast for
any statewide office filled in that election." Va. Code Ann. $ 24.2-101

on the general election ballot, without the need to declaretheir candidacy or to demonstrate their support with a nominating petition. $ 24.2-511. Party nominees are listedsequentially on the ballot before independent candidates, all
of whom are grouped together in a separate row or columnor spaced apart from the former.

10 $$ 24.2-613, 24.2-640.

Virginia law authorizes the two parties to determine forthemselves how they will select their nominees--by primary, by nominating convention, or by some other method.$ 24.2-509(A).

11 The Republican Party has taken advantage

(1993). The Democratic Party of Virginia and the Republican Party of
Virginia are the only organizations that satisfy that definition.

The definition has not been set in stone, however. Before 1991, the
term "political party" included only parties that polled 10 percent of the
vote at the last preceding statewide election. The Democratic Party,

however, did not field a candidate for the 1990 Senate race, and thus would
have lost its automatic ballot access for the next election. See 29 Council
of State Governments, Book of the States 260 (1992-1993 ed.). Rather
than allow that outcome, the Virginia Legislature amended the definition
to qualify parties that polled the requisite number of votes at either of the
two preceding elections and provided that the amendment would apply
retroactively. See 1991 Va. Acts, ch. 12, $ 1(7).

10 Virginia law also allows the major political parties to substitute a new

nominee should the chosen nominee die, withdraw, or have his or her nomination set aside. In that circumstance, other parties and independent
candidates are also permitted to make nominations, but the triggering
event occurs only when a party nominee cannot run. The statute thus
ensures that the major parties will always have a candidate on the ballot.
See Va. Code Ann. $$ 24.2-539, 24.2-540 (1993).

11 In some circumstances, a primary election is required unless the incumbent officeholder from that party consents to a different method of
nomination. Va. Code Ann. $ 24.2-509(B) (1993). In its brief, the Party
suggested that this one exception to plenary party control over the method
of nomination is unconstitutional. See Brief for Appellees 31. While it
appeared that the Party might bring suit before the 1996 election to try
to have the provision struck down, see Whitley, Republicans Wrestle with
Primary Issue, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Oct. 25, 1995, p. B1, it relented
after the Attorney General of Virginia determined that the law was probably valid. See Va. Op. Atty. Gen. (Nov. 22, 1995). In any event, because
the incumbent United States Senator was a Democrat in 1994, the Party

of these options in past elections. Its nominee has some-times been selected by the Party's State Central Committee,

sometimes by statewide convention, and sometimes by pri-mary election. Whatever method is chosen, state law requires the Commonwealth to place the name of the nomineeon the general election ballot.

12

In this dual regime, the parties "ac[t] under authority" ofVirginia when they decide who will appear on the general

election ballot. 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995). It is uncontestedthat Virginia has sole authority to set the qualifications for
ballot access. Pursuant to that authority, the Common-wealth has prescribed stringent criteria for access with
which nearly all independent candidates and political organi-zations must comply. But it reserves two places on its ballot--indeed, the top two positions 13--for the major partiesto fill with their nominees, however chosen. Those parties
are effectively granted the power to enact their own qualifi-cations for placement of candidates on the ballot, which the
Commonwealth ratifies by adopting their nominees. Byholding conventions, for example, the Party does not need to

was authorized to follow any method it chose, so long as it named its
candidate within the time period prescribed by the statute.

12 The Secretary of the Party is required to certify the name of the

nominee to the State Board of Elections. If certification is not timely,
however, the board will declare the chosen candidate to be the nominee
and treat his or her name as if certified. Va. Code Ann. $ 24.2-511 (1993).

13 Research has shown that placement at the top of a ballot often confers

an advantage to candidates so positioned. The classic study of the
phenomenon is H. Bain & D. Hecock, Ballot Position and Voter's Choice:
The Arrangement of Names on the Ballot and its Effect on the Voter
(1957). See also Note, California Ballot Position Statutes: An Unconstitutional Advantage to Incumbents, 45 S. Cal. L. Rev. 365 (1972) (listing other
studies); Note, Constitutional Problems with Statutes Regulating Ballot
Position, 23 Tulsa L. J. 123 (1987). Some studies have suggested that the
effect of favorable placement varies by type of election, visibility of the
race, and even the use of voting machines. See id., at 127. While the
research is not conclusive, it is reasonable to assume that candidates would
prefer positions at the top of the ballot if given a choice.

assemble thousands of signatures on a petition for its nomi-nee. In some years, as few as 550 nominators have selected

the Party's candidate for United States Senate.14 Even in1994, when the Party convention had its largest attendance
to date, fewer nominators were present than would havebeen necessary to meet the petition requirement.

15 In any

event, state law permits the Party to allow as many or as
few delegates as it sees fit to choose the Party nominee.The Party is thus delegated the power to determine part

of the field of candidates from which the voters must choose.Correspondingly, when Virginia incorporates the Party's
selection, it "endorses, adopts and enforces" the delegatequalifications set by the Party for the right to choose that
nominee. Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 664 (1944).The major parties have no inherent right to decide who
may appear on the ballot. That is a privilege conferred by
Virginia law, not natural law. If the Party chooses to avail
itself of this delegated power over the electoral process, it
necessarily becomes subject to the regulation.16

14 App. 24 (affidavit of David S. Johnson, Exec. Dir. of Republican Party
of Virginia || 12).

15 According to the Party, 14,614 voters attended the 1994 convention.

Ibid. A total of 14,871 signatures were required to qualify as an independent candidate. See n. 8, supra.

16 The Party argues that automatic ballot access is merely a "practical

accommodation to political reality" because the major parties have shown,
through their performance in previous elections, significant levels of voter
support. Brief for Appellees 32. According to the Party, the Party nominee need not demonstrate personal support because he or she is credited
with the Party's showing. Id., at 33 (citing Weisburd, Candidate-Making
and the Constitution: Constitutional Restraints on and Protections of
Party Nominating Methods, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 213, 242 (1984)).

Such "crediting" does not answer the question why the Party nominee
should receive automatic ballot access. The fact that the Party has polled
well in previous elections does not logically entail any conclusion about
the success of its present candidate--especially when that nominee is chosen at a convention attended by limited numbers of Party members, rather
than a primary. Furthermore, ballot access for all other candidates is

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In concluding that the regulation applies to the Party, weare guided by the reasoning of Smith v. Allwright, decided

more than half a century ago. There, Texas gave automaticballot access to the nominee of any party that polled a certain number of votes at the preceding general election, andrequired independent candidates to file nominating petitions.
Id., at 653, n. 6, 663. We explained that "recognition of theplace of the primary in the electoral scheme," rather than
the degree of state control over it, made clear that "statedelegation to a party of the power to fix the qualifications of
primary elections is delegation of a state function that maymake the party's action the action of the State."

Id., at 660.The only difference here is that Virginia has not required its

political parties to conduct primary elections to nominatetheir candidates. But the right to choose the method of
nomination makes the delegation of authority in this casemore expansive, not less, for the Party is granted even
greater power over the selection of its nominees. Seegenerally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 13-24,
p. 1121, and n. 3 (2d ed. 1988); Rotunda, Constitutional andStatutory Restrictions on Political Parties in the Wake of
Cousins v. Wigoda, 53 Texas L. Rev. 935, 953-954 (1975);
predicated on a showing of individual electability. The Commonwealth
certainly may choose to recognize the Party's selection of a nominee, but
such recognition is not mandated by any right of the Party to demand
placement on the ballot. Contrary to appellees, cases such as Williams
v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431 (1971), and
American Party of Tex. v. White, 415 U. S. 767 (1974), establish only that
political parties with at least a modicum of public support must be provided a reasonable method of ballot access. They do not establish that
they are entitled to choose the method itself.

According to Justice Thomas, the Party merely "takes advantage of
favorable state law" when it certifies its nominee for automatic placement
on the ballot. Post, at 274. On that theory, the requirements of 28 CFR

$ 51.7 (1995) would not be met even if Virginia let only the two major
parties place their candidates on the ballot, and no one else. For the same
reasons we give below, see infra, at 220-221, it is implausible to think the
regulation was meant to apply only in one-party States.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Developments in the Law--Elections, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 1111,1159-1163 (1975). By the logic of Smith, therefore, the

Party acted under authority of the Commonwealth.17It is true that the example set forth in the Attorney General's regulation describes changes in the conduct of primaryelections. That example, however, does not purport to define the outer limits of the coverage of $ 5. Moreover, bothin its brief

amicus curiae supporting appellants in this caseand in its prior implementation of the regulation, the Department of Justice has interpreted it as applying to changesaffecting voting at a party convention.

18 We are satisfied

17 Justice Thomas argues that our decision in Smith v. Allwright, 321
U. S. 649 (1944), depended on the State's regulation of the Party's activities. Post, at 268. While it is true that political parties in Smith were
subject to extensive regulation, nothing in our decision turned on that
factor. Only nine years before Smith, the Court had surveyed the same
statutory regime in Grovey v. Townsend, 295 U. S. 45, 50 (1935), and concluded that primary elections were private voluntary activity. What
changed was not the extent of state regulation, but the Court's understanding, based on its intervening decision in United States v. Classic, 313
U. S. 299 (1941), that primaries were "a part of the machinery for choosing
officials." 321 U. S., at 664. On that basis, the Court overruled Grovey,
even though the objectionable practice there of excluding blacks from
membership in the party was undertaken by a private, unregulated entity.

The irrelevance of state regulation was confirmed in two cases decided
after Smith. Subsequent to Smith, South Carolina repealed all of its laws
regulating political primaries. The Democratic primary was thereafter
conducted under rules prescribed by the Democratic Party alone, which
included rules restricting the primary to white persons. The Fourth Circuit struck down those practices, reasoning that "[s]tate law relating to
the general election gives effect to what is done in the primary and makes
it just as much a part of the election machinery of the state by which the
people choose their officers as if it were regulated by law, as formerly."

required preclearance of the Party's delegate filing fee.The decision in

election ballot graphically distinguishes the two cases. Wilpolitical parties in covered jurisdictions. See letter from Drew S. Days
III, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of the Supreme Court,
dated Oct. 4, 1995 (lodged with Clerk of this Court). Of particular note,
on April 12, 1982, the Attorney General precleared changes in the delegate
selection plan adopted by the Democratic Party of Virginia for its senatorial nominating convention. See Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 12, n. 7; letter from Wm. Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney
General, Civil Rights Div., to Russel Rosen, Executive Director, Democratic Party of Va., dated Apr. 12, 1982 (lodged with Clerk of this Court).

Political parties submitted changes in their rules for preclearance, and
the Department of Justice interposed objections to those changes, long
before 1981. For example: the Sumter County, Alabama, Democratic Executive Committee submitted changes in 1974, and the Democratic Party
of New York City submitted changes in 1975. See Extension of the Voting Rights Act: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 1st
Sess., pt. 3, pp. 2246, 2265 (1981) (app. to letter from James P. Turner,
Acting Ass't Attorney General, to Rep. Edwards dated Apr. 9, 1981).
Parties from New York, North Carolina, and Alabama submitted changes
in 1972. See D. Hunter, Federal Review of Voting Changes 69, n. 30
(1974), reprinted in Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong.,
1st Sess., 1541 (1975). In MacGuire v. Amos, 343 F. Supp. 119, 121 (MD
Ala. 1972), a three-judge court held that rules promulgated by the Alabama Democratic and Republican Parties governing election of national
delegates required preclearance, despite the fact that the rules were not
passed by "the State's legislature or by a political subdivision of the
State." As a result of this decision, the Democratic Party of Alabama
sought judicial preclearance under $ 5. See Vance v. United States, Civ.
Action No. 1529-72 (DDC Nov. 30, 1972), cited in Hunter, Federal Review

liams did not concern the selection of nominees for stateelective office, but rather a political party's compliance with

a rule promulgated by the Democratic National Party gov-erning the selection of delegates to its national convention.
According to the District Court's interpretation of Georgialaw, the State exercised no control over, and played no part
in, the state Party's selection of delegates to the DemocraticNational Convention.

19 Because the Commonwealth delegated no authority to the Party to choose the delegates, theParty did not act under the authority, implicit or explicit, of

the Commonwealth.If anything, the logic of

Williams supports application ofthe preclearance requirement. The District Court stated

that it was "convinced that voting rights connected with thedelegate election process are the type of rights Congress intended to safeguard" by passage of the Act. Civ. ActionNo. 16286, at 4. It declined to require the party to preclear
changes in its nominating methods only because there wereno administrative procedures for submission of such changes
at the time of the decision. Id., at 5. Since then, however,the Attorney General has clarified that "an appropriate official of the political party" may submit party rules affecting

19 "The State has no connection with the delegate selection process or
State Party's rules and regulations other than allowing the rules and regulations to be filed under Ga. Code Ann. $ 34-902. The purpose of such
filing is merely to provide a place for public inspection of the State Party's
rules and regulations." Williams v. Democratic Party of Georgia, Civ.
Action No. 16286 (ND Ga., Apr. 6, 1972), pp. 4-5. In their motion to affirm
in that case, the appellees noted that the Secretary of State of Georgia
was obligated to approve a political party's rules applicable to the selection
of candidates for public office by convention but had no authority to review
the rules and regulations promulgated by the National Democratic Party
governing the selection of delegates to its national convention. Under the
Attorney General's regulation that is now in effect, preclearance of the
National Democratic Party's rule change would not have been required if
the District Court's interpretation of Georgia law was correct. Our summary affirmance no doubt accepted that court's view of the relevant state
law. Cf. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 345-346 (1976).

voting for preclearance, 28 CFR $ 51.23(b) (1993), therebyeliminating this one practical obstacle. Other lower courts

have subsequently required preclearance of internal partyrules, even when those rules do not relate to the conduct of
primary elections.20 Indeed, if the rationale of Williamswere still valid, $ 5 would not cover party primaries either,
for the party (by hypothesis) would likewise have nomeans of preclearing changes. But it is firmly established--
and the Party does not dispute--that changes affecting pri-maries carried out by political parties must be precleared.

21

The District Court was therefore incorrect to base its deci-sion on either the Attorney General's regulation or on our

summary affirmance in Williams. The Party's activities falldirectly within the scope of the regulation. We next conclude, based on the language and structure of the Act, andthe historical background which informed the Congress that
enacted it, that $ 5 of its own force covers changes in elec-toral practices such as the Party's imposition of a filing fee
for delegates to its convention.

IV
Section 5 of the Act requires preclearance of changes in"any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting." Section

20 See, e. g., Fortune v. Kings County Democratic Comm., 598 F. Supp.
761, 764 (EDNY 1984) (requiring preclearance of change in voting membership of county party executive committee, because those members performed a "public electoral function" in filling vacancies in nominations for
state office).

21 We also note that a summary affirmance by this Court is a "rather

slender reed" on which to rest future decisions. Anderson v. Celebrezze,
460 U. S. 780, 784-785, n. 5 (1983). "A summary disposition affirms only
the judgment of the court below, and no more may be read into our action
than was essential to sustain that judgment." Ibid. Either of the two
grounds discussed above--the State's noninvolvement or the absence of
suitable administrative procedures for submission--would have sufficed
for our affirmance.

Although a narrow reading of the text of the Voting RightsAct might have confined the coverage of $ 5 to changes in

United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110, 140-

874, 892, 914 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment),
the Court has squarely rejected that construction. Shortly
after the statute was passed, the Court thoroughly reviewed
its legislative history and found that Congress intended $ 5
to have "the broadest possible scope" reaching "any state
enactment which altered the election law of a covered State
in even a minor way." Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393
U. S., at 566-567. Similarly, in Sheffield, the Court concluded that "the language of the Act does not require such
a crippling interpretation, but rather is susceptible of a
reading that will fully implement the congressional objectives." 435 U. S., at 117. We expressly held that "$ 5, like
the constitutional provisions it is designed to implement, applies to all entities having power over any aspect of the electoral process within designated jurisdictions, not only to
counties or to whatever units of state government perform
the function of registering voters." Id., at 118. More recently we noted that $ 5 is "expansive within its sphere of
operation" and "comprehends all changes to rules governing
voting." Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491,

elect [particular] candidates." Allen, 393 U. S., at 570; seealso

Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 40
(1978). Changes in the composition of the electorate thatvotes for a particular office--that is, situations that raise the

specter of vote dilution--also belong to this class because
they could "nullify [voters'] ability to elect the candidate of
their choice just as would prohibiting some of them from voting." 393 U. S., at 569. This nexus between the changed
practice and its impact on voting in the general election has
been a recurring theme in our cases interpreting the Act.
See Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 397 (1991) ("Any
abridgment of the opportunity of members of a protected
class to participate in the political process inevitably impairs
their ability to influence the outcome of an election"). In its
reenactments and extensions of the Act, moreover, Congress
has endorsed these broad constructions of $ 5. See, e. g.,
S. Rep. No. 97-417, pp. 6-7, and n. 8 (1982).

A filing fee for party delegates operates in precisely the
same fashion as these covered practices. By limiting the
opportunity for voters to participate in the Party's convention, the fee undercuts their influence on the field of candidates whose names will appear on the ballot, and thus weakens the "effectiveness" of their votes cast in the general
election itself. As an elementary fact about our Nation's political system, the significance of the nominating convention
to the outcome in the general election was recognized as long
ago as Justice Pitney's concurrence in Newberry v. United
States, 256 U. S. 232 (1921). Joined by Justices Brandeis and
Clarke, he wrote: "As a practical matter, the ultimate choice

of the mass of voters is predetermined when the nominations
[by the major political parties] have been made." Id., at 286
(opinion concurring in part). See also United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 319 (1941) (endorsing the Newberry concurrence). Just like a primary, a convention narrows the field
of candidates from a potentially unwieldy number to the serious few who have a realistic chance to win the election. We
have held, in fact, that the State's compelling interest in winnowing down the candidates justifies substantial restrictions
on access to the ballot. American Party of Tex. v. White,
415 U. S. 767, 782, and n. 14 (1974). Virginia, no doubt,
would justify its own ballot access rules--including those for
the major parties--on just this basis.22

We have previously recognized that $ 5 extends to changes
affecting nomination processes other than the primary. In
Whitley v. Williams, one of the companion cases decided
with Allen, this Court affirmed $ 5 coverage of a scheme that
placed new burdens on voters who wished to nominate independent candidates by petition. The Court was unconcerned that the changes did not directly relate to the conduct
of a primary, because they had an effect on the general election. See Allen, 393 U. S., at 570. One of those changes
was a requirement that each nominator sign the petition personally and state his or her polling precinct and county. See
id., at 551. Like the filing fee in this case, that condition
made it more difficult for voters to participate in the nomina22 Virginia created its first signature requirement for self-nominated candidates in 1936. See Va. Code Ann., Tit. 6, $ 154 (1936) (requiring petition
signed by 250 qualified voters of the Commonwealth). Although the Commonwealth maintains limited legislative history records, contemporary
news accounts reported that the provision was designed to "discourage
cranks and persons who for personal glorification take advantage of the
very liberal terms of the election code." New Qualification, The Richmond News Leader, Mar. 6, 1936, p. 8. Then as now, political parties were
exempt from the signature requirement.

tion process, and therefore properly fell within $ 5's scope.
A fee of $45 to cast a vote for the Party nominee is, if anything, a more onerous burden than a mere obligation to include certain public information about oneself next to one's
name on a nominating petition. In dissent, Justice Harlan
agreed that "the nominating petition is the functional equivalent of the political primary." Id., at 592 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Delegate qualifications are in fact more closely tied to the
voting process than practices that may cause vote dilution,
whose coverage under $ 5 we have repeatedly upheld. Virginia, like most States, has effectively divided its election
into two stages, the first consisting of the selection of party
candidates and the second being the general election itself.
See United States v. Classic, 313 U. S., at 316. Exclusion
from the earlier stage, as two appellants in this case experienced, does not merely curtail their voting power, but
abridges their right to vote itself. To the excluded voter
who cannot cast a vote for his or her candidate, it is all the
same whether the party conducts its nomination by a primary or by a convention open to all party members except
those kept out by the filing fee. Each is an "integral part
of the election machinery." Id., at 318.

The reference to "party office" in $ 14, which defines the
terms "vote" and "voting" as they appear throughout the
Act, reinforces this construction of $ 5. Section 14 specifically recognizes that the selection of persons for "party office" is one type of action that may determine the effectiveness of a vote in the general election. Delegates to a party
convention are party officers. See H. R. Rep. No. 439, 89th
Cong., 1st Sess., 32 (1965) ("Thus, for example, an election of
delegates to a State party convention would be covered by
the act"). The phrase "votes cast with respect to candidates
for public or party office" in $ 14 is broad enough to encompass a variety of methods of voting beyond a formal elec517us1$38I 02-23-99 16:40:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
tion.23 Cf. Classic, 313 U. S., at 318. The Party itself recognizes this point, for both in its brief to this Court and in
its Plan of Organization, it repeatedly characterizes its own
method of selecting these delegates as an "election." 24

The legislative history of $ 14 supports this interpretation.
Representative Bingham proposed addition of the term
"party office" to the language of the section for the express
purpose of extending coverage of the Act to the nominating
activities of political parties. See Hearings on H. R. 6400
before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 456-457 (1965) (proposing
coverage of "political party meetings, councils, conventions,
and referendums which lead to endorsement or selection of
candidates who will run in primary or general elections").
Congressional concern that the Act reach the selection of
party delegates was not merely speculative. On the floor of
the House, Representative Bingham expressed the importance of preventing a reprise of the fiasco of the previous
year, 1964, "when the regular Democratic delegation from
Mississippi to the Democratic National Convention was
chosen through a series of Party caucuses and conventions
from which Negroes were excluded." 111 Cong. Rec. 16273
(1965); see also Hearings on H. R. 6400, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,

23 Quoting this very language, we have observed that candidates are
nominated, not elected. Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 400 (1991). It
is not anomalous, therefore, to hold that $ 5 applies regardless of the means
of nomination.

24 See Brief for Appellees 2; App. 32 (Republican Party Plan, Art. II,

|| 22) (defining "Party Canvass" as "a method of electing . . . delegates to
Conventions"); id., at 52 (Plan, Art. VIII, $ A, || 3) (referring to "any election by a Mass Meeting, Party Canvass, or Convention"); id., at 56 (Plan,

Party Canvasses that shall be held between March 1, 1994 and April 1,
1994." Id., at 62.

at 456 ("The events of 1964 demonstrate the need" to expand$ 14). As he later explained, the solution that was reached

to this problem was "to add to the definition of the word`vote' in section 14(c)(1)." 111 Cong. Rec. 16273. The Party's delegates to its 1994 convention were chosen through
precisely the same methods Representative Bingham de-scribed: mass meetings, conventions, and canvasses. Exempting the Party from the scope of $ 14 would thus defeatthe purpose for which the House and eventually Congress as
a whole adopted Representative Bingham's amendment.The text of $ 2 also makes apparent the Act's intended coverage of nonprimary nomination methods. Section 2, which
bans any "voting qualification or prerequisite" that discriminates on account of race or color, considers a violation to have
occurred if "the political processes leading to nomination or
election in the State or political subdivision are not equally
open to participation by members of [groups protected by
the Act] in that its members have less opportunity than other
members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973(b) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added). Under the broad
sweep of this language, exclusion from a nominating convention would qualify as a violation. Section 2 "adopts the
functional view of `political process' " and applies to "any
phase of the electoral process." S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 30,
and n. 120.

If such practices and procedures fall within the scope of

$ 2, they must also be subject to $ 5. In recent cases, some
Members of this Court have questioned whether $ 2 is as
broad as $ 5, see Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S., at 416-417
(Scalia, J., dissenting); Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S., at 882-885
(opinion of Kennedy, J.); id., at 930 (Thomas, J., concurring
in judgment), but there has never been any doubt about the
converse--that changes in practices within covered jurisdictions that would be potentially objectionable under $ 2 are
also covered under $ 5. The purpose of preclearance is to

prevent all attempts to implement discriminatory votingpractices that change the status quo. If $ 5 were narrower

than $ 2, then a covered jurisdiction would not need to pre-clear changes in voting practices known to be illegal. "It is
unlikely that Congress intended such an anomalous result."
Chisom, 501 U. S., at 402.25A fair reading of the text of $ 5 unquestionably supports

the conclusion that by imposing its filing fee the Partysought to administer a "voting qualification or prerequisite
to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect tovoting different from that in force or effect on November 1,
1968." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (1988 ed.).

V
Consideration of the history that led to passage of the Actconfirms our construction of $ 5. The preamble to the stat25 In fact, it did not. The 1981 House Report states that "whether a
discriminatory practice or procedure is of recent origin affects only the
mechanism that triggers relief, i. e., litigation or preclearance." H. R.
Rep. No. 97-227, p. 28. That statement indicates that the substantive
standards for $ 2 and $ 5 violations are the same, so long as the challenged
practice represents a change from 1965 conditions, as the filing fee did
here. Even more explicitly, the 1982 Senate Report states that "a section
5 objection also follow[s] if a new voting procedure itself so discriminates
as to violate section 2." S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 12, n. 31. The Report
refers to voting procedures that dilute minority voting strength. See id.,
at 10. We have recognized that measures undertaken by both " `[s]tate
legislatures and political party committees' " have had just such dilutive
effects, through devices that included " `switching to at-large elections
where Negro voting strength is concentrated in particular election districts, facilitating the consolidation of predominantly Negro and predominantly white counties, and redrawing the lines of districts to divide concentrations of Negro voting strength.' " Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S.

Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong.,

ute expressly identifies the "fifteenth amendment" as theconstitutional provision the Act was designed to implement.26 Our cases dealing with the applicability of thatAmendment to the selection of party candidates in States
that engaged in the sort of voting discrimination that $ 5 wasdesigned to remedy are therefore directly relevant. See
McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, 246 (1984) (interpretingAct "in light of its prophylactic purpose and the historical
experience which it reflects"); Dougherty County Bd. of Ed.v.

White, 439 U. S., at 37 (seeking "guidance from the historyand purpose of the Act"). In a series of decisions known as

the White Primary Cases, this Court applied the Fifteenthand Fourteenth Amendments to strike down a succession of
measures by authorities in Texas to exclude minority votersfrom their nomination processes. These cases demonstrate
that electoral practices implemented by political parties havethe potential to "den[y] or abridg[e] the right to vote on
account of race or color," which $ 5 prohibits. 42 U. S. C.$ 1973c (1988 ed.).

Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536 (1927), involved the valid-ity of a Texas statute enacted in 1923 that flatly provided
" `in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in aDemocratic party primary election held in the State of
Texas,' " id., at 540. It took only a paragraph for JusticeHolmes to conclude that it was "unnecessary to consider the
Fifteenth Amendment, because it seems to us hard to imag-ine a more direct and obvious infringement of the Fourteenth." Id., at 540-541. Promptly after the announce-ment of that decision, the Texas Legislature responded to
what it regarded as an emergency by replacing the invalidprovision with a substitute that authorized the executive
committee of every political party to determine "in its ownway" who shall be "qualified to vote or otherwise participate
in such political party." Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73, 82

(1932). The State Executive Committee of the DemocraticParty adopted a rule that only "white democrats" could participate in the party's primary elections. Pursuant to thatrule, Mr. Nixon was again refused a primary ballot and again
persuaded this Court that the authors of the discriminatory
rule should be "classified as representatives of the State tosuch an extent and in such a sense that the great restraints

of the Constitution set limits to their action." Id., at 89.The decision in

Nixon v. Condon relied on the fact that a
state statute authorized the Party's Executive Committee todetermine the qualifications of voters. Thereafter the

Party implemented the same discriminatory policy withoutstatutory authorization by adopting a resolution at a state
convention restricting party membership to "white persons."
When it first confronted the issue, the Court held that imple-mentation of that rule was not state action.

Grovey v.
Townsend, 295 U. S. 45 (1935). A few years later, however,
Grovey was overruled and the Court decided that the resolution adopted by the party's state convention constitutedstate action violative of the Fifteenth Amendment even

though it was not expressly authorized by statute. Smithv.

Texas counties by a private organization known as theJaybird Democratic Association. It conducted a so-called

"Jaybird primary" at which white voters selected candidateswho thereafter ran in and nearly always won the Democratic
Party's primary and the general election. Although theJaybirds had no official status, received no state funds, and
conducted a purely private election, the Court readily con-cluded that this voluntary association's exclusion of black
voters from its primaries on racial grounds was prohibitedby the Fifteenth Amendment.

Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S.461 (1953). Citing our earlier cases, Justice Clark tersely

noted that an "old pattern in new guise is revealed by therecord."

Id., at 480 (concurring opinion).Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1964 because

it concluded that case-by-case enforcement of the FifteenthAmendment, as exemplified by the history of the white primary in Texas, had proved ineffective to stop discriminatoryvoting practices in certain areas of the country on account of
the intransigence of officials who "resorted to the extraordi-nary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for
the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in theface of adverse federal court decrees."

this evasion once and for all. By prohibiting officials in cov-ered jurisdictions from implementing any change in voting
practices without prior approval from the District Court forthe District of Columbia or the Attorney General, it sought
to "shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpe-trators of the evil to its victims."

The distinction between a primary and a nominating con-vention is just another variation in electoral practices that

tices. See H. R. Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1965). In addition,
during the 1970 extension of the Act, Congress heard testimony from the
Director of the United States Civil Rights Commission wherein he reiterated the influence political parties continued to exercise over the electoral
process in jurisdictions designated under the Act. He testified that
"[s]tate legislatures and political party committees in Alabama and Mississippi have adopted laws or rules since the passage of the act which have
had the purpose or effect of diluting the votes of newly enfranchised Negro
voters." Hearings on Voting Rights Act Extension before Subcommittee
No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 17
(1969) (remarks of Mr. Glickstein), quoted in Perkins v. Matthews, 400
U. S., at 389. As examples, he introduced evidence that in 1968 the Mississippi Democratic Party persisted in its "pattern of exclusion of and discrimination against Negroes at precinct meetings, county conventions and
the State convention," Hearings on Voting Rights Act Extension, 91st
Cong., 1st Sess., at 18-19; that other officials "withheld information from
black party members about party precinct meetings and conventions or
have prevented them from participating fully," id., at 18, 43; that the Alabama Democratic Party raised candidate filing fees for some of its primaries tenfold after blacks began voting in large numbers, id., at 18, 27;
and that various party executive committees refused to count votes by
blacks who were not on the registration books, even if they were listed by
the Federal Examiner, id., at 46, engaged in discriminatory purges of black
voters, id., at 48, and misled black candidates about the requirements for
running in primary elections or did not notify them of their failure to
qualify until after deadlines had passed, id., at 46-47.

In his testimony, Director Glickstein summarized the more extensive
findings about discriminatory electoral practices carried out by the established political parties that were set forth in a report prepared by the
United States Commission on Civil Rights pursuant to congressional directive. See id., at 17-18. It concluded that, three years after passage of
the Act,

"in some areas there has been little or no progress in the entry and participation by Negroes in political party affairs--the key to meaningful participation in the electoral process. Some of the practices found are reminiscent of those which existed at an earlier time during Reconstruction when
fear of `Negro government' gave rise to intimidation and a number of election contrivances which finally led to disenfranchisement of the Negro citi517us1$38I 02-23-99 16:40:25 PAGES OPINPGT

the privilege of participating in the selection of the Party'snominee for the United States Senate is equally a practice

or procedure relating to voting whether the selection is madeby primary election or by a "convention" in which every
voter willing to pay the fee is eligible to cast a vote. Aprimary election would not cease to be a practice relating to
voting if the Party imposed such a high fee that only 14,000voters cast ballots; nor should a "convention" performing the
same electoral function as a primary avoid coverage becausefewer voters participate in the process than normally vote
in a primary. As was true in Sheffield, "the District Court'sinterpretation of the Act . . . makes $ 5 coverage depend upon
a factor completely irrelevant to the Act's purposes, andthereby permits precisely the kind of circumvention of congressional policy that $ 5 was designed to prevent." 435U. S., at 117. It would undermine the Act to permit " `[s]uch
a variation in the result from so slight a change in form.' "Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S., at 465, n. 1 (quoting Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S., at 661).Section 5 coverage of nominating conventions follows directly from our decision in Terry. Although called a "pri-mary," the Jaybird election was the equivalent of the Party's
nominating convention, for it did not involve the State's elec-toral apparatus in even the slightest way--neither to supply
election officials, nor ballots, nor polling places. See 345U. S., at 471 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). In fact, the Jaybirds went far beyond the Party in immunizing their nomina-tion process from the State's control. The Jaybird nominee
did not receive any form of automatic ballot access. He filedindividually as a candidate in the Democratic primary, paid
the filing fee, and complied with all requirements to whichother candidates were subject. Id., at 486-487 (Minton, J.,

tion ballot. Those elections, moreover, were open to anycandidate who was able to meet the filing requirements, and

to black as well as white voters. If the Jaybirds' nominatingprocess violated the Fifteenth Amendment because black
voters were not permitted to participate, despite the entirely
voluntary nature of the Jaybird association, then $ 5--whichrequires preclearance of all practices with the potential to

discriminate--must cover the Party's exclusion of votersfrom its convention.

28

Appellees nevertheless assert that Terry, like the otherWhite Primary Cases, has no bearing on the proper interpretation of the Voting Rights Act. They offer three reasonsfor that contention: first, that their convention did not operate in a racially discriminatory manner, Brief for Appellees37; second, that the 89th Congress did not intend to legislate
to the "outer limit" of the Fifteenth Amendment, ibid.; and
third, that present-day Virginia is not a one-party Common-wealth, unlike Texas after Reconstruction,

id., at 36. None
of these reasons is persuasive.First, while it is true that the case before us today does

not involve any charge of racial discrimination in voting, thedecision whether discrimination has occurred or was intended to occur, as we have explained on many occasions, isfor the Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia to make in the first instance. NAACP v.

28 The analogy is even closer, for the Jaybirds originally performed their
nominations in mass meetings. See 345 U. S., at 470 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); id., at 480 (Clark, J., concurring). Nothing in any of the opinions suggests--and it would be perverse to suppose--that the Jaybirds'
nominating activities only became unconstitutional when they switched to
balloting methods.

400 U. S. 379, 383-385 (1971); Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,393 U. S., at 570. The critical question for us, as for the

District Court below, is whether "the challenged alterationhas the potential for discrimination." Hampton County
Election Comm'n, 470 U. S., at 181 (emphasis in original).It is not contested that the Party's filing fee had that
potential.29The second argument misconceives the purpose of the preclearance system and the nature of the Act as a whole.Again, the very preamble of the Act states that its purpose
is to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. 79 Stat. 437. Sec-tion 5 "is a means of assuring in advance the absence of all
electoral illegality, not only that which violates the VotingRights Act but

that which violates the Constitution as well."
Chisom, 501 U. S., at 416 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasisadded). It is beyond question, therefore, that the Act encompassed the discriminatory practices struck down in Terryand Smith, which this Court had found violative of the same
constitutional guarantees. Not only were they the leadingcases securing the right to vote against racial discrimination
at the time of enactment, but Congress passed the Act tofacilitate the enforcement effort they embodied. It strains
credulity to suppose that despite Congress' professed impa-tience with the "case-by-case" method of enforcing voting
rights, it did not mean to cover the cases that capped thestruggle to end the white primary.

29 Justice Thomas' claim that there has been no purposeful evasion of
the Constitution, see post, at 269-270, is therefore irrelevant.

30 Appellees' theory is particularly unpersuasive in light of the fact that

other parts of the Voting Rights Act reach beyond the scope of $ 1 of the
Fifteenth Amendment. For example, the Act created a per se ban on
literacy tests despite this Court's decision that facially fair tests are
not themselves unconstitutional. Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd.

success rate of the candidates one endorses. Voting at thenomination stage is protected regardless of whether it "invariably, sometimes or never determines the ultimate choiceof the representative."

United States v. Classic, 313 U. S.,at 318. The operative test, we have stated repeatedly, is

whether a political party exercises power over the electoralprocess. See United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435
U. S., at 122 ("$ 5 has to apply to all entities exercising con-trol over the electoral processes within the covered States
or subdivisions"); Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439U. S., at 44-45 ($ 5 coverage depends only on the "impact of
a change on the elective process"); Terry, 345 U. S., at 481("[A]ny `part of the machinery for choosing officials' becomes
subject to the Constitution's restraints") (quoting Smith v.
Allwright, 321 U. S., at 664). That situation may arise intwo-party States just as in one-party States. Indeed, the

Terry concurrence summarized Smith as holding that "theDemocratic Party of itself,

and perforce any other politicalparty, is prohibited by [the Fifteenth] Amendment from conducting a racially discriminatory primary election." Terry,345 U. S., at 481 (Clark, J., concurring) (emphasis added).
See also Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814, 818 (1969) (holdingthat the use of nomination petitions by independent candidates is a procedure that "must pass muster against thecharges of discrimination or of abridgment of the right to
vote"); Classic, 313 U. S., at 318.31 The contrary position
v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 173-178 (1980). Congress again legislated
beyond the reach of the Fifteenth Amendment when it amended $ 2 of the
Act to reject the "intent test" propounded in Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S.
55 (1980). See S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 39-43.

31 Justice Thomas contends that United States v. Classic is inapplicable

because Party nominating conventions are not " `by law made an integral
part of the election machinery.' " Post, at 270, n. 12. Moore v. Ogilvie,
394 U. S. 814 (1969), shows that this view is incorrect. The Court in
Moore held that the use of nominating petitions by independent candidates

would make little sense. On appellees' theory, one political
party could not exclude blacks from the selection of its nominee, however it chose that individual, but two parties each
independently could.

In any event, the controlling factor for our construction of

$ 5 is Congress' intent. It is apparent from the legislative
history that Congress did not mean to limit $ 5 to political
parties whose nominating procedures "foreordained" the
results of the general election, see post, at 269 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting). The impetus behind the addition of the term
"party office" to $ 14 was the exclusion of blacks from the
Mississippi delegation to the National Democratic Convention in 1964. See supra, at 208-209. The activities of those
delegates did not settle the result of the Presidential race;
Republican candidates won the general election in 1952 and
1956, and from 1968 until 1992, excluding 1976. Nevertheless, Congress insisted that the selection of those delegates
must be open to all voters, black and white.

The imposition by an established political party--that is
to say, a party authorized by state law to determine the
method of selecting its candidates for elective office and also
authorized to have those candidates' names automatically appear atop the general election ballot--of a new prerequisite
to voting for the party's nominees is subject to $ 5's preclearance requirement.

was an " `integral part of the election process,' " even though a nominating
petition obviously is not a primary, and that procedure plainly was not
"merged by law," post, at 270, n. 12, into the State's election apparatus.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

VI
Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas reject our con-struction of $ 5 for a number of reasons, none of which is

convincing. They rely primarily on the argument that,under a literal reading of the statutory text, a political party
is not a "State or political subdivision" within the meaningof $ 5 because it is not a unit of government. See

post, at253-276 (
Thomas, J., dissenting); post, at 248-250 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The radicalism of this position shouldnot be underestimated. It entirely rejects the distinction

between primary elections and conventions that is the cen-terpiece of the Party's argument. On this view, even if a
political party flagrantly discriminated in the selection ofcandidates whose names would appear on the primary election ballot or in the registration of voters in a primary elec-tion, it would not fall within the coverage of $ 5. Unsurprisingly, neither the District Court nor the Party advanced thisextreme argument, for it is plainly at war with the intent
of Congress and with our settled interpretation of the Act.32Almost two decades ago we held in United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs that "$ 5, like the constitutional pro-visions it is designed to implement, applies to all entities
having power over any aspect of the electoral processwithin designated jurisdictions." 435 U. S., at 118 (emphasis
added). We understood the phrase "State or political subdi-vision" to have a "territorial reach" that embraced "actions
that are not formally those of the State." Id., at 127. TheCourt even invoked

Terry to make its point. 435 U. S., at127.
Justice Thomas' efforts to confine Sheffield and oursubsequent decision in

Dougherty do not make sense of thosecases. Dougherty held that a county school board qualifies

32 The Party makes passing reference to the idea in its brief, but the
surrounding argument makes clear that it only challenges application of
the regulation to its nominating activities. See Brief for Appellees 30-40.
At oral argument, moreover, the Party confirmed that it believed $ 5 could
encompass the activities of political parties. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-30.

as a "State or political subdivision" even though it is clearlyneither "one of the 50 constituent States of the Union," post,

at 254, nor "a political subdivision" of any such State in aliteral sense or as that term is defined in the statute itself.

33

Indeed, a major political party has far more power over theelectoral process than a school board, which we conceded has

"no nominal electoral functions." Dougherty, 439 U. S., at 44.Besides the fact that it contravenes our precedents, this
argument fails at the purely textual level. The VotingRights Act uses the same word as the Fifteenth Amendment--"State"--to define the authorities bound to honor the
right to vote. Long before Congress passed the VotingRights Act, we had repeatedly held that the word "State"

in the Fifteenth Amendment encompassed political parties.
See Smith v. Allwright; Terry v. Adams. How one can si-multaneously concede that "State" reaches political parties

under the Fifteenth Amendment, yet argue that it "plainly"excludes all such parties in $ 5, is beyond our understanding.
Imposing different constructions on the same word is espe-cially perverse in light of the fact that the Act--as it states
on its face--was passed to enforce that very Amendment.See

United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 112 (1948) ("There
is no better key to a difficult problem of statutory construction than the law from which the challenged statuteemerged"). Speculations about language that might have

more clearly reached political parties are beside the point.It would be a mischievous and unwise rule that Congress
cannot rely on our construction of constitutional languagewhen it seeks to exercise its enforcement power pursuant to
the same provisions.34

33 The statute defines "political subdivision" as a unit of government that
registers voters. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(2) (1988 ed.).

34 Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas nevertheless argue that

Congress should have borrowed language from 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 if it
had intended $ 5 to cover political parties. To bolster the point, they cite
the "Prohibited acts" provision of the Act, $ 11(a), which forbids any "per517us1$38I 02-23-99 16:40:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Justice Thomas makes two other arguments. First, he
contends that we should not defer to the Attorney General's
regulation when construing the coverage of $ 5. See post,
at 258. The argument is surprising because our explanation
of why $ 5 applies to political parties places no reliance on
principles of administrative deference. It is nevertheless
interesting to note that the regulation has been endorsed
by three successive administrations.35

son acting under color of law" to interfere with the exercise of the right
to vote. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973i(a) (1988 ed.). It is quite natural, however,
that Congress would draw on $ 1983 when it sought to draft provisions
that established individual liability for persons who violate civil rights
such as the right to vote. Section 1983 was designed "to give a remedy
to parties deprived of constitutional rights, privileges and immunities by
an official's abuse of his position." Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 172
(1961). Section 11(a) served exactly the same end, and therefore used
similar language.

By contrast, Congress would not have looked to $ 1983 to supply language for $ 5 for the simple reason that $ 1983 does not reach the one type
of entity Congress most desired $ 5 to cover: the States themselves. See
Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58 (1989). Justice
Thomas tries to avoid this problem by proposing a new, disjunctive statutory phrase that is supposedly clearer than the present $ 5: " `State or
political subdivision or any person acting under color of State law.' " Post,
at 265 (emphasis deleted). That concatenation of elements, however,
appears in no statute ever enacted, so it is unclear why it is preferable to
language that had already been construed by this Court. Furthermore,
the "person acting under color of state law" locution would be simultaneously too broad and too narrow in that context. Section 5 focuses not on
actions that individuals carry out, but on voting practices that organizations enact or implement. Ordinary "persons" do not create and implement voting practices. At the same time, the "plain meaning" of the word
"person" does not include political parties. While "person" can be read
more broadly, so can "State," as our precedents show. Finally, if "person"
reached nonnatural entities, it would become partly redundant with the
word "State," which the dissent itself concedes encompasses political units
smaller than States. See Sheffield; Dougherty. In short, it is hardly surprising that Congress opted for the language of the Constitution rather
than Justice Thomas' concocted phrase.

35 Justice Thomas is unwilling to accept our representation as to the

reasoning underlying our decision; he goes on at great length about our

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Second, relying principally on Jackson v. Metropolitan
Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345 (1974), and Flagg Bros., Inc. v.
Brooks, 436 U. S. 149 (1978), Justice Thomas argues thata major political party is not a "state actor" unless its nominees are virtually certain to win the general election. See
post, at 264-276. Thus, the Party would be a state actor ifVirginia allowed only its candidates' names to appear on the

ballot, but if the privilege of ballot access (or a preferredposition) is reserved to two parties, neither is performing a
public function when it selects its nominees. Given Justice
Thomas' reliance on cases construing the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, the argument seems to challenge boththe constitutional power of Congress to prohibit discrimination in the Party's selection of its nominees for federal office
and our construction of the statute.To the extent the argument addresses the constitutionality

of the Act, it is wholly unconvincing. Jackson held that aprivate utility did not act "under color of any statute . . . of
any State" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 when itterminated a customer's electric service.

Flagg Bros. held
that a warehouseman did not violate $ 1983 when it soldgoods that were entrusted to it for storage. In both cases,

this Court concluded that the defendants were not acting
under authority explicitly or implicitly delegated by theState when they carried out the challenged actions. In this

case, however, as we have already explained, supra, at 195-200, the Party acted under the authority conferred by the
Virginia election code. It was the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia--indeed,

only Virginia--that had the exclusive power
to reserve one of the two special ballot positions for the

treatment of the regulation, claiming that we "displac[e]" $ 5 with it, post,
at 258, n. 4; that we "substitut[e]" it as the "analytical starting point" of
the case, post, at 262; and that by considering it we somehow prejudge the
question presented, post, at 263. None of these assertions is accurate.
We begin our discussion of the case by analyzing the regulation for the
simple reason that the District Court rested its decision on that ground,
and the Party argues that the regulation supports its position.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Party.36 Moreover, unlike cases such as Jackson and FlaggBros., this is a case in which Congress has exercised the enforcement power expressly conferred to it by $ 2 of the Fif-teenth Amendment. That power unquestionably embraces
the authority to prohibit a reincarnation of the white pri-maries, whether they limit the field of viable candidates to
just one as in Terry, or to just two as would be permissibleunder

Justice Thomas' construction of the Act.To the extent the argument addresses the coverage of the

Act, it is equally unconvincing. As we have already ex-plained, the legislative history of the Act makes it perfectly
clear that Congress did not intend to limit the application of$ 5 to nominating procedures that "foreordained" the results
of the general election. After the statute was enacted, themajority opinions in

Jackson and Flagg Bros. included lan-guage that may limit the reach of the constitutional holdings

in the White Primary Cases. Those later opinions, however,shed no light on the intent of the Congress that had already
enacted the Voting Rights Act and unambiguously expresseda purpose to have it apply to the candidate selection process.
While Justice Thomas would narrowly confine the coverage

36 While Justice Thomas relies heavily on Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614
(1991), he overlooks the fact that the Court's holding in that case makes it
clear that state delegation of selection powers to two adversaries instead
of just one state actor does not preclude a finding of state action. The
Edmonson dissent argued that since peremptory strikes are available to
both opposing sides in a lawsuit, the State cannot simultaneously advance
each party's use. The dissent reasoned, therefore, that the State is "neutral" as to their use and not " `responsible' " for it. Id., at 643. Virginia,
on the other hand, grants automatic ballot access to only two entities, and
requires everyone else to comply with more onerous requirements. As
we have shown, Virginia gives a host of special privileges to the major
parties, including automatic access, preferential placement, choice of nominating method, and the power to replace disqualified candidates. See
supra, at 195-197, and nn. 10-13. It is perfectly natural, therefore, to
hold that Virginia seeks to advance the ends of both the major parties.

of the Act to practices that prevent a voter at a general election from casting a ballot and having it counted, see post, at
278 (citing the concurrence in Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874
(1994)), we have no doubt that Congress intended to prohibit
the dominant political parties from engaging in discriminatory practices in primary elections as well as conventions of
the character involved in this case.

In his separate dissent, Justice Kennedy accuses us of
adopting a "blanket rule" that all political parties must preclear all of their "internal procedures." See post, at 250,
251. That characterization is quite inaccurate. We hold
that political parties are covered under $ 5 only in certain
limited circumstances: here, only insofar as the Party exercises delegated power over the electoral process when it
charges a fee for the right to vote for its candidates. It
is Justice Kennedy who proposes the "blanket rule" that
political parties are never covered under the Act, no matter
what functions they perform and no matter what authority
the State grants them. As we have explained, on that construction even situations involving blatant discrimination by
political parties of the kind not seen since the White Primary
Cases would fail to trigger the preclearance requirement.

Justice Kennedy downplays the significance of this
drastic limitation by arguing that voters who face electoral
discrimination could sue under the Fifteenth Amendment.
But lawsuits are no substitute for the preclearance requirement; if they were, $ 5 would be superfluous for governmental units, too. As we have explained, the fundamental purpose of the preclearance system was to "shift the advantage
of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its
victims," South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328, by
declaring all changes in voting rules void until they are
cleared by the Attorney General or by the District Court
for the District of Columbia. Justice Kennedy's construction would reimpose the very burden $ 5 was designed to

relieve--the necessity of relying on "case-by-case litigation"
to protect the right to vote. Ibid.

Justice Kennedy argues that this would be a "much different" case if the State "restructured its election laws in
order to allow political parties the opportunity to practice
unlawful discrimination in the nominating process." Post,
at 252. On his view, however, without any restructuring at
all, the Party could now take advantage of Virginia's present
election laws to perform the same discriminatory acts. It
is simply inaccurate, moreover, to claim that the State had
undertaken such legislative efforts in each of the White Primary Cases. The Jaybirds in Terry began discriminating
against minority voters as early as 1889, and, as we have
explained, they operated entirely outside the framework of
Texas' electoral laws. Finally, it is highly counterintuitive
to rely on cases such as Smith and Terry for the proposition
that voters affected by discrimination should sue the State
rather than the political party that carries it out, for those
cases were actions against parties, not the State.

What Justice Kennedy apparently finds most objectionable in our decision is the idea that political parties must
seek preclearance from the Attorney General of the United
States, because she is a "political officer," post, at 251. Pursuant to $ 5, the Attorney General is entrusted with the statutory duty of determining whether submitted changes have
the purpose or will have the effect to discriminate. The
suggestion implicit in Justice Kennedy's opinion, that we
should avoid our construction of $ 5 because the Attorney
General might subvert her legal responsibility in order to
harass a political party, is quite extraordinary and unsupported by even a shred of evidence. In any event, any political party distrustful of the Attorney General may seek preclearance under $ 5 from the District Court for the District
of Columbia.

Appellees advance two practical objections to our inter-pretation of $ 5: that it will create an administrative nightmare for political parties as well as the Department ofJustice by requiring preclearance of a multitude of minor
changes in party practices; and that it threatens to abridgeassociational rights protected by the First Amendment.
Each of these objections merits a response.With respect to the first, it is important to emphasize the
limitations spelled out in the Attorney General's regulation.To be subject to preclearance a change must be one "affecting voting." Examples of changes that are not covered in-clude "changes with respect to the recruitment of party
members, the conduct of political campaigns, and the draft-ing of party platforms." 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995). The line between changes that are covered and those that are not maybe difficult to articulate in the abstract, but given the fact
that the regulation has been in effect since 1981 and doesnot appear to have imposed any unmanageable burdens on
covered jurisdictions, it seems likely that the administrativeconcerns described by the Party are more theoretical than
practical.37 Indeed, past cases in which we were requiredto construe the Act evoked similar protestations that the ad37 This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that in most covered jurisdictions party candidates are selected in primary elections which are admittedly subject to the preclearance requirement. Apparently, Alabama and
Virginia are the only two States covered by the Act that authorize the use
of conventions to nominate candidates for statewide office. See Council
of State Governments, Book of the States 217-218 (1994-1995 ed.).

We also note that States may remove themselves from the special provisions of the Act, such as preclearance, by means of the bailout mechanisms
provided in $ 4. Several States and political subdivisions initially designated for coverage have successfully availed themselves of these procedures. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 94-295, p. 35 (1975) (citing bailouts by
Alaska; Wake County, North Carolina; Elmore County, Idaho; and Apache,
Navajo, and Coconino Counties, Arizona).

vocated construction would prove administratively unworkable. See Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S.,
at 54 (Powell, J., dissenting); United States v. Sheffield Bd.
of Comm'rs, 435 U. S., at 147-148 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Those fears were not borne out, and we think it no more
likely that these will either.

With respect to the second argument, we wholeheartedly
agree with appellees that the right of association of members
of a political party "is a basic constitutional freedom" and
that "governmental action that may have the effect of curtailing freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny." Brief for Appellees 25 (citing Buckley v. Valeo, 424
U. S. 1 (1976), and NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357
U. S. 449 (1958)). Such scrutiny, however, could not justify a
major political party's decision to exclude eligible voters
from the candidate selection process because of their race;
the Fifteenth Amendment and our cases construing its application to political parties foreclose such a possibility. See
Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S., at 657 (rejecting argument
that Democratic Party of Texas, as a private voluntary association, could exclude black voters from its primary); Eu v.
San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S.
214, 232 (1989) ( justifying legislative "intervention" in internal party affairs where "necessary to prevent the derogation
of the civil rights of party adherents") (citing Smith).

Moreover, appellees have not argued that the registration
fee at issue in this case--which is challenged because it curtails the freedom of association of eligible voters arguably in
conflict with the interests protected by the Twenty-fourth
Amendment--is itself protected by the First Amendment.
Rather, they have suggested that hypothetical cases unrelated to the facts of this case might implicate First Amendment concerns that would foreclose application of the preclearance requirement. It is sufficient for us now to respond

that we find no constitutional impediment to enforcing $ 5 inthe case before us.

38 We leave consideration of hypothetical

concerns for another day.39

38 We recognize that there is a narrow category of exceptional cases in
which litigants "are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own
rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction
or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973). Because a
claim of facial overbreadth, if successful, is such "strong medicine," the
doctrine "has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last
resort." Id., at 613. Specifically, as is the case with $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act, "where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe
that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as
well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." Id., at
615. The breadth and importance of the legitimate sweep of $ 5 have
been demonstrated in a long and unbroken line of decisions applying its
preclearance requirements to covered jurisdictions. Even among political
parties, it is undisputed that the right of associative freedom would not
provide a defense to many practices condemned by $ 5. See Smith, 321
U. S., at 657; Eu, 489 U. S., at 232. Cf. Tashjian v. Republican Party of
Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 237 (1986) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (the State "may
lawfully require that significant elements of the democratic election process be democratic--whether the Party wants that or not"). Presumably
that is why appellees have not argued that $ 5 is invalid on its face. Unlike Justice Scalia, we do not believe that the possibility that some future application of the statute might violate the First Amendment justifies
a departure from our "traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication." 413 U. S., at 610.

We also disagree with his assertion that the requirement that the Party
preclear a change in practices that imposes a registration fee on voters
seeking to participate in the nomination process is a "classic prior restraint." It imposes no restraint at all on speech. Given the past history
of discrimination that gave rise to the preclearance remedy imposed by

$ 5, the minimal burden on the right of association implicated in this case
is unquestionably justified.

39 Relying on statements in appellees' brief, rather than anything in the

record, Justice Thomas suggests that the registration fee was intended
to avoid the danger that funding the convention with contributions from a
few major donors would enable a small group of contributors to exercise

The District Court dismissed appellants' claim under $ 10of the Act because that section only authorizes enforcement

proceedings brought by the Attorney General and does notexpressly mention private actions.

40 While that ruling

might have been correct if the Voting Rights Act had beenenacted recently, it fails to give effect to our cases holding

undue influence over the candidate selection process. See post, at 283.
The argument is ironic, to say the least, given the evidence that the supporters of the successful candidate for the Party's nomination were willing
to pay a delegate's registration fee in return for that delegate's vote. See
App. 7-8 (Complaint |||| 21-34).

40 As originally enacted, $ 10 provided, in part:

"Sec. 10. (a) The Congress finds that the requirement of the payment
of a poll tax as a precondition to voting (i) precludes persons of limited
means from voting or imposes unreasonable financial hardship upon such
persons as a precondition to their exercise of the franchise, (ii) does not
bear a reasonable relationship to any legitimate State interest in the conduct of elections, and (iii) in some areas has the purpose or effect of denying persons the right to vote because of race or color. Upon the basis of
these findings, Congress declares that the constitutional right of citizens
to vote is denied or abridged in some areas by the requirement of the
payment of a poll tax as a precondition to voting.

"(b) In the exercise of the powers of Congress under section 5 of the
fourteenth amendment and section 2 of the fifteenth amendment, the Attorney General is authorized and directed to institute forthwith in the
name of the United States such actions, including actions against States
or political subdivisions, for declaratory judgment or injunctive relief
against the enforcement of any requirement of the payment of a poll tax
as a precondition to voting, or substitute therefor enacted after November
1, 1964, as will be necessary to implement the declaration of subsection (a)
and the purposes of this section.

"(c) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of
such actions which shall be heard and determined by a court of three
judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the
United States Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. It
shall be the duty of the judges designated to hear the case to assign the
case for hearing at the earliest practicable date, to participate in the hearing and determination thereof, and to cause the case to be in every way
expedited." 79 Stat. 442.

U. S. 353, 381 (1982).Our holding in

Cannon, that Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 created a private right of action for

victims of discrimination in education, relied heavily on thefact that during the 1960's the Court had consistently found
such remedies notwithstanding the absence of an express di-rection from Congress. 441 U. S., at 698; see also

id., at 718
(Rehnquist, J., concurring). Indeed, Cannon cited and relied on our earlier decision in Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,393 U. S. 544 (1969), holding that private parties may enforce

$ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, to show that Congress actedagainst a "backdrop" of decisions in which implied causes
of action were regularly found. See 441 U. S., at 698, andnn. 22-23. The Voting Rights Act itself was passed one year
after this Court's decision in J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S.426 (1964), which applied a highly liberal standard for finding
private remedies.

In Allen we made two observations about $ 5 that apply asforcefully to $ 10. We noted that "achievement of the Act's

laudable goal could be severely hampered . . . if each citizenwere required to depend solely on litigation instituted at the
discretion of the Attorney General." 393 U. S., at 556. Thesame is surely true of $ 10.

41 Second, we attached significance to the fact that the Attorney General had urged us
to find that private litigants may enforce the Act. Id., at
557, n. 23. The United States takes the same position in

41 In a footnote we observed that a private litigant could always bring
suit under the Fifteenth Amendment, but it was the inadequacy of just
those suits for securing the right to vote that prompted Congress to enact
the statute. See 393 U. S., at 556, n. 21. Similarly with respect to a poll
tax, the fact that a suit might be brought directly under the Twenty-fourth
Amendment is not a reason for declining to find a statutory remedy.

Congress has not only ratified Allen's construction of $ 5in subsequent reenactments, see H. R. Rep. No. 91-397, p. 8

(1970), but extended its logic to other provisions of the Act.
Although $ 2, like $ 5, provides no right to sue on its face,"the existence of the private right of action under Section 2

. . . has been clearly intended by Congress since 1965."S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 30 (citing

Allen); see also H. R. Rep.
No. 97-227, p. 32 (1981). We, in turn, have entertainedcases brought by private litigants to enforce $ 2. See,

e. g.,
Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380 (1991); Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994). It would be anomalous, to
say the least, to hold that both $ 2 and $ 5 are enforceable by
private action but $ 10 is not, when all lack the same expressauthorizing language.

Appellees argue that while $ 5 creates substantive rights,$ 10 merely directs the Attorney General to bring certain
types of enforcement actions. Brief for Appellees 42-43.Exactly the same argument was made as to $ 5 in

Allen.
But we held there that it was "unnecessary to reach thequestion" whether $ 5 created new rights or only gave plaintiffs new remedies to enforce existing rights, for "[h]owever
the Act is viewed, the inquiry remains whether the right or

42 Justice Thomas attempts to distinguish $ 5 and $ 10 by arguing that
the former describes a "particular class of persons" to be benefited while
the latter does not. See post, at 287. Justice Thomas has it backwards.
Section 5 states generically that "no person shall be denied the right to
vote" by unprecleared changes. With far greater specificity, $ 10 states
that poll taxes preclude "persons of limited means" from voting or impose
unreasonable financial hardships on them and "in some areas ha[ve] the
purpose or effect of denying persons the right to vote because of race or
color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973h(a). It also declares that "the constitutional
right of citizens to vote is denied or abridged in some areas by the requirement of the payment of a poll tax as a precondition to voting." Ibid.
Section 10 was clearly designed to benefit a limited class of individuals.

remedy has been conferred upon the private litigant." 43 393U. S., at 556, n. 20. Even if it mattered whether $ 10 created

rights or remedies, the other provisions of the Act indicatethat the antipoll tax provision established a right to vote
without paying a fee.44Furthermore, when Congress reenacted and extended the
life of the Voting Rights Act in 1975, it recognized that pri-vate rights of action were equally available under $ 10. Section 3, for example, originally provided for special procedures in any action brought "under any statute to enforcethe guarantees of the fifteenth amendment" by the Attorney

General. See 79 Stat. 437. In 1975, Congress amendedthat section to cover actions brought by "the Attorney General or an aggrieved person." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973a (1988 ed.)
(emphasis added). The Senate Report explained that thepurpose of the change was to provide the same remedies to

private parties as had formerly been available to the Attor-ney General alone. See S. Rep. No. 94-295, pp. 39-40
(1975).45 Since $ 10 is, by its terms, a statute designed for

43 We do not know, therefore, what Justice Thomas means when he
describes $ 5 as conferring a "statutory privilege" on a group of individuals. See post, at 287. If that phrase refers to a "right," then Justice
Thomas is flatly wrong, for Allen itself denies reaching that question.
The "guarantee of $ 5" to which Allen refers is simply its holding that
individuals can sue under $ 5. It is circular to rely on that conclusion to
distinguish $ 5 from $ 10, for the question presented here is precisely
whether this Court should apply the same logic to $ 10.

44 See $ 12(a) (prescribing sanctions for any deprivation or attempted

deprivation of "any right secured by section . . . 1973h [$ 10]"), 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973j(a) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added); $ 12(c) (prescribing sanctions for any
conspiracy to interfere with "any right secured by section . . . 1973h
[$ 10]"), 42 U. S. C. $ 1973j(c) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).

45 The Senate Report went on to explain more generally: "In enacting

remedial legislation, Congress has regularly established a dual enforcement mechanism. It has, on the one hand, given enforcement responsibility to a governmental agency, and on the other, has also provided remedies
to private persons acting as a class or on their own behalf. The Commit517us1$38I 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT

enforcement of the guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1973h(b) (1988 ed.),
Congress must have intended it to provide private remedies.

The same logic applies to $ 14(e), added in 1975, which
allows attorney fees to be granted to "the prevailing party,
other than the United States," in any action "to enforce the
voting guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(e) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).
Obviously, a private litigant is not the United States, and the
Attorney General does not collect attorney's fees.46 Both
this section and $ 3 thus recognize the existence of a private
right of action under $ 10.47

Last, appellees argue that $ 10 does not apply to the Party's nominating convention because a delegate registration
fee is not a poll tax. This argument addresses the merits
rather than the right to sue. Without reaching the merits,
the District Court dismissed appellants' claim because it held
there was no private cause of action under $ 10. Since we

tee concludes that it is sound policy to authorize private remedies to assist
the process of enforcing voting rights." S. Rep. No. 94-295, at 40.

46 The Senate Report states: "Such a provision is appropriate in voting

rights cases because there, as in employment and public accomodations
[sic] cases, and other civil rights cases, Congress depends heavily upon
private citizens to enforce the fundamental rights involved. Fee awards
are a necessary means of enabling private citizens to vindicate these Federal rights." Ibid.

47 Appellees argue that any congressional action taken in 1975 cannot

support the existence of an implied private right of action because this
Court began applying a stricter test for implied rights in Cort v. Ash, 422
U. S. 66 (1975). We note that Cort was decided on June 17, 1975, while
the amendments to the Act were passed on August 6 of the same year.
Pub. L. 94-73, 89 Stat. 400. Seven weeks--in the context of a bill that
was first proposed more than a year earlier--is scarcely enough time for
Congress to take account of a change in the "contemporary legal context,"
especially one whose nature and impact were the subject of some dispute
at the time. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 739-743
(1979) (Powell, J., dissenting) (arguing that Cort relaxed the standards for

finding implied rights of action).

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor and

One historical fact makes it particularly difficult for me toaccept the statutory and constitutional arguments of the appellees. In 1965, to have read this Act as excluding all politi-cal party activity would have opened a loophole in the statute the size of a mountain. And everybody knew it. Theyknew that, despite the enactment of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, African-Americans had been systemati-cally deprived of the right to vote in many places and for
many years. They knew, too, that States had tried to main-tain that status quo through the "all-white" primary--a tactic that tried to avoid the Fifteenth Amendment by permit-ting white voters alone to select the "all-white" Democratic
Party nominees, who were then virtually assured of victoryin the general election. Once the Supreme Court held unlawful the "all-white" primary, Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.649 (1944), the obvious next step would have been to substitute an "all-white" preprimary Democratic Party nominating

48 Appellees make one final argument that this case is moot because the
1994 convention has already been held. We note, however, that the Party
has not disavowed the practice of imposing a delegate filing fee for its
nominating convention, nor has it returned the $45 collected from appellant Morse. Indeed, the Party has required fees as far back as 1964, and
continues to assert that they are necessary to finance its conventions.
Like other cases challenging electoral practices, therefore, this controversy is not moot because it is "capable of repetition, yet evading review."

Supreme Court held one version of it, the Jaybird Associa-tion straw poll, unconstitutional.

Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S.
461 (1953).

In 1965, Congress knew this history well, see, e. g., H. R.Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 6-22 (noting White

Primary Cases and discussing failure of case-by-case enforce-ment of Fifteenth Amendment); S. Rep. No. 162, 89th Cong.,
1st Sess., pt. 3 (1965) (same); South Carolina v. Katzenbach,383 U. S. 301, 308-315 (1966) (summarizing legislative history), and it knew more besides. It knew that Mississippihad just sent to the Democratic National Convention an "allwhite" delegation, selected in a process of party precinct
meetings, caucuses, and conventions from which "Negroes"were excluded. See,

e. g., Hearings on H. R. 6400 before
Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judi-ciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 456-457 (1965) (testimony of

Rep. Bingham) (hereafter H. R. 6400 Hearings). How is itpossible that a Congress, knowing this obvious history,
would have wanted to enact a "voting rights" law containinga major and obvious loophole that would allow such practices
to continue, thereby threatening to destroy in practice the
very promise of elementary fairness that the Act held out?The answer is that Congress did not want to enact a statute with that loophole, and it did not do so. That is whyRepresentative Bingham said, in offering the amendment
that brought voting for "party office" within the Act, see 42U. S. C. $ 1973

l(c)(1) (1988 ed.), that

"to be most effective, [the Act] should include express
coverage of party functions which directly, or indirectly,
affect the primary or general elections in any State."

which lead to endorsement or selection of candidates who
will run in primary or general elections"). And it is why he
told the full House of Representatives (after the Committee
had accepted his amendment) that his change

"would extend the protections of the bill to the type of
situation which arose last year when the regular Democratic delegation from Mississippi to the Democratic National Convention was chosen through a series of Party
caucuses and conventions from which Negroes were
excluded." 111 Cong. Rec. 16273 (1965).

See also H. R. Rep. No. 439, supra, at 32.

Representative Bingham's amendment, as the dissents
point out, applies only to actions taken by "State or political
subdivision." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (1988 ed.). But that language did not automatically place a party's all-white evasive
maneuvers beyond the statute's reach, because the Supreme
Court had already held that the word "State" as it appears
in the Fifteenth Amendment could constitutionally apply to
certain activities of political parties, such as nominating activities. See Smith, supra, at 662-666; Terry, supra, at 473
(opinion of Frankfurter, J.) ("The application of the prohibition of the Fifteenth Amendment to `any State' is translated
by legal jargon to read `State action' "). The question before
us is whether in 1965 Congress intended its words to place
even a party's convention-based, all-white evasive maneuvers beyond the statute's reach, thereby ignoring even the
Mississippi Democratic Party's efforts the year before to use
an "all-white" convention process to help nominate a candidate for President of the United States.

The answer to this question must be "no." In light of
history--that of Jim Crow and that of the Act--one cannot
understand Congress as having intended to endorse any
such evasion. And that is as far as we need go to answer
the statutory question presented by this case.

238 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
We need not go further in determining when party activities are, in effect, substitutes for state nominating primaries
because the case before us involves a nominating convention
that resembles a primary about as closely as one could imagine. The convention (but for the $45 fee) was open to any
voter declaring loyalty to the Republican Party of Virginia
(Party), just like a primary. The Party itself had previously
selected the primary method to choose its nominee (in 1990,
the year of the immediately preceding United States Senate
race, the Party canceled its scheduled primary when no candidate filed to oppose the incumbent, App. 24), but changed
its mind in 1994 without asking the Justice Department to
"preclear" the switch. And the Party chose to avail itself of
special state-law preferences, in terms of ballot access and
position, offered to the convention's choice. Va. Code Ann.

$$ 24.2-511(A), 535, 613 (1993).

Nor need we go further to decide just which party nominating convention practices fall within the scope of the Act.
There are already substantial limits as to which votingrelated "practices and procedures" must be precleared. See
Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 502-503
(1992) (gathering cases and setting out four preclearance categories: changes involving "the manner of voting[,] . . . candidacy requirements and qualifications[,] . . . the composition
of the electorate that may vote[,] . . . [and] the creation or
abolition of an elective office"). Thus, for example, the
Party here states that besides nominating candidates, "other
business at its conventions" includes "adoption of resolutions
or platforms outlining the philosophy [of the Party]" and
rules governing its internal operation. App. 24. Under
Presley, these activities are very likely not subject to preclearance. See also 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995) (making clear that
"changes with respect to the recruitment of party members,
the conduct of political campaigns, and the drafting of party
platforms are not subject to the preclearance requirement").

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
I would note, moreover, that the lower courts have applied

$ 5 only to a small subcategory of party rules. See Hawthorne v. Baker, 750 F. Supp. 1090, 1094-1095 (MD Ala. 1990)
(three-judge court), vacated as moot, 499 U. S. 933 (1991);
Fortune v. Kings County Democratic County Committee,
598 F. Supp. 761, 764-765 (EDNY 1984) (three-judge court)
(per curiam); MacGuire v. Amos, 343 F. Supp. 119, 121
(MD Ala. 1972) (three-judge court) (per curiam).

While these limitations exclude much party activity--including much that takes place at an assembly of its members--I recognize that some of the First Amendment concerns raised by the dissents may render these limits yet
more restrictive in the case of party conventions. But the
practice challenged here--the fee--lies within the Act, and
well outside the area of greatest "associational" concern.
Like the more obviously evasive "all-white" devices, it is of
a kind that is the subject of a specific constitutional Amendment. U. S. Const., Amdt. 24, $ 1 (banning poll tax).

We go no further in this case because, as the dissents indicate, First Amendment questions about the extent to which
the Federal Government, through preclearance procedures,
can regulate the workings of a political party convention, are
difficult ones, see, e. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214 (1989), as are those
about the limits imposed by the state-action cases. See
Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991).
Those questions, however, are properly left for a case that
squarely presents them.

Such questions, we are satisfied, are not so difficult as to
warrant interpreting this Act as containing a loophole that
Congress could not have intended to create. See, e. g., Terry
v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.
649 (1944). See also Eu, supra, at 232 (recognizing that the

gation of the civil rights of party adherents"); Presley, supra,at 502-503 (setting out which voting-related practices are

subject to preclearance); Brief for Appellees 6-7 (agreeing$ 5 reaches certain primary-related party activity).

An interpretation of $$ 5 and 14(c)(1), in light of the language, history, and purpose of the Act, sufficient to avoidthat loophole is sufficient to answer the question presented

here. In this case, I conclude that this Court has not de-cided the exact boundaries that the Constitution draws
around the subcategory of party rules subject to $ 5. Fur-ther definition should await another day.

Finally, I agree with Justice Stevens that Congress
must be taken to have intended to authorize a private right
of action to enforce $ 10 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973h (1988
ed.). He explains, ante, at 231-232, that the rationale of
Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 556-557 (1969)
(Congress established private right of action to enforce $ 5),
applies with similar force not only to $ 2 but also to $ 10. Cf.
S. Rep. No. 97-417, pt. 1, p. 30 (1982) (implied private right
of action to enforce $ 2 "has been clearly intended by Congress since 1965"). The differences in statutory language
and structure between $$ 5 and 10 are not determinative.
Ante, at 232. In addition, I do not know why Congress
would have wanted to treat enforcement of $ 10 differently
from enforcement of $$ 2 and 5, particularly after 1975. In
that year, Congress focused on $ 10, deleted the then-obsolete

$ 10(d), made technical amendments to $ 10(b), and thereby
indicated its belief that $ 10 remained an important civil
rights provision. Pub. L. 94-73, $ 408, 89 Stat. 405. See
also S. Rep. No. 94-295, pp. 40-41 (1975) (reiterating general
importance of private enforcement of Act); H. R. Report
No. 94-196, pp. 33-34 (1975) (same). For these reasons, I
believe Congress intended to establish a private right of
action to enforce $ 10, no less than it did to enforce $$ 2 and
5. I express no view as to the merits of the underlying

$ 10 claim.

"Any interference with the freedom of a party is simulta-neously an interference with the freedom of its adherents."
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957). Forthat reason, we have always treated government assertion
of control over the internal affairs of political parties--which,after all, are simply groups of like-minded individual voters--as a matter of the utmost constitutional consequence.
See, e. g., Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin
ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 121-122 (1981); Cousins v.

case, therefore, is not merely interpretation of $ 5 of the Vot-ing Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, but, inextricably bound

up with that interpretation, the First Amendment freedom
of political association.There are several respects in which both

Justice Stevens' opinion and Justice Breyer's opinion concurring inthe judgment constitute remarkable departures from the settled course of our First Amendment jurisprudence. Themost obvious, perhaps, is their refusal to consider the present application of $ 5 unconstitutional on the basis of "hypo-thetical cases unrelated to the facts of this case [that] might
implicate First Amendment concerns." Stevens, J., ante,

at 228.1 Instead, they "leave consideration of hypotheticalconcerns for another day,"

ante, at 229, and reserve such"difficult" questions "for a case that squarely presents them,"

Breyer, J., ante, at 239. That is a luxury our precedentsdo not allow. It has been a constant of our free-speech jurisprudence that claimants whose First Amendment rights areaffected may challenge a statute, not merely on the ground
that its specific application to them is unconstitutional, but

also on the ground that its application is void in a substantialnumber of other contexts that arguably fall within its scope.

This principle of "overbreadth" has been applied not only inthe context of freedom of speech narrowly speaking, but also
in the context of the freedom to associate for the purpose of
political speech. See, e. g., United States v. Robel, 389 U. S.258, 265-266 (1967);

Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11,
18-19 (1966).Thus, to satisfy oneself that the particular practice challenged here lies "well outside the area of greatest `associa-tional' concern,"

Breyer, J., ante, at 239, is to take only the
first and smallest step in treating the weighty constitutional
question posed by application of $ 5 to political parties. In
this First Amendment context, to "go no further than necessary to decide the case at hand" means going far enough
to assure against overbreadth. We must do that whenever
"rights of association [are] ensnared in statutes which, by
their broad sweep, might result in burdening innocent associations." Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973)
(citing, inter alia, Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of
State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967)). Justice Stevens does
not assert that applying $ 5 to party activity passes First
Amendment muster except "in the case before us," ante,
at 229, and Justice Breyer acknowledges that the First
Amendment may bar application of $ 5 to other convention
activity, see ante, at 239. Yet despite these indications of
overbreadth, neither opinion attempts to provide what our
cases require: a "limiting construction or partial invalidation" that will "remove the seeming threat or deterrence to
constitutionally protected expression," Broadrick, supra, at
613.

Besides flouting the doctrine of overbreadth, the opinions'
refusal to provide "[f]urther definition" of $ 5's application to
political parties, Breyer, J., ante, at 240, leaves political parties without guidance as to "when [their] activities are, in
effect, substitutes for state nominating primaries," ante, at

238, and as to "which party nominating convention practicesfall within the scope of the Act," ibid.

2 Before today, this

Court has not tolerated such uncertainty in rules bearingupon First Amendment activities, because it causes persons

to refrain from engaging in constitutionally protected con-duct for fear of violation. See,

e. g., Baggett v. Bullitt, 377U. S. 360, 372 (1964). Surely such an effect can be expected

here. Party officials will at least abstain from proceedingwith certain convention activities without notification; and in
light of the high degree of uncertainty they may well decideto hold no conventions at all.

Another respect in which the Court today diverges fromour free-speech jurisprudence is even more astounding, if
possible, than its disregard of the doctrines of overbreadthand vagueness. From reading the majority's two opinions,
one would surmise that the only constitutional question at
issue is whether the First Amendment permits the FederalGovernment to make unlawful and set aside party rule

changes designed to hinder racial minorities' full participa-tion in election-related functions. But this statute does

not
present only that question, any more than a statute establishing a Board of Obscenity Censors, to which films or booksmust be submitted for approval before publication, presents

only the question whether the First Amendment permits theprohibition of obscenity. See,

e. g., Freedman v. Maryland,

2 Justice Breyer apparently thinks that the First Amendment concerns raised by appellees are minimal because many activities engaged in
by a party at its convention "are very likely not subject to preclearance."
Ante, at 238. Of course, a mere "very likelihood" that failure to preclear
a particular activity will not result in nullification of the work of the convention is hardly sufficient to induce a party organizer to take the chance.
In any event, I find curious the proposition that certain subsidiary determinations of the convention, such as " `adoption of resolutions or platforms
outlining the philosophy [of the Party],' " ibid., are not subject to Government oversight, whereas the determination of who may attend the convention--upon which all else depends--is subject to Government oversight.
That is a good bargain for the tyrant.

Scalia, J., dissenting
380 U. S. 51 (1965); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S.58 (1963). A point entirely ignored by

Justices Stevensand
Breyer is that this case involves a classic priorrestraint.

Our cases have heavily disfavored all manner of prior re-straint upon the exercise of freedoms guaranteed by the
First Amendment. Although most often imposed uponspeech, prior restraints are no less noxious, and have been
no less condemned, when directed against associational lib-erty (with which, we have said, freedom of speech "overlap[s]
and blend[s]," Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for
Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 300 (1981)). See
Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 539-540 (1945); Carroll v.President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175,

180-185 (1968); cf. Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169, 184 (1972).Today, however, a majority of the Court readily accepts the
proposition that $ 5 can subject this First Amendment free-dom to a permit system, requiring its exercise to be "precleared" with the Government even when it is not being usedunlawfully. The Court thus makes citizens supplicants in
the exercise of their First Amendment rights.As the five Justices who support the judgment of the
Court choose to read this statute, a political party (or at leastone that the State has awarded a place on the ballot

make no change in its practices or procedures that mightaffect a voter's capacity to have his candidate elected--no

3 Justice Stevens makes much of the fact that the nominee selected
by the Republican Party of Virginia, by reason of the outcome of prior
elections, had automatically been given a place on the primary ballot,
see ante, at 195-199, but he also explains his interpretation of $ 5 as "follow[ing] directly from our decision in Terry [v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461
(1953)]," ante, at 215, a case in which the private party's nominating election "did not involve the State's electoral apparatus in even the slightest
way," ibid. Justice Breyer alludes to Virginia's election laws, see ante,
at 238, but they are plainly incidental to his analysis, see ante, at 235-239.
So one must assume that what the Court today holds for parties whose
nominees are automatically listed is true for other parties as well.

matter how race neutral in purpose and effect--unless it
first obtains prior clearance by the Government, see Stevens, J., ante, at 203-207; Breyer, J., ante, at 237-239.Any change not precleared--after a proceeding in which the

burden rests on the party to show absence of discriminatory
purpose and effect, see City of Rome v. United States, 446U. S. 156, 172-173, 183, n. 18 (1980)--can be enjoined. Given

that political parties are organized with the near-exclusivepurpose of influencing the outcomes of elections, I think it
obvious that as construed today, $ 5 requires political partiesto submit for prior Government approval, and bear the burden of justifying, virtually every decision of consequence regarding their internal operations. That is the most outrageous tyranny. A freedom of political association that must
await the Government's favorable response to a "Mother,
may I?" is no freedom of political association at all.

There would be reason enough for astonishment and regret if today's judgment upheld a statute clearly imposing a
prior restraint upon private, First Amendment conduct.
But what makes today's action astonishing and regrettable
beyond belief is that this Court itself is the architect of a
prior restraint that the law does not clearly express. And
here is yet another respect in which today's opinions ignore
established law: their total disregard of the doctrine that,
where ambiguity exists, statutes should be construed to
avoid substantial constitutional questions. That has been
our practice because we presume that "Congress, which also
has sworn to protect the Constitution, would intend to err
on the side of fundamental constitutional liberties when its
legislation implicates those liberties." Regan v. Time, Inc.,
468 U. S. 641, 697 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). We have in the past
relied upon this canon to construe statutes narrowly, so as
not to impose suspect prior restraints. For example, in
Lowe v. SEC, 472 U. S. 181 (1985), we held that a statute
requiring all "investment advisors" to register with the

246 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Securities and Exchange Commission, see 15 U. S. C. $ 80b-3,does not extend to persons who publish "nonpersonalized"

investment advice such as periodic market commentary--thereby avoiding the question whether Congress could constitutionally require such persons to register. Lowe, supra,
at 190, 204-205, and n. 50. How insignificant that prior re-straint when compared with the requirement for preclearance of all changes in self-governance by political parties.What drives a majority of the Court to find a prior restraint where the text does not demand (or even suggest) itis the notion that it "strains credulity" to think that Congress would enact a Voting Rights Act that did not reach
political-party activity, Stevens, J., ante, at 217. Congress,
the majority believes, "could not have intended" such a result, Breyer, J., ante, at 239. I doubt the validity of that
perception; the assumption it rests upon--that a legislature
never adopts half-way measures, never attacks the easy part
of a problem without attacking the more sensitive part as
well--seems to me quite false. Indeed, the one-step-at-atime doctrine that we regularly employ in equal protection
cases is based on precisely the opposite assumption. See,
e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483,
488-489 (1955).

Moreover, even if one were to accept the majority's
question-begging assumption that Congress must have covered political-party activity, and even if one were to credit
their sole textual support for such coverage, today's decision
to impose a prior restraint upon purely private, politicalparty activity would still be incomprehensible. The sole
textual support adduced by the two opinions consists of $ 14's
reference to elections for "party office," and $ 2's reference
to "the political processes leading to nomination or election."
See Stevens, J., ante, at 207-209; Breyer, J., ante, at 236-
237. Justice Thomas gives compelling reasons why these
phrases cannot bear the meaning the majority would ascribe,
see post, at 277-282. But even accepting that they mean

what Justices Stevens and Breyer say, all that thephrase in $ 14 shows is that some portion of the Act reaches

private, political-party conduct; and all that the phrase in $ 2shows is that (at least in some circumstances) $ 2 does so.
Nothing in the text, nor anything in the assumption thatCongress

must have addressed political-party activity, com-pels the conclusion that Congress addressed political-party

activity in the preclearance, prior-restraint scheme of $ 5,4which is of course the only question immediately before us.
Thus, the only real credulity strainer involved here is thenotion that Congress would impose a restraint bearing a
"heavy presumption against its constitutional validity," Ban-tam Books, 372 U. S., at 70, in such a backhanded fashion--
saying simply "State[s]" and "political subdivision[s]" in $ 5,but meaning political parties as well. Because I find that
impossible to believe, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, dissenting.

I join Part II of Justice Thomas' dissent, which demonstrates that $ 10 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973h(1988 ed.), does not create a private right of action,

With respect to $ 5 of the Act, $ 1973c, this statutory con-struction case does not require us to explore the full reach

4 The Court majority would respond, perhaps, that the phrase "State or
political subdivision" in $ 5 should be read to have the same meaning that
it has in $ 2. Of course it normally should. But if the majority fancies
itself confronted with the choice between departing from that general rule
of construction (which, like all rules of construction, can be overcome by
other indication of statutory intent, see, e. g., Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84, 86-88 (1934)) and violating the inflexible principle that courts should not needlessly interpret a statute to impose a prior
restraint upon private political activity, it is not debatable where the outcome must lie. Of course, the imagined conflict between the rule and the
principle disappears if "State or political subdivision" is given its natural
meaning in both $ 5 and $ 2, subjecting political parties to neither.

of Congress' substantial power to enforce the Thirteenth,Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Cf.,

e. g., City of
Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 173-182 (1980). Nordoes it present the question whether the rule of attribution

we have adopted in the state-action cases would, of its own
force and without statutory implementation, extend theguarantees of the Equal Protection Clause to these appellants. The state-action doctrine and case authorities suchas

Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944), and Terry v.
Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953), may be of considerable rele-vance to equal protection or other constitutional challenges

still pending before the District Court, see ante, at 191-192
(opinion of Stevens, J.), but those matters need not be discussed here. It would be unwise to do so; for, with full recognition of the vital doctrine that Smith, Terry, and kindred
cases elaborate when we confront discrimination in the participatory processes that are the foundation of a democratic
society, we have been cautious to preserve the line separating state action from private behavior that is beyond the
Constitution's own reach. " `Careful adherence to the "state
action" requirement preserves an area of individual freedom
by limiting the reach of federal law' and avoids the imposition of responsibility on a State for conduct it could not control." National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, 488
U. S. 179, 191 (1988), quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,
457 U. S. 922, 936-937 (1982).

It is "unnecessary to traverse that difficult terrain in the
present case," Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 378 (1995), because $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act does not reach all entities or individuals who
might be considered the State for constitutional purposes.
Congress was aware of the difference between the State as
a political, governing body and other actors whose conduct
might be subject to constitutional challenge or the congressional enforcement power, and intended $ 5 to reach only the
former. Justice Thomas explains why $ 5, both by its

terms and with the gloss placed on it in United States v.
Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110 (1978), does not reach
the Republican Party of Virginia's actions. Post, at 254-263.Furthermore, Congress demonstrated its ability to distinguish between the State and other actors in the text of the
Act itself. Section 11 of the Act makes it unlawful for any"person acting under color of law" to "fail or refuse to permit

any person to vote who is entitled to vote under" specifiedprovisions of the Act, or to "willfully fail or refuse to tabulate, count, and report such person's vote," 42 U. S. C.$ 1973i(a), and also provides that "[n]o person, whether acting
under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten,
or coerce . . . any person for voting or attempting to vote,"

$ 1973i(b).

In the context of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 (1988 ed.), which uses similar language to describe the class of individuals subject to its reach
("[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or usage, of any State"), we have said
" `under color' of law has consistently been treated as the
same thing as the `state action' required under the Fourteenth Amendment." United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787,
794, n. 7 (1966). See also Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,
supra, at 929; Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830, 838
(1982); West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 49 (1988); National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, supra, at 182, n. 4;
Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 28 (1991). There is no apparent
reason why the "under color of law" requirement of $ 11
should not also be considered coterminous with the stateaction requirement of the Amendment that statute enforces,
and we should infer from Congress' employment of that requirement an intent to distinguish between the State and
those other actors to whom governmental status must be
imputed in some instances, cf. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513
U. S. 561, 568 (1995) (elementary canon of statutory construction to give a term a "consistent meaning throughout the

Act"). Congress knows the difference between regulating
States and other actors, and in $ 5 chose only to regulate
the States.

The First Amendment questions presented by governmental intrusion into political party functions are a further reason for caution before we adopt a blanket rule that preclearance is required on the theory that when Congress used the
word "State" it also meant "political party." Sensitive consideration of the rights of speech and association counsels
much restraint before finding that a political party is a state
actor for purposes of all preclearance requirements. In particular, we have called for circumspection in drawing the
state-action line where political parties and their roles in selecting representative leaders are concerned. See Cousins
v. Wigoda, 419 U. S. 477, 483, n. 4 (1975) (reserving question whether national political party's selection of delegates
to nominating convention amounts to state action). See
also id., at 492-494 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in result);
O'Brien v. Brown, 409 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1972) (per curiam) (staying order that political party seat certain delegates at its
national convention and expressing "grave doubts" about
Court of Appeals' action in case raising "[h]ighly important"
state-action question); Republican State Central Comm. of
Ariz. v. Ripon Society Inc., 409 U. S. 1222, 1226-1227 (1972)

banc), cert. denied, 424 U. S. 933 (1976).

Notwithstanding the terse dismissals of these concerns in
the opinions that support today's judgment, ante, at 228-229
(opinion of Stevens, J.); ante, at 239 (Breyer, J., concurring
in judgment), we have recognized before now the important
First Amendment values that attach to a political party's
"freedom to identify the people who constitute the association, and to limit the association to those people only."

Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122 (1981). These concerns wouldprovide a sound basis for construing an ambiguous reference

to the term "State" to avoid constitutional difficulties. See
Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 924-928 (1995) (refusing to
defer to Attorney General's interpretation of $ 5 that raised
equal protection concerns). Cf. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501U. S. 452, 460-464 (1991) (adopting plain statement rule with

respect to statutory ambiguity that implicates Tenth Amend-ment concerns). Given the absence of any ambiguity in the
statutory text before us, there is no basis for a grasping andimplausible construction of the Act that brings these constitutional problems to the fore.

We are well advised to remember that Congress, too, can
contribute in drawing the fine distinctions required in the
balancing of associational and participatory rights. Cf.
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 577 (1995) (Kennedy,
J., concurring) ("[I]t would be mistaken and mischievous for
the political branches to forget that the sworn obligation to
preserve and protect the Constitution in maintaining the federal balance is their own in the first and primary instance").
No such fine distinctions were attempted, I would submit,
in this statute; if anything "strains credulity," ante, at 217
(opinion of Stevens, J.), it is that Congress meant to include
the Democratic and Republican Parties when it used the
simple word "State" in the Voting Rights Act.

The opinions supporting the judgment express concern
that cases like Smith and Terry would not be covered by the
Voting Rights Act were the interpretation adopted today to
be rejected. To begin with, of course, we should note that
the Voting Rights Act was not needed to invalidate the discrimination that occurred in those cases. The Constitution
of its own force did that. What we confront here, instead,
is a statutory scheme in which entities seeking preclearance
must ask a political officer (the Attorney General of the
United States) for permission to change various internal procedures. It is a far reach to suppose that Congress required

Kennedy, J., dissenting
this for ordinary party processes. The White Primary
Cases involved ever-increasing efforts on the part of the
State itself to camouflage discrimination in the guise of party
activity. See ante, at 211-213 (opinion of Stevens, J.).
There is no claim in this case that the Commonwealth's statutory policy of allowing the Republican Party (and any other
political party that receives at least 10 percent of the vote in
either of two preceding elections) the option to nominate by
primary or convention, Va. Code Ann. $ 24.2-509 (1993), is
void on account of the Commonwealth's failure to preclear
that policy in accordance with the requirements of $ 5.
Rather, the argument embraced today is that the Party itself
acted in violation of $ 5 by failing to preclear the $45 registration fee. We would face a much different case if a State,
without first seeking $ 5 preclearance, restructured its election laws in order to allow political parties the opportunity
to practice unlawful discrimination in the nominating process. If, as seems likely, such a change constituted a "voting
qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,
or procedure with respect to voting different from that in
force or effect on November 1, 1964," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, $ 5
would require preclearance by the State. For this reason,
appellants' counsel overstated the matter by arguing that if
Congress intended to reach only States qua States, and not
political parties, "the Voting Rights Act would have been
strangled at its birth." Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.

Although Congress enacted $ 5 to counteract the notorious
history of attempts to evade the guarantees of equal treatment in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301,
327-328 (1966), that history does not give us license to expand the Act's coverage beyond the boundaries of the statutory text, Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491,
509 (1992). I would adhere to that text, which reflects a
decided intent on Congress' part to reach governmental, not
private, entities. With respect, I dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and

Two discrete questions of statutory interpretation control
appellants' claim under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act: whetherthe Republican Party of Virginia is a "State or political subdivision" and, if so, whether the fee imposed upon its conventioneers constitutes a procedure "with respect to voting."
42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. The plain meaning of the Voting Rights
Act mandates a negative answer to both of these questions.
The text of the Act also forecloses the availability of a private cause of action under $ 10. I therefore dissent.

I
A

Section 5 declares that, "[w]henever a State or political
subdivision . . . shall enact or seek to administer" any change
with respect to voting, it may not institute that change
absent preclearance. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (emphasis added).
Only when a "State or political subdivision" promulgates
new voting rules is $ 5 even arguably implicated. See
United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110, 141
(1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("As a starting point, it is
clear that [$ 5] applies only to actions taken by two types of
political units--States or political subdivisions"). Thus, the
first issue to be decided here is whether the Republican
Party of Virginia is the type of entity that must comply with
the preclearance requirement of $ 5.

Justice Stevens does not directly address this threshold
question of pure statutory interpretation. He begins with
the Attorney General's regulation, rather than with the text
of $ 5 itself. Cf. Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 128 (1991) ("As always, we begin with
the language of the statute and ask whether Congress has

spoken on the subject before us"). In my opinion, the Re-publican Party of Virginia is not a "State or political subdivision" within the meaning of $ 5, and that statute is thereforenot triggered in this case.

1
The Voting Rights Act provides no definition of the term"State." When words in a statute are not otherwise defined, it is fundamental that they "will be interpreted as tak-ing their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning."

Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979). The ordinarymeaning of the word "State" does not encompass a partisan

group such as the Republican Party of Virginia. Rather,that word--particularly when capitalized--is generally understood to mean one of the 50 constituent States of theUnion. See Webster's New International Dictionary 2461
(2d ed. 1957) (defining "State" as "any body of people occupy-ing a definite territory and politically organized under one
government, esp. one that is a sovereign, or not subject toexternal control; . . . Cf.

commonwealth"). Indeed, itnearly belabors the point to explain that, in common parlance, "State" normally refers to a geographical unit of theUnited States, such as California or Massachusetts. Our
own opinions in $ 5 cases use the word in this natural fashion.See,

e. g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, supra,at 113 ($ 5 "requires that States, like Alabama," preclear

new voting rules) (emphasis added); Hadnott v. Amos, 394U. S. 358, 365-366 (1969) ($ 5 "provides that whenever States
like Alabama seek to administer" voting changes, they mustpreclear) (emphasis added). Even

Justice Stevens em-ploys "State" in its usual sense. See

ante, at 193 ("Virginiais one of the seven
States to which the $ 4 coverage formulawas found applicable . . . . The entire Commonwealth has

been subject to the preclearance obligation of $ 5 ever since")(emphasis added).

That the statutory term "State" should be applied in lightof its ordinary meaning is reinforced by the Act's definition

of the term "political subdivision." Section 14(c)(2) statesthat " `political subdivision' shall mean any county or parish,"

with certain exceptions not relevant here. 42 U. S. C.$ 1973

l(c)(2). As appellants' counsel explained at oral argument, the phrase "political subdivision" refers to "particular
geographic regions" within a State, such as New York'sWestchester County. Tr. of Oral Arg. 15-16. See also

United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, supra, at 128,n. 15 ($ 14(c)(2) "obviously refer[s] to a geographic territory,
and the usages of `political subdivision' in the Act and thelegislative history leave no doubt but that it is in this sense
that Congress used the term").1 Given that limited under-standing of "political subdivision," it would be odd indeed
if the term "State," which immediately precedes "politicalsubdivision," did not have an analogous meaning. The
terms "State" and "political subdivision" should both be con-strued to refer solely to the various territorial divisions
within a larger unit of territorially defined government.

There is further statutory evidence to support this interpretation of "State." The Act elsewhere speaks of the
"territory" of a State or political subdivision. See, e. g.,

$ 1973b(a)(1)(F) (referring to "such State or political subdivision and all governmental units within its territory") (emphasis added). Political parties, of course, are made up not
of land, but of people. It is nonsensical to talk of things
existing "within [the] territory" of a political party. Also,
the definitional section of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, Pub. L. 91-285, 84 Stat. 316, indicates that
Congress uses the word "State" in voting rights statutes to

1 There is thus no colorable argument in this case that the Party is a
"political subdivision" within the meaning of $ 14(c)(2); it is not a geographic territory, such as a "county or parish," within a State. Appellants
assert no such claim, apparently in recognition of the weakness of the
argument. If the Party falls under $ 5, it could only be because it is a
"State" or state actor, as appellants and the United States maintain. See

and judicial bodies. When the legislature passes a law, oran administrative agency issues a policy directive, official action has unquestionably been taken in the name of the State.Accordingly, voting changes administered by such entities
have been governed consistently by $ 5. See, e. g., Allen v.
State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544 (1969) (requiring preclearance of amendments to Mississippi Code enacted by
state legislature and bulletin distributed by Virginia Board
of Elections). See also United States v. Saint Landry Parish School Bd., 601 F. 2d 859, 864, n. 8 (CA5 1979) ("The
cases uniformly speak of $ 5 as applying to `enactments,' `legislation,' `regulations,' and `laws'--all actions taken by the
governmental authority of state"). Unlike the Virginia General Assembly, however, the Republican Party of Virginia is
not an organ of the State through which the State must conduct its affairs, and the Party has no authority to formulate
state law. The Party's promulgations thus cannot be within

$ 5's reach of "any state enactment which alter[s] the election
law of a covered State." Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,
supra, at 566 (quoted ante, at 204).

Although Justice Stevens points to past preclearance
submissions as evidence that $ 5 covers political parties, ante,
at 200-201, n. 18, those submissions are largely irrelevant to
the meaning of $ 5. It should come as no surprise that once
the Attorney General promulgated a regulation expressly
covering political parties, 28 CFR $ 51.7 (effective Jan. 5,
1981), some of those organizations requested preclearance
and the Justice Department processed their requests. Tellingly, Justice Stevens is able to cite only a handful of party

submissions that predate the Attorney General's regulation.2
This fact confirms what common sense instructs: Most people
who read $ 5 simply would not think that the word "State"
embraces political parties. This commonsense understanding also explains why virtually every one of this Court's

$ 5 cases has involved a challenge to, or a request for approval of, action undertaken by a State or a unit of state
government.3

2 Justice Stevens has discovered five instances of such party submissions. See ante, at 200-201, n. 18. Per year, however, at least several
thousand preclearance requests are sent to the Attorney General. See,
e. g., Annual Report of the Attorney General 161 (1982) ("During the year,
over 2,800 submissions involving more than 13,300 voting-related changes
were submitted to the Attorney General under Section 5"); Annual Report
of the Attorney General 131 (1986) ("During fiscal year 1986, over 3,700
submissions involving more than 20,000 changes were submitted to the
Attorney General under Section 5").

Thomas, J., dissenting
In light of the plain meaning of the phrase "State or politi-cal subdivision," I see no reason to defer to the Attorney

General's regulation interpreting that statute to cover politi-cal parties. See 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995). Though the Party
has not challenged the validity of the regulation, it hardlyfollows that this Court is bound to accept it as authoritative.
We defer to the Attorney General on statutory matterswithin her authority "only if Congress has not expressed its
intent with respect to the question, and then only if the ad-ministrative interpretation is reasonable."

Presley v. Eto-wah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 508 (1992). As explained, $ 5 on its face resolves the question whether politicalparties are subject to the preclearance rule of $ 5: A political
party is simply not a "State," regardless of the particularactivity in which it might be engaging. Congress has conveyed its intent to limit $ 5 to the States themselves andtheir political subdivisions. Accordingly, the regulation
warrants no judicial deference. Cf. id., at 508-509 (decliningto defer to Attorney General's construction of $ 5).

My reading of $ 5 is squarely supported by our only prece-dent on the applicability of $ 5 to political parties,

Williamsv. Democratic Party of Georgia, Civ. Action No. 16286 (ND

Ga., Apr. 6, 1972), aff 'd, 409 U. S. 809 (1972). Williams held,as a matter of "statutory construction," Civ. Action No.
16286, at 5, that $ 5 does not apply to political parties. TheDistrict Court stated that "[t]he Act does not refer to actions
by political parties but refers to actions by a `State or political subdivision.' " Id., at 4. Though the District Court be4 Justice Stevens contends that the foregoing discussion is "surprising
because [his] explanation of why $ 5 applies to political parties places no
reliance on principles of administrative deference." Ante, at 222. By
presupposing that the regulation is a valid interpretation of $ 5, however,
Justice Stevens simply assumes that $ 5 could cover political parties.
Thus, he does not just defer to the Attorney General's reading of $ 5, but
displaces $ 5 with the regulation. Cf. Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n,
supra, at 508 ("Deference does not mean acquiescence"). For the reasons
given above, I would not do the same.

lieved, based on legislative history, that Congress probably
meant to include the election of party delegates under the
Act, the court felt itself bound by the fact that $ 5 addresses
only actions of the State. This limitation was further evidenced, in the court's view, by $ 5's provision that preclearance be sought by "the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c. The District Court concluded that the State itself
had "no connection" with the delegate selection process
other than providing for the public filing of the rules for selection, and that, though the action of the Party might be
"state action" in the constitutional sense, $ 5 could not be
read so broadly. Civ. Action No. 16286, at 5. Essential to
the judgment of the District Court in Williams was the holding that $ 5 does not encompass political parties. The affirmance of that holding, which is entitled to precedential
weight, is instructive here.5

Contrary to the suggestion of Justice Stevens, United
States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110 (1978), does
not support the contention that the Republican Party of Virginia is subject to $ 5. See ante, at 204, 219. The precise
question presented in that case was whether $ 5 required the
city of Sheffield, Alabama, to preclear a voting change. The

5 Justice Stevens' attempt to distinguish, and even to draw support
from, Williams is unpersuasive. See ante, at 201-203. The fact that Virginia grants ballot access to the Party's nominee in this case does not
establish state involvement in the nominating convention. In holding its
convention, the Party exercised no state-delegated power. See infra, at
269-276. Further, Justice Stevens mischaracterizes Williams when
he declares that the "only" reason that the District Court did not require
preclearance was because no adequate administrative procedures existed;
the Williams court noted that the lack of such procedures buttressed its
premise that $ 5 applies only to States and political subdivisions. Civ.
Action No. 16286, at 4. Finally, 28 CFR $ 51.23(b) (1995), which now provides that party officials may submit rules for preclearance, cannot change
the language of $ 5, which is still limited, as it was at the time Williams
was decided, to States and political subdivisions.

controversy arose because $ 14(c)(2) of the Act defines "political subdivision" as a county or parish, "except that where
registration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include any other
subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(2). Notwithstanding the facts
that the city was not a county or parish and that it did not
register voters, the Court concluded that the city was subject to the preclearance requirement of $ 5. The essence of
Sheffield's rationale was that because the entire State of Alabama was designated for coverage pursuant to $ 4(b), the city
of Sheffield was covered by $ 5 because it was a "political
unit" (though not a "political subdivision") within Alabama.
435 U. S., at 127-128.

Whether or not Sheffield was correct as an original matter,
it stands, at most, for the proposition that a local unit of
government, like a city, may be considered the "State" for
purposes of $ 5: "[Section] 5 . . . applies territorially and includes political units like Sheffield whether or not they conduct voter registration." Id., at 130. In accordance with
that proposition, we have applied Sheffield to find coverage
of other types of governmental bodies under $ 5. See, e. g.,
Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 45 (1978)
(finding $ 5 coverage of county school board under Sheffield
and noting that "[i]f only those governmental units with official electoral obligations actuate the preclearance requirements of $ 5," the purposes of the Act could be undermined)
(emphasis added). But we have never applied Sheffield to
find a nongovernmental organization to be within the scope
of $ 5. This is because Sheffield says little about the question whether a group that does not operate in the name of
the State, or in the name of any governmental unit of a State,
must comply with $ 5. If anything, Sheffield suggests, with
respect to this case, that a political party is not so obligated,
because a political party is quite plainly neither a territorial

division of a State nor a governmental unit acting on behalf
of any such territory.

Undoubtedly, Sheffield speaks in broad terms when it
states that $ 5 "applies to all entities having power over any
aspect of the electoral process within designated jurisdictions, not only to counties or to whatever units of state government perform the function of registering voters." 435
U. S., at 118 (quoted ante, at 204, 220). That language must
be viewed in the context of the case, however. The holding
of Sheffield applies only to governmental bodies within a
State--i. e., cities, counties, or municipalities, and their agencies--not to private groups with a partisan, or "political,"
agenda. See, e. g., Sheffield, 435 U. S., at 117 ("We first consider whether Congress intended to exclude from $ 5 coverage political units, like Sheffield, which have never conducted voter registration"); id., at 124 ("Congress could not
have intended $ 5's duties to apply only to those cities that
register voters"); ibid. ("local political entities like Sheffield"
can impair minority votes in ways other than registration)
(all emphases added). In the legislative history Sheffield
cites as support for its holding that "political units" are covered regardless of whether they register voters, every entity
mentioned is a governmental one. See id., at 133-134 (cities;
school districts; city councils; precincts; county districts; and
municipalities). There is no basis in Sheffield and its progeny for covering nongovernmental entities under $ 5.

Nonetheless, there is a critical similarity between this case
and Sheffield. Just as in Sheffield, a majority of the Court
has inflated the phrase "State or political subdivision" to implausible proportions. The dissent in Sheffield warned that
"the logistical and administrative problems inherent in reviewing all voting changes of all political units strongly suggest that Congress placed limits on the preclearance requirement." Id., at 147 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Today, the
Justices that support the judgment go much further and re517us1$38N 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT

quire all "established" political parties, ante, at 219, in desig-nated States to preclear all changes " `affecting voting,' "

ante, at 227. See also ante, at 238 (Breyer, J.) (suggestingthat political groups that receive state-law preferences in access to, and placement on, the ballot must preclear "votingrelated" changes). As the Solicitor General candidly ac-knowledged, an "affecting-voting" or "voting-related" rule

cannot be limited to practices administered at conventions;it logically extends to practices at all local mass meetings
that precede conventions. See Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 20, n. 11. And almost all activity that occurs at a nominating convention theoretically affects voting;indeed,

Justice Stevens is unable to articulate any principled dividing line between that which does and does not
relate to voting at a convention. See ante, at 227. Thus,today's decision will increase exponentially the number of

preclearance requests, for even the most innocuous changes,that the Attorney General must process within a statutorily
limited amount of time. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (60 days)."[I]t is certainly reasonable to believe that Congress, having
placed a strict time limit on the Attorney General's consider-ation of submissions, also deliberately placed a limit on the
number and importance of the submissions themselves.
This result was achieved by restricting the reach of $ 5 to
enactments of either the States themselves or their political
subdivisions." Sheffield, supra, at 148 (Stevens, J., dissenting). That the inclusion of political parties under $ 5 demeans the preclearance regime and so drastically increases
its scope substantially undermines the possibility that Congress intended parties to preclear.

Without so much as a nod to the explicit "State or political
subdivision" limitation in $ 5, Justice Stevens substitutes
the administrative regulation as the analytical starting point
in this case. See ante, at 194-195. He apparently does so
because the Party failed to challenge the regulation and its
counsel stated at oral argument that $ 5 could sometimes encompass political parties. See ante, at 194-195, 220, n. 32,

222-223, n. 35. We did not take this case to review the Dis-trict Court's application of the regulation based on the facts

of this case, but to decide whether "[$ ]5 of the Voting RightsAct of 1965 require[s] preclearance of a political party's decision . . . to impose" a fee on conventiongoers. Juris. State-ment i. Consequently, appellants and the Government argued that the Party was covered as a "State" under $ 5, seen. 7,

infra, and the Party maintained that $ 5 "requires actionby a State or political subdivision." Brief for Appellees 29.

See also id., at 30 ("A political party is not a subdivision orinstrumentality of the government [under Sheffield]").

Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer address the questionpresented, however, only in the course of dismissing the

dissents' arguments, and after they reach their respectiveconclusions.

Furthermore, the tactical or legal error of a litigant cannotdefine the meaning of a federal statute. See generally
Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968). Our duty is to readthe statute for ourselves. While the regulation may "unambiguously provid[e] that . . . a political party" must preclear,ante, at 194 (opinion of

Stevens, J.), the statute does nothingof the sort, regardless of any submission by the Party. Accordingly, I would decide this case on the ground that theRepublican Party of Virginia is not a "State" in the ordinary
sense of the word. Its rules and policies should thereforenot be subject to $ 5.

6 Justice Stevens rejects this reading of $ 5 as being "at war with the
intent of Congress and with our settled interpretation of the Act." Ante,
at 220. First, as explained supra, at 256-258, and n. 3, 258-261, there is
no precedent for the application of $ 5 to nongovernmental units; the issue
is anything but "settled." Justice Stevens errs when he states that
"[t]he operative test, we have stated repeatedly, is whether a political
party exercises power over the electoral process." Ante, at 218. We
have never made any such statement, because we have never before addressed the question whether political parties are subject to $ 5. Second,
Justice Stevens cites only legislative history as evidence of Congress'
"unambiguously expressed . . . purpose" that $ 5 should apply to the "candidate selection process." Ante, at 224. Section 5, of course, could apply in

To the limited extent that Justice Stevens and Justice
Breyer address the triggering language in $ 5, they fail to
explain adequately how it is that the Party could qualify as
a "State or political subdivision" under the Act. By referring to the White Primary Cases, however, they reveal the
only conceivable basis in law for deeming the acts of the
Party to be those of the State: the doctrine of state action,
as developed under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.7 In attempting to establish the relevance of that

the context of the "candidate selection process," if the State itself enacted
or sought to administer the contested change. But Justice Stevens
points to nothing in $ 5, or even in that statute's legislative history, that
expresses any intent to include political parties within the meaning of
"State or political subdivision." Finally, it is perfectly reasonable to
suppose that the term "State" has a different meaning in $ 5 than it does
in the Fifteenth Amendment. Cf. ante, at 221. This Court has affirmed
in other contexts that statutory language does not necessarily mean the
same thing as parallel language in the Constitution. For instance, "[a]lthough the language of [28 U. S. C. $ 1331 (1982 ed.)] parallels that of the
`Arising Under' Clause of Article III, this Court never has held that statutory `arising under' jurisdiction is identical to Art. III `arising under' jurisdiction." Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 494
(1983). Here, the ordinary-meaning rule of statutory construction, which
governs the interpretation of $ 5, explains why political parties could be
covered under the Fifteenth Amendment, but not under $ 5: The commonsense definition of "State" is very different from the complex doctrine of
state action that this Court has developed as a matter of constitutional law.

7 In fact, the Government identified our state-action cases under the Fifteenth Amendment as the justification for the Attorney General's regulation on which Justice Stevens bases his judgment. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 10-11. Review of the regulation confirms that
it is premised upon the notion that the Party's activities can sometimes
be treated as those of the State. See 28 CFR $ 51.7 (1995) (referring

to "public electoral function" carried out by parties and to parties "acting under authority explicitly or implicitly granted by a covered jurisdiction"). Likewise, appellants relied solely on state-action theory as
their rationale for bringing the Party within $ 5. See Brief for Appellants
14-20, 24-25.

constitutional doctrine to this statutory case, more by repeti-tion than analysis, both opinions suggest that the meaning of

the statutory term "State" in $ 5 is necessarily coterminouswith the constitutional doctrine of state action. See, ante,
at 199-200, 210-219, 221 (opinion of Stevens, J.); ante, at235-237 (

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). I cannotagree.

The text of $ 5 does not support this constitutional gloss.There is a marked contrast between the language of $ 5 and
other federal statutes that we have read to be coextensivewith the constitutional doctrine of state action. Specifically,
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 has been accorded a reach equivalent tothat of the Fourteenth Amendment. See

Lugar v. Edmond-son Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 934-935 (1982); United States v.

Price, 383 U. S. 787, 794, n. 7 (1966). That statute providesa cause of action against "[e]very person who, under color of
any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of anyState" deprives any citizen of federal constitutional or statutory rights. 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. Section 1983's coveragereasonably extends beyond official enactments of the State,
since it expressly provides for coverage of persons who actunder authority of the State. If Congress intended to incorporate state-action doctrine into $ 5, one would expect $ 5 toread more like $ 1983. That is, it might require preclearance
"whenever a State or political subdivision or any person acting under color of State law" seeks to enact voting changes.8But $ 5 does not read like $ 1983.

8 Justice Stevens argues that this example does not by its terms cover
political parties. See ante, at 221-222, n. 34. The criticism is beside the
point, however, because the example is not intended to demonstrate how
Congress could have covered political parties as such; that, of course, could
be easily achieved by inserting "political parties" in the opening clause of

$ 5. Instead, the example is meant to emphasize that there is no textual
basis for the conclusion that Congress imported the constitutional doctrine
of state action into $ 5. Because there is no evidence that Congress did
so, Justice Stevens, as well as Justice Breyer, is wrong to use stateaction doctrine as license to read "State" to mean "political party."

The Voting Rights Act does, in fact, contain precisely suchlanguage in a different section. "[W]here Congress includes

particular language in one section of a statute but omits itin another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed
that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the dispar-ate inclusion or exclusion."

Russello v. United States, 464U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 11(a) of the Act provides that "[n]o person acting undercolor of law shall fail or refuse to permit any person to vote
who is entitled to vote under any provision of [the VotingRights Act and supplemental provisions] or is otherwise
qualified to vote, or willfully fail or refuse to tabulate, count,and report such person's vote." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973i(a) (emphasis added). See also $ 1973i(b) ("No person, whether
acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate,threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or

coerce any person for voting or attempting to vote") (empha-sis added). These provisions of the Act account for the very
possibility that seems to motivate the Court's strained inter-pretation of $ 5: that persons acting individually or as part
of a group, as opposed to States or political subdivisionsthrough their governmental bodies, will interfere with the
right to vote.I would not, therefore, accept the proposition that the
constitutional doctrine of state action defines the breadth ofthe statutory term "State." Given the clarity of the word
"State," together with the facts that Congress has tradition-ally encompassed the broad category of state action by using
the phrase "under color of law," and has done so in otherparts of this very Act, it is evident that Congress did not
mean to incorporate state-action doctrine in $ 5.

Even indulging the argument that $ 5's coverage extendsto all activity that qualifies as state action for constitutional

purposes, the Court's further assumption that the actions of

the Party in this case are fairly attributable to the State isirreconcilable with our state-action precedents.

Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer are correct tosuggest that, under the White Primary Cases--most notably

Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944), and Terry v. Adams,345 U. S. 461 (1953)--political parties may sometimes be
characterized as state actors. Where they err, however, is
in failing to recognize that the state-action principle of thosecases "does not reach to all forms of private political activity." Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U. S. 149, 158 (1978).Rather, it "encompasses only state-regulated elections or
elections conducted by organizations which in practiceproduce `the uncontested choice of public officials.' "

Ibid.
(quoting Terry, supra, at 484 (Clark, J., concurring)). Thus,
the White Primary Cases do not stand for the categoricalrule that political parties are state actors, but only for the

proposition that, in limited factual circumstances, a particular political party may be deemed an agent of the State.

This case is not governed by the state-action principle
enunciated in either Smith or Terry. Unlike the primary in
Smith, the Republican Party of Virginia's convention was not
a " `state-regulated electio[n]' " to which the doctrine of state
action extends. Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, supra, at 158.
As an initial matter, it is important to recognize that Smith
is on its face limited to primary elections. That is, Smith
requires a sufficient degree of state regulation that "the
party which is required to follow these legislative directions
[is made] an agency of the State in so far as it determines
the participants in a primary election." 321 U. S., at 663

9 Although Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer never expressly acknowledge their reliance on state-action theory, each finds it necessary to
look to that case law for support. See ante, at 199-200, 210-219, 221;
ante, at 235-237. Indeed, Justice Stevens' discussion of whether the
Party acted under the Commonwealth of Virginia's authority in holding
the convention is virtually indistinguishable from state-action analysis.
See ante, at 194-200.

(emphasis added). In this case, the Party played no role indetermining the participants in an election--whether primary, general, or special--but required persons who wishedto attend its convention to pay a fee.

But, even assuming that the reasoning of Smith applies toconventions as well as actual elections, there is still insufficient state regulation in this case to find that "the party . . .[is] an agency of the State."

Ibid. In Smith, the party wascompelled by statute to hold a primary and was subject to

myriad laws governing the primary from start to finish.See id., at 653, n. 6, 662-663. By comparison, the amount
and burden of the state regulation in this case pale. Appel-lants point to only two provisions of the Virginia Code that
directly regulate nominating conventions. Section 24.2-510imposes certain deadlines for the nomination of candidates
by methods other than a primary. Va. Code. Ann. $ 24.2-510(1993). And once a candidate is selected, $ 24.2-511 requires
that the party chairman certify the candidate to the StateBoard of Elections.

Ibid. While $ 24.2-509 permits partiesto choose their own method of nomination, it is a purely permissive, not a mandatory, provision; the party is not "re-quired to follow [this] legislative directio[n]."

Smith v. All-wright, 321 U. S., at 663. There exists no "statutory system

for the selection of party nominees for inclusion on the gen-eral election ballot," ibid.; there are only a few relatively
minor statutory requirements. In other words, when theparty holds its convention to select a candidate, it is party,
not state, machinery that is put in gear. Cf. United Statesv.

Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 318 (1941).10

10 While Justice Stevens believes that the decision in Smith did not
depend at all upon state regulation of primaries, ante, at 199-200, and
n. 17, Smith is by its terms premised upon the existence of a "statutory
system." See Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 662-664 (1944) (detailing
state law relating to primaries and concluding that the "statutory system"
in Texas for the selection of party nominees "makes the party which is
required to follow these legislative directions an agency of the State").

Nor does coverage of the Party in this case "follo[w] di-rectly from . . .

Terry." Ante, at 215 (opinion of Stevens,
J.). The three separate opinions that constituted the major-ity in that case contain little analysis of the state-action question, and there was certainly no theory of state action upon
which the majority agreed. See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks,
supra, at 158, and n. 6. Consequently, the holding in Terry
has since been rationalized in light of two unique factual
predicates: (1) a candidate selection system that foreordained
the winner of the general election; and (2) the participation
of the State in the intentional evasion of the Constitution for
the purpose of discrimination. See Edmonson v. Leesville
Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 625 (1991) ("The Jaybird candidate was certain to win the Democratic primary and the
Democratic candidate was certain to win the general election"); Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 64 (1980) (explaining
Terry on grounds that "[t]he candidates chosen in the Jaybird
primary . . . invariably won in the subsequent Democratic
primary and in the general election" and that "there was
agreement that the State was involved in the purposeful exclusion of Negroes from participation in the election process"). The nub of Terry was that the Jaybird primary was
the de facto general election and that Texas consciously permitted it to serve as such; thus, the exclusion of blacks from
that event violated the Fifteenth Amendment.

This case involves neither of the operative premises of
Terry. First, there is no hint of state involvement in any
purposeful evasion of the Constitution. No one--not the litigants, the Government, or the court below--has so much as
suggested that the Party, in concert with the State, held a
convention rather than a primary in order to avoid the constitutional ban on race-based discrimination. Nor has anyone implied that the Party had any intent to discriminate on
the basis of race when it decided to charge a fee to cover

the costs of the convention.11 Second, it simply cannot be
maintained that exclusion from the Party's 1994 convention
was tantamount to exclusion from the general election. The
fact that the Party's 1994 nominee for the United States
Senate lost the general election is proof enough that the
modern-day Republican Party in Virginia does not have the
stranglehold on the political process that the Democratic
Party of Texas had in the 1940's.12 In short, this case is a

far cry from Terry, and it does not fall within the bounds of
state action delineated, albeit none too clearly, by Terry.13

In any event, subsequent decisions of this Court have
"carefully defined" the scope of Smith and Terry. Flagg
Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U. S., at 158. As we have refined

11 It is true, as Justice Stevens states, that potential for discrimination is the prevailing test for preclearance under $ 5. See ante, at 216-217,
and n. 29. But that is a different question from whether the Party's conduct rises to the level of state action under Terry, the issue I address here.

12 Justice Stevens claims that, under United States v. Classic, 313

U. S. 299 (1941), "[v]oting at the nomination stage is protected regardless
of whether it `invariably, sometimes or never determines the ultimate
choice of the representative.' " Ante, at 218. Classic did not so hold.
Even assuming that Classic applies to conventions as well as primaries,
that case merely stated, in dicta, that "where the primary is by law made
an integral part of the election machinery," 313 U. S., at 318, the right to
participate in a primary does not turn upon the dispositive nature of the
primary. Party nominating conventions in Virginia have not been merged
by law with the election machinery of the State. See supra, at 269 and this
page. Contrary to what Justice Stevens says, ante, at 218-219, n. 31,
the petition procedure at issue in Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814 (1969),
was by law made a part of the State's electoral system: It was expressly
mandated by state statute. See id., at 815 (citing Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46,

$ 10-3 (1967)).

13 In light of Smith and Terry, Justice Breyer concludes that the word

"State" does not "automatically place a party's all-white evasive maneuvers beyond [$ 5's] reach." Ante, at 237 (emphasis deleted). That, however, is not this case. As discussed above, there is no basis in fact for
inferring that the Party charged the fee as a strategy for producing an
" `all-white' convention process" or as a method of evading the Constitution. Ibid. And the record in no way suggests that the three law students challenging the fee are black.

our state-action jurisprudence, the White Primary Cases
have come to stand for a relatively limited principle. When
political parties discharge functions "traditionally performed" by and " `exclusively reserved to' " government,
their actions are fairly attributable to the State. Ibid.
(quoting Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345,
352 (1974)). See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., supra,
at 621 (citing Terry as a case in which "the actor is performing a traditional governmental function"); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S., at 939 (citing Terry as illustration of
"the `public function' test"). In Terry, the Jaybirds performed the traditional and exclusive state function of conducting what was, in effect, the actual election.

In applying the public function test, "our holdings have
made clear that the relevant question is not simply whether
a private group is serving a `public function.' " RendellBaker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830, 842 (1982) (citation omitted).
Instead, "[w]e have held that the question is whether the
function performed has been `traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.' " Ibid. As Justice O'Connor explained the White Primary Cases, "the government functions in these cases had one thing in common: exclusivity."
Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S., at 640 (dissenting opinion). Thus, in order to constitute state action
under the public function test, "private conduct must not
only comprise something that the government traditionally
does, but something that only the government traditionally
does." Ibid.

The Party's selection of a candidate at the convention does
not satisfy that test. As we stated in Flagg Bros., Inc. v.
Brooks, "the Constitution protects private rights of association and advocacy with regard to the election of public officials" and it is only "the conduct of the elections themselves
[that] is an exclusively public function." 436 U. S., at 158
(citing Terry). Thus, we have carefully distinguished the
"conduct" of an election by the State from the exercise of

517us1$38N 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT
272 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Thomas, J., dissenting
private political rights within that state-created framework.Providing an orderly and fair process for the selection of

public officers is a classic exclusive state function. As theConstitution itself evidences, the organization of the electoral process has been carried out by States since the founding: "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections forSenators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each

State by the Legislature thereof." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 4,cl. 1.

By contrast, convening the members of a political associa-tion in order to select the person who can best represent and
advance the group's goals is not, and historically never has
been, the province of the State--much less its exclusive
province. The selection of a party candidate is not the type
of function, such as eminent domain, that is "traditionally
associated with sovereignty." Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, at 353. Cf. San Francisco Arts & Athletics,
Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522, 545
(1987) (holding that United States Olympic Committee is not
a state actor because "[n]either the conduct nor the coordination of amateur sports has been a traditional governmental
function"); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1011-1012 (1982)
(holding that nursing home is not a state actor in part because provision of nursing home services is not a traditional
and exclusive sovereign function); Edmonson v. Leesville
Concrete Co., supra, at 638-641 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)
(arguing that exercise of peremptory strikes by litigants in
state court is not a government function but a matter of
private choice). Though States often limit ballot access to
persons who are official party nominees or who meet the
requirements for independent candidates, see, e. g., Storer
v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724 (1974), no State to my knowledge
has ever held a convention in order to designate a political
party's nominee for public office. Indeed, it would subvert
the very purpose of democracy if the State possessed sole
control over the identification of candidates for elective office.

I therefore fail to see how the selection of a party's candi-date for United States Senator is a public electoral function.

Cf. ante, at 194-195 (opinion of Stevens, J.).14In asking whether the Party acted under authority of the
State in selecting its nominee at the convention, the Courtemphasizes that Virginia automatically grants ballot access
to the nominees of political parties, as defined by statute.See

ante, at 195-198; ante, at 238 (Breyer, J., concurring injudgment). It does not follow from that fact, however, that

"the Party exercised delegated state power when it certifiedits nominee for automatic placement on Virginia's general
election ballot." Ante, at 195 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Theformulation of rules for deciding which individuals enjoy sufficient public support to warrant placement on the ballot, andthe actual placement of those candidates on the ballot, are
indeed part of the traditional power of the States to manageelections. See

Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433 (1992).But these criteria are established exclusively and definitively

by the State of Virginia--not the Party--in the VirginiaCode. See Va. Code Ann. $$ 24.2-101, 24.2-511 (1993) (providing ballot access for certified nominees of organizations ofVirginia citizens that receive, in either of the last two statewide general elections, at least 10 percent of the total votescast).

Justice Stevens is flatly wrong when he assertsthat political parties in Virginia "are effectively granted the

power to enact their own qualifications for placement of can-didates on the ballot."

Ante, at 197. Also, it is the Com-monwealth of Virginia, not the Party itself, that has eliminated the Party's need to present a petition in support of itscandidate. Cf. ante, at 197-198; Va. Code Ann. $ 24.2-511(D)

required of a candidate once the party chairman has certifiedhis name to the State Board [of Elections]"). The Party has

no control over the qualifications that determine "who mayappear on the ballot." Ante, at 198.

What the Party does determine is something entirely dis-tinct from the rules for ballot access, but which the Court
fails to distinguish: the identity of the person who shall beentitled under state law, as the Party's nominee, to placement on the ballot by the State. In making that determina-tion, the Party sets the "qualifications" necessary for the selection of its candidate. Though the Court conflates thesetwo sets of criteria, the Party's standards for choosing its
candidate are wholly separate from the State's standards forballot access, as set forth in $$ 24.2-101 and 24.2-511 of the
Virginia Code. When the Party picks a candidate accordingto its own partisan criteria, it does not act on behalf of the
State. Whatever the reason the Party chooses its nominee,"it is not the government's reason." Edmonson v. Leesville
Concrete Co., 500 U. S., at 638 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Insum, the selection of a party nominee "forms no part of the
government's responsibility" in regulating an election. Id.,at 639.

To be sure, the Party takes advantage of favorable statelaw when it certifies its candidate for automatic placement
on the ballot. See ante, at 195-197, and n. 13 (opinion of
Stevens, J.); ante, at 238 (Breyer, J., concurring in judg-ment). Nevertheless, according to our state-action cases,

that is no basis for treating the Party as the State. TheState's conferral of benefits upon an entity--even so great a
benefit as monopoly status--is insufficient to convert the en-tity into a state actor. See

Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison,419 U. S., at 351-352.

has created an unfair electoral system by granting partiesautomatic access to the ballot, the proper course of action is

to bring suit against the appropriate state official and chal-lenge the ballot-access statute itself, see,

e. g., Burdick v. Takushi, supra, not to bring a preclearance suit against the
Party and contest the registration fee. If the State sought
to enact or administer a law limiting ballot access to only
one group, as Justice Stevens repeatedly hypothesizes,
see, e. g., ante, at 223, state action would most likely exist,
and that law would be subject to $ 5 and those provisions of
the Constitution that impose restrictions on the States.

As for the point that Virginia allows the Party to choose
its method of nomination, that fact does not warrant a finding
of state action either. We have made it clear that an organization's "exercise of the choice allowed by state law where
the initiative comes from it and not from the State, does not
make its action in doing so `state action.' " Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, supra, at 357. Thus, when the Party exercised the choice afforded it by state law and opted to hold
a convention, that decision did not amount to state action.
The Party did not take the initiative to make that choice in
order to serve the public interest; in reality, the selection of a
nomination method is an intensely political matter, as recent

are, like most corporations, substantially advantaged by various provisions of state law. See, e. g., Va. Code Ann. $$ 13.1-692.1, 13.1-870.1 (1993)
(creating a limitation on liability for corporate officers and directors). I
doubt seriously, however, that even the Members of today's majority
would hold that when a corporation takes the necessary steps to invoke
these statutory benefits, it thereby becomes a state actor; yet this is the
logical result of the suggestion that the Party is a state actor because
Virginia automatically places its nominee on the ballot. Such a conclusion
would run headfirst into our case law, in which we have stated unequivocally that privately owned corporations, absent some symbiotic relationship with the State, are purely private actors. See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison, 419 U. S., at 357-358; Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1011
(1982).

intra-Party disputes over that choice well illustrate.16 Evenif, as might be said here, "[t]he government erects the platform" upon which a private group acts, the government"does not thereby become responsible for all that occurs
upon it." Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., supra, at 632
(O'Connor, J., dissenting).17The basis for today's decision, which subjects a political

party to the requirements of $ 5, can only be state-action doc-trine. But treating the Party as an agent of the State in
this case is not only wrong as a matter of statutory interpre-tation, it also squarely contravenes our state-action precedents. In short, there is no legal justification--statutory,constitutional, or otherwise--for the conclusion that the
Party is an entity governed by $ 5.18

16 See Editorial, Primarily Primaries, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Nov.
28, 1995, p. A-8 (describing contentious debate between supporters of the
incumbent Virginia Senator and those of his Republican challenger over
nomination methods and noting that "[i]t is only human for sides to favor
the means--convention or primary--perceived to give their candidate an
edge").

17 With respect to Congress' power to prohibit discrimination in party

affairs, see ante, at 223-224, it is enough for purposes of this case to note
that it is well established that Congress may not regulate purely private
behavior pursuant to its enforcement power under the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments. See James v. Bowman, 190 U. S. 127, 139 (1903)
("[A] statute which purports to punish purely individual action cannot be
sustained as an appropriate exercise of the power conferred by the Fifteenth Amendment upon Congress to prevent action by the State through
some one or more of its official representatives"); Civil Rights Cases, 109
U. S. 3 (1883).

18 Indeed, Justice Breyer's concurrence is founded on little more

than sheer disbelief that Congress passed a statute that does not go as
far in terms of coverage as he thinks, in light of the history of voting
rights, the statute should. See ante, at 236 ("How is it possible that a
Congress, knowing this obvious history, would have wanted to enact a
`voting rights' law containing a major and obvious loophole . . ."). We are
not free to construe statutes by wondering about what Congress "would
have wanted to enact." There are myriad reasons why measures that "a
Congress"--I assume Justice Breyer means a majority of the Members

Assuming, arguendo, that the Republican Party of Virginia is a "State" within either the ordinary or the constitu-tional sense of the word, the question remains whether the

Party has sought to administer a practice or procedure withrespect to "voting." Based on the statutory definition of
"voting," I conclude that the registration fee is not the typeof election-related change with which the Act concerns itself.

Section 14 of the Act defines voting as "all action necessaryto make a vote effective in any primary, special, or general
election, including, but not limited to . . . casting a ballot,
and having such ballot counted properly and included in
the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect to candidates for public or party office." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(1).
There is no mention of conventions. Because $ 14 specifically enumerates the types of elections covered, but does not

of that institution--might "wan[t] to enact" never become law. We must
look to the extant text of the statute and see what Congress has in fact,
and not in theory, enacted.

In contrast to Justice Breyer's imaginary statute, which covers all
actors that might discriminate in the electoral process, $ 5 is in reality
limited to States and political subdivisions. Thus, the question in this
case is not whether we should "read this Act as excluding all political
party activity . . . [and] ope[n] a loophole in the statute," ante, at 235, but
whether we should read $ 5 to include such activity in the first place. If
there is any "loophole" in $ 5 here, it results from the fact that Congress
simply did not cover political parties in the preclearance provision. Justice Breyer's argument thus boils down to the curious notion that when
Congress passes a statute that covers certain actors, it thereby establishes
a "loophole" for all others. Moreover, while Congress was surely aware
of the history of discrimination in the political process when it passed
the Act, I presume it was also cognizant of the prohibitions of the First
Amendment, see infra, at 282-285, as well as the constraints on its legislative powers under the Fifteenth Amendment, not the least of which is
the state-action requirement. See n. 14, supra. Both of these constitutional limits on Congress' powers are sufficient reason to curb speculation
and to think it "possible" (if the lack of textual evidence were not enough)
that Congress did not intend to cover political parties under $ 5.

Thomas, J., dissenting
include conventions, the most natural (and logical) inference
is that Congress did not intend to include voting at conventions within the definition of "voting."

The omission of conventions from the list of elections covered in $ 14 is especially revealing when compared to and
contrasted with other federal election laws. The Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971 defines "election" to mean
"(A) a general, special, primary, or runoff election; [and] (B)
a convention or caucus of a political party which has authority to nominate a candidate." 86 Stat. 11, as amended, 2
U. S. C. $ 431(1) (emphasis added). Similarly, $ 600 of Title
18 criminalizes the promising of employment in exchange for
political support "in connection with any general or special
election to any political office, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select
candidates for any political office." 18 U. S. C. $ 600 (emphasis added). See also $ 601(b)(2) (defining "election" as, inter
alia, "a convention or caucus of a political party held to nominate a candidate") (emphasis added). Congress obviously
knows how to cover nominating conventions when it wants
to. After all, if there is a field in which Congress has expertise, it is elections.

Justice Stevens maintains that the fee relates to "voting" because, even though it was not imposed at one of the
three types of elections listed in $ 14, it diminished the effectiveness of appellants' votes at the general election. See
ante, at 205-206. As I explained in Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S.
874 (1994), my view is that "as far as the Act is concerned,
an `effective' vote is merely one that has been cast and fairly
counted." Id., at 919 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).
Appellants do not contend that they were unable to submit
a ballot in the general election or that their votes in that
election were not properly registered and counted. I thus
would not strain to hold, as do Justices Stevens and
Breyer, that appellants' votes at the general election lacked

effect simply because their personal favorite for the Republi-can nomination was not on the ballot as the Party candidate.

Justice Stevens also reasons that party primaries andconventions are functionally indistinguishable. See

ante, at
205-207, 214-215. Similarly, Justice Breyer maintains
that the convention in this case "resembles a primary aboutas closely as one could imagine."

Ante, at 238. These assertions may or may not be true as a matter of practicaljudgment (or imagination). One crucial difference between

primaries and conventions is that in the context of the for-mer, the party often avails itself of a system erected, funded,
and managed by the State, whereas in the latter, it generally
does not. Consequently, charging the State with responsibility for voting changes that occur in a primary, where there
may be actual state involvement, makes more sense than
holding the State accountable for changes implemented at
a party convention. Though Justice Breyer lists several
reasons why the Party's convention was like a primary,
see ibid., he fails to mention the critical factor of state
involvement.

In any event, the question whether conventions ought to
be governed by the Act is, at bottom, a matter of policy.
And, as far as I can discern from the face of $ 14, Congress
made no policy determination in favor of regulating conventions under the Act. Though one might think it more sensible to include conventions in $ 14, "[t]he short answer is that
Congress did not write the statute that way." United States
v. Naftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 773 (1979). When we examine the
legislative lines that Congress has drawn, we generally do
not hold Congress to exceedingly rigorous standards of logic.
See, e. g., FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307,
314 (1993) (reviewing statute for rational basis under Equal
Protection Clause and noting that " `judicial intervention is
generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may
think a political branch has acted' ") (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93, 97 (1979)); International Primate Protec517us1$38N 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT

distinction based on a "mere technicality" because "Congresscould rationally have made such a distinction").

Justice Stevens is right that "we have held that $ 5 applies to cases like Whitley v. Williams, which involve candi-dacy requirements and qualifications."

Presley v. Etowah
County Comm'n, 502 U. S., at 502; see ante, at 206-207.However, those cases all involved qualifications for candidates running in either primary or general elections that areclearly within the scope of $ 14. See 502 U. S., at 502. ("In
Whitley v. Williams, there were changes in the requirements for independent candidates running in general elections"). See also NAACP v. Hampton County Election
Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166 (1985) (change in filing deadline to run
for school board in general election); Hadnott v. Amos, 394
U. S. 358 (1969) (change in filing deadline for general election); Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32
(1978) (rule requiring school board members to take unpaid
leave of absence while campaigning for office, where plaintiff
ran in primary and general election). The cases holding
that changes in the composition of the electorate are covered
by $ 5 likewise involve general elections. See Allen v. State
Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S., at 550, 569 (change from district
to at-large, general election). Thus, we had no occasion in
any of these cases to question whether activity that occurs
at a nominating convention, as opposed to a primary, special,
or general election, falls under the Act's definition of "voting." Rather, the issue in these cases was whether the contested change had a sufficiently "direct relation to, or impact
on, voting," Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, supra, at
506, so as to constitute a "practice or procedure with respect
to voting" subject to preclearance under $ 5. See, e. g.,
Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, supra, at 569 (holding that
"the enactment in each of these cases constitutes a `voting
qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,

or procedure with respect to voting' within the meaning of$ 5"). Regardless of whether Congress has ever "endorsed

these broad constructions of $ 5," ante, at 205, they have nobearing on the meaning of $ 14.

Nor does the reference to the election of party officials
bring the convention within the ambit of $ 14, as Justice
Stevens and Justice Breyer argue. See ante, at 207-
208; ante, at 236-237. Section 14 does refer to "votes castwith respect to candidates for public or party office." 42

U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(1) (1988 ed.). But Justices Stevens and
Breyer amputate that phrase from the rest of the sentence,
which provides that casting a vote at a "primary, special, or
general election" for "candidates for . . . party office" constitutes "voting" for purposes of the Act. See ibid. (voting is
"all action necessary to make a vote effective in any primary,
special, or general election, including, but not limited to . . .
casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted properly and
included in the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect
to candidates for public or party office"). Under $ 14, then,
voting does extend to casting a ballot for a party officer, but
only when that ballot is cast at a primary, special, or general
election. Since this is obvious on the face of the statute, I
see no need to resort to the legislative history of the Bingham Amendment. Cf. ante, at 208-209 (opinion of Stevens,
J.); ante, at 236-237 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).
Though Representative Bingham may have had every intention of covering the activities of political parties under $ 5,
there is no evidence that he succeeded in transforming that
intention into law.

Finally, as Justice Stevens notes, $$ 2 and 5 would appear to be designed to work in tandem. See ante, at 209-
210. Nonetheless, there is a patent discrepancy between the
broad sweep of $ 2, which refers to "the political processes
leading to nomination or election," and the undeniably narrower definition of voting set forth in $ 14, which is limited
to the context of a "primary, special, or general election."

282 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Thomas, J., dissenting
The incongruity appears to be a result of Congress' 1982amendment of $ 2 to expand its reach to pre-election political

processes, see Pub. L. 97-205, $ 3, 96 Stat. 134, without mak-ing any concomitant amendments to either $ 5 or $ 14. As
long as $ 5 contains the term "voting," and $ 14 in turn de-fines that word, I think we must adhere to the specific definition provided in $ 14. We cannot decline to apply thatdefinition according to its terms simply because we think it
would be preferable to harmonize $$ 2 and 5. If the 1982amendment produced an undesirable inconsistency between

$$ 2 and 5, Congress is free to harmonize them.19

C
Were I otherwise willing to disregard the plain meaningof $$ 5 and 14, there is another factor counseling strongly

against the Court's interpretation of the Act. Holding thatthe Party's convention fee must be precleared by the Government poses serious constitutional problems. Our stand19 Legislative history is insufficient to bridge this gap in coverage that
is apparent on the face of the statutes, as Justice Stevens would have
it. See ante, at 210, n. 25. In any case, the legislative history cited by
Justice Stevens is wholly nonresponsive to the issue of which types of
entities must submit their rules for preclearance under $ 5. That is, the
legislative history discusses certain kinds of changes that must be precleared, without suggesting that the entities that must comply with the
preclearance requirement are anything other than States and political subdivisions. The part of the Senate Report cited by Justice Stevens addresses the need to preclear statewide redistricting plans. Reapportionment plans, of course, are usually enacted by state or local legislative
bodies. See, e. g., Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130 (1976) (reapportionment plan adopted by city council). The passage in the House Report
states that a voting practice that is outside the scope of the preclearance
provision (either because it was in existence before 1965 or is implemented
in a noncovered jurisdiction) may nonetheless be challenged in a lawsuit
under $ 2; hence the distinction between preclearance and litigation. The
Report thus supports precisely the opposite proposition for which Justice
Stevens cites it: It expressly states that not every action that can be
brought under $ 2 falls within the scope of $ 5.

ard practice is to avoid constructions of a statute that createsuch difficulties. See

Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida
Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.568, 575 (1988). "This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly
confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like thisCourt, is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not lightly assume thatCongress intended to infringe constitutionally protected
liberties." Ibid.Among the constitutional questions raised by this decision
are ones relating to freedom of political association. "The
First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 15 (1976).
Political parties, and their supporters, enjoy this constitutional right of political affiliation. Cousins v. Wigoda, 419
U. S. 477, 487 (1975). "[A]t the very heart of the freedom of
assembly and association," is "[t]he right of members of a
political party to gather in a . . . political convention in order
to formulate proposed programs and nominate candidates for
political office." Id., at 491 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in
result). A convention to nominate a party candidate is perhaps the classic forum for individual expression of political
views and for association with like-minded persons for the
purpose of advancing those views.

We need not look beyond this case to "hypothetical," ante,
at 228, controversies in order to identify substantial First
Amendment concerns. As applied today, $ 5 burdens the
rights of the Party and its members to freedom of political
association. The Party has represented in this Court that
it decided to charge each delegate a registration fee rather
than to fund the convention with contributions from a few
major donors in order to avoid undue influence from a small
group of contributors. See Brief for Appellees 45-46.
Under our precedents, the Party's choice of how to fund its
statewide convention seems to be a constitutionally pro517us1$38N 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT

tected one. "The Party's determination of the boundariesof its own association, and of the structure which best allows

it to pursue its political goals, is protected by the Constitu-tion."

Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S.
208, 224 (1986). See also Democratic Party of United States
v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 124 (1981) ("Apolitical party's choice among the various ways of determining the makeup of a State's delegation to the party's nationalconvention is protected by the Constitution"). As the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explained,"a party's choice, as among various ways of governing itself,
of the one which seems best calculated to strengthen the
party and advance its interests, deserves the protection of
the Constitution . . . . [T]here must be a right not only to
form political associations but to organize and direct them in
the way that will make them most effective." Ripon Society, Inc. v. National Republican Party, 525 F. 2d 567, 585
(1975) (en banc), cert. denied, 424 U. S. 933 (1976) (emphasis
deleted). By requiring the Party to seek approval from the
Federal Government before it may implement rules regarding the funding of nominating conventions, the Court has
burdened the Party's ability to institute the constitutionally
protected choice embodied in those rules.

Moreover, if the Attorney General or a federal court were
to refuse to preclear the registration fee, the Government
would in effect be requiring the Party to include persons
who could not, or would not, pay the registration fee for its
convention. But, as we have held, "the freedom to associate
for the `common advancement of political beliefs,' necessarily
presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the association, and to limit the association to those people only." Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin,
supra, at 122 (citation omitted). See also Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 224
(1989). Section 5, under the Court's novel construction, impinges upon that interest. Furthermore, the Court creates

a classic prior restraint on political expression, as Justice
Scalia cogently explains. See ante, at 243-246.

Legislative burdens on associational rights are subject toscrutiny under the First Amendment. See

Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S., at 433-434 (level of scrutiny depends upon
severity of the infringement); cf. Eu, supra, at 225; Cousins,
supra, at 489. Severe interference with protected rights of
political association "may [only] be sustained if the [govern-ment] demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgmentof associational freedoms."

Buckley, supra, at 25. Though
Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer glibly dismiss this
constitutional inquiry, see ante, at 228-229; ante, at 239
("[s]uch questions, we are satisfied, are not so difficult"), it is
not equally obvious to me that $ 5, as interpreted today,
would survive a First Amendment challenge.

Justice Stevens is correct that, under the White Primary Cases, First Amendment rights of political association
cede to the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment in certain circumstances. Ante, at 228. The Court has held that
when state-approved exclusion from a political group is tantamount to exclusion from the actual election, that exclusion
violates the Fifteenth Amendment. See Terry v. Adams,
345 U. S., at 469-470. However, where a person is refused
membership in a political organization without any involvement on the part of the State, and membership in the group
is not a precondition to participation in the ultimate choice
of representatives, there can logically be no state denial of
the right to vote. In such a situation, there is no conflict
between the First and Fifteenth Amendments.

Exclusion of political parties from the coverage of $ 5 obviates the foregoing First Amendment problems. Cf. Miller
v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 926-927 (1995) (rejecting possible
reading of $ 5 because it raised constitutional problems). By
letting stand a construction of $ 5 that encompasses political
parties, however, the Court begets these weighty First

Amendment issues. Ironically, the Court generates thesedifficulties by contorting, rather than giving the most natural

meaning to, the text of $ 5. II

I also disagree with the Court that $ 10 of the VotingRights Act contains an implicit cause of action for private
suits against States and localities that impose poll taxes uponvoters. Section 10 states:

"[T]he Attorney General is authorized and directed toinstitute forthwith in the name of the United States such
actions, including actions against States or political sub-divisions, for declaratory judgment or injunctive relief
against the enforcement of any requirement of the pay-ment of a poll tax as a precondition to voting, or substitute therefor enacted after November 1, 1964, as will benecessary to implement the declaration of subsection (a)
of this section and the purposes of this section." 42U. S. C. $ 1973h(b).

By its very terms, $ 10 authorizes a single person to suefor relief from poll taxes: the Attorney General. The inescapable inference from this express grant of litigating au-thority to the Attorney General is that no other person may
bring an action under $ 10. Though Justice Stevens con-tends that implication of a private cause of action is crucial
to the enforcement of voting rights, ante, at 231, $ 10 itselfindicates otherwise. Suits instituted by the Attorney General were evidently all that Congress thought "necessary toimplement . . . the purposes of this section." Ibid. Section
10 explicitly entrusts to the Attorney General, and to theAttorney General alone, the duty to seek relief from poll
taxes under the Act.Although

Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544(1969), held that $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act contains a private right of action, Allen does not require the same resultunder $ 10. Section 5 affirmatively proclaims that " `no per517us1$38N 02-23-99 16:40:26 PAGES OPINPGT

Ibid. A private cause of action was thought neces-sary to effectuate "[t]he guarantee of $ 5 that no person shall

be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with anunapproved new enactment subject to $ 5." Id., at 557.

20

See also Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 690(1979) ("[I]t was statutory language describing the special

class to be benefited by $ 5 . . . that persuaded the Court thatprivate parties within that class were implicitly authorized
to seek a declaratory judgment against a covered State").Unlike $ 5, $ 10 creates no statutory privilege in any particular class of persons to be free of poll taxes. The only possi-ble "guarantee" created by $ 10 is that the Attorney General
will challenge the enforcement of poll taxes on behalf ofthose voters who reside in poll tax jurisdictions. What $ 10
does not do, however, is actually prohibit a State or po-litical subdivision from administering poll taxes. Nor does
it declare that no person shall be required to pay a polltax. Rather, $ 10 merely provides, as a "declaration of
policy" prefacing the authorization for civil suits, that "theconstitutional right of citizens to vote is denied or abridged
in some areas by the requirement of the payment of a polltax as a precondition to voting." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973h(a). It
further provides that when a jurisdiction administers a polltax, the Attorney General may prevent its enforcement by
bringing suit in accordance with certain procedural require-ments, including a three-judge district court and direct appeal to this Court. See $ 1973h(c). Section 10 creates noban on the imposition of poll taxes, whereas $ 5,

Allen said,

guaranteed that no person would be subject to unapprovedvoting changes. Thus, $ 10 confers no rights upon individuals and its remedial scheme is limited to suits by the Attor-ney General. Cf. ante, at 232 (opinion of

Stevens, J.).I am unpersuaded by the maxim that Congress is presumed to legislate against the backdrop of our "implied causeof action" jurisprudence. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 698-699; ante, at 230-231. That maxim isrelevant to but one of the three factors that were established
for determining the existence of private rights of action in
Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975), and that were applied in
Cannon. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at
699 (considering "contemporary legal context" of statute toassess the third

Cort factor, whether the legislative history
reveals an intent to create a cause of action). Though wemay thus look to this presumption for guidance in evaluating

the history of a statute's enactment, "what must ultimatelybe determined is whether Congress intended to create the
private remedy asserted." Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15-16 (1979). See also
Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 575 (1979).
We do this by "begin[ning] with the language of the statuteitself."

Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis,
supra, at 16. In my view, $ 10--which authorizes only theAttorney General to sue for relief and creates no enforceable

right in any person to be free from poll taxes--precludes theinference that Congress intended the availability of implied
causes of action under that section.21Finally, the 1975 amendments to the Voting Rights Act do
not justify the judicial creation of a private cause of action

21 Nor do I think that we should imply a cause of action under $ 10 simply
because we have heard and decided challenges by private plaintiffs under

$ 2. See ante, at 232 (opinion of Stevens, J.); ante, at 240 (Breyer, J.,
concurring in judgment). We ought not base our decision in this case on
the fact that we have inadvertently, and perhaps incorrectly, allowed private suits to proceed under other sections of the Act.

under $ 10. See ante, at 233-234 (opinion of Stevens, J.).
Section 3 is a generalized section of the Act, providing
three-judge district courts with special authority in adjudicating Voting Rights Act claims. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973a.
As appellants accurately state, $ 3 "explicitly recognizes that
private individuals can sue under the [Act]." Brief for Appellants 41. Section 3 does not, however, identify any of the
provisions under which private plaintiffs may sue. The
most logical deduction from the inclusion of "aggrieved person" in $ 1973a is that Congress meant to address those cases
brought pursuant to the private right of action that this
Court had recognized as of 1975, i. e., suits under $ 5, as well
as any rights of action that we might recognize in the future.
Section 14(e), which provides for attorney's fees to "the prevailing party, other than the United States," is likewise a
general reference to private rights of action. Like $ 3,

$ 14(e) fails to address the availability of a private right to
sue under $ 10. $ 1973l(e).22

At bottom, appellants complain that unless a private cause
of action exists under $ 10, private plaintiffs will be forced
to challenge poll taxes by bringing constitutional claims in
single-judge district courts. This, they contend, "is directly
contrary to the special procedures for adjudicating poll tax
claims established by Congress in section 10." Brief for Appellants 38. It is appellants' claim, however, that flatly contravenes $ 10. The only "special procedure" for litigating
poll tax challenges that Congress created in $ 10 is an action
by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States.

22 It does not follow from Congress' technical amendment of $ 10 in 1975,
which Justice Breyer takes as an indication that "$ 10 remained an important civil rights provision," ante, at 240, that we should imply a cause
of action thereunder. A statute outlawing a class of voting practices and
authorizing the Attorney General of the United States to sue jurisdictions
that engage in such practices is surely an "important" provision, even if
not privately enforceable.

290 MORSE v. REPUBLICAN PARTY OF VA.

Thomas, J., dissenting

* * *
To conclude, I would decide this controversy on the ground
that the Republican Party of Virginia is not a "State or political subdivision" for purposes of $ 5. This is true whether
one invokes the ordinary meaning of the term "State" or
even, as the Court erroneously does, the state-action theory
of our constitutional precedents. Even if the Party were a
"State" or a state actor, the registration fee does not relate
to "voting," as defined by $ 14. Because the argument for
the applicability of $ 5 in this case fails at each step, I would
not require the Party to preclear its convention registration
fee under $ 5. Nor would I imply a private right of action
under $ 10.

Today, the Court cuts $ 5 loose from its explicit textual
moorings regarding both the types of entities and the kinds
of changes that it governs. Justice Breyer, writing for
three Members of the Court, does so without attempting to
define the limits of $ 5's applicability to political parties and
their practices. See ante, at 238 ("We need not . . . determin[e] when party activities are, in effect, substitutes for
state nominating primaries"); ibid. ("Nor need we go further
to decide just which party nominating convention practices
fall within the scope of the Act"). Indeed, Justice Breyer
expends much ink evading inevitable questions about the
Court's decision. See ante, at 239 ("We go no further in this
case because, as the dissents indicate, First Amendment
questions about the extent to which the Federal Government, through preclearance procedures, can regulate the
workings of a political party convention, are difficult ones, as
are those about the limits imposed by the state-action cases")
(citations omitted). This is not reassuring, and it will not
do. Eventually, the Court will be forced to come to grips
with the untenable and constitutionally flawed interpretation
of $ 5 that it has wrought in this case. That encounter,

which could easily have been averted today, will involve yetanother Voting Rights Act conundrum of our own making.

23

When leveled against wholly private partisan organiza-tions with respect to their internal affairs, $ 5's potential for

use as an instrument of political harassment should be ob-vious to all. I have no doubt that $ 5 was never intended
for such purposes. Rather, that section was aimed atpreventing covered States from intentionally and systematically evading the guarantees of the Voting Rights Act bysimply recasting their election laws. This suit, along with
the ones certain to follow, trivializes that goal. I respect-fully dissent.

23 Apart from the preclearance issues that the Court leaves unresolved,
today's judgment raises additional questions under the Voting Rights Act,
since the phrase "State or political subdivision" is used in several other
key provisions. For instance, may political parties bring a declaratory
judgment action under $ 5 as an alternative to preclearance? See 42
U. S. C. $ 1973c. May political parties bring a "bailout suit" for exclusion
from the category of covered jurisdictions? See $ 1973b(a). Are political
parties subject to suit under $ 2? See $ 1973(a). Can a three-judge district court authorize the appointment of federal examiners to monitor a
political party's activities during the pendency of, and as part of a final
judgment in, a voting rights suit? See $ 1973a(a). Quite apparently, the
Court has not stopped to consider the ramifications of its decision.

Syllabus

RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 94-8769. Argued November 27, 1995--Decided March 27, 1996
A jury found petitioner guilty of one count of participating in a conspiracy

to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846 and
one count of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) "in concert" with others in violation of $ 848. The "in concert" element of his
CCE offense was based on the same agreement as the $ 846 conspiracy.
The District Court entered judgment of conviction on both counts and
imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without possible release on
each, the sentences to be served concurrently. Pursuant to 18 U. S. C.

$ 3013, it also ordered petitioner to pay a special assessment of $50 on
each count. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on Jeffers v. United
States, 432 U. S. 137, to reject petitioner's contention that his convictions and concurrent life sentences impermissibly punished him twice
for the same offense.

Held: The District Court erred in sentencing petitioner to concurrent life

sentences on the $ 846 and $ 848 counts. Pp. 297-307.

(a) It is presumed that a legislature does not intend to impose two
punishments where two statutory provisions proscribe the "same offense." The test for determining whether there are two offenses is
whether each of the statutory provisions requires proof of a fact which
the other does not. Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304.
This Court has often concluded that two statutes define the "same offense" where one is a lesser included offense of the other. For the reasons set forth in Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 149-150 (plurality opinion); id., at
158, 159, n. 5 (dissenting opinion), and particularly because the plain
meaning of $ 848's "in concert" phrase signifies mutual agreement in a
common plan or enterprise, the Court now resolves definitively that a
guilty verdict on a $ 848 charge necessarily includes a finding that the
defendant also participated in a conspiracy violative of $ 846. Conspiracy is therefore a lesser included offense of CCE. Pp. 297-300.

(b) The Court rejects the Government's contention that the presumption against multiple punishments does not invalidate either of petitioner's convictions because the sentence on the second one was concurrent.
That conviction amounts to a second punishment because a $50 special
assessment was imposed on it. Cf. Ray v. United States, 481 U. S. 736
(1987) (per curiam). Even if the assessment were ignored, the force of

Syllabus
the Government's argument would be limited by Ball v. United States,
470 U. S. 856, 861-865, in which the Court concluded that Congress did
not intend to allow punishment for both illegally "receiving" and illegally "possessing" a firearm; held that the only remedy consistent with
the congressional intent was to vacate one of the underlying convictions
as well as the concurrent sentence based upon it; and explained that the
second conviction does not evaporate simply because of its sentence's
concurrence, since it has potential adverse collateral consequences--
e. g., delay of parole eligibility or an increased sentence under a recidivist statute for a future offense--that make it presumptively impermissible to impose. Although petitioner did not challenge the $50 assessment below, the fact that $ 3013 required its imposition renders it as
much a collateral consequence of the conspiracy conviction as the consequences recognized by Ball. Pp. 301-303.

(c) Also rejected is the Government's argument that the presumption
against multiple punishments is overcome here because Congress has
clearly indicated its intent to allow courts to impose them. Support for
that view cannot be inferred from the fact that this Court's Jeffers judgment allowed convictions under both $$ 846 and 848 to stand, since those
convictions were entered in separate trials, the Court's review addressed only the $ 848 conviction, and that conviction was affirmed because the four-Justice plurality decided that Jeffers had waived any
right to object, see 432 U. S., at 152-154, and because Justice White
took the hereinbefore-rejected position that conspiracy was not a lesser
included offense of CCE, see id., at 158 (opinion concurring in judgment
in part and dissenting in part). As to this issue, then, the judgment is
not entitled to precedential weight because it amounts at best to an
unexplained affirmance by an equally divided court. Pp. 303-304.

(d) The Government's argument that Congress intended to allow multiple convictions here to provide a "backup" conviction, preventing a
defendant who later successfully challenges his greater offense from escaping punishment altogether, is unpersuasive. There is no reason why
this particular pair of greater and lesser offenses should present any
novel problem not already addressed by the federal appellate courts,
which have uniformly concluded--with this Court's approval, see, e. g.,
Morris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237, 246-247--that they may direct the
entry of judgment for a lesser included offense when a conviction for a
greater offense is reversed on grounds affecting only the greater offense. Pp. 305-307.

(e) Because the Court here adheres to the presumption that Congress
intended to authorize only one punishment, one of petitioner's convictions, as well as its concurrent sentence, is unauthorized punishment

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Days, ActingAssistant Attorney General Keeney, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and Richard A. Friedman.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
A jury found petitioner guilty of participating in a conspir-acy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 84 Stat.

1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 846, and of conducting a con-tinuing criminal enterprise (CCE) in violation of $ 848. The
"in concert" element of his CCE offense was based on thesame agreement as the $ 846 conspiracy. The question presented is whether it was therefore improper for the DistrictCourt to sentence him to concurrent life sentences on the
two counts. I

Petitioner organized and supervised a criminal enterprisethat distributed cocaine in Warren County, Illinois, from 1988
until December 1990, when he was arrested by federalagents. He was charged with several offenses, of which only
Count One, the CCE charge, and Count Two, the conspiracycharge, are relevant to the issue before us.

Count One alleged that during the period between early1988 and late 1990, petitioner violated $ 848

Opinion of the Court
a CCE that consisted of a series of unlawful acts involvingthe distribution of cocaine.

2 The count alleged that these

actions were undertaken "in concert with at least five (5)other persons," that petitioner supervised those other persons, and that he obtained substantial income from the con-tinuing series of violations. App. 2-3.

Count Two separately alleged that during the same period,petitioner violated 21 U. S. C. $ 846

3 by conspiring with four

codefendants and others to engage in the unlawful distribu-tion of cocaine. The count alleged that each of the conspirators had furthered the conspiracy by performing an overt actinvolving the delivery, purchase, or distribution of cocaine.
App. 3-5.After a 9-day trial, a jury found petitioner guilty on all
counts. The trial court entered judgment of conviction onboth Count One and Count Two and imposed a sentence of
life imprisonment without possible release on each count, thesentences to be served concurrently. Id., at 8-10. Pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3013, petitioner was also ordered to paya special assessment of $50 on each count.

"(1) he violates any provision of this subchapter or subchapter II of this
chapter the punishment for which is a felony, and

"(2) such violation is a part of a continuing series of violations of this

violation of $ 841(a) and the same conspiracy in violation of $ 846 that was
charged in Count Two.

296 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
On appeal, petitioner contended in a pro se supplemental
brief that even though the life sentences were concurrent,
entering both convictions and sentences impermissibly punished him twice for the same offense. The Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit accepted the premise of his argument, namely, that the conspiracy charge was a lesser included offense of the CCE charge. 40 F. 3d 879, 886 (1994).
The Court of Appeals nonetheless affirmed his convictions
and sentences. Relying on its earlier decision in United
States v. Bond, 847 F. 2d 1233, 1238 (1988), and our decision
in Jeffers v. United States, 432 U. S. 137 (1977), it held that
convictions and concurrent sentences may be imposed for
conspiracy and CCE, "provided the cumulative punishment
does not exceed the maximum under the CCE act." 40
F. 3d, at 886.

The decision of the Seventh Circuit is at odds with the
practice of other Circuits. Most federal courts that have
confronted the question hold that only one judgment should
be entered when a defendant is found guilty on both a CCE
count and a conspiracy count based on the same agreements.4
The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an intermediate
position, allowing judgment to be entered on both counts but
permitting only one sentence rather than the concurrent sen4 See, e. g., United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F. 2d 148, 153 (CA1),

Courts may not "prescrib[e] greater punishment than thelegislature intended." Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359,

366 (1983); Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). In ac-cord with principles rooted in common law and constitutional
jurisprudence, see Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 168-170(1874), we presume that "where two statutory provisions
proscribe the `same offense,' " a legislature does not intend toimpose two punishments for that offense.

Whalen v. UnitedStates, 445 U. S. 684, 691-692 (1980); Ball v. United States,

470 U. S. 856, 861 (1985).For over half a century we have determined whether a
defendant has been punished twice for the "same offense" byapplying the rule set forth in

Blockburger v. United States,284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932). If "the same act or transaction

constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are two
offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proofof a fact which the other does not."

Ibid. In subsequentapplications of the test, we have often concluded that two

different statutes define the "same offense," typically be-cause one is a lesser included offense of the other.

Opinion of the Court
In this case it is perfectly clear that the CCE offense re-quires proof of a number of elements that need not be established in a conspiracy case.7 The Blockburger test requiresus to consider whether the converse is also true--whether
the $ 846 conspiracy offense requires proof of any element
that is not a part of the CCE offense. That question couldbe answered affirmatively only by assuming that while the

$ 846 conspiracy requires proof of an actual agreementamong the parties, the "in concert" element of the CCE offense might be satisfied by something less.The Government advanced this precise argument in

Jeffers v. United States, 432 U. S. 137 (1977),8 but it managed topersuade only one Justice.

Id., at 158 (White, J., concurring). The position was rejected, to varying degrees, by the

v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), to confirm state-court conclusion
that offense of "joyriding" was a lesser included offense of auto theft).

7 The defendant must, for example, commit a series of substantive violations, be a leader of the criminal enterprise, and derive substantial income
from it. The Government need not prove any of those elements to establish a conspiracy in violation of $ 846. Even the "in concert" element of
the CCE offense is broader than any requirement in $ 846 because it requires at least five participants, while a conspiracy requires only two.

8 In Jeffers, we considered whether the Government could prosecute the

defendant under $ 848 even though he had previously been convicted of

$ 846 conspiracy on the basis of the same agreements. The Government
argued that the multiple prosecution was permissible because the crimes
were not the "same offense." "The Government's position is premised on
its contention that agreement is not an essential element of the $ 848 offense, despite the presence in $ 848(b)(2)(A) of the phrase `in concert with.'
If five `innocent dupes' each separately acted `in concert with' the ringleader of the continuing criminal enterprise, the Government asserts, the
statutory requirement would be satisfied. Brief for United States 23."
432 U. S., at 147. The Government relied on Iannelli v. United States,
420 U. S. 770 (1975), in which we construed 18 U. S. C. $ 1955 as not requiring proof of conspiracy. As Justice Blackmun pointed out, however, the
language of $ 1955 was significantly different from $ 848 in that it omitted
the words "in concert" and left open "the possibility that the five persons
`involved' in the gambling operation might not be acting together." 432

other eight. The four dissenters adopted, without comment,the proposition that conspiracy was a lesser included offense

of CCE. See id., at 158, 159, n. 5. The remaining Justicesjoined Justice Blackmun's plurality opinion which, while declining to hold that conspiracy was a lesser included offense,9nonetheless explained why the Government's argument was
inconsistent with the statute's text, with the way the words"in concert" have been used in other statutes, and with the
legislative history of this statute.10 Based on its under-standing of the "more likely" interpretation of $ 848, the plurality assumed, arguendo, "that $ 848 does require proof of

9 The plurality did not need to hold that conspiracy was a lesser included
offense because it found that even if it was, the petitioner waived whatever
right he may have had to object to the second prosecution under $ 848
when he opposed the Government's motion, brought before the first trial,
to consolidate the proceedings. Id., at 149-150, 153-154.

10 The language of $ 848 "restricts the definition of the crime to a continuing series of violations undertaken by the accused `in concert with five
or more other persons.' " Id., at 148. As a result, "a conviction [under

$ 848] would be impossible unless concerted activity were present. . . .
Even if $ 848 were read to require individual agreements between the
leader . . . and each of the other five necessary participants, enough would
be shown to prove a conspiracy." Ibid.

Furthermore, "[w]hen the phrase `in concert' has been used in other
statutes, it has generally connoted cooperative action and agreement. . . .
This suggests that Congress intended the same words to have the same
meaning in $ 848. . . . Since the word `concert' commonly signifies agreement of two or more persons in a common plan or enterprise, a clearly
articulated statement from Congress to the contrary would be necessary
before that meaning should be abandoned." Id., at 149, n. 14 (citations
omitted); see 3 Oxford English Dictionary 658 (2d ed. 1989) (defining "concert" as "[a]greement of two or more persons or parties in a plan, design,
or enterprise; union formed by such mutual agreement"; "esp[ecially] in
phrase in concert"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 470
(1981) (defining "concert" as "agreement in a design or plan: union formed
by mutual communication of opinions and views: accordance in a scheme").
Thus, "[i]n the absence of any indication from the legislative history or
elsewhere to the contrary, the far more likely explanation is that Congress
intended the word `concert' to have its common meaning of agreement in
a design or plan." Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 148-149.

300 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
an agreement among the persons involved in the continuingcriminal enterprise. So construed, $ 846 is a lesser included

offense of $ 848, because $ 848 requires proof of every factnecessary to show a violation under $ 846 as well as proof of
several additional elements." Id., at 149-150.

In the years since Jeffers was decided, the Courts of Ap-peals have also consistently rejected the Government's interpretation of the "in concert" language of $ 848; they haveconcluded, without exception, that conspiracy is a lesser included offense of CCE.11 We think it is appropriate now toresolve the point definitively: For the reasons set forth in
Jeffers, and particularly because the plain meaning of thephrase "in concert" signifies mutual agreement in a common
plan or enterprise, we hold that this element of the CCEoffense requires proof of a conspiracy that would also violate

$ 846. Because $ 846 does not require proof of any fact that
is not also a part of the CCE offense, a straightforward appli-cation of the

Blockburger test leads to the conclusion that
conspiracy as defined in $ 846 does not define a different of-fense from the CCE offense defined in $ 848. Furthermore,

since the latter offense is the more serious of the two, andbecause only one of its elements is necessary to prove a $ 846
conspiracy, it is appropriate to characterize $ 846 as a lesserincluded offense of $ 848.

of importing marijuana. Ibid. That holding, however, merely adhered
to our understanding that legislatures have traditionally perceived a quali517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT

III
The Government contends that even if conspiracy is alesser included offense of CCE, the resulting presumption

against multiple punishments does not invalidate either ofpetitioner's convictions. The second conviction, the Government first argues, may not amount to a punishment at all.We begin by noting that 18 U. S. C. $ 3013 requires a federal district court to impose a $50 special assessment forevery conviction, and that such an assessment was imposed
on both convictions in this case. As long as $ 3013 stands, asecond conviction will amount to a second punishment. Cf.
Ray v. United States, 481 U. S. 736, 737 (1987) (per curiam)(presence of $50 assessment precludes application of "concurrent sentence doctrine"). The Government urges us not torely on the assessment, however, pointing out that petitioner
did not challenge it below, and noting that the question pre-sented "presupposes" fully concurrent sentences. Brief for
United States 7, n. 1.If we ignore the assessment as the Government requests,
the force of its argument would nonetheless be limited byour decision in

Ball v. United States, 470 U. S. 856 (1985).There, we concluded that Congress did not intend to allow

punishment for both illegally "receiving" and illegally "pos-sessing" a firearm.

Id., at 861-864. In light of that conclu-sion, we held that "the only remedy consistent with the contative difference between conspiracy-like crimes and the substantive offenses upon which they are predicated. See, e. g., United States v. Felix,
503 U. S. 378, 389-390 (1992) (allowing prosecution for conspiracy after
petitioner was convicted of underlying substantive offense, and citing Garrett as a similar case). No such difference is present here. In contrast
to the crimes involved in Garrett, this case involves two conspiracy-like
offenses directed at largely identical conduct. Jeffers v. United States,
432 U. S., at 157; Garrett, 471 U. S., at 794 ("[T]he plurality [in Jeffers]
reasonably concluded that the dangers posed by a conspiracy and a CCE
were similar and thus there would be little purpose in cumulating the
penalties").

517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT
302 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
gressional intent is for the District Court . . . to exercise itsdiscretion to vacate one of the underlying convictions" as

well as the concurrent sentence based upon it. Id., at 864.We explained further:

"The second conviction, whose concomitant sentenceis served concurrently, does not evaporate simply because of the concurrence of the sentence. The separate
conviction, apart from the concurrent sentence, has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not beignored. For example, the presence of two convictions

on the record may delay the defendant's eligibility for
parole or result in an increased sentence under a recidi-vist statute for a future offense. Moreover, the second

conviction may be used to impeach the defendant's credi-bility and certainly carries the societal stigma accompanying any criminal conviction. See Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791 (1969); Sibron v. New York,
392 U. S. 40, 54-56 (1968). Thus, the second conviction,
even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment." Id., at 864-865.

Under Ball, the collateral consequences of a second conviction make it as presumptively impermissible to impose as
it would be to impose any other unauthorized cumulative
sentence.

The Government suggests, however, that petitioner will
never be exposed to collateral consequences like those described in Ball because he is subject to multiple life sentences without possibility of release. We need not conclusively resolve the matter, for there is no doubt that the
second conviction carried with it, at very least, a $50 assessment. Although petitioner did not challenge the assessment
below, 18 U. S. C. $ 3013 required the District Court to impose it, and the assessment was therefore as much a collateral consequence of the conspiracy conviction as the con517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT

303Cite as: 517 U. S. 292 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
sequences recognized by Ball would be. As a result, theconviction amounts to cumulative punishment not authorized

by Congress. IV

The Government further argues that even if the secondconviction amounts to punishment, the presumption against
allowing multiple punishments for the same crime may beovercome if Congress clearly indicates that it intended to
allow courts to impose them. Hunter, 459 U. S., at 366 (cit-ing

Whalen, 445 U. S., at 691-692); Garrett v. United States,471 U. S. 773, 779 (1985) (allowing multiple punishment in

light of Congress' "plainly expressed" view). The Govern-ment submits that such clear intent can be found here.

The Government finds support for its position in thisCourt's judgment in Jeffers because that judgment allowed
convictions under both $$ 846 and 848 to stand. Those con-victions, however, had been entered in separate trials and
our review only addressed the conviction under $ 848. TheCourt affirmed that conviction not because anyone on the
Court suggested that Congress had intended to authorizedual convictions for the same offense,

13 but rather because

the four-Justice plurality decided that Jeffers had waived anyright to object to Jeffers' prosecution for that conviction, see

Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 152-154, and because Justice White be-lieved that the two prosecutions were for different offenses.

The sole ground for Justice White's critical fifth vote toaffirm the judgment was his belief, set forth in a single short
paragraph, that conspiracy was not a lesser included offense

13 Indeed, the parties insisted that the case did not involve multiple punishment concerns, Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 154, and n. 23, and the Government
did not contend that Congress intended to authorize the imposition of dual
punishments. Because neither the Court nor the parties addressed the
issue, Jeffers is a singularly unlikely source for a holding that Congress
clearly authorized multiple convictions. Cf. United States v. L. A. Tucker
Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952).

Opinion of the Court
of CCE. Id., at 158 (opinion concurring in judgment in partand dissenting in part). In Part II of this opinion we have

rejected that view. Accordingly, even if we could infer thatthe plurality had silently reached the rather bizarre conclusion that Congress intended to allow dual convictions but topreclude other multiple punishments, only four Justices
would have supported it, with four others explicitly disagree-ing. As to this issue, then, the judgment amounts at best to
nothing more than an unexplained affirmance by an equallydivided court--a judgment not entitled to precedential
weight no matter what reasoning may have supported it.See

Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 192 (1972). The more im-portant message conveyed by

Jeffers is found not in the barejudgment, but in the plurality's conclusion, joined by the four

dissenters, that CCE and conspiracy are insufficiently dis-tinct to justify a finding that Congress intended to allow punishments for both when they rest on the same activity.14

14 The Government suggests that convictions are authorized for both

$$ 846 and 848 because they are different sections of the United States
Code. Brief for United States 16. This does not rise to the level of the
clear statement necessary for us to conclude that despite the identity of
the statutory elements, Congress intended to allow multiple punishments.
After all, we concluded in Ball that the statutes at issue did not authorize
separate convictions, and they were even more distant in the Code. See
470 U. S., at 863-864 (discussing 18 U. S. C. $ 922(h) and 18 U. S. C. App.

$ 1202(a) (1984)). If anything, the proximity of $$ 846 and 848 indicates
that Congress understood them to be directed to similar, rather than separate, evils. Cf. Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 343 (1981).

The Government further discerns congressional intent to allow multiple
punishment from "significant differences" between Ball and this case.
Brief for United States 19-24. None of its arguments, however, demonstrates that Congress "specially authorized" convictions for both the
greater and lesser included offenses we address today. Whalen, 445 U. S.,
at 693. The Government suggests, for example, that the statutes in Ball
were directed at virtually identical activity, while CCE and conspiracy
are not. As we have already concluded, however, every proof of a CCE
will demonstrate a conspiracy based on the same facts. That overlap is
enough to conclude, absent more, that Congress did not intend to allow
punishments for both.

Opinion of the Court

V
Finally, the Government argues that Congress must haveintended to allow multiple convictions because doing so

would provide a "backup" conviction, preventing a defendantwho later successfully challenges his greater offense from
escaping punishment altogether--even if the basis for thereversal does not affect his conviction under the lesser.
Brief for United States 20-22. We find the argument unper-suasive, for there is no reason why this pair of greater and
lesser offenses should present any novel problem beyondthat posed by any other greater and lesser included offenses,
for which the courts have already developed rules to avoidthe perceived danger.

In Tinder v. United States, 345 U. S. 565, 570 (1953), thedefendant had been convicted of theft from a mailbox and
improperly sentenced to prison for more than one year eventhough the evidence only supported a misdemeanor conviction. Exercising our "power to do justice as the case re-quires" pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2106, we ordered the District Court to correct the sentence without vacating theunderlying conviction. Relying on

Tinder and the practicein "state courts, including courts governed by statutes virtually the same as Section 2106," the Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit later decided that its "power to
modify erroneous judgments authorizes reduction to a lesserincluded offense where the evidence is insufficient to support
an element of the [greater] offense stated in the verdict."
Austin v. United States, 382 F. 2d 129, 140, 141-143 (1967).15

15 The Court of Appeals used this same power in Allison v. United
States, 409 F. 2d 445 (CADC 1969), but noted: "[T]he circumstances in
which such authority may be exercised are limited. It must be clear (1)
that the evidence adduced at trial fails to support one or more elements
of the crime of which appellant was convicted, (2) that such evidence sufficiently sustains all the elements of another offense, (3) that the latter is a
lesser included offense of the former, and (4) that no undue prejudice will

306 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Consistent with the views expressed by the District of Co-lumbia Circuit, federal appellate courts appear to have uniformly concluded that they may direct the entry of judgmentfor a lesser included offense when a conviction for a greater
offense is reversed on grounds that affect only the greateroffense. See 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice || 31.03[5], and
n. 54 (2d ed. 1995); United States v. Ward, 37 F. 3d 243, 251(CA6 1994) (after finding insufficient evidence to support
CCE count, Court of Appeals vacated CCE conviction andsentence and remanded for entry of conspiracy conviction,
which District Court had previously vacated as lesser included offense of CCE), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1030 (1995);
United States v. Silvers, 888 F. Supp. 1289, 1306-1309 (NDMd. 1995) (reinstating conspiracy conviction previously vacated after granting motion for new trial on CCE convic-tion). This Court has noted the use of such a practice with
approval. Morris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237, 246-247 (1986)(approving process of reducing erroneous greater offense to
lesser included offense as long as the defendant is not ableto demonstrate that "but for the improper inclusion of the
[erroneous] charge, the result of the proceeding probably
would have been different"). See also Jones v. Thomas, 491U. S. 376, 384-385, n. 3 (1989) (citing

Morris).
There is no need for us now to consider the precise limitson the appellate courts' power to substitute a conviction on

a lesser offense for an erroneous conviction of a greater of-fense.

16 We need only note that the concern motivating the

Government in asking us to endorse either the Seventh Circuit's practice of entering concurrent sentences on CCE and
conspiracy counts, or the Second Circuit's practice of enter16 Indeed, because of our holding today, problems like the one presented
in this case are unlikely to arise in the future. A jury is generally instructed not to return a verdict on a lesser included offense once it has
found the defendant guilty of the greater offense. See, e. g., Seventh
Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction 2.03, in 1 L. Sand, J. Siffert,
W. Loughlin, & S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, p. 7-7 (1991).

Opinion of the Court
ing concurrent judgments, is no different from the problemthat arises whenever a defendant is tried for greater and

lesser offenses in the same proceeding. In such instances,neither legislatures nor courts have found it necessary to
impose multiple convictions, and we see no reason why Con-gress, faced with the same problem, would consider it necessary to deviate from the traditional rule.17

VI
A guilty verdict on a $ 848 charge necessarily includes afinding that the defendant also participated in a conspiracy

violative of $ 846; conspiracy is therefore a lesser includedoffense of CCE. Because the Government's arguments have
not persuaded us otherwise, we adhere to the presumptionthat Congress intended to authorize only one punishment.
Accordingly, "[o]ne of [petitioner's] convictions, as well as itsconcurrent sentence, is unauthorized punishment for a separate offense" and must be vacated. Ball, 470 U. S., at 864.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

17 In certain circumstances, it may be that the Government will investigate and prosecute an individual for one or more $ 846 conspiracies without
being aware of facts that would justify charging a defendant with a violation of $ 848 as well. Moreover, a lesser included $ 846 conspiracy may not
always be coterminous with the larger CCE. Because neither instance is
true here, we need not explore the consequences of our holding today for
purposes of the successive prosecution strand of the Double Jeopardy
Clause, see Diaz v. United States, 223 U. S. 442, 448-449 (1912); Brown v.
Ohio, 432 U. S., at 169, n. 7; see also Garrett, 471 U. S., at 786-793, nor
need we address how prior convictions for lesser included $ 846 offenses
should be handled for purposes of entering judgment if the later $ 848
conviction is obtained but then set aside.

O'CONNOR v. CONSOLIDATED COIN CATERERS

CORP.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 95-354. Argued February 27, 1996--Decided April 1, 1996
At age 56, petitioner was fired by respondent corporation and replaced by

a 40-year-old worker. He then filed this suit, alleging that his discharge
violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).
The District Court granted respondent's summary judgment motion,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner failed to make
out a prima facie case of age discrimination under McDonnell Douglas
Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, because he failed to show that he was
replaced by someone outside the age group protected by the ADEA.

Held: Assuming that Title VII's McDonnell Douglas framework is applicable to ADEA cases, there must be at least a logical connection
between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination. Replacement by someone under 40 fails this requirement.
Although the ADEA limits its protection to those who are 40 or older,
it prohibits discrimination against those protected employees on the
basis of age, not class membership. That one member of the protected
class lost out to another member is irrelevant, so long as he lost out
because of his age. The latter is more reliably indicated by the fact
that his replacement was substantially younger than by the fact that his
replacement was not a member of the protected class.

Opinion of the Court
tioner appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-cuit stated that petitioner could establish a prima facie case

under McDonnell Douglas only if he could prove that (1) hewas in the age group protected by the ADEA; (2) he was
discharged or demoted; (3) at the time of his discharge ordemotion, he was performing his job at a level that met his
employer's legitimate expectations; and (4) following his dis-charge or demotion, he was replaced by someone of comparable qualifications outside the protected class. Since peti-tioner's replacement was 40 years old, the Court of Appeals
concluded that the last element of the prima facie case hadnot been made out.

1 56 F. 3d 542, 546 (1995). Finding that

petitioner's claim could not survive a motion for summaryjudgment without benefit of the

McDonnell Douglas pre-sumption (i. e., "under the ordinary standards of proof used

in civil cases," 56 F. 3d, at 548), the Court of Appeals af-firmed the judgment of dismissal. We granted O'Connor's
petition for certiorari. 516 U. S. 973 (1995).In

McDonnell Douglas, we "established an allocation ofthe burden of production and an order for the presentation

of proof in Title VII discriminatory-treatment cases." St.Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506 (1993). We
held that a plaintiff alleging racial discrimination in violationof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e
et seq., could establish a prima facie case by showing "(i) thathe belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was
qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking appli-cants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected;
and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained openand the employer continued to seek applicants from persons
of [the] complainant's qualifications." McDonnell Douglas,

McDonnell Douglas prima facie standard which the Fourth Circuit applies
to reduction-in-force cases, see Mitchell v. Data General Corp., 12 F. 3d
1310, 1315 (1993), petitioner could not prevail. We limit our review to the
Fourth Circuit's treatment of this case as a non-reduction-in-force case.

411 U. S., at 802. Once the plaintiff has met this initial bur-den, the burden of production shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for theemployee's rejection." Ibid. If the trier of fact finds that
the elements of the prima facie case are supported by a pre-ponderance of the evidence and the employer remains silent,
the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff. St. Mary's
Honor Center, supra, at 509-510, and n. 3; Texas Dept. ofCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981).

In assessing claims of age discrimination brought underthe ADEA, the Fourth Circuit, like others,

2 has applied some

variant of the basic evidentiary framework set forth in Mc-Donnell Douglas. We have never had occasion to decide

whether that application of the Title VII rule to the ADEAcontext is correct, but since the parties do not contest that
point, we shall assume it. Cf. St. Mary's Honor Center,
supra, at 506, n. 1 (assuming that "the McDonnell Douglasframework is fully applicable to racial-discrimination-inemployment claims under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983"). On that as-sumption, the question presented for our determination is
what elements must be shown in an ADEA case to establishthe prima facie case that triggers the employer's burden of
production.As the very name "prima facie case" suggests, there must
be at least a logical connection between each element of theprima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it

312 O'CONNOR v. CONSOLIDATED COIN CATERERS CORP.

Opinion of the Court
establishes a "legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,"
Burdine, supra, at 254, n. 7. The element of replacement
by someone under 40 fails this requirement. The discrimi-nation prohibited by the ADEA is discrimination "because

of [an] individual's age," 29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(1), though the
prohibition is "limited to individuals who are at least 40years of age," $ 631(a). This language does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged 40 or older;it bans discrimination against employees because of their
age, but limits the protected class to those who are 40 orolder. The fact that one person in the protected class has
lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his age. Or to
put the point more concretely, there can be no greater inference of age discrimination (as opposed to "40 or over" discrimination) when a 40-year-old is replaced by a 39-year-old
than when a 56-year-old is replaced by a 40-year-old. Because it lacks probative value, the fact that an ADEA plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class
is not a proper element of the McDonnell Douglas prima
facie case.

Perhaps some courts have been induced to adopt the principle urged by respondent in order to avoid creating a prima
facie case on the basis of very thin evidence--for example,
the replacement of a 68-year-old by a 65-year-old. While
the respondent's principle theoretically permits such thin evidence (consider the example above of a 40-year-old replaced
by a 39-year-old), as a practical matter it will rarely do so,
since the vast majority of age-discrimination claims come
from older employees. In our view, however, the proper solution to the problem lies not in making an utterly irrelevant
factor an element of the prima facie case, but rather in recognizing that the prima facie case requires "evidence adequate
to create an inference that an employment decision was
based on a[n] [illegal] discriminatory criterion . . . ."
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 358 (1977) (empha517us1$40k 11-06-97 20:20:15 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sis added). In the age-discrimination context, such an infer-ence cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker

with another worker insignificantly younger. Because theADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not
class membership, the fact that a replacement is substan-tially younger than the plaintiff is a far more reliable indicator of age discrimination than is the fact that the plaintiffwas replaced by someone outside the protected class.

The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

LONCHAR v. THOMAS, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 95-5015. Argued December 4, 1995--Decided April 1, 1996
Petitioner Lonchar was sentenced to death for murder nine years ago. In

the years following the affirmance of his conviction and sentence, his
sister and brother each filed "next friend" state habeas petitions, which
Lonchar opposed, and Lonchar filed, and then had dismissed, a state
habeas petition. Shortly before his scheduled execution, he filed another state habeas petition. When it was denied, he filed this "eleventh
hour" federal petition, his first. Reasoning that federal Habeas Corpus
Rule 9, not some generalized equitable authority to dismiss, governed
the case, the District Court held that Lonchar's conduct in waiting almost six years to file his federal petition did not constitute an independent basis for rejecting the petition and granted a stay to permit time
for consideration of other grounds for dismissal raised by the State.
The Court of Appeals vacated the stay. It held that equitable doctrines
independent of Rule 9 applied, relying chiefly on this Court's per curiam
order in Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist of Cal.,
503 U. S. 653. Setting aside the Rules and traditional habeas doctrines,
the court concluded that Lonchar did not merit equitable relief.

Held:

1. The principle of Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, applies when a
district court is faced with a request for a stay in a first federal habeas
case: If the district court cannot dismiss the petition on the merits before the scheduled execution, it is obligated to address the merits and
must issue a stay to prevent the case from becoming moot. If the court
lacks authority to directly dispose of the petition on the merits, it would
abuse its discretion by attempting to achieve the same result indirectly
by denying a stay. Since Lonchar's claims certainly seem substantial
enough to prevent dismissal under Habeas Corpus Rule 4 and the State
does not argue to the contrary, the courts below correctly assumed that
he could not be denied a stay unless his petition was properly subject
to dismissal. This Court's Gomez order has not displaced Barefoot's
rationale with one permitting denial of a stay in first federal habeas
cases, even when the district court lacks authority to dismiss the petition on the merits. Gomez did not involve a denial of a stay in a case
in which the lower court had no authority to dismiss the petition or a

Syllabus
first habeas petition, and it neither discussed nor cited Barefoot, much
less repudiated its rationale. Pp. 319-321.

2. The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Lonchar's first federal
petition for special ad hoc "equitable" reasons not encompassed within
the relevant statutes, the Federal Habeas Corpus Rules, or prior precedents. First, the history of the Great Writ reveals, not individual
judges dismissing writs for ad hoc reasons, but, rather, the gradual evolution of more formal judicial, statutory, or rules-based doctrines of law
that regularize and thereby narrow the discretion that individual judges
can freely exercise. See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 479-
489. Second, the fact that the writ has been called an "equitable" remedy, see, e. g., Gomez, supra, at 653-654, does not authorize a court to
ignore this body of statutes, rules, and precedents. Rather, "courts of
equity must be governed by rules and precedents no less than the courts
of law," Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (Thomas, J., concurring).
The arguments against ad hoc departure from settled rules seem particularly strong when dismissal of a first habeas petition is at issue, since
such dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ
entirely. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 95. Third, Rule 9(a)--which
permits courts to dismiss a habeas petition when "it appears that the
state . . . has been prejudiced in its ability to respond . . . by delay in
[the petition's] filing"--specifically and directly addresses the delay factor that led the Court of Appeals to dismiss Lonchar's petition. The
District Court was not asked to, and did not, make a finding of prejudice
in this case, whereas the Rule's history makes plain that the prejudice
requirement represents a critical element in the balancing of interests
undertaken by Congress and the Rule's framers, which courts may not
undermine through the exercise of background equitable powers. See
Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, 255. Fourth, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, Gomez, supra, at 653-654, did not
authorize ad hoc equitable departures from the Habeas Corpus Rules
and did not purport to work a significant change in the law applicable
to the dismissal of first habeas petitions. Fifth, the fact that Lonchar
filed his petition at the "eleventh hour" does not lead to a different
conclusion. Gomez, supra, at 654, and, e. g., Sawyer v. Whitley, 505
U. S. 333, 341, n. 7, distinguished. The complexity inherent in developing fair and effective rules to minimize the harms created by last-minute
petitions in capital cases offers a practical caution against a judicial attempt, outside the framework of the Habeas Rules, to fashion reforms
concerning first federal habeas petitions. Sixth, a different result is not
warranted by the special circumstances in this case, including the "next
friend" petitions filed by Lonchar's siblings, his filing and later withdrawal of his own state habeas petition, and the fact that his motive for

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case asks us to decide whether a federal court maydismiss a first federal habeas petition for general "equitable"

reasons beyond those embodied in the relevant statutes,Federal Habeas Corpus Rules, and prior precedents. We
decide that the Court of Appeals erred in doing so in thiscase. The primary "equitable" consideration favoring dismissal of the "eleventh hour" petition before us is seriousdelay. A Federal Habeas Corpus Rule deals specifically
with delay. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(a) (permittingcourts to dismiss a habeas petition when "it appears that the
state . . . has been prejudiced in its ability to respond . . . bydelay in its filing"). And, in our view, this Rule, not some
general "equitable" power to create exceptions to the Rule,should have determined whether or not the petition's dismissal was appropriate. I

317Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
for habeas corpus--his first federal habeas corpus petition--on June 28, 1995, the day of his scheduled execution. To

understand the procedural significance of this petition, thenature of the delay here at issue, and other relevant special
features of this case, we must consider the petition in the
context of earlier proceedings, which, for ease of exposition,we divide into five stages:

Stage One: Trial, Appeal, Execution Date: 1987-1990. In1987, Lonchar was convicted in state court for murdering
three people and sentenced to death by electrocution. Amandatory state-court appeal led to affirmance of the conviction and sentence in 1988. The trial judge then issued a
death warrant for the week of March 23, 1990. Throughout
these proceedings Lonchar said he wanted to die and refused
to cooperate with his lawyer or to attend his trial. He also
attempted (unsuccessfully) to waive his mandatory appeal,
declined to authorize any collateral attacks on his conviction
or sentence, and wrote the trial judge asking for an execution date.

Stage Two: Sister's "Next Friend" Habeas: March 1990-
February 1993. Two days before the scheduled execution,
Lonchar's sister, Chris Kellog, filed a "next friend" habeas
petition in state court, claiming Lonchar was incompetent.
Lonchar opposed the action and eventually the state and federal courts, at trial and appellate levels, held that Lonchar
was competent and dismissed the petition. The state courts
again issued a death warrant, this time for the week of February 24, 1993.

Stage Three: Lonchar's own State Habeas: February 1993-
May 1995. After Lonchar's lawyer told him that his
brother, Milan, was threatening to kill himself because of
Lonchar's execution, Lonchar authorized a habeas petition in
state court and obtained a stay of execution. He subsequently changed his mind and told the judge he did not want
to proceed. Although his lawyers objected that Lonchar
was incompetent to make this decision, the judge dismissed

318 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
the petition without prejudice. A death warrant was issuedfor the week of June 23, 1995.

Stage Four: Brother's "Next Friend" Habeas: June 20-
June 23, 1995. Three days before the scheduled execution,
Lonchar's brother, Milan, filed another "next friend" habeas
petition in state court. Lonchar again opposed it. Withinthree days, Milan's petition met the same fate as his sister's

earlier petition. That is to say, federal and state courts, attrial and appellate levels, all found Lonchar competent and
denied the petition.

Stage Five: Lonchar's Current Habeas: June 23, 1995-
Present. Immediately thereafter, after discussions with his
lawyers, Lonchar filed another state habeas petition containing 22 claims, including one that challenged the method of
execution. He told the state-court judge that he wished to
pursue each of the 22 claims, but was litigating them only to
delay his execution, with the hope that the State would
change the execution method to lethal injection so he could
donate his organs. The state courts stayed the execution
briefly, and then, two days later, denied the petition.
Lonchar immediately filed his first federal habeas petition,
which set forth the same 22 claims.

The State asked that Lonchar's federal petition be dismissed, stressing what it called Lonchar's "inequitable conduct" in waiting almost six years, and until the last minute,
to file a federal habeas petition. The District Court held
that this could not constitute an independent basis for rejecting the petition. In its view, Habeas Corpus Rule 9, not
some generalized equitable authority to dismiss, governed
the case. And, it held, Rule 9's authority to dismiss for
"abuse of the writ" applied to "second or successive" habeas
petitions, not to a first petition, such as Lonchar's. See Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b) ("A second or successive petition may
be dismissed if . . . the judge finds that the failure of the
petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ") (emphasis added). The District

Court therefore granted a stay to permit time for consider-ation of the State's other grounds in its motion to dismiss.

The next day the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir-cuit vacated the stay. 58 F. 3d 590 (1995). It pointed out
that the District Court had "based its holding exclusivelyon Rule 9."

Id., at 592. It held that "equitable doctrinesindependent of Rule 9" applied, relying chiefly on this

Court's per curiam order in Gomez v. United States Dist.Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992). 58
F. 3d, at 593. And, setting aside the Rules and traditionalhabeas doctrines, the court concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, "Lonchar does not merit equitable re-lief."

Ibid.As mentioned above, we granted certiorari in order to consider whether a federal court may, in such circumstances,dismiss a valid first habeas petition for "equitable reasons"
other than reasons listed in federal statutes and Rules, orwell established in this Court's precedents.

II
We first discuss a preliminary matter. We have before usa Court of Appeals order that vacates a stay, not an order to

dismiss the habeas petition. We believe, however, that thisfact makes no difference. That is, the Court of Appeals
order vacating the stay is lawful only if dismissal of the peti-tion would have been lawful. By bringing about Lonchar's
execution, vacating the stay would prevent the courts fromconsidering the petition's merits, just as would its dismissal.

This Court has previously considered, in a slightly differ-ent context, whether a court may allow a first federal habeas
petition to be mooted by an execution, even though the courtlacked the authority to dispose of the petition on the merits.
In Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983), the Court consid-ered the proper standard for granting or denying a stay
pending consideration of an appeal from a dismissal of a firstfederal habeas petition. The Court stated:

517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT
320 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
"When a certificate of probable cause is issued by thedistrict court, as it was in this case, or later by the court

of appeals, petitioner must then be afforded an opportu-nity to address the merits, and the court of appeals is
obligated to decide the merits of the appeal. Accord-ingly, a court of appeals, where necessary to prevent the
case from becoming moot by the petitioner's execution,should grant a stay of execution pending disposition of
an appeal when a condemned prisoner obtains a certifi-cate of probable cause on his initial habeas appeal."

Id.,at 893-894.

We believe that the same principle applies when a districtcourt is faced with a request for a stay in a first federal
habeas case: If the district court cannot dismiss the petitionon the merits before the scheduled execution, it is obligated
to address the merits and must issue a stay to prevent thecase from becoming moot. That is, if the district court lacks
authority to directly dispose of the petition on the merits, itwould abuse its discretion by attempting to achieve the same
result indirectly by denying a stay. Of course, a districtcourt is authorized to dismiss a petition summarily when "it
plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibitsannexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in
the district court," Habeas Corpus Rule 4, just as a court ofappeals is not required to address an appeal that fails to meet
the certificate of probable cause standard of a "substantialshowing of the denial of a federal right," see Barefoot, 463
U. S., at 893-894. And, as is also true of consideration ofappeals, a district court may, within the constraints of
due process, expedite proceedings on the merits. Id., at894-895.

In this case, Lonchar's claims certainly seem substantialenough to prevent dismissal under Rule 4, and the State does
not argue to the contrary. That being so, we believe thatthe District Court and Court of Appeals were correct to as517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT

321Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
sume that Lonchar could not be denied a stay unless his petition was properly subject to dismissal. See App. 62, 63-64;
58 F. 3d, at 593.

The concurrence argues that the Court's decision in Gomez
v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal.,
supra, displaced the rationale of Barefoot, relying particularly on the statement that a "court may consider the lastminute nature of an application to stay execution in deciding
whether to grant equitable relief." 503 U. S., at 654. The
concurrence understands this statement to authorize denial
of a stay, for generalized equitable reasons, in first federal
habeas cases, even when the district court lacks authority to
dismiss the petition on the merits. We do not believe this
sentence, or the rest of the Court's order in Gomez, supports
this conclusion.

First, Gomez did not involve denial of a stay in a case in
which the lower court had no authority to dismiss the petition. Instead, as the concurrence concedes, post, at 338, the
case could have been dismissed as an "abuse of the writ."
See 503 U. S., at 653-654. Second, Gomez involved a fifth
attempt to secure collateral review, not a first habeas petition. Barefoot indicated that stays in "[s]econd and successive federal habeas corpus petitions present a different
issue," since in such cases it is more likely that " `a condemned inmate might attempt to use repeated petitions and
appeals as a mere delaying tactic,' " and because this danger
is specially recognized and addressed in the Habeas Corpus
Rules. Barefoot, supra, at 895. Finally, the concurrence's
reading of Gomez seriously conflicts with Barefoot's wellsettled treatment of first habeas petitions. We decline to
adopt such a far-reaching interpretation of this per curiam
order, especially since Gomez did not concern a first habeas
petition, and since the Gomez order did not discuss (or even
cite) Barefoot, much less explicitly repudiate its rationale.

322 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court

III
We turn, then, to the main question: Could the Court ofAppeals properly dismiss this first habeas petition for special

ad hoc "equitable" reasons not encompassed within theframework of Rule 9? We conclude that it could not.

First, the history of the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus re-veals, not individual judges dismissing writs for ad hoc reasons, but, rather, the gradual evolution of more formal judi-cial, statutory, or rules-based doctrines of law. See,

e. g.,
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 479-489 (1991); Barefoot,supra, at 892; Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 451 (1986)

(plurality opinion); Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 15(1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313 (1963). In earlier times, the courts followed comparatively simple rules,even occasionally disregarding complex procedural doctrines, such as res judicata, see McCleskey, supra, at 479, asthey exercised the writ in light of its most basic purpose,
avoiding serious abuses of power by a government, say aking's imprisonment of an individual without referring the
matter to a court. See, e. g., L. Yackle, Postconviction Rem-edies $ 4, pp. 9-11 (1981); W. Duker, A Constitutional History
of Habeas Corpus 4-6 (1980); W. Church, A Treatise on theWrit of Habeas Corpus $$ 1-46, pp. 2-40 (2d ed. 1893). As
the writ has evolved into an instrument that now demandsnot only conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, see
In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 756-758 (1888), but also applicationof basic constitutional doctrines of fairness, see Jones v.
Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236, 243 (1963), Congress, the Rulewriters, and the courts have developed more complex procedural principles that regularize and thereby narrow the dis-cretion that individual judges can freely exercise. Those
principles seek to maintain the courts' freedom to issue thewrit, aptly described as the "highest safeguard of liberty,"
Smith v. Bennett, 365 U. S. 708, 712 (1961), while at the sametime avoiding serious, improper delay, expense, complexity,
and interference with a State's interest in the "finality" of

Opinion of the Court
its own legal processes. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,698 (1993) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part); McCleskey, supra, at 490-492; Reed v. Ross, 468U. S. 1, 10 (1984). These legal principles are embodied in

statutes, rules, precedents, and practices that control the
writ's exercise. Within constitutional constraints they re-flect a balancing of objectives (sometimes controversial),

which is normally for Congress to make, but which courtswill make when Congress has not resolved the question.
See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 632-633 (1993).Second, the fact that the writ has been called an "equitable" remedy, see, e. g., Gomez, supra, at 653-654, does not
authorize a court to ignore this body of statutes, rules, and
precedents. "There is no such thing in the Law, as Writs of
Grace and Favour issuing from the Judges." Opinion on
the Writ of Habeas Corpus, Wilm. 77, 87, 97 Eng. Rep. 29,
36 (1758) (Wilmot, J.). Rather, "courts of equity must be
governed by rules and precedents no less than the courts of
law." Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (Thomas,
J., concurring). See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422
U. S. 405, 417 (1975); The Federalist No. 78, p. 528 (J. Cooke
ed. 1961). As Selden pointed out so many years ago, the
alternative is to use each equity chancellor's conscience as a
measure of equity, which alternative would be as arbitrary
and uncertain as measuring distance by the length of each
chancellor's foot. See 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity
Jurisprudence 16 (13th ed. 1886).

That is why this Court, in McCleskey, said that concern
about habeas petition abuses has led to "a complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by
historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions." 499 U. S., at 489 (emphasis added). And it is why
this Court, in McCleskey, also reaffirmed the importance,
" `in order to preclude individualized enforcement of the Constitution in different parts of the Nation,' " of " `lay[ing] down
as specifically as the nature of the problem permits the

Opinion of the Court
standards or directions that should govern the DistrictJudges in the disposition of applications for habeas corpus

by prisoners under sentence of State Courts.' " Id., at 496(quoting

Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 501-502 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)).

After all, equitable rules that guide lower courts reduceuncertainty, avoid unfair surprise, minimize disparate treatment of similar cases, and thereby help all litigants, includingthe State, whose interests in "finality" such rules often further. See Barefoot, 463 U. S., at 892; Kuhlmann, supra, at451;

Townsend, supra, at 313. See also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991) (barring consideration of claims
procedurally defaulted in state court absent cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice); Teague v. Lane,
489 U. S. 288, 299-316 (1989) (plurality opinion) (barring
from habeas proceedings federal claims based on certain
"new rules" of constitutional law); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S.
509, 522 (1982) ("[A] district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims").

And the arguments against ad hoc departure from settled
rules would seem particularly strong when dismissal of a
first habeas petition is at issue. Dismissal of a first federal
habeas petition is a particularly serious matter, for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the Great Writ
entirely, risking injury to an important interest in human
liberty. See Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 95 (1869) (the writ
"has been for centuries esteemed the best and only sufficient
defence of personal freedom"); Withrow, supra, at 700
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (decisions involving limitation of habeas relief "warrant restraint"). Even in the context of "second and successive"
petitions--which pose a greater threat to the State's interests in "finality" and are less likely to lead to the discovery
of unconstitutional punishments--this Court has created
careful rules for dismissal of petitions for abuse of the writ.
See McCleskey, supra.

Opinion of the Court
This is not to say that a district court has no discretionin dealing with first federal habeas petitions. The Habeas

Corpus Rules themselves provide district courts with amplediscretionary authority to tailor the proceedings to dispose
quickly, efficiently, and fairly of first habeas petitions thatlack substantial merit, while preserving more extensive proceedings for those petitions raising serious questions. Forinstance, as noted above, the Rules permit a district court to
dismiss summarily a first petition without waiting for theState's response if "it plainly appears from the face of the
petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner isnot entitled to relief." Habeas Corpus Rule 4. Moreover,
even if the petition cannot be dismissed under that standard,the district court is still authorized to "take such other action
as the judge deems appropriate." Ibid. The AdvisoryCommittee's Note makes clear that this provision was

"designed to afford the judge flexibility in a case whereeither dismissal or an order to answer may be inappropriate. For example, the judge may want to authorizethe respondent to make a motion to dismiss based upon
information furnished by respondent, which may showthat petitioner's claims have already been decided on the
merits in a federal court; that petitioner has failed toexhaust state remedies; that the petitioner is not in custody within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254; or that adecision in the matter is pending in state court. In
these situations, a dismissal may be called for on proce-dural grounds, which may avoid burdening the respondent with the necessity of filing an answer on the substan-tive merits of the petition. In other situations, the
judge may want to consider a motion from respondentto make the petition more certain. Or the judge may
want to dismiss some allegations in the petition, requir-ing the respondent to answer only those claims which
appear to have some arguable merit." 28 U. S. C.,p. 478.

517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT
326 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
The Rules also afford the district court substantial discretionin the conduct of a case once an answer has been ordered.

It may decide to order expansion of the record to facilitate adisposition on the merits without the need for an evidentiary
hearing. Habeas Corpus Rule 7. Discovery is available
only if "the judge in the exercise of his discretion and forgood cause shown grants leave." Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a).

And the district court is afforded a degree of discretion indetermining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing. See
Habeas Corpus Rule 8(a); Townsend, 372 U. S., at 318;
Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992). Thus,
the district court is afforded substantial discretion to expe-dite proceedings, cf.

Barefoot, supra, at 894-895, in order
quickly to dispose of meritless first petitions while at the
same time preserving the important right of those raisingserious habeas questions to have their claims thoroughly

considered by the district court.Third, a specific federal Habeas Corpus Rule, Rule 9(a),
directly addresses the primary factor--delay--that led theCourt of Appeals to dismiss the petition for "equitable reasons." That Rule says:

"Delayed petitions. A petition may be dismissed if it
appears that the state of which the respondent is an of-ficer

has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the
petition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner showsthat it is based on grounds of which he could not have

had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence
before the circumstances prejudicial to the state oc-curred." (Emphasis added.)

The Rule applies because Lonchar's petition is a "delayed
petition." And the language of the Rule requires, as a condition of dismissal, a finding of "prejudice," which the District Court was not asked to, and did not, make. (Because
the State specifically disavows reliance upon Rule 9(a), we
do not consider what would constitute sufficient "prejudice"

327Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
to justify application of the Rule in the context of a last-minute habeas petition.) Instead, it asked the Court of

Appeals to develop an equitable rule under which a "peti-tion may be dismissed" for "delay in its filing"

without the
prejudice precondition.

But the history of the Rule makes plain that the prejudicerequirement represents a critical element in the balancing of

interests undertaken by Congress and the framers of theRule which courts may not undermine through the exercise
of background equitable powers. See Bank of Nova Scotiav.

United States, 487 U. S. 250, 255 (1988) ("The balance
struck by the Rule between societal costs and the rights of
the accused may not casually be overlooked `because a court
has elected to analyze the question under the supervisory
power ' " (quoting United States v. Payner, 447 U. S. 727, 736
(1980)). The Advisory Committee's Note indicates that the
very maxim upon which the Court of Appeals relied as authority for acting outside the Rules--the equitable maxim
that "the petitioner's conduct may . . . disentitle him to relief," 58 F. 3d, at 592--was taken into account when the
Rule's framers drafted Rule 9(a) and included its prejudice
requirement. See Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas
Corpus Rule 9, 28 U. S. C., p. 484. Moreover, Congress,
when considering a draft of the Rule, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2074,
directly focused upon the prejudice requirement and rejected, by removing from the draft Rule, a provision that
would have eased the burden of the prejudice requirement
by presuming prejudice after a delay of five years. Compare Rules of Procedure: Communication from the Chief
Justice of the United States Transmitting Rules and Forms
Governing Proceedings Under Sections 2254 and 2255 of
Title 28, H. R. Doc. No. 94-464, pp. 38-39 (1976), with Act of

328 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
(Even in an area, such as exhaustion, where judges have con-siderable discretionary authority, "appropriate deference to

Congress' power to prescribe the basic procedural schemeunder which a claim may be heard in a federal court requires
fashioning of exhaustion principles in a manner consistent
with congressional intent and any applicable statutoryscheme").

We recognize there is considerable debate about whetherthe present Rule properly balances the relevant competing
interests. See, e. g., U. S. Judicial Conference, Ad Hoc Com-mittee on Federal Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Committee Report and Proposal 6, 18-21 (1989) (hereinafter Powell
Report) (suggesting a statute of limitations for habeas petitions); American Bar Association, Toward a More Just and
Effective System of Review in State Death Penalty Cases
29-30 (1990) (hereinafter ABA Report) (same). But, to debate the present Rule's effectiveness is to affirm, not to deny,
its applicability. Moreover, that debate's focus upon Congress also reveals the institutional inappropriateness of
amending the Rule, in effect, through an ad hoc judicial
exception, rather than through congressional legislation or
through the formal rulemaking process. See Vasquez v.
Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986) ("[D]espite many attempts
in recent years, Congress has yet to create a statute of limitations for federal habeas corpus actions. We should not
lightly create a new judicial rule . . . to achieve the same
end") (citation omitted); Appendix to this opinion (listing
more than 80 bills that have proposed a statute of limitations
for federal habeas cases since Vasquez, none of which has
been adopted).

Fourth, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, we do
not believe that this Court, in Gomez v. United States
Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992),
authorized ad hoc equitable departures from the Habeas
Corpus Rules. The Court of Appeals relied heavily on the
statement:

517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT

329Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
"Even if we were to assume, however, that Harriscould avoid the application of McCleskey to bar his

claim, we would not consider it on the merits. Whetherhis claim is framed as a habeas petition or as a [42
U. S. C.] $ 1983 action, Harris seeks an equitable rem-edy."

Id., at 653-654.

But, this statement, understood in context, does not meanthat this Court authorized setting aside the Habeas Corpus

Rules and refusing to consider a first habeas petition forgeneralized "equitable" reasons. As we explained above,
Gomez was not a first habeas petition. Harris, after bring-ing four habeas petitions, argued that he still could raise a
"method of execution" claim in a last-minute $ 1983 action, towhich habeas rules, like

McCleskey's abuse of the writ doc-trine, would not apply. The quoted sentence simply says

that these rules would apply, even if $ 1983 were also aproper vehicle for his "method of execution" claim, since
Harris was still seeking equitable relief and the equitablerationale underlying

McCleskey's abuse of the writ doc-trine--avoiding, among other things, "last-minute attempts

to manipulate the judicial process," 503 U. S., at 654; Mc-Cleskey, 499 U. S., at 484-485, 491-493--would apply to a
suit challenging the method of execution, regardless of thetechnical form of action.

Gomez did not, and did not purportto, work a significant change in the law applicable to the

dismissal of first habeas petitions.Fifth, the fact that Lonchar filed his petition at the "eleventh hour" does not lead to a different conclusion. Werecognize that the Court in Gomez said that "[a] court may
consider the last-minute nature of an application to stayexecution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief."
503 U. S., at 654. And this Court has made similar state-ments in other cases. See,

e. g., Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S.333, 341, n. 7 (1992) ( judge may resolve doubts against petitioners who "delay their filings until the last minute with aview to obtaining a stay because the district court will lack

time to give them the necessary consideration before thescheduled execution");

Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 425-
426 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring).These statements do not help the State, however, for they

all involve "second or successive" habeas petitions. The
Rules specifically authorize dismissal of those petitions for"abuse of the writ." Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b). See also 28

U. S. C. $ 2244(b) (authorizing dismissal when "the applicanthas . . . deliberately withheld the newly asserted ground

or
otherwise abused the writ") (emphasis added). McCleskeygives content to the notion of "abuse of the writ," as do the

cases just mentioned. These statements, therefore, reflect
an effort to follow and to apply the Habeas Corpus Rules,
not an effort to develop law outside the Rules.

Indeed, to try to devise some sensible way of supplementing first federal habeas petition rules with ad hoc equitable
devices would prove difficult. As we discussed, supra, at
324, the interest in permitting federal habeas review of a
first petition is quite strong. And, given the importance
of a first federal habeas petition, it is particularly important that any rule that would deprive inmates of all access
to the writ should be both clear and fair. As two prominent
bodies charged with developing proposals for habeas law
reform have pointed out, developing fair and effective rules
to minimize the harms created by last-minute petitions in
capital cases is quite complicated, requiring consideration
of issues such as the State's control over setting execution dates, the time needed to exhaust state remedies, the
common practice of substituting specialized capital counsel
for habeas, and the time needed by habeas counsel to investigate claims, some of which (such as ineffective assistance
of counsel) often cannot be raised on direct appeal. See
ABA Report 26-29, 114-134; id., at 29 ("In a system of review that employs artificial execution dates as a catalyst,
there are many eleventh hours and many last minutes, because, if the petitioner does not seek a stay of execution at

Opinion of the Court
virtually every level, the execution is imminent"); PowellReport 1 ("[P]risoners often cannot obtain qualified counsel

until execution is imminent"). These bodies, consequently,have proposed a comprehensive set of interrelated changes,
see ABA Report 5-39; Powell Report 5-7, as have recent
legislative proposals. See, e. g., H. R. 3, 104th Cong., 1stSess. (1995); H. R. 729, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); H. R.

2703, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); S. 3, 104th Cong., 1st Sess.(1995); S. 623, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); S. 735, 104th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1995). This complexity offers a practicalcaution against a judicial attempt, outside the framework of
the Habeas Corpus Rules, to fashion similar reforms concerning first federal habeas petitions.

Sixth, the special circumstances in this case--other than
delay--do not warrant a different result. The earlier habeas petitions brought by Lonchar's sister and brother are
beside the point. Lonchar did not assert his claims in those
proceedings, nor did he conspire with his siblings to delay
his execution. To the contrary, he opposed their petitions
and prevailed in his opposition. See App. 22, 35, 48. These
"next friend" petitions neither aggravate nor mitigate
Lonchar's delay in filing his own petition during those six
years.

Lonchar's filing and later withdrawal of his own state
habeas petition would seem similarly beside the point. At
most, the assertion and withdrawal of that petition would
create a potential ground for a state-law procedural bar to a
second state petition, which, in certain circumstances, might
also prevent litigation of similar claims in federal court. See
Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729-732. The State (despite its
apparent agreement to Lonchar's withdrawal of the state
petition "without prejudice," see App. 34, 161-163) has
asserted just such a bar. It is free to litigate the matter
on remand.

Nor do we believe that Lonchar's motive for filing this federal habeas petition can make a critical difference. Lonchar

517us1$41q 02-16-99 20:25:31 PAGES OPINPGT
332 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
did say that he filed this petition to delay his execution with
the hope that the State would change its execution method.
But Lonchar's petition also requested the traditional habeas
relief of a new trial or resentencing, App. 362, and he told
the District Court specifically that he had considered each
and every claim and wanted the court to hear them. Normally courts will not look behind an action that states a valid
legal claim on its face in order to try to determine the comparative weight a litigant places on various subjective reasons for bringing the claim. A valid antitrust complaint or
environmental action, for example, does not suddenly become
invalid simply because the litigant is subjectively indifferent
about receiving the requested equitable relief, but instead
primarily wants to please his or her family or obtain revenge.
More importantly, litigation about a petitioner's subjective
motivations risks adding to the complexity of habeas litigation, asking a subjective question (about the petitioner's true
motives) that is often unanswerable and the very asking of
which may encourage and reward the disingenuous. See
Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 487 (1986) (rejecting a subjective test for determining "cause" for procedural default, in
part because under such a rule "federal habeas courts would
routinely be required to hold evidentiary hearings to determine what prompted counsel's failure to raise the claim in
question").

In sum, we believe that this case should have been examined within the framework of the Habeas Corpus Rules and
settled precedents, not according to generalized equitable
considerations outside that framework. We, of course, express no view about the proper outcome of the application of
the Rules.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in
the judgment.

I agree with the Court that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed, but I am in sufficient disagreement with the Court's reasoning to write separately. I disagree with the Court's statement that "the Court of Appeals
order vacating the stay is lawful only if dismissal of the petition would have been lawful." Ante, at 319. This statement, I believe, misreads our opinion in Barefoot v. Estelle,
463 U. S. 880 (1983), and ignores our reasoning in Gomez v.
United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503
U. S. 653 (1992).

The order under review does not dispose of a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus; it vacates a stay of execution. The
Court dismisses this distinction as a "preliminary matter,"
which "makes no difference," because "the Court of Appeals
order vacating the stay is lawful only if dismissal of the petition would have been lawful." Ante, at 319. In my view,

335Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
the fact that we are reviewing an order vacating a stay isanything but "preliminary."

The Court is correct inasmuch as the underlying petition'slikelihood of success is one factor to be considered in determining whether a stay should be entered. See Hilton v.
Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776 (1987). Rule 9 of the RulesGoverning $ 2254 Cases sets forth the grounds upon which a

habeas petition may be dismissed other than the merits.Under Rule 9(b), a petition may be dismissed if it is found
to be successive or abusive. Under Rule 9(a) it may alsobe dismissed

"if it appears that the state of which the respondent isan officer has been prejudiced in its ability to respond
to the petition by delay in its filing unless the petitionershows that it is based on grounds of which he could not
have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable dili-gence before the circumstances prejudicial to the state
occurred." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(a).
In this case, there was no basis for denying a stay on the
ground that petitioner's habeas claims are without merit; forthe purposes of considering the stay application, it is undisputed that those claims are substantial. Because the habeaspetition was petitioner's first, it would also have been inappropriate to deny a stay on the ground that the petition could
have been dismissed under Rule 9(b). I agree with the ma-jority,

ante, at 326, that, on the record before us, the petition
likewise could not have been dismissed under Rule 9(a), be-cause the Rule's elements were not satisfied. Although the

District Court determined that petitioner engaged in delay,
it made no determination that the delay prejudiced the
State's ability to respond to the petition, within the meaning
of Rule 9(a), by depriving the State of adequate time to respond or otherwise.

However, an applicant's likelihood of success is not the only
consideration in determining whether he is entitled to a stay.

336 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
See Hilton, supra, at 776. The Habeas Rules say little ifanything about this determination, and understandably so.

It must be remembered the statutes governing habeas cor-pus, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241-2255, were enacted in 1948, before
the writ developed into a vehicle for federal courts "to reexamine federal constitutional issues even after trial and re-view by a state,"

Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 459 (1953),
and long before this Court declined to declare the deathpenalty unconstitutional, in

Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153
(1976), Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976), and Jurek v.
Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976). It would have been difficult for
Congress to have anticipated the issues that arise in a system in which state death sentences are presumptively valid,
but are "reexamined" in federal court before execution to
consider constitutional challenges to the manner in which
they were imposed.

In the typical noncapital habeas case, it is relatively easy
to rule on an application to stay execution of a state sentence
by consulting ordinary principles governing stays. Rarely,
if ever, does a noncapital petitioner seek a stay of his sentence before the district court has passed on the merits of
his petition. When a petitioner does make such a request,
he usually has little chance of success on the merits, since
he has been confined pursuant to a presumptively valid final
judgment of conviction rendered by a state court. See 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d). If, after entertaining his petition, the district court awards the writ, the "stay equities" shift in favor
of the petitioner, who will be enlarged unless the State can
demonstrate that the equities counsel otherwise. Hilton,
supra, at 774.

This easily managed system can be adapted to govern capital habeas cases, so long as the capital petitioner files his
habeas petition sufficiently in advance of his execution date.
If he files in a timely fashion, the district court may then
consider the petition in due course, without in any way disturbing the sentence or execution date before ruling on the

337Cite as: 517 U. S. 314 (1996)
Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
petition's merits. But if, as in this case, the petitioner in-stead files an "eleventh hour" federal habeas petition, the

customary principles must be revised accordingly. The dis-trict court may feel that it simply does not have time before
the date of execution to adequately consider the merits ofpetitioner's claims, and will naturally be disposed, as the District Court was here, to enter a stay to enable it to do so.1In so doing, the district court sets aside a scheduled state
execution of sentence, imposed by a presumptively valid finalstate judgment of conviction, on the basis of a tentative assessment that the judgment violates a federal constitutionalright. Unless the eleventh-hour nature of the petition is
taken into account, the late filing may induce the federalcourt to disregard federal-state comity and "frustrate . . . the
States' sovereign power to punish offenders," Engle v. Isaac,456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982), when such interference might have
been avoided by timely filing.2 The customary principlesmust also be revised to account for an attempt by a petitioner to manipulate the district court into granting reliefwhere relief is clearly precluded.

In Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist.
of Cal., 503 U. S. 653 (1992), this Court demonstrated how
last-minute or manipulative uses of the stay power constituteequitable grounds which can justify the denial of an application for stay of a state-court order of execution. The Court

1 The Court is not concerned by this prospect because district courts
have discretion to "order expansion of the record," authorize discovery,
decide "whether to hold an evidentiary hearing," and generally "expedite
proceedings." Ante, at 326. These tools are useless, however, when a
petitioner deliberately leaves the district court only one day to review a
petition's claims.

2 Of course, there may be cases in which the eleventh-hour nature of the

petition is attributable to the State's scheduling the execution date before
the petitioner may appeal the denial of postconviction relief in a timely
manner, not to the petitioner's deliberate refusal to seek relief. I am certain that district courts are capable of distinguishing between the two
situations.

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
vacated a stay of execution issued on behalf of Robert AltonHarris, a California prisoner, pending consideration of a 42

U. S. C. $ 1983 action alleging that his method of executionviolated the Eighth Amendment. See 503 U. S., at 653.
Because Harris had not raised the Eighth Amendment claim
in any of the four federal habeas corpus petitions he hadfiled over 10 years, the Court considered the $ 1983 claim "an

obvious attempt to avoid the application of McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), to bar this successive claim for
relief." Ibid. We could have vacated the stay on the basisof the successive-petition bar alone, but we explicitly did not:

"Even if we were to assume, however, that Harriscould avoid the application of

McCleskey to bar his
claim, we would not consider it on the merits. Whetherhis claim is framed as a habeas petition or as a $ 1983

action, Harris seeks an equitable remedy. Equity musttake into consideration the State's strong interest in
proceeding with its judgment and Harris' obvious attempt at manipulation. This claim could have beenbrought more than a decade ago. There is no good reason for this abusive delay, which has been compoundedby last-minute attempts to manipulate the judicial process. A court may consider the last-minute nature ofan application to stay execution in deciding whether
to grant equitable relief." Id., at 653-654 (citationsomitted).

Our order confirms that "abusive delay"--waiting until thelast minute to submit a claim that could have been submitted
earlier--and "obvious attempt[s] at manipulation"--in that
case, asking the court to exercise its equitable powers in defiance of a clearly applicable legal rule precluding relief on
the merits--constitute equities to be considered in ruling on
the prayer for relief. More important, because we explained
that this misconduct constituted sufficient grounds to deny
Harris' stay application, "[e]ven if " McCleskey did not bar

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
his claim, we made clear that such abuse may tip the scalesdecisively against a stay applicant regardless of the applicant's likelihood of success on the merits.3Gomez also confirms that a habeas petitioner's misconduct
in applying for a stay may disentitle him to the stay evenif the petition is his first. The inequitable conduct

Gomezcriticized, abusive delay and manipulation, may be present

in any stay application. In Gomez we did not equivocatewhen we said: "Equity must take into consideration [an] obvious attempt at manipulation. . . . A court may consider thelast-minute nature of an application to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief." 503 U. S., at 654(citations omitted). It may be admitted that there would be
a stronger presumption in favor of deciding the merits ofa first-time petition than for a successive petition. The
successive nature of a petition gives rise to an additionalconcern counseling against review of the merits: that the
petitioner is frustrating the State's attempts to execute itsjudgment by exploiting the fact that ordinary principles of
res judicata do not apply in habeas corpus. McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 479, 491-492 (1991). It does not follow,
however, that because a first-time petitioner does not abusethe writ under Rule 9(b) he may never be found to have
engaged in the misconduct we criticized in Gomez; it meansonly that misconduct by such a petitioner is less likely to
result in a refusal to grant a stay in order to consider themerits of the petition.

The majority attempts to distinguish Gomez because thematter before the Court in that case was "not a

first habeaspetition." Ante, at 321. This reading is wholly implausible,

because the first paragraph of the Court's order had alreadydiscussed the fact that Harris was not a first-time petitioner.

3 The $ 1983 action was a class-action suit, of which Harris was one member. I note that the claim that the Court declined to consider on the
merits has enough merit for the class plaintiffs to have prevailed in district
court and the court of appeals. Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F. 3d 301 (CA9 1996).

340 LONCHAR v. THOMAS

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
If the paragraph about Harris' misconduct in relation to hisapplication, quoted above, had legal significance only if his

petition was successive, it would have been superfluous.To support its view that a stay must be granted if a first
federal habeas petition is not dismissed, the Court relies on
our decision in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880 (1983). But
Barefoot and the present case arose in different contexts.
The question presented and decided in Barefoot only ad-dressed how the merits of the habeas petition may determine

whether the petitioner obtains a stay. Id., at 887 (announc-ing the Court was considering "the appropriate standard for
granting or denying a stay of execution pending dispositionof an appeal by a federal court of appeals by a deathsentenced federal habeas corpus petitioner"); id., at 891 (affirming the denial of a stay because the Court of Appeals"ruled on the merits of [Barefoot's] appeal"). The issue in

the present case is quite different: whether a petitioner'scourse of conduct in seeking the writ may be considered by
the district court in deciding whether to grant a stay. Tothe extent that the Court's reading of

Barefoot depends on
the belief that a decision on a first federal habeas petition issomehow necessary to validate a state conviction, the Court

ignores Barefoot's assertion to the contrary:

"The role of federal habeas proceedings . . . is secondary
and limited. Federal courts are not forums in which torelitigate state trials. . . . The procedures adopted to

facilitate the orderly consideration and disposition of habeas petitions are not legal entitlements that a defend-ant has a right to pursue irrespective of the contribution

these procedures make toward uncovering constitutional
error." Id., at 887-888.

And, contrary to the Court's refusal to consider whether
Barefoot's "rationale" might brook a distinction between seasonable and eleventh-hour first habeas petitions, ante, at 321,
our opinion warned that federal habeas corpus is not "a

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
means by which a defendant is entitled to delay an executionindefinitely." 463 U. S., at 887.

I nonetheless agree with the Court that the Court ofAppeals erred in vacating the stay granted in this case by
the District Court. The District Court did not consider
whether petitioner's conduct in court constituted misconductso abusive that it disentitled him to a stay; it focused solely

on the likelihood that petitioner's habeas petition might bedismissed. Although the court determined that petitioner
had "abused the writ," it did not rely on this finding to denya stay, correctly concluding that a first habeas petition may
not be dismissed on the basis of abuse of the writ. App.
61-62. There was no determination that petitioner's habeas
petition could be dismissed under Rule 9(a). There is no
other ground under which to dismiss a first petition other
than the merits, and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding otherwise.

Although the findings supporting the District Court's determination that petitioner abused the writ would go a long
way toward supporting affirmance on the ground that petitioner's misconduct disentitled him to a stay, reversal is still
in order. I agree with the Court that petitioner's conduct in
the next-friend proceedings "neither aggravate nor mitigate
Lonchar's delay in filing." Ante, at 331. Petitioner may
not be blamed for having asserted his competence and his
control over his habeas claims, because our case law required
the District Court to establish as much. See Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 165 (1990). Nor should he be
blamed for his brother's and sister's desire to protect him,
although it would be a different case if the record established
that his relatives and he were colluding to stay his execution
but avoid putting his claims before the court, so as to keep
his options open in the future. Because the District Court
erred in concluding that petitioner was culpable for the
course of the next-friend proceedings and "[i]t is a paradigmatic abuse of discretion for a court to base its judgment on

SHIEH v. KAKITA et al.
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 95-7587. Decided April 1, 1996*
In March 1996, this Court invoked Rule 39.8 to deny petitioner Shieh in

forma pauperis status. To date, he has filed 10 petitions in this Court
in less than three years. All were patently frivolous and were denied
without recorded dissent.

Held: For the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court

of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1, Shieh is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the instant cases, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any
further petitions for certiorari from him in noncriminal matters unless
he pays the required docketing fee and submits his petition in compliance with this Court's Rule 33.1. This order will not prevent Shieh
from petitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be imposed
against him, but it will allow this Court to devote its limited resources
to the claims of petitioners who have not abused the certiorari process.

Motions denied.

Per Curiam.
In these three petitions for certiorari, pro se petitionerLiang-Houh Shieh requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis under Rule 39 of this Court. We deny his requestspursuant to Rule 39.8. Shieh is allowed until April 22, 1996,
within which to pay the docketing fees required by Rule 38and to submit his petitions in compliance with this Court's
Rule 33.1. We also direct the Clerk not to accept any fur-ther petitions for certiorari from Shieh in noncriminal matters unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 38and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.1.

Shieh has abused this Court's certiorari process. InMarch 1996, we invoked Rule 39.8 to deny Shieh

in forma
pauperis status. See Shieh v. State Bar of California, 516

*Together with No. 95-7588, Shieh v. United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, and No. 95-7589, Shieh v. Krieger et al., also on

sanction accordingly. The order will not prevent Shieh frompetitioning to challenge criminal sanctions which might be

BOWERSOX, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORREC-TIONAL CENTER

v. WILLIAMS

on application to vacate stay of execution

No. A-828. Decided April 9, 1996
A Federal District Court denied respondent Williams' third habeas corpus

petition, finding all of his claims to be abusive, successive, or procedurally defaulted. The Eighth Circuit subsequently entered a summary
order staying Williams' pending execution, giving no explanation for its
conclusion that such a stay was appropriate.

Held: The Eighth Circuit abused its discretion by entering a stay on this

record. Entry of a stay on a second or third habeas petition is particularly egregious absent substantial grounds for relief. Delo v. Blair, 509
U. S. 823. No such grounds can be discerned here. The Magistrate's
report adopted by the District Court meticulously addresses and rejects
each of Williams' claims. To the extent that the Eighth Circuit discerned substantial grounds for relief, it failed to reveal them in its summary order. Entry of a stay without explanation is disfavored, cf. Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951 (per curiam), for this Court loses the
benefit of the court of appeals' views and must resort to other portions
of the record in evaluating whether to vacate the stay.

Application granted.

of Missouri on April 10, 1996. On January 11, 1996, a Fed-eral District Court denied Williams' third federal habeas

corpus petition, finding all of Williams' claims to be abusive,successive, or procedurally defaulted. On March 8, 1996, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit en-tered a summary order staying Williams' execution. The
Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for May 13, 1996,

denied a petition for rehearing en banc, and we now have
before us an application to vacate the stay.

"A stay of execution pending disposition of a second or
successive federal habeas petition should be granted only
when there are `substantial grounds upon which relief might
be granted.' " Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320, 321 (1990) (per
curiam) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895
(1983)). Entry of a stay on a second or third habeas petition
is a drastic measure, and we have held that it is " `particularly egregious' " to enter a stay absent substantial grounds
for relief. Delo v. Blair, 509 U. S. 823 (1993) (citation omitted). On the record before us, we can discern no such
grounds. We are persuaded by the report prepared by Magistrate Judge Hays, which meticulously addresses each of
Williams' claims and finds each to be abusive, successive, procedurally defaulted, or meritless, and by the District Court's
order adopting that report, in which the District Court also
denied Williams' dilatory motion to amend the habeas petition. The Court of Appeals abused its discretion by entering a stay on this record.

To the extent the Court of Appeals discerned substantial
grounds for relief, it failed to reveal them in its summary
order granting the stay. Although we hesitate to say that a
court of appeals must, in every case, explain the basis for its
entry of a stay, we see fit to remind the lower courts that
entry of a stay without explanation is disfavored. Cf. Netherland v. Tuggle, 515 U. S. 951 (1995) (per curiam). When
a court of appeals fails to articulate its reasons for granting
a stay, we lose the benefit of that court's views and must
resort to other portions of the record in evaluating whether
to vacate the stay. In this case, the District Court's careful
treatment of Williams' claims and the surface implausibility
of those claims persuade us that the stay should not have
been granted, and the Court of Appeals' summary order does
not convince us otherwise.

Accordingly, the application to vacate the stay of executionis granted.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

I would deny the application to vacate the stay of Wil-liams' execution. A diligent appellate court has granted a

certificate of probable cause and scheduled this case for argu-ment on May 13. Those actions signal to me the existence
of reasons, not the absence of reasons, for granting a stay.At the very least, before acting irretrievably, this Court
might have invited prompt clarification of the Court of Ap-peals' order. Appreciation of our own fallibility, and respect
for the judgment of an appellate tribunal closer to the scenethan we are, as I see it, demand as much.

COOPER v. OKLAHOMA
certiorari to the court of criminal appealsof oklahoma

No. 95-5207. Argued January 17, 1996--Decided April 16, 1996
Oklahoma law presumes that a criminal defendant is competent to stand

trial unless he proves his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. Applying that standard, a judge found petitioner Cooper competent on separate occasions before and during his trial for first-degree
murder, despite his bizarre behavior and conflicting expert testimony
on the issue. In affirming his conviction and death sentence, the Court
of Criminal Appeals rejected his argument that the State's presumption of competence, combined with its clear and convincing evidence
standard, placed such an onerous burden on him as to violate due
process.

Held: Because Oklahoma's procedural rule allows the State to try a defendant who is more likely than not incompetent, it violates due process. Pp. 354-369.

(a) It is well settled that the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due process. Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 449, establishes that a State may presume that the defendant is competent and
require him to prove incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence.
Such a presumption does not offend a " `principle of justice so rooted in
the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,' " id., at 445, for it affects the outcome "only in a narrow class of
cases . . . where the evidence that a defendant is competent is just as
strong as the evidence that he is incompetent," id., at 449. This case,
however, presents the quite different question whether a State may
proceed with a criminal trial after a defendant has shown that he is
more likely than not incompetent. Pp. 354-356.

(b) Oklahoma's rule has no roots in historical practice. Both early
English and American cases suggest that the common-law standard of
proof was preponderance of the evidence. That this same standard is
currently used by 46 States and the federal courts indicates that the
vast majority of jurisdictions remain persuaded that Oklahoma's heightened standard is not necessary to vindicate the State's interest in
prompt and orderly disposition of criminal cases. The near-uniform application of a standard that is more protective of the defendant's rights
than Oklahoma's rule supports the conclusion that the heightened standard offends a deeply rooted principle of justice. Pp. 356-362.

(c) Oklahoma's rule does not exhibit "fundamental fairness" in operation. An erroneous determination of competence has dire consequences
for a defendant who has already demonstrated that he is more likely
than not incompetent, threatening the basic fairness of the trial itself.
A defendant's inability to communicate effectively with counsel may
leave him unable to exercise other rights deemed essential to a fair
trial--e. g., choosing to plead guilty, waiving his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by taking the witness stand, or waiving his
rights to a jury trial or to cross-examine witnesses--and to make a
myriad of smaller decisions concerning the course of his defense. These
risks outweigh the State's interest in the efficient operation of its criminal justice system. Difficulty in ascertaining whether a defendant is
incompetent or malingering may make it appropriate to place the burden of proof on him, but it does not justify the additional onus of an
especially high standard of proof. Pp. 362-367.

(d) Although it is normally within a State's power to establish the
procedures through which its laws are given effect, the power to regulate procedural burdens is subject to proscription under the Due Process
Clause when, as here, the procedures do not sufficiently protect a fundamental constitutional right. Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, distinguished. The decision herein is in complete accord with the ruling
in Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, that due process requires a clear
and convincing evidence standard of proof in involuntary civil commitment proceedings. That ruling protects an individual's fundamental
liberty interest, while the ruling in this case safeguards the fundamental
right not to stand trial while incompetent. Pp. 367-369.

350 COOPER v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Oklahoma the defendant in a criminal prosecution is
presumed to be competent to stand trial unless he proves his
incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 22, $ 1175.4(B) (1991). Under that standard a defendant
may be put to trial even though it is more likely than not
that he is incompetent. The question we address in this
case is whether the application of that standard to petitioner
violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

I

In 1989 petitioner was charged with the brutal killing of
an 86-year-old man in the course of a burglary. After an
Oklahoma jury found him guilty of first-degree murder and
recommended punishment by death, the trial court imposed
the death penalty. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.

Petitioner's competence was the focus of significant attention both before and during his trial. On five separate occasions a judge considered whether petitioner had the ability
to understand the charges against him and to assist defense
counsel. On the first occasion, a pretrial judge relied on the
opinion of a clinical psychologist employed by the State to
find petitioner incompetent. Based on that determination,
he committed petitioner to a state mental health facility for
treatment.

Opinion of the Court
Upon petitioner's release from the hospital some threemonths later, the trial judge heard testimony concerning

petitioner's competence from two state-employed psycholo-gists. These experts expressed conflicting opinions regarding petitioner's ability to participate in his defense. Thejudge resolved the dispute against petitioner, ordering him
to proceed to trial.At the close of a pretrial hearing held one week before the
trial was scheduled to begin, the lead defense attorney raisedthe issue of petitioner's competence for a third time. Counsel advised the court that petitioner was behaving oddly andrefusing to communicate with him. Defense counsel opined
that it would be a serious matter "if he's not faking." App.6. After listening to counsel's concerns, however, the judge
declined to revisit his earlier determination that petitionerwas competent to stand trial.

Petitioner's competence was addressed a fourth time onthe first day of trial, when petitioner's bizarre behavior
prompted the court to conduct a further competency hearingat which the judge observed petitioner and heard testimony
from several lay witnesses, a third psychologist, and peti-tioner himself.

1 The expert concluded that petitioner was

Tr. of Pretrial Motions and Competency Hearings 3-4 (May 4-5, 1992),
talked to himself and to an imaginary "spirit" who petitioner claimed gave
him counsel. On the witness stand petitioner expressed fear that the lead
defense attorney wanted to kill him.

In his argument at the close of the proceeding, defense counsel reminded
the court of an incident that occurred during petitioner's testimony:

"Every time I would get close to his space where he is seated in this
little witness enclave . . . he would stand up and he would get away from
me as far as he could and so I would back off and I'd give him a little
space. . . . So, I've approached him from every side. . . . except I haven't
approached him from the front. So yesterday, I approach him from the
front. And that's the last thing I did. I regret doing that.

"He stood up and he got as far back against the rail behind the witness
chair as he could get. I edged closer. He got as far back and he got up

Opinion of the Court
presently incompetent and unable to communicate effectively
with counsel, but that he could probably achieve competence
within six weeks if treated aggressively. While stating that
he did not dispute the psychologist's diagnosis, the trial
judge ruled against petitioner. In so holding, however, the
court voiced uncertainty:

"Well, I think I've used the expression . . . in the past
that normal is like us. Anybody that's not like us is not
normal, so I don't think normal is a proper definition
that we are to use with incompetence. My shirtsleeve
opinion of Mr. Cooper is that he's not normal. Now, to
say he's not competent is something else.. . . . .

"But you know, all things considered, I suppose it's
possible for a client to be in such a predicament that he
can't help his defense and still not be incompetent. I
suppose that's a possibility, too.

"I think it's going to take smarter people than me to
make a decision here. I'm going to say that I don't believe he has carried the burden by clear and convincing
evidence of his incompetency and I'm going to say we're
going to go to trial." Id., at 42-43.

on that rail. So I've got him up on the rail and I'm thinking, hey, what
can I lose? Let me just see what he does now because he can go no
further back, but as the Court knows, there's a space of about two-and-ahalf feet behind this rail and a marble wall.

"Without looking for his safety at all and looking what's behind him,
when I moved the least bit and I didn't move very far towards him, he
fell to get away from me. He fell. He hit his head. The thud on that
marble when he jackknifed backward off of that railing into that marble
could be heard at the back of that courtroom. . . .

"We got him back up here in the witness enclave, he's just busted his
head, tears are streaming down his eyes and he does not respond in any
normal fashion." App. 37-38.

Opinion of the Court
Incidents that occurred during the trial,2 as well as the
sordid history of petitioner's childhood that was recounted
during the sentencing phase of the proceeding, were consistent with the conclusions expressed by the expert. In a final
effort to protect his client's interests, defense counsel moved
for a mistrial or a renewed investigation into petitioner's
competence. After the court summarily denied these motions, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death.

In the Court of Criminal Appeals, petitioner contended
that Oklahoma's presumption of competence, combined with
its statutory requirement that a criminal defendant establish
incompetence by clear and convincing evidence, Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 22, $ 1175.4(B) (1991),3 placed such an onerous burden on
him as to violate his right to due process of law. The appellate court rejected this argument. After noting that it can
be difficult to determine whether a defendant is malingering,
given "the inexactness and uncertainty attached to [competency] proceedings," the court held that the standard was
justified because the "State has great interest in assuring its
citizens a thorough and speedy judicial process," and because
a "truly incompetent criminal defendant, through his attorneys and experts, can prove incompetency with relative
ease." 889 P. 2d 293, 303 (1995). We granted certiorari to
review the Court of Criminal Appeals' conclusion that appli2 Petitioner did not communicate with or sit near defense counsel during
the trial. Through much of the proceedings he remained in prison overalls, crouching in the fetal position and talking to himself.

3 Section 1175.4(B) provides, in relevant part: "The court, at the hearing

on the application [for determination of competency], shall determine, by
clear and convincing evidence, if the person is incompetent. The person
shall be presumed to be competent for the purposes of the allocation of
the burden of proof and burden of going forward with the evidence."

Section 1175.4 was amended in 1991, during the pretrial period of
petitioner's prosecution. The amendment did not alter the text of
subsection B.

Opinion of the Court
cation of the clear and convincing evidence standard does notviolate due process. 516 U. S. 910 (1995).

II
No one questions the existence of the fundamental rightthat petitioner invokes. We have repeatedly and consistently recognized that "the criminal trial of an incompetentdefendant violates due process." Medina v. California, 505
U. S. 437, 453 (1992); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172 (1975);

Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966). Noris the significance of this right open to dispute. As

Justice
Kennedy recently emphasized:

"Competence to stand trial is rudimentary, for upon itdepends the main part of those rights deemed essential

to a fair trial, including the right to effective assistanceof counsel, the rights to summon, to confront, and to
cross-examine witnesses, and the right to testify onone's own behalf or to remain silent without penalty for
doing so. Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172(1975)." Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139-140
(1992) (opinion concurring in judgment).4
The test for incompetence is also well settled. A defendantmay not be put to trial unless he " `has sufficient present

ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree ofrational understanding . . . [and] a rational as well as factual
understanding of the proceedings against him.' " Dusky v.United States, 362 U. S. 402, 402 (1960) (per curiam).

5

4 Indeed, the right not to stand trial while incompetent is sufficiently
important to merit protection even if the defendant has failed to make a
timely request for a competency determination. See Pate v. Robinson,
383 U. S. 375, 384 (1966).

5 The Oklahoma statute defines competence as "the present ability of a

person arrested for or charged with a crime to understand the nature of
the charges and proceedings brought against him and to effectively and

Opinion of the Court
Our recent decision in Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437(1992), establishes that a State may presume that the defendant is competent and require him to shoulder the burden ofproving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. Id., at 449. In reaching that conclusion we held thatthe relevant inquiry was whether the presumption " `offends
some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and con-science of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' "

Id.,at 445 (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202

(1977)). We contrasted the "deep roots in our common-lawheritage" underlying the prohibition against trying the incompetent with the absence of any settled tradition concern-ing the allocation of the burden of proof in a competency
proceeding. 505 U. S., at 446. Our conclusion that the pre-sumption of competence offends no recognized principle of
"fundamental fairness" rested in part on the fact that theprocedural rule affects the outcome "only in a narrow class
of cases where the evidence is in equipoise; that is, wherethe evidence that a defendant is competent is just as strong
as the evidence that he is incompetent." Id., at 449.6The question we address today is quite different from the
question posed in Medina. Petitioner's claim requires us toconsider whether a State may proceed with a criminal trial
after the defendant has demonstrated that he is more likelythan not incompetent. Oklahoma does not contend that it
may require the defendant to prove incompetence beyond areasonable doubt.

7 The State maintains, however, that the

clear and convincing standard provides a reasonable accomrationally assist in his defense." Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, $ 1175.1(1) (Supp.
1996).

6 In her concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor expressed the view that

placing the burden on the defendant in this limited group of cases was
permissible because it provided the defendant with an incentive to cooperate with the information-gathering process necessary to a reliable competency determination. Medina, 505 U. S., at 455.

modation of the opposing interests of the State and the de-fendant. We are persuaded, by both traditional and modern

practice and the importance of the constitutional interest atstake, that the State's argument must be rejected.

III
"Historical practice is probative of whether a proceduralrule can be characterized as fundamental," Medina, 505

U. S., at 446. In this case, unlike in Medina, there is noindication that the rule Oklahoma seeks to defend has any
roots in prior practice. Indeed, it appears that a rule sig-nificantly more favorable to the defendant has had a long and
consistent application.We turn first to an examination of the relevant commonlaw traditions of England and this country. The prohibitionagainst trying the incompetent defendant was well established by the time Hale and Blackstone wrote their famouscommentaries. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24 ("[I]f a
man in his sound memory commits a capital offence . . . [a]ndif, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he shall
not be tried: for how can he make his defence?"); 1 M. Hale,Pleas of the Crown *34-*35 (same). The English cases
which predate our Constitution provide no guidance, how-ever, concerning the applicable standard of proof in competency determinations. See Trial of Charles Bateman(1685), reported in 11 How. St. Tr. 464, 467 (1816), and
Hawles, Remarks on the Trial of Mr. Charles Bateman, 11How. St. Tr. 474, 476 (1816) (noting that the court in the 1685
trial incurred "censure" for proceeding to trial with a doubtas to the defendant's competence);

Kinloch's Case (1746), 18How. St. Tr. 395, 411 (1813);
King v. Steel, 1 Leach 452, 168Eng. Rep. 328 (1787).

Beginning in the late 18th century, cases appear whichprovide an inkling of the proper standard. In

King v. Frith,
22 How. St. Tr. 307 (1790), for example, the court instructed

Opinion of the Court
the jury to "diligently inquire . . . whether John Frith, thenow prisoner at the bar . . . be of sound mind and understanding or not . . . ." Id., at 311. Some 50 years later the jurorsreceived a nearly identical admonition in Queen v. Goode, 7
Ad. & E. 536, 112 Eng. Rep. 572 (K. B. 1837): " `You shalldiligently inquire, and true presentment make . . . whether
John Goode . . . be insane or not . . . .' " Id., at 536, n. (a),112 Eng. Rep., at 572-573, n.

(a)2.8 Similarly, in King v.Pritchard, 7 Car. & P. 303, 173 Eng. Rep. 135 (1836), the

court empaneled a jury to consider "whether the prisoner ismute of malice or not; secondly, whether he can plead to the
indictment or not; thirdly, whether he is of sufficient intellectto comprehend the course of proceedings on the trial . . . ."
Ibid. See also King v. Dyson, 73 Car. & P. 305, n. (a), 173Eng. Rep. 135-136, n.

(a) (1831); Queen v. Southey, 4 F. & F.864, 895, 176 Eng. Rep. 825, 838 (1865); Queen v. Berry, 1

Q. B. Rep. 447, 449 (1876). Ibid.9These authorities, while still speaking less clearly than we
might wish, are instructive. By phrasing the inquiry in asimple disjunctive, Frith, Goode, and Pritchard suggest that
traditional practice required the jury to determine whetherthe defendant was "more likely than not" incompetent.
Nothing in the jury instructions of these cases will bear theinterpretation of a clear and convincing standard. What is
more, the cases contain no indication that the use of a pre8 Courts often referred to the prisoner's insanity (or present insanity)
rather than incompetence, even when the proceeding concerned the defendant's competence to stand trial. Beginning with the earliest cases,
the issue at a sanity or competency hearing has been "whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial,
so as to make a proper defence to the charge." King v. Pritchard, 7
Car. & P. 303, 304, 173 Eng. Rep. 135 (1836).

9 In 1800 England codified the common-law rule that a court could

empanel a jury to determine whether a defendant charged with treason,
murder, or a felony offense was competent to stand trial. Criminal

Opinion of the Court
ponderance standard represented a departure from earlier(pre-Constitution) practice.

10

Modern English authority confirms our interpretation ofthese early cases as applying a preponderance standard.

Relying on "principles . . . laid down in a number of cases,"including

Pritchard and King v. Dyson, 7 Car. & P. 305,n. (a), 173 Eng. Rep. 135, n. (a) (1831), the court in Queen v.

Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220, 3 All E. R. 418 (1959), ruled:

"If the contention that the accused is insane is put forward by the defence and contested by the prosecution,there is, in our judgment, a burden upon the defence of

satisfying the jury of the accused's insanity. In such acase, as in other criminal cases in which the onus of
proof rests upon the defence, the onus is discharged ifthe jury are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that
the accused's insanity has been made out." Id., at 235,3 All E. R., at 429.

11

10 Indeed, although in Medina we concluded that it is permissible for a
State to require the defendant to shoulder the burden of demonstrating
his incompetence, we noted that some 19th-century English authorities
placed the burden on the prosecutor once competence was put in issue.
Medina v. California, 505 U. S., at 447. See Queen v. Davies, 3 Car. &
K. 328, 329, 175 Eng. Rep. 575, 575 (1853) (judge ruled that "[the prosecutor] should begin, and call his witnesses, to show that the prisoner is sane,
and capable of pleading"); Ley's Case, 1 Lewin 239, 240, 168 Eng. Rep.
1026 (1828) (" `If there be a doubt as to the prisoner's sanity . . . you cannot
say that he is in a fit state to be put upon his trial' "). See also Halsbury,
10 Laws of England 403 (3d ed. 1955) ("Where a jury is so empanelled
[to determine competency], the onus is on the prosecution to prove the
sanity of the defendant"). But see Queen v. Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220,
236, 3 All E. R. 418, 430 (1959) (explicitly rejecting the suggestion that
the prosecutor must prove the defendant's competence to stand trial).
Given the disagreement among English courts concerning which party
bore the burden of proof, it is unlikely that in cases in which the burden
was placed on the defendant that burden was as weighty as clear and
convincing evidence.

11 The Podola court opined that the tests laid down in Pritchard "have

been followed so often that they may be said to be firmly embodied in our
law." 43 Crim. App., at 238, 3 All E. R., at 431.

Opinion of the Court
Likewise, we are aware of no decisional law from thiscountry suggesting that any State employed Oklahoma's

heightened standard until quite recently. Rather, the ear-liest available sources typically refer to English authorities, see, e. g., Freeman v. People, 47 Am. Dec. 216, 223-225(N. Y. 1847),

State v. Harris, 78 Am. Dec. 272, 272-275(N. C. 1860) (adopting procedures outlined in King v. Dyson,

7 Car. & P. 305, n. (a), 173 Eng. Rep. 135, n. (a) (1831), andKing v. Pritchard, 7 Car. & P. 303, 173 Eng. Rep. 135 (1836)),
and employ the disjunctive language used by the Englishcourts, see,

e. g., Commonwealth v. Hathaway, 13 Mass. 299
(1816); People v. Kleim, 1 N. Y. 13, 15 (1845); Harris, 78 Am.
Dec., at 275; United States v. Chisolm, 149 F. 284, 290 (SDAla. 1906).

12 By the turn of the 20th century, however,

American courts were explicitly applying a preponderance
standard. In 1896, Ohio juries were instructed that "[t]heburden is upon the prisoner to show by a preponderance

of the proof that he is insane." State v. O'Grady, 5 Ohio
Dec. 654, 655 (1896).13 Some 15 years later, the TennesseeSupreme Court described the competency determination as

12 In Commonwealth v. Braley, 1 Mass. 102, 103 (1804), a case decided
shortly after the Constitution was ratified, the court instructed the jury
to consider "whether [the accused] neglected or refused to plead to the
indictment against him for murder, of his free will and malice, or whether
he did so neglect by the act of God." This instruction may be a precursor
to the "sane or insane" disjunctive.

13 See also State v. Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P. 443, 444 (1898) ("What I mean by

the preponderance of the evidence is that the accused must show that he
is now at the time of this trial probably not sane"). Cf. People v. Ah
Ying, 42 Cal. 18, 20 (1872) (jury should find defendant presently insane if
"satisfied" by the evidence supporting that conclusion).

Both Tyler and State v. O'Grady are instructive concerning the proper
interpretation of the authorities which articulate no standard of proof
but phrase the inquiry in the disjunctive. In each case the jury was told
that its task was to determine whether the accused "is or is not sane,"
Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P., at 443, see also O'Grady, 5 Ohio Dec., at 654, and
then explicitly instructed that the defendant bore the burden of proof by
a preponderance of the evidence. Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P., at 443; O'Grady,
5 Ohio Dec., at 655.

"controlled by the preponderance of the proof," Jordan v.
State, 124 Tenn. 81, 89, 135 S. W. 327, 329 (1911), and the
highest court of Pennsylvania held that competence is "de-cided by a preponderance of the evidence,"

Commonwealth
v. Simanowicz, 242 Pa. 402, 405, 89 A. 562, 563 (1913).14These early authorities are bereft of language susceptible of

supporting a clear and convincing evidence standard.15

Contemporary practice demonstrates that the vast majority of jurisdictions remain persuaded that the heightened
standard of proof imposed on the accused in Oklahoma is
not necessary to vindicate the State's interest in prompt and
orderly disposition of criminal cases. Only 4 of the 50 States
presently require the criminal defendant to prove his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence.16 None of the re14 See also State v. Arnold, 12 Iowa 479, 484 (1861) ("A doubt must be
raised whether at the time there is such mental impairment . . . as to
render it probable that the prisoner can not, as far as may devolve upon
him, have a full, fair and impartial trial"); People v. McElvaine, 125 N. Y.
596, 608, 26 N. E. 929, 933 (1891) (the court "was familiar with the appearance and conduct of the prisoner during the period of that trial, and had
sufficient grounds before it to judge as to the probability of his present
sanity"). See also Crocker v. State, 19 N. W. 435, 436 (Wis. 1884); United
States v. Chisolm, 149 F. 284, 290 (SD Ala. 1906).

Several of the early cases explicitly mention the common-law roots of
the State's statutory procedure for determining competency. See People
v. McElvaine, 125 N. Y., at 608, 26 N. E., at 932 ("We do not think the
Code of Criminal Procedure has made any radical change in the mode of
procedure or the character of the [competency] proceedings"); French v.
State, 67 N. W. 706, 710 (Wis. 1896) ("The statute . . . providing for an
inquisition, where there is a probability that the accused is, at the time of
his trial, insane, and thereby incapacitated to act for himself, to determine
whether he is so insane, is substantially a provision in affirmance of a
power the court had at common law in such cases, as abundantly appears
from the authorities").

prove the defendant's competence to stand trial once a ques-tion about competency has been credibly raised.

18 The situation is no different in federal court. Congress has directedthat the accused in a federal prosecution must prove incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U. S. C.$ 4241.

The near-uniform application of a standard that is moreprotective of the defendant's rights than Oklahoma's clear
and convincing evidence rule supports our conclusion thatthe heightened standard offends a principle of justice that is
deeply "rooted in the traditions and conscience of our peo-ple."

Medina v. California, 505 U. S., at 445 (internal quo-tation marks omitted). We turn next to a consideration of

whether the rule exhibits " `fundamental fairness' in opera-tion."

Id., at 448 (quoting Dowling v. United States, 493U. S. 342, 352 (1990)).

IV
Contemporary and historical procedures are fully consist-ent with our evaluation of the risks inherent in Oklahoma's

practice of requiring the defendant to prove incompetenceby clear and convincing evidence. In

Addington v. Texas,441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979), we explained that:

"The function of a standard of proof, as that concept isembodied in the Due Process Clause and in the realm of
factfinding, is to `instruct the factfinder concerning thedegree of confidence our society thinks he should have
in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particulartype of adjudication.'

In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,370 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)."

The "more stringent the burden of proof a party must bear,the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision."

Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 283(1990). For that reason, we have held that due process

places a heightened burden of proof on the State in civil pro-ceedings in which the "individual interests at stake . . . are
both `particularly important' and `more substantial thanmere loss of money.' "

Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745,756 (1982) (termination of parental rights) (quoting Addington, 441 U. S., at 424).19Far from "jealously guard[ing]," Jacob v. New York City,
315 U. S. 752, 752-753 (1942), an incompetent criminal de-fendant's fundamental right not to stand trial, Oklahoma's
practice of requiring the defendant to prove incompetenceby clear and convincing evidence imposes a significant risk
of an erroneous determination that the defendant is compe-tent. In

Medina we found no comparable risk because thepresumption would affect only the narrow class of cases in

which the evidence on either side was equally balanced.

19 See also Addington v. Texas (involuntary civil commitment); Woodby
v. INS, 385 U. S. 276, 285-286 (1966) (deportation); Chaunt v. United
States, 364 U. S. 350, 353 (1960) (denaturalization); Schneiderman v.

Our opinions in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261
(1990), and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502
(1990), are not to the contrary. In Cruzan we held that the Due Process
Clause does not prohibit Missouri from requiring a third party who seeks
to terminate life-sustaining treatment to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the incompetent person receiving such treatment
would wish that step to be taken. 497 U. S., at 280. We reasoned that
the heightened standard of proof was permissible because the decisionmaker was a surrogate for the incompetent individual, id., at 280-281, and
because the consequences of an erroneous decision were irreversible, id.,
at 283. In Akron Center for Reproductive Health we upheld an Ohio
statute that required an unmarried, unemancipated minor woman who
sought to obtain an abortion without notifying a parent to prove by clear
and convincing evidence that judicial bypass of the notification requirement was appropriate in her case. We approved the heightened standard
of proof in that case largely because the proceeding at issue was ex parte.

364 COOPER v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
"Once a State provides a defendant access to procedures formaking a competency evaluation," we stated, there is "no

basis for holding that due process further requires the Stateto assume the burden of vindicating the defendant's constitutional right by persuading the trier of fact that the defendant
is competent to stand trial." 505 U. S., at 449. Unlike thepresumption at issue in

Medina, however, Oklahoma's clear
and convincing evidence standard affects a class of cases inwhich the defendant has already demonstrated that he is

more likely than not incompetent.For the defendant, the consequences of an erroneous determination of competence are dire. Because he lacks theability to communicate effectively with counsel, he may be
unable to exercise other "rights deemed essential to a fair
trial." Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S., at 139 (Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment). After making the "profound"

choice whether to plead guilty, Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S.389, 398 (1993), the defendant who proceeds to trial

"will ordinarily have to decide whether to waive his`privilege against compulsory self-incrimination,'

Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969), by taking thewitness stand; if the option is available, he may have to

decide whether to waive his `right to trial by jury,' ibid.;and, in consultation with counsel, he may have to decide
whether to waive his `right to confront [his] accusers,'
ibid., by declining to cross-examine witnesses for the
prosecution." Ibid.

With the assistance of counsel, the defendant also is called
upon to make myriad smaller decisions concerning the courseof his defense. The importance of these rights and decisions

demonstrates that an erroneous determination of compe-tence threatens a "fundamental component of our criminal
justice system" 20--the basic fairness of the trial itself.

Opinion of the Court
By comparison to the defendant's interest, the injury tothe State of the opposite error--a conclusion that the defendant is incompetent when he is in fact malingering--is mod-est. To be sure, such an error imposes an expense on the
state treasury and frustrates the State's interest in theprompt disposition of criminal charges. But the error is
subject to correction in a subsequent proceeding and theState may detain the incompetent defendant for "the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there isa substantial probability that he will attain [competence] in
the foreseeable future." Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715,738 (1972).

21

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals correctly ob-served that the "inexactness and uncertainty" that characterize competency proceedings may make it difficult to deter-mine whether a defendant is incompetent or malingering.
889 P. 2d, at 303. We presume, however, that it is unusualfor even the most artful malingerer to feign incompetence
successfully for a period of time while under professionalcare.

22 In this regard it is worth reiterating that only four

jurisdictions currently consider it necessary to impose on thecriminal defendant the burden of proving incompetence by

clear and convincing evidence. Moreover, there is no reasonto believe that the art of dissimilation is new. Eighteenth
and nineteenth century courts, for example, warned jurorscharged with making competency determinations that
" `there may be great fraud in this matter,' " King v. Dyson,7 Car. & P. 305, n.

(a), 173 Eng. Rep., at 136, n. (a) (quoting

21 Under Jackson, if the defendant regains competence or is found to be
malingering, the State may proceed to trial.

22 Sir John Hawles, Solicitor General to King William III (who reigned

from 1689-1702), noted that "there is a great difference between pretences
and realities, and sana and non sana memoria hath been often tryed in
capital matters, and the prisoners have reaped so little benefit by their
pretences, it being always discovered, that we rarely hear of it." Hawles,

1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at *35), and that "[i]t would bea reproach to justice if a guilty man . . . postponed his trial

upon a feigned condition of mind, as to his inability to aidin his defense," United States v. Chisolm, 149 F., at 288.

23

Although they recognized this risk, the early authorities didnot resort to a heightened burden of proof in competency

proceedings. See Part III, supra.More fundamentally, while the difficulty of ascertaining
where the truth lies may make it appropriate to place theburden of proof on the proponent of an issue, it does not
justify the additional onus of an especially high standard ofproof. As the

Chisolm Court continued,

"[I]t would be likewise a reproach to justice and ourinstitutions, if a human being . . . were compelled to go

to trial at a time when he is not sufficiently in possessionof his mental faculties to enable him to make a rational
and proper defense. The latter would be a more griev-ous error than the former; since in the one case an individual would go unwhipped of justice, while in the otherthe great safeguards which the law adopts in the punishment of crime and the upholding of justice would berudely invaded by the tribunal whose sacred duty it is
to uphold the law in all its integrity." 149 F., at 288.
A heightened standard does not decrease the risk of error,but simply reallocates that risk between the parties. See

Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S., at 283.In cases in which competence is at issue, we perceive no
sound basis for allocating to the criminal defendant the largeshare of the risk which accompanies a clear and convincing
evidence standard. We assume that questions of compe-tence will arise in a range of cases including not only those
in which one side will prevail with relative ease, but alsothose in which it is more likely than not that the defendant

is incompetent but the evidence is insufficiently strong tosatisfy a clear and convincing standard. While important

state interests are unquestionably at stake, in these lattercases the defendant's fundamental right to be tried only
while competent outweighs the State's interest in the effi-cient operation of its criminal justice system.

V
Oklahoma makes two additional arguments in support ofits procedural rule that warrant discussion. First, Oklahoma correctly reminds us that it is normally within thepower of the State to establish the procedures through which
its laws are given effect, including those related to the bur-den of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion.
See Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 201-202. In Patterson we upheld New York's requirement that in a prosecutionfor second-degree murder the defendant must bear the burden of proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotionaldisturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter.
Id., at 207-208. After observing that the rule was consist-ent with common-law practice,

id., at 202, we held that "[t]heDue Process Clause . . . does not put New York to the choice

of abandoning [statutory] defenses or undertaking to dis-prove their existence in order to convict of a crime which
otherwise is within its constitutional powers to sanction bysubstantial punishment,"

id., at 207-208.Although we found no violation in Patterson, we noted

that the State's power to regulate procedural burdens wassubject to proscription under the Due Process Clause if it
"offends some principle of justice so rooted in the tradi-tions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental," id., at 201-202 (internal quotation marks omitted).This case involves such a rule. Unlike

Patterson, whichconcerned procedures for proving a statutory defense, we

consider here whether a State's procedures for guaranteeinga fundamental constitutional right are sufficiently protective

Opinion of the Court
of that right. The deep roots and fundamental character ofthe defendant's right not to stand trial when it is more likely

than not that he lacks the capacity to understand the natureof the proceedings against him or to communicate effectively
with counsel mandate constitutional protection.Finally, Oklahoma suggests that our decision in

Addingtonv. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), in which we held that due process requires a clear and convincing standard of proof in aninvoluntary civil commitment proceeding, supports imposition of such a rule in competency proceedings. The argu-ment is unpersuasive because commitment and competency
proceedings address entirely different substantive issues.Although we have not had the opportunity to consider the
outer limits of a State's authority to civilly commit an unwill-ing individual,

O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 573-574 (1975), our decision in Donaldson makes clear that due

process requires at a minimum a showing that the person ismentally ill and either poses a danger to himself or others
or is incapable of "surviving safely in freedom," id., at 573-576. The test for competence to stand trial, by contrast, is
whether the defendant has the present ability to understandthe charges against him and communicate effectively with
defense counsel. Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S., at 402.Even if we were to uphold Oklahoma's imposition of the clear
and convincing evidence rule in competency proceedings, thecomparable standards in the two proceedings would not
guarantee parallel results.24More importantly, our decision today is in complete accord
with the basis for our ruling in Addington. Both cases con-cern the proper protection of fundamental rights in circumstances in which the State proposes to take drastic actionagainst an individual. The requirement that the grounds for
civil commitment be shown by clear and convincing evidence

24 For example, a mentally retarded defendant accused of a nonviolent
crime may be found incompetent to stand trial but not necessarily be subject to involuntary civil commitment.

Opinion of the Court
protects the individual's fundamental interest in liberty.The prohibition against requiring the criminal defendant to

demonstrate incompetence by clear and convincing evidencesafeguards the fundamental right not to stand trial while
incompetent. Because Oklahoma's procedural rule allowsthe State to put to trial a defendant who is more likely than
not incompetent, the rule is incompatible with the dictatesof due process.

25

VI
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed, andthe case is remanded to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

25 We note that Addington did not purport to resolve any question concerning the rights of the defendant in a criminal proceeding. To the contrary, in his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Burger contrasted the
appropriate standard in civil commitment proceedings with the rules applicable in criminal cases in which "the interests of the defendant are of
such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional
requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to
exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment."

Petitioner Markman owns the patent to a system that tracks clothing

through the dry-cleaning process using a keyboard and data processor
to generate transaction records, including a bar code readable by optical
detectors. According to the patent's claim, the portion of the patent
document that defines the patentee's rights, Markman's product can
"maintain an inventory total" and "detect and localize spurious additions
to inventory." The product of respondent Westview Instruments, Inc.,
also uses a keyboard and processor and lists dry-cleaning charges on
bar-coded tickets that can be read by optical detectors. In this infringement suit, after hearing an expert witness testify about the meaning of the claim's language, the jury found that Westview's product had
infringed Markman's patent. The District Court nevertheless directed
a verdict for Westview on the ground that its device is unable to track
"inventory" as that term is used in the claim. The Court of Appeals
affirmed, holding the interpretation of claim terms to be the exclusive
province of the court and the Seventh Amendment to be consistent with
that conclusion.

Held: The construction of a patent, including terms of art within its claim,

is exclusively within the province of the court. Pp. 376-391.

(a) The Seventh Amendment right of trial by jury is the right which
existed under the English common law when the Amendment was
adopted. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S. 654,
657. Thus, the Court asks, first, whether infringement cases either
were tried at law at the time of the founding or are at least analogous
to a cause of action that was. There is no dispute that infringement
cases today must be tried before a jury, as their predecessors were more
than two centuries ago. This conclusion raises a second question:
whether the particular trial issue (here a patent claim's construction) is
necessarily a jury issue. This question is answered by comparing the
modern practice to historical sources. Where there is no exact antecedent in the common law, the modern practice should be compared to
earlier practices whose allocation to court or jury is known, and the

Syllabus
best analogy that can be drawn between an old and the new must be
sought. Pp. 376-378.

(b) There is no direct antecedent of modern claim construction in the
historical sources. The closest 18th-century analogue to modern claim
construction seems to have been the construction of patent specifications describing the invention. Early patent cases from England and
this Court show that judges, not juries, construed specification terms.
No authority from this period supports Markman's contention that even
if judges were charged with construing most patent terms, the art of
defining terms of art in a specification fell within the jury's province.
Pp. 378-384.

(c) Since evidence of common-law practice at the time of the framing
does not entail application of the Seventh Amendment's jury guarantee
to the construction of the claim document, this Court must look elsewhere to characterize this determination of meaning in order to allocate
it as between judge or jury. Existing precedent, the relative interpretive skills of judges and juries, and statutory policy considerations all
favor allocating construction issues to the court. As the former patent
practitioner, Justice Curtis, explained, the first issue in a patent case,
construing the patent, is a question of law, to be determined by the
court. The second issue, whether infringement occurred, is a question
of fact for a jury. Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330, 338. Contrary to
Markman's contention, Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812, and Tucker v.
Spalding, 13 Wall. 453, neither indicate that 19th-century juries resolved
the meaning of patent terms of art nor undercut Justice Curtis's authority. Functional considerations also favor having judges define patent
terms of art. A judge, from his training and discipline, is more likely
to give proper interpretation to highly technical patents than a jury and
is in a better position to ascertain whether an expert's proposed definition fully comports with the instrument as a whole. Finally, the need
for uniformity in the treatment of a given patent favors allocation of
construction issues to the court. Pp. 384-391.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question here is whether the interpretation of a so-called patent claim, the portion of the patent document that

defines the scope of the patentee's rights, is a matter of lawreserved entirely for the court, or subject to a Seventh
Amendment guarantee that a jury will determine the mean-ing of any disputed term of art about which expert testimony
is offered. We hold that the construction of a patent, includ-ing terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the
province of the court.

Opinion of the Court

I
The Constitution empowers Congress "[t]o promote theProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited

Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to theirrespective Writings and Discoveries." Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8.
Congress first exercised this authority in 1790, when it pro-vided for the issuance of "letters patent," Act of Apr. 10,
1790, ch. 7, $ 1, 1 Stat. 109, which, like their modern counter-parts, granted inventors "the right to exclude others from
making, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing the pat-ented invention," in exchange for full disclosure of an invention, H. Schwartz, Patent Law and Practice 1, 33 (2d ed.1995). It has long been understood that a patent must describe the exact scope of an invention and its manufacture to"secure to [the patentee] all to which he is entitled, [and] to
apprise the public of what is still open to them." McClainv.

Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419, 424 (1891). Under the modernAmerican system, these objectives are served by two distinct elements of a patent document. First, it contains aspecification describing the invention "in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in theart . . . to make and use the same." 35 U. S. C. $ 112; see
also 3 E. Lipscomb, Walker on Patents $ 10:1, pp. 183-184 (3ded. 1985) (Lipscomb) (listing the requirements for a specification). Second, a patent includes one or more "claims,"which "particularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m] the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention."
35 U. S. C. $ 112. "A claim covers and secures a process, amachine, a manufacture, a composition of matter, or a design,

but never the function or result of either, nor the scientific
explanation of their operation." 6 Lipscomb $ 21:17, at 315-316. The claim "define[s] the scope of a patent grant," 3

id.,

noncritical change," Schwartz, supra, at 82.1 In this opinion, the word "claim" is used only in this sense peculiar to
patent law.

Characteristically, patent lawsuits charge what is known
as infringement, Schwartz, supra, at 75, and rest on allegations that the defendant "without authority ma[de], use[d] or
[sold the] patented invention, within the United States during the term of the patent therefor . . . ." 35 U. S. C. $ 271(a).
Victory in an infringement suit requires a finding that the
patent claim "covers the alleged infringer's product or process," which in turn necessitates a determination of "what the
words in the claim mean." Schwartz, supra, at 80; see also
3 Lipscomb $ 11:2, at 288-290.

Petitioner in this infringement suit, Markman, owns
United States Reissue Patent No. 33,054 for his "Inventory
Control and Reporting System for Drycleaning Stores."
The patent describes a system that can monitor and report
the status, location, and movement of clothing in a drycleaning establishment. The Markman system consists of
a keyboard and data processor to generate written records
for each transaction, including a bar code readable by optical detectors operated by employees, who log the progress
of clothing through the dry-cleaning process. Respondent
Westview's product also includes a keyboard and processor,
and it lists charges for the dry-cleaning services on bar-coded
tickets that can be read by portable optical detectors.

Markman brought an infringement suit against Westview
and Althon Enterprises, an operator of dry-cleaning estab1 Thus, for example, a claim for a ceiling fan with three blades attached
to a solid rod connected to a motor would not only cover fans that take
precisely this form, but would also cover a similar fan that includes some
additional feature, e. g., such a fan with a cord or switch for turning it on
and off, and may cover a product deviating from the core design in some
noncritical way, e. g., a three-bladed ceiling fan with blades attached to a
hollow rod connected to a motor. H. Schwartz, Patent Law and Practice
81-82 (2d ed. 1995).

Opinion of the Court
lishments using Westview's products (collectively, Westview). Westview responded that Markman's patent is not
infringed by its system because the latter functions merely
to record an inventory of receivables by tracking invoices
and transaction totals, rather than to record and track an
inventory of articles of clothing. Part of the dispute hinged
upon the meaning of the word "inventory," a term found in
Markman's independent claim 1, which states that Markman's product can "maintain an inventory total" and "detect
and localize spurious additions to inventory." The case was
tried before a jury, which heard, among others, a witness
produced by Markman who testified about the meaning of
the claim language.

After the jury compared the patent to Westview's device,
it found an infringement of Markman's independent claim 1
and dependent claim 10.2 The District Court nevertheless
granted Westview's deferred motion for judgment as a matter of law, one of its reasons being that the term "inventory"
in Markman's patent encompasses "both cash inventory and
the actual physical inventory of articles of clothing." 772
F. Supp. 1535, 1537-1538 (ED Pa. 1991). Under the trial
court's construction of the patent, the production, sale, or
use of a tracking system for dry cleaners would not infringe
Markman's patent unless the product was capable of tracking
articles of clothing throughout the cleaning process and generating reports about their status and location. Since Westview's system cannot do these things, the District Court directed a verdict on the ground that Westview's device does
not have the "means to maintain an inventory total" and thus
cannot " `detect and localize spurious additions to inventory
as well as spurious deletions therefrom,' " as required by
claim 1. Id., at 1537.

2 Dependent claim 10 specifies that, in the invention of claim 1, the input
device is an alpha-numeric keyboard in which single keys may be used to
enter the attributes of the items in question.

376 MARKMAN v. WESTVIEW INSTRUMENTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Markman appealed, arguing it was error for the DistrictCourt to substitute its construction of the disputed claim

term `inventory' for the construction the jury had presum-ably given it. The United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit affirmed, holding the interpretation of claimterms to be the exclusive province of the court and the Seventh Amendment to be consistent with that conclusion. 52F. 3d 967 (1995). Markman sought our review on each point,
and we granted certiorari. 515 U. S. 1192 (1995). We nowaffirm.

II
The Seventh Amendment provides that "[i]n Suits at com-mon law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty

dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved . . . ."U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. Since Justice Story's day,

UnitedStates v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas. 745, 750 (No. 16,750) (CC Mass.

1812), we have understood that "[t]he right of trial by jurythus preserved is the right which existed under the English
common law when the Amendment was adopted." Balti-more & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U. S. 654, 657
(1935). In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this"historical test," Wolfram, The Constitutional History of the
Seventh Amendment, 57 Minn. L. Rev. 639, 640-643 (1973),we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action
that either was tried at law at the time of the founding or isat least analogous to one that was, see,

e. g., Tull v. UnitedStates, 481 U. S. 412, 417 (1987). If the action in question

belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the partic-ular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve
the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.See

infra, at 377-378.3

3 Our formulations of the historical test do not deal with the possibility
of conflict between actual English common-law practice and American assumptions about what that practice was, or between English and American practices at the relevant time. No such complications arise in this
case.

Opinion of the Court

A
As to the first issue, going to the character of the cause of
action, "[t]he form of our analysis is familiar. `First we compare the statutory action to 18th-century actions brought in
the courts of England prior to the merger of the courts of
law and equity.' " Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492
U. S. 33, 42 (1989) (citation omitted). Equally familiar is the
descent of today's patent infringement action from the infringement actions tried at law in the 18th century, and there
is no dispute that infringement cases today must be tried to
a jury, as their predecessors were more than two centuries
ago. See, e. g., Bramah v. Hardcastle, 1 Carp. P. C. 168
(K. B. 1789).

B

This conclusion raises the second question, whether a particular issue occurring within a jury trial (here the construction of a patent claim) is itself necessarily a jury issue, the
guarantee being essential to preserve the right to a jury's
resolution of the ultimate dispute. In some instances the
answer to this second question may be easy because of clear
historical evidence that the very subsidiary question was so
regarded under the English practice of leaving the issue for
a jury. But when, as here, the old practice provides no clear
answer, see infra, at 378-380, we are forced to make a judgment about the scope of the Seventh Amendment guarantee
without the benefit of any foolproof test.

The Court has repeatedly said that the answer to the second question "must depend on whether the jury must shoulder this responsibility as necessary to preserve the `substance of the common-law right of trial by jury.' " Tull v.
United States, supra, at 426 (emphasis added) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 157 (1973)); see also Baltimore & Carolina Line, supra, at 657. " ` "Only those incidents which are regarded as fundamental, as inherent in and
of the essence of the system of trial by jury, are placed be517us2$45M 02-19-99 11:08:03 PAGES OPINPGT

yond the reach of the legislature." ' " Tull v. United States,
supra, at 426 (citations omitted); see also Galloway v. United
States, 319 U. S. 372, 392 (1943).

The "substance of the common-law right" is, however, a
pretty blunt instrument for drawing distinctions. We have
tried to sharpen it, to be sure, by reference to the distinction
between substance and procedure. See Baltimore & Carolina Line, supra, at 657; see also Galloway v. United States,
supra, at 390-391; Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 309
(1920); Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., 165
U. S. 593, 596 (1897); but see Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486
U. S. 717, 727 (1988). We have also spoken of the line as one
between issues of fact and law. See Baltimore & Carolina
Line, supra, at 657; see also Ex parte Peterson, supra, at
310; Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., supra,
at 597; but see Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273,
288 (1982).

But the sounder course, when available, is to classify a
mongrel practice (like construing a term of art following receipt of evidence) by using the historical method, much as
we do in characterizing the suits and actions within which
they arise. Where there is no exact antecedent, the best
hope lies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones
whose allocation to court or jury we do know, cf. Baltimore & Carolina Line, supra, at 659, 660; Dimick v. Schiedt,
293 U. S. 474, 477, 482 (1935), seeking the best analogy we
can draw between an old and the new, see Tull v. United
States, supra, at 420-421 (we must search the English common law for "appropriate analogies" rather than a "precisely
analogous common-law cause of action").

American states," Lutz, Evolution of the Claims of U. S. Patents, 20 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 134 (1938), and we have accordingly
found no direct antecedent of modern claim construction in
the historical sources. Claim practice did not achieve statutory recognition until the passage of the Act of July 4, 1836,
ch. 357, $ 6, 5 Stat. 119, and inclusion of a claim did not become a statutory requirement until 1870, Act of July 8, 1870,
ch. 230, $ 26, 16 Stat. 201; see 1 A. Deller, Patent Claims $ 4,
p. 9 (2d ed. 1971). Although, as one historian has observed,
as early as 1850 "judges were . . . beginning to express more
frequently the idea that in seeking to ascertain the invention `claimed' in a patent the inquiry should be limited to
interpreting the summary, or `claim,' " Lutz, supra, at 145,
"[t]he idea that the claim is just as important if not more important than the description and drawings did not develop
until the Act of 1870 or thereabouts." Deller, supra, $ 4,
at 9.

At the time relevant for Seventh Amendment analogies,
in contrast, it was the specification, itself a relatively new
development, H. Dutton, The Patent System and Inventive Activity During the Industrial Revolution, 1750-1852,
pp. 75-76 (1984), that represented the key to the patent.
Thus, patent litigation in that early period was typified by
so-called novelty actions, testing whether "any essential part
of [the patent had been] disclosed to the public before," Huddart v. Grimshaw, Dav. Pat. Cas. 265, 298 (K. B. 1803), and
"enablement" cases, in which juries were asked to determine
whether the specification described the invention well
enough to allow members of the appropriate trade to reproduce it, see, e. g., Arkwright v. Nightingale, Dav. Pat. Cas.
37, 60 (C. P. 1785).

The closest 18th-century analogue of modern claim construction seems, then, to have been the construction of
specifications, and as to that function the mere smattering

Opinion of the Court
of patent cases that we have from this period 4 shows noestablished jury practice sufficient to support an argument

by analogy that today's construction of a claim should be aguaranteed jury issue. Few of the case reports even touch
upon the proper interpretation of disputed terms in the spec-ifications at issue, see,

e. g., Bramah v. Hardcastle, 1 Carp.P. C. 168 (K. B. 1789); King v. Else, 1 Carp. P. C. 103, Dav.

Pat. Cas. 144 (K. B. 1785); Dollond's Case, 1 Carp. P. C. 28(C. P. 1758); Administrators of Calthorp v. Waymans, 3 Keb.
710, 84 Eng. Rep. 966 (K. B. 1676), and none demonstratesthat the definition of such a term was determined by the
jury.5 This absence of an established practice should notsurprise us, given the primitive state of jury patent practice

at the end of the 18th century, when juries were still new tothe field. Although by 1791 more than a century had passed
since the enactment of the Statute of Monopolies, which pro4 Before the turn of the century, "no more than twenty-two [reported]
cases came before the superior courts of London." H. Dutton, The Patent
System and Inventive Activity During the Industrial Revolution, 1750-
1852, p. 71 (1984).

5 Markman relies heavily upon Justice Buller's notes of Lord Mansfield's

instructions in Liardet v. Johnson (K. B. 1778), in 1 J. Oldham, The Mansfield Manuscripts and the Growth of English Law in the Eighteenth Century 748 (1992). Liardet was an enablement case about the invention of
stucco, in which a defendant asserted that the patent was invalid because
it did not fully describe the appropriate method for producing the substance. Even setting aside concerns about the accuracy of the summary
of the jury instructions provided for this case from outside the established
reports, see 1 Oldham, supra, at 752, n. 11, it does not show that juries
construed disputed terms in a patent. From its ambiguous references,
e. g., 1 Oldham, supra, at 756 ("[Lord Mansfield] left to the jury 1st, on all
objections made to exactness, certainty and propriety of the Specification, & whether any workman could make it by [the Specification]"), we
cannot infer the existence of an established practice, cf. Galloway v.
United States, 319 U. S. 372, 392 (1943) (expressing concern regarding the
"uncertainty and the variety of conclusions which follows from an effort
at purely historical accuracy"), especially when, as here, the inference is
undermined by evidence that judges, rather than jurors, ordinarily construed written documents at the time. See infra, at 381-383.

vided that the validity of any monopoly should be deter-mined in accordance with the common law, patent litigation

had remained within the jurisdiction of the Privy Counciluntil 1752 and hence without the option of a jury trial. E.
Walterscheid, Early Evolution of the United States PatentLaw: Antecedents (Part 3), 77 J. Pat. & Tm. Off. Soc. 771,
771-776 (1995). Indeed, the state of patent law in thecommon-law courts before 1800 led one historian to observe
that "the reported cases are destitute of any decision of im-portance . . . . At the end of the eighteenth century, therefore, the Common Law Judges were left to pick up the
threads of the principles of law without the aid of recent and
reliable precedents." Hulme, On the Consideration of thePatent Grant, Past and Present, 13 L. Q. Rev. 313, 318 (1897).

Earlier writers expressed similar discouragement at patentlaw's amorphous character,

6 and, as late as the 1830's, English commentators were irked by enduring confusion in the
field. See Dutton, supra, at 69-70.

Markman seeks to supply what the early case reports lackin so many words by relying on decisions like

Turner v. Winter, 1 T. R. 602, 99 Eng. Rep. 1274 (K. B. 1787), and Arkwright v. Nightingale, Dav. Pat. Cas. 37 (C. P. 1785), to argue
that the 18th-century juries must have acted as definers ofpatent terms just to reach the verdicts we know they rendered in patent cases turning on enablement or novelty.But the conclusion simply does not follow. There is no more
reason to infer that juries supplied plenary interpretation of
written instruments in patent litigation than in other casesimplicating the meaning of documentary terms, and we do

know that in other kinds of cases during this period judges,

Opinion of the Court
not juries, ordinarily construed written documents.7 The
probability that the judges were doing the same thing in the
patent litigation of the time is confirmed by the fact that as
soon as the English reports did begin to describe the construction of patent documents, they show the judges construing the terms of the specifications. See Bovill v. Moore,
Dav. Pat. Cas. 361, 399, 404 (C. P. 1816) ( judge submits question of novelty to the jury only after explaining some of the
language and "stat[ing] in what terms the specification
runs"); cf. Russell v. Cowley & Dixon, Webs. Pat. Cas. 457,
467-470 (Exch. 1834) (construing the terms of the specification in reviewing a verdict); Haworth v. Hardcastle, Webs.
Pat. Cas. 480, 484-485 (1834) (same). This evidence is in
fact buttressed by cases from this Court; when they first
reveal actual practice, the practice revealed is of the judge
construing the patent. See, e. g., Winans v. New York &
Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88, 100 (1859); Winans v. Denmead, 15

ED Pa. 1849). These indications of our patent practice are
the more impressive for being all of a piece with what we
know about the analogous contemporary practice of inter7 See, e. g., Devlin, Jury Trial of Complex Cases: English Practice at the
Time of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 43, 75 (1980); Weiner,
The Civil Jury Trial and the Law-Fact Distinction, 54 Calif. L. Rev. 1867,
1932 (1966). For example, one historian observed that it was generally
the practice of judges in the late 18th century "to keep the construction
of writings out of the jury's hands and reserve it for themselves," a "safeguard" designed to prevent a jury from "constru[ing] or refin[ing] it at
pleasure." 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2461, p. 194 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed.
1981) (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). The absence of any established practice supporting Markman's view is also shown
by the disagreement between Justices Willis and Buller, reported in Macbeath v. Haldimand, 1 T. R. 173, 180-182, 99 Eng. Rep. 1036, 1040-1041
(K. B. 1786), as to whether juries could ever construe written documents
when their meaning was disputed.

preting terms within a land patent, where it fell to the judge,not the jury, to construe the words.

Losing, then, on the contention that juries generally hadinterpretive responsibilities during the 18th century, Markman seeks a different anchor for analogy in the more modestcontention that even if judges were charged with construing most terms in the patent, the art of defining terms ofart employed in a specification fell within the province of

the jury. Again, however, Markman has no authority fromthe period in question, but relies instead on the later case
of Neilson v. Harford, Webs. Pat. Cas. 328 (Exch. 1841).There, an exchange between the judge and the lawyers indicated that although the construction of a patent was ordi-narily for the court, id., at 349 (Alderson, B.), judges should
"leav[e] the question of words of art to the jury," id., at 350(Alderson, B.); see also id., at 370 ( judgment of the court);
Hill v. Evans, 4 De. G. F. & J. 288, 293-294, 45 Eng. Rep.1195, 1197 (Ch. 1862). Without, however, in any way disparaging the weight to which Baron Alderson's view is entitled,the most we can say is that an English report more than 70
years after the time that concerns us indicates an exceptionto what probably had been occurring earlier.

"With regard to the second part of this objection, that which claims for
the jury the construction of the patent, we remark that the patent itself
must be taken as evidence of its meaning; that, like other written instruments, it must be interpreted as a whole . . . and the legal deductions
drawn therefrom must be conformable with the scope and purpose of the
entire document. This construction and these deductions we hold to be
within the exclusive province of the court."

9 In explaining that judges generally construed all terms in a written

document at the end of the 18th century, one historian observed that "[i]nterpretation by local usage for example (today the plainest case of legitimate deviation from the normal standard) was still but making its way."

Opinion of the Court
Markman's inference that this exceptional practice existed in1791 there is at best only a possibility that it did, and for

anything more than a possibility we have found no schol-arly authority.

III
Since evidence of common-law practice at the time of theframing does not entail application of the Seventh Amendment's jury guarantee to the construction of the claim docu-ment, we must look elsewhere to characterize this determination of meaning in order to allocate it as between court orjury. We accordingly consult existing precedent

10 and consider both the relative interpretive skills of judges and juriesand the statutory policies that ought to be furthered by the

allocation. A

The two elements of a simple patent case, construing thepatent and determining whether infringement occurred,
were characterized by the former patent practitioner, JusticeCurtis.

11 "The first is a question of law, to be determined

by the court, construing the letters-patent, and the descrip-tion of the invention and specification of claim annexed to

them. The second is a question of fact, to be submitted toa jury."

Winans v. Denmead, supra, at 338; see Winans v.

whether our conclusion that the Seventh Amendment does not require
terms of art in patent claims to be submitted to the jury supports a similar
result in other types of cases.

10 Because we conclude that our precedent supports classifying the question as one for the court, we need not decide either the extent to which
the Seventh Amendment can be said to have crystallized a law/fact distinction, cf. Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 310 (1920); Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., 165 U. S. 593, 597 (1897), or whether post1791 precedent classifying an issue as one of fact would trigger the
protections of the Seventh Amendment if (unlike this case) there were no
more specific reason for decision.

11 See 1 A Memoir of Benjamin Robbins Curtis, L. L. D., 84 (B. Curtis

ed. 1879); cf. O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 63 (1854) (noting his involvement in a patent case).

Opinion of the Court
New York & Erie R. Co., supra, at 100; Hogg v. Emerson,supra, at 484; cf. Parker v. Hulme, supra, at 1140.

In arguing for a different allocation of responsibility forthe first question, Markman relies primarily on two cases,
Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812 (1870), and Tucker v. Spalding, 13 Wall. 453 (1872). These are said to show that evi-dence of the meaning of patent terms was offered to 19thcentury juries, and thus to imply that the meaning of adocumentary term was a jury issue whenever it was subject
to evidentiary proof. That is not what Markman's casesshow, however.

In order to resolve the Bischoff suit implicating the con-struction of rival patents, we considered "whether the court
below was bound to compare the two specifications, and toinstruct the jury, as a matter of law, whether the inventions
therein described were, or were not, identical." 9 Wall., at813 (statement of the case). We said it was not bound to do
that, on the ground that investing the court with so disposi-tive a role would improperly eliminate the jury's function in
answering the ultimate question of infringement. On thatultimate issue, expert testimony had been admitted on "the
nature of the various mechanisms or manufactures describedin the different patents produced, and as to the identity or
diversity between them." Id., at 814. Although the jury'sconsideration of that expert testimony in resolving the question of infringement was said to impinge upon the well-established principle "that it is the province of the court,
and not the jury, to construe the meaning of documentaryevidence,"

id., at 815, we decided that it was not so. Wesaid:

"[T]he specifications . . . profess to describe mechanismsand complicated machinery, chemical compositions and
other manufactured products, which have their exist-ence in pais, outside of the documents themselves; and
which are commonly described by terms of the art ormystery to which they respectively belong; and these

386 MARKMAN v. WESTVIEW INSTRUMENTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
descriptions and terms of art often require peculiarknowledge and education to understand them aright . . . .

Indeed, the whole subject-matter of a patent is an em-bodied conception outside of the patent itself . . . . This
outward embodiment of the terms contained in the pat-ent is the thing invented, and is to be properly sought,
like the explanation of all latent ambiguities arisingfrom the description of external things, by evidence

in pais." Ibid.
Bischoff does not then, as Markman contends, hold thatthe use of expert testimony about the meaning of terms of

art requires the judge to submit the question of their con-struction to the jury. It is instead a case in which the Court
drew a line between issues of document interpretation andproduct identification, and held that expert testimony was
properly presented to the jury on the latter, ultimate issue,whether the physical objects produced by the patent were
identical. The Court did not see the decision as bearingupon the appropriate treatment of disputed terms. As the
opinion emphasized, the Court's "view of the case is not in-tended to, and does not, trench upon the doctrine that the
construction of written instruments is the province of thecourt alone.

It is not the construction of the instrument,
but the character of the thing invented, which is sought inquestions of identity and diversity of inventions." Id., at

816 (emphasis added). Tucker, the second case proffered byMarkman, is to the same effect. Its reasoning rested expressly on Bischoff, and it just as clearly noted that in ad-dressing the ultimate issue of mixed fact and law, it was for
the court to "lay down to the jury the law which should gov-ern them."

Tucker, supra, at 455.12

12 We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's heavy reliance upon the decision of Justice Story on circuit in Washburn v. Gould, 29 F. Cas. 312 (No.
17,214) (CC Mass. 1844). Although he wrote that "[t]he jury are to judge
of the meaning of words of art, and technical phrases," id., at 325, he did
so in describing the decision in Neilson v. Harford, Webs. Pat. Cas. 328

387Cite as: 517 U. S. 370 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
If the line drawn in these two opinions is a fine one, it isone that the Court has drawn repeatedly in explaining the

respective roles of the jury and judge in patent cases,13 andone understood by commentators writing in the aftermath
of the cases Markman cites. Walker, for example, read
Bischoff as holding that the question of novelty is not de-cided by a construction of the prior patent, "but depends

rather upon the outward embodiment of the terms containedin the [prior patent]; and that such outward embodiment is to
be properly sought, like the explanation of latent ambiguitiesarising from the description of external things, by evidence
in pais." A. Walker, Patent Laws $ 75, p. 68 (3d ed. 1895).He also emphasized in the same treatise that matters of
claim construction, even those aided by expert testimony, arequestions for the court:

"Questions of construction are questions of law for thejudge, not questions of fact for the jury. As it cannot
be expected, however, that judges will always possessthe requisite knowledge of the meaning of the terms of
art or science used in letters patent, it often becomesnecessary that they should avail themselves of the light
furnished by experts relevant to the significance of suchwords and phrases. The judges are not, however,
obliged to blindly follow such testimony." Id., $ 189, at173 (footnotes omitted).

Virtually the same description of the court's use of evidencein its interpretive role was set out in another contemporary
treatise:

(Exch. 1841), which we discuss, supra, at 383, and, whether or not he
agreed with Neilson, he stated, "[b]ut I do not proceed upon this ground."
29 F. Cas., at 325.

388 MARKMAN v. WESTVIEW INSTRUMENTS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
"The duty of interpreting letters-patent has been com-mitted to the courts. A patent is a legal instrument, to

be construed, like other legal instruments, according toits tenor. . . . Where technical terms are used, or where
the qualities of substances or operations mentioned orany similar data necessary to the comprehension of the
language of the patent are unknown to the judge, thetestimony of witnesses may be received upon these subjects, and any other means of information be employed.
But in the actual interpretation of the patent the courtproceeds upon its own responsibility, as an arbiter of

the law, giving to the patent its true and final character and force." 2 W. Robinson, Law of Patents $ 732,pp. 481-483 (1890) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).

In sum, neither Bischoff nor Tucker indicates that juries re-solved the meaning of terms of art in construing a patent,
and neither case undercuts Justice Curtis's authority.

B
Where history and precedent provide no clear answers,functional considerations also play their part in the choice

between judge and jury to define terms of art. We said in
Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985), that when an issue"falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a

simple historical fact, the fact/law distinction at times hasturned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound
administration of justice, one judicial actor is better posi-tioned than another to decide the issue in question." So it
turns out here, for judges, not juries, are the better suitedto find the acquired meaning of patent terms.

The construction of written instruments is one of thosethings that judges often do and are likely to do better than
jurors unburdened by training in exegesis. Patent con-struction in particular "is a special occupation, requiring, like
all others, special training and practice. The judge, fromhis training and discipline, is more likely to give a proper

Opinion of the Court
interpretation to such instruments than a jury; and he is,therefore, more likely to be right, in performing such a duty,

than a jury can be expected to be." Parker v. Hulme, 18 F.Cas., at 1140. Such was the understanding nearly a century
and a half ago, and there is no reason to weigh the respective
strengths of judge and jury differently in relation to themodern claim; quite the contrary, for "the claims of patents

have become highly technical in many respects as the resultof special doctrines relating to the proper form and scope of
claims that have been developed by the courts and the Pat-ent Office." Woodward, Definiteness and Particularity in
Patent Claims, 46 Mich. L. Rev. 755, 765 (1948).

Markman would trump these considerations with his argument that a jury should decide a question of meaning peculiar to a trade or profession simply because the question is
a subject of testimony requiring credibility determinations,
which are the jury's forte. It is, of course, true that credibility judgments have to be made about the experts who testify
in patent cases, and in theory there could be a case in which a
simple credibility judgment would suffice to choose between
experts whose testimony was equally consistent with a patent's internal logic. But our own experience with document
construction leaves us doubtful that trial courts will run into
many cases like that. In the main, we expect, any credibility determinations will be subsumed within the necessarily
sophisticated analysis of the whole document, required by
the standard construction rule that a term can be defined
only in a way that comports with the instrument as a whole.
See Bates v. Coe, 98 U. S. 31, 38 (1878); 6 Lipscomb $ 21:40,
at 393; 2 Robinson, supra, $ 734, at 484; Woodward, supra, at

Chemicals Co., 315 U. S. 668, 678 (1942); cf. 6 Lipscomb

$ 21:40, at 393. Thus, in these cases a jury's capabilities to
evaluate demeanor, cf. Miller, supra, at 114, 117, to sense
the "mainsprings of human conduct," Commissioner v.
Duberstein, 363 U. S. 278, 289 (1960), or to reflect community

Opinion of the Court
standards, United States v. McConney, 728 F. 2d 1195, 1204(CA9 1984) (en banc), are much less significant than a trained

ability to evaluate the testimony in relation to the overallstructure of the patent. The decisionmaker vested with the
task of construing the patent is in the better position to as-certain whether an expert's proposed definition fully comports with the specification and claims and so will preservethe patent's internal coherence. We accordingly think there
is sufficient reason to treat construction of terms of art likemany other responsibilities that we cede to a judge in the
normal course of trial, notwithstanding its evidentiaryunderpinnings.

C
Finally, we see the importance of uniformity in the treat-ment of a given patent as an independent reason to allocate

all issues of construction to the court. As we noted in General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U. S. 364, 369(1938), "[t]he limits of a patent must be known for the protection of the patentee, the encouragement of the inventive ge-nius of others and the assurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated ultimately to the public." Otherwise,a "zone of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation
may enter only at the risk of infringement claims would dis-courage invention only a little less than unequivocal foreclosure of the field," United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith
Co., 317 U. S. 228, 236 (1942), and "[t]he public [would] bedeprived of rights supposed to belong to it, without being

clearly told what it is that limits these rights." Merrill v.Yeomans, 94 U. S. 568, 573 (1877). It was just for the sake
of such desirable uniformity that Congress created the Courtof Appeals for the Federal Circuit as an exclusive appellate
court for patent cases, H. R. Rep. No. 97-312, pp. 20-23(1981), observing that increased uniformity would
"strengthen the United States patent system in such a wayas to foster technological growth and industrial innovation."
Id., at 20.

391Cite as: 517 U. S. 370 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Uniformity would, however, be ill served by submittingissues of document construction to juries. Making them

jury issues would not, to be sure, necessarily leave eviden-tiary questions of meaning wide open in every new court
in which a patent might be litigated, for principles of issuepreclusion would ordinarily foster uniformity. Cf.

Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation,

402 U. S. 313 (1971). But whereas issue preclusion could notbe asserted against new and independent infringement defendants even within a given jurisdiction, treating interpre-tive issues as purely legal will promote (though it will not
guarantee) intrajurisdictional certainty through the appli-cation of

stare decisis on those questions not yet subjectto interjurisdictional uniformity under the authority of the

single appeals court. * * *

Accordingly, we hold that the interpretation of the word"inventory" in this case is an issue for the judge, not the
jury, and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit.

It is so ordered.

HOLLY FARMS CORP. et al. v. NATIONAL LABORRELATIONS BOARD

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 95-210. Argued February 21, 1996--Decided April 23, 1996
Respondent National Labor Relations Board (Board) approved a bargaining unit at the Wilkesboro, North Carolina, processing plant of petitioner Holly Farms Corporation, a vertically integrated poultry producer. The approved unit included workers described as "live-haul"
crews--teams of chicken catchers, forklift operators, and truckdrivers,
who collect for slaughter chickens raised as broilers by independent contract growers, and transport the birds to the processing plant. On
Holly Farms' petition for review, the Fourth Circuit enforced the Board's
order. The court held that the Board's classification of the live-haul
workers as "employee[s]" protected by the National Labor Relations
Act (NLRA or Act), rather than "agricultural laborer[s]" excluded from
the Act's coverage by $ 2(3) of the NLRA, rested on a reasonable interpretation of the Act and was consistent with the Board's prior decisions
and with the Eighth Circuit's case law.

Held: The Board reasonably aligned the live-haul crews with Holly Farms'

processing operations, typing them covered "employee[s]," not exempt
"agricultural laborer[s]"; therefore, the Fourth Circuit properly deferred
to the Board's determination. Pp. 397-409.

(a) The term "agricultural laborer," as used in $ 2(3) of the NLRA,
derives its meaning from the definition of "agriculture" supplied by $ 3(f)
of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). This definition includes farming in both a primary sense, which includes "the raising . . .
of poultry," and a secondary sense, which encompasses practices "performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with
such farming operations." When a statutory prescription is not free
from ambiguity, the Board must choose between conflicting reasonable
interpretations. Courts, in turn, must respect the judgment of the
agency empowered to apply the law to varying fact patterns. Bayside
Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRB, 429 U. S. 298, 304. Pp. 397-399.

(b) The Court confronts no contention that the live-haul crews are
engaged in primary agriculture. Thus, the sole question the Court addresses and decides is whether the chicken catchers, forklift operators,
and truckdrivers are engaged in secondary agriculture. The live-haul
activities are not "performed by a farmer." When an integrated poul517US2$46z 02-07-99 17:00:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
try producer contracts with independent growers for the care and feeding of chicks hatched in the producer's hatcheries, the producer's status
as a farmer ends with respect to those chicks. Bayside, 429 U. S., at
302, n. 9. The producer does not resume farmer status when its livehaul employees arrive on the independent farms to collect broilers for
carriage to slaughter and processing. This conclusion entirely disposes
of the contention that the truckdrivers are employed in secondary agriculture, for Holly Farms acknowledges that these crew members do not
work "on a farm." Pp. 399-401.

(c) The more substantial question is whether the catching and loading
of broilers qualifies as work performed "on a farm as an incident to or in
conjunction with" the independent growers' farming operations. Holly
Farms' position that this work is incident to the raising of poultry is a
plausible, but not an inevitable, construction of FLSA $ 3(f). Hence, a
reviewing court must examine the Board's position only for its reasonableness as an interpretation of the governing legislation. P. 401.

(d) The Board concluded that the collection of broilers for slaughter,
although performed "on a farm," is not incidental to farming operations.
Rather, the Board determined, the live-haul crews' work is tied to Holly
Farms' processing operations. This is a reasonable interpretation of
the statute. Once the broilers have grown on the farm for seven weeks,
the growers' contractual obligation to raise the birds ends, and the work
of the live-haul crew begins. The growers do not assist the crews in
catching or loading the chickens, and the crews play no role in the growers' performance of their contractual undertakings. Furthermore, the
live-haul employees all work out of the Wilkesboro processing plant,
begin and end each shift by punching a timeclock at the plant, and are
functionally integrated with other processing-plant employees. It was
also sensible for the Board to home in on the status of the crews' employer. Pp. 401-404.

(e) The Board's decision adheres to longstanding NLRB precedent,
see, e. g., Imco Poultry, Div. of Int'l Multifoods Corp., 202 N. L. R. B.
259, 260, and is supported by the construction of FLSA $ 3(f) by the
Department of Labor, the agency responsible for administering the
FLSA. The Department's interpretative regulations accord with the
Board's conclusion that the live-haul crews do not engage in secondary
farming and further demonstrate that FLSA $ 3(f)'s meaning is not so
plain as to bear only one permissible construction in the context at
hand. Pp. 405-408.

teams of chicken catchers, forklift operators, and truckdriv-ers, who collect for slaughter chickens raised as broilers by
independent contract growers, and transport the birds toHolly Farms' processing plant. Holly Farms maintains that
members of "live-haul" crews are "agricultural laborer[s]," acategory of workers exempt from National Labor Relations

Petitioner Holly Farms Corporation, a wholly owned sub-sidiary of Tyson Foods, Inc., is a vertically integrated poultry

producer headquartered in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.1Holly Farms' activities encompass numerous poultry operations, including hatcheries, a feed mill, an equipment mainte-nance center, and a processing plant.

"Broiler" chickens are birds destined for human food markets.2 Holly Farms hatches broiler chicks at its own hatch-eries, and immediately delivers the chicks to the farms of

independent contractors. The contractors then raise thebirds into full-grown broiler chickens. Holly Farms pays
the contract growers for their services, but retains title tothe broilers and supplies the food and medicine necessary to
their growth.

When the broilers are seven weeks old, Holly Farms sends
its live-haul crews to reclaim the birds and ferry them to the
processing plant for slaughter. The live-haul crews--which
typically comprise nine chicken catchers, one forklift operator, and one live-haul driver--travel in a flat-bed truck from
Holly Farms' processing plant to the farms of the independent growers. At the farms, the chicken catchers enter the
coops, manually capture the broilers, and load them into
cages. The forklift operator lifts the caged chickens onto
the bed of the truck, and the live-haul driver returns the

chickens destined to serve as laying hens. The live-haul workers whose

In 1989, the Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers, Local 391(Union), filed a representation petition with the National

Labor Relations Board (Board or NLRB), seeking an elec-tion in a proposed unit that included live-haul employees
working out of Holly Farms' Wilkesboro processing plant.Over Holly Farms' objection, the Board approved the bargaining unit, ruling that the live-haul workers were "employ-ee[s]" protected by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA
or Act), 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 151 et seq.,rather than "agricultural laborer[s]" excluded from the Act's
coverage by $ 2(3) of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3). See
Holly Farms Corp., 311 N. L. R. B. 273, 273, n. 4, 284 (1993).3After further proceedings not relevant here, the Board ordered the corporation to bargain with the Union as the rep-resentative of the unit. Id., at 285-286.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitenforced the Board's order. The court held that the Board's
classification of the live-haul workers as "employee[s],"rather than "agricultural laborer[s]," rested "on a reasonable
interpretation of the Act." 48 F. 3d 1360, 1372 (1995). TheBoard's reading, the court added, was consistent with the

400 HOLLY FARMS CORP. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
ent growers, who raise Holly Farms' broiler chickens on theirown farms, are engaged in primary agriculture. But we

confront no contention that Holly Farms' live-haul employeesare themselves engaged in raising poultry.

7 Thus, the only

question we resolve is whether the chicken catchers, forkliftoperators, and truckdrivers are engaged in

secondary agri-culture--that is, practices "performed by a farmer or on a

farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farmingoperations." 29 U. S. C. $ 203(f).

We take up, initially, the "performed by a farmer" strandof FLSA $ 3(f ). We do not labor over the point, for our decision in Bayside securely leads us to the conclusion that thelive-haul activities are not performed "by a farmer." In
Bayside, we considered the application of $ 3(f)'s "by afarmer" specification to integrated agricultural companies
that contract out farming work. We upheld the Board's re-jection of the contention that "all of the activity on a contract
farm should be regarded as agricultural activity of an inte-grated farmer" such as Holly Farms. 429 U. S., at 302.
When an integrated poultry producer "contracts with inde-pendent growers for the care and feeding of [its] chicks, [its]
status as a farmer engaged in raising poultry ends with re-spect to those chicks." Id., at 302, n. 9 (citing Imco Poultry,
202 N. L. R. B., at 260). Accordingly, when the live-haulemployees arrive on the independent farms to collect broilers
for carriage to slaughter and processing, Holly Farms doesnot resume its status as "farmer" with respect to those birds,
the status Holly Farms had weeks before, when the birds

7 Holly Farms, it is true, ultimately argues that the catching and loading
of broilers slated for slaughter constitute primary agriculture because
those activities are best viewed as the "harvesting" of chickens. See
Brief for Petitioners 29-30. But Holly Farms failed to advance this argument before the Court of Appeals, and it did not home in on this contention
in its petition for certiorari. Because we "generally do not address arguments that were not the basis for the decision below," Matsushita Elec.
Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367, 379, n. 5 (1996), we decline to
entertain Holly Farms' primary farming argument.

were hatched in its hatcheries. This conclusion, we note,entirely disposes of the contention that the truckdrivers are

employed in secondary agriculture, for Holly Farms acknowledges that these crew members do not work "on a farm."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.

We turn, now, to the nub of the case for the chicken catchers and forklift operators: the "on a farm" strand of FLSA

$ 3(f ).

A

Holly Farms argues that under the plain language of the
statute, the catching and loading of broilers qualifies as work
performed "on a farm as an incident to" the raising of poultry. The corporation emphasizes that $ 3(f) of the FLSA
enumerates "preparation for market" and "delivery to storage or to market" among activities that count as "agriculture." The live-haul employees' work, Holly Farms concludes, thus falls within the domain of the FLSA exemption
and, accordingly, enjoys no NLRA protection.

We find Holly Farms' position to be a plausible, but not
an inevitable, construction of $ 3(f). Hence, we turn to the
Board's position, examining only its reasonableness as an
interpretation of the governing legislation.

B
While agreeing that the chicken catchers and forklift operators work "on a farm," the Board contends that their catch
and cage work is not incidental to farming operations.
Rather, the work is tied to Holly Farms' slaughtering and
processing operations, activities that do not constitute "farming" under the statute. We conclude, as we next explain,
that the Board's position "is based on a reasonable interpretation of the statute, is consistent with the Board's prior
holdings, and is supported by the Secretary of Labor's construction of $ 3(f)." Bayside, 429 U. S., at 303 (footnotes

402 HOLLY FARMS CORP. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court

1
The Board underscores the statutory words "such farmingoperations." It does not suffice that the alleged secondary

agriculture consists of "preparation for market," or "deliveryto storage or to market," the Board maintains; to qualify for
the statutory exemption, the Board urges, the work must beincidental to, or conjoined with, primary farming operations.

8

As just explained, see supra, at 400-401, at the growingstage in the short life of a broiler, Holly Farms is not involved in primary farming, but the contract growers are.The essential question, then, is whether the live-haul employees' activities are inevitably "incident to or in conjunc-tion with" the farming operations of the independent growers.9 The Board answers this question in the negative.

8 As we noted in Farmers Reservoir & Irrigation Co. v. McComb, 337
U. S. 755 (1949), Congress specifically added the words "or on a farm"
to FLSA $ 3(f) to address some Senators' objections that the exemption
otherwise would not cover "the threshing of wheat or other functions necessary to the farmer if those functions were not performed by the farmer
and his hands, but by separate companies organized for and devoted solely
to that particular job." See id., at 767 (citing 81 Cong. Rec. 7653 (1937)).
Nothing in the Board's decision detracts from the application of $ 3(f),
based on the "on a farm" language, to employees of "separate companies
organized for and devoted solely to" auxiliary work in aid of a farming
enterprise. Hence, the words "on a farm" do the work intended, and are
not redundant. But see post, at 412-413.

Holly Farms presses the argument that its live-haul employees are
analogous to the wheat threshers who figured in FLSA $ 3(f)'s legislative
history. The Board reasonably responds, however, that any worker--
whether a wheat thresher, a feed-haul driver, or a chicken catcher--must
perform his or her work "as an incident to or in conjunction with such
farming operations" in order to fall under the agricultural exemption. If
the chicken catching crews were employed by the independent growers,
rather than by Holly Farms' processing operation, those crews would more
closely resemble the wheat threshers contemplated by the framers of

$ 3(f).

9 To this question, the dissent asserts "there can be only one answer."

Post, at 415. In the dissent's view, activities "directly related to the farming operations that occurred on that very farm"--in this case, removing
chickens from the independent growers' farms to make room for more--

403Cite as: 517 U. S. 392 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
See Imco Poultry, 202 N. L. R. B., at 261 (Because chickencatching crews "have no business relationship with the independent farmers, we conclude that the employees' activitieswere not incidental to the independent farmers' poultry raising operations.").We find the Board's answer reasonable. Once the broilers
have grown on the farm for seven weeks, the growers' con-tractual obligation to raise the birds ends, and the work of
the live-haul crew begins. The record reflects minimaloverlap between the work of the live-haul crew and the independent growers' raising activities. The growers do not as-sist the live-haul crews in catching or loading the chickens;
their only responsibilities are to move certain equipmentfrom the chicken coops prior to the crews' arrival, and to be
present when the crews are on the farms. App. to Brief forFederal Respondent 3a. Nor do the live-haul employees
play any role in the growers' performance of their contrac-tual undertakings.

The record, furthermore, supports the Board's conclusionthat the live-haul crews' activities were conjoined with Holly
Farms' processing operations, rather than with farming.10
inescapably satisfy the statute. Post, at 414-415. FLSA $ 3(f), all agree,
does not apply absent a connection between the activity in question and
the primary farming operations conducted "on a farm." But the statutory language--"incident to or in conjunction with"--does not place beyond rational debate the nature or extent of the required connection. See
29 CFR $ 780.144 (1995) (recognition by the Secretary of Labor that the
"line between practices that are and those that are not performed `as an
incident to or in conjunction with' such farming operations is not susceptible of precise definition").

10 Holly Farms argues, and the dissent agrees, post, at 414, that the

Board's conclusion rests on the assumption that a given activity can be
incidental to one thing only--in this case, either processing or farming,
but not both. At oral argument, counsel for the Board stated that Holly
Farms had not accurately conveyed the Board's position. Tr. of Oral Arg.
33, 38. The Board apparently recognizes, as do we, that an activity can
be incidental to more than one thing. To gain the agricultural exemption, however, farming must be an enterprise to which the activity at
issue is incidental. The relevant question under the statute, therefore,

work as a unit. They all "work out of the processing plant"
in Wilkesboro, App. 22a, located three miles from the hatcheries, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-381, n. 119. Crew members
begin and end each shift by punching a timeclock at the processing plant, id., at A-831 to A-832, and are functionally
integrated with other processing-plant employees, App. 22a.
See also App. to Pet. for Cert. A-396 (correlation between
Holly Farms' slaughter rate and work available for live-haul

"warrant in the record." Bayside, 429 U. S., at 304, n. 14
(citing NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111,
131 (1944)).

We think it sensible, too, that the Board homed in on the
status of the live-haul crews' employer. The employer's status respecting the particular activity at issue accounts for
the Board's determination that Holly Farms' "egg haulers"
(who transport eggs from the laying houses to the hatcheries), and "pullet catchers" (who collect the breeding-destined
birds on the farms of independent growers) rank as "agricultural laborer[s]." As the record shows, the pullet catchers
and egg haulers work in Holly Farms' hatchery operations,
while the live-haul employees--who deal only with broilers--work out of the processing plant. "There is no interchange between these classifications. Broiler haulers do not
haul pullets and pullet haulers do not haul broilers." App.
20a-21a. Accordingly, the Board reasonably aligned the
pullet catchers and egg haulers with Holly Farms' poultryraising operation, and the live-haul employees with the corporation's slaughtering and processing activities.

is whether the work of the live-haul crews qualifies as incidental to
farming.

Opinion of the Court

2
The Board's decision regarding Holly Farms' live-haulcrews adheres to longstanding NLRB precedent. For more

than 23 years, the NLRB has maintained that vertically inte-grated poultry producers' employees who "handl[e] and
transpor[t] chicks on the farms of independent growers onlyafter [the poultry producers'] farming operations have ended
. . . cannot be performing practices incident to, or in conjunc-tion with, [their employer's] farming operations."

Imco
Poultry, 202 N. L. R. B., at 260. Rather, such employees,the Board has repeatedly ruled, perform work "incident to,

or in conjunction with, a separate and distinct business activ-ity of [their employer], i. e., shipping and marketing." Id.,
at 261. See also Draper Valley Farms, Inc., 307 N. L. R. B.,at 1440 ("We think it follows plainly from Imco that the Employer's chicken catchers are not, when working on the farmsof independent growers who have concluded their `raising'

In construing the agricultural laborer exemption, theBoard endeavors to "follow, whenever possible, the interpretations of Section 3(f ) adopted by the Department of Labor,the agency which is charged with the responsibility for and

railroad workers employed by an integrated sugar cane producer were
exempt, as "agricultural laborer[s]," from FLSA overtime provisions.
The employer in Maneja, unlike Holly Farms, grew and cultivated its
sugar cane autonomously, without the aid of independent growers; hence,
we concluded that the activities of the railroad workers, who hauled the
freshly cut cane from the sugar fields to the processing plant, were incidental to the employer's primary farming operations. Id., at 262-263.

Wegman's Food Market, Inc., 236 N. L. R. B. 1062 (1978).The Board has not departed from that endeavor here.

12 The

Department of Labor's regulations do not address the pre-cise situation of the live-haul workers before us, nor are the

regulations free from ambiguity. We agree with the Board,however, that they are consistent with "employee" characterization of the crews that catch grown chickens for car-riage to Holly Farms' processing plant.

On contract arrangements for raising poultry, the Depart-ment of Labor has issued an interpretative regulation, which
we noted in Bayside, 429 U. S., at 303-304, n. 13, as follows:

"Feed dealers and processors sometimes enter intocontractual arrangements with farmers under which the

latter agree to raise to marketable size baby chicks sup-plied by the former who also undertake to furnish all
the required feed and possibly additional items. Typi-cally, the feed dealer or processor retains title to the
chickens until they are sold. Under such an arrange-ment, the activities of the farmers and their employees
in raising the poultry are clearly within section 3(f).The activities of the feed dealer or processor, on the
other hand, are not `raising of poultry,' and employeesengaged in them cannot be considered agricultural employees on that ground. Employees of the feed dealeror processor who perform work on a farm as an incident
to or in conjunction with the raising of poultry on thefarm are employed in `secondary' agriculture (see

12 Coleman v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 629 F. 2d 1077 (CA5 1980), which
determined that chicken catching crews were employed in "agriculture"
under $ 3(f), involved a dispute over applicability of the FLSA's overtime
provisions, not over union representation. Thus, the court in that case
was not required to respect the position of the Board. See id., at 1081,
n. 4. We note, however, that the Coleman court did not advert to the
Secretary of Labor's interpretations of $ 3(f).

F. 2d 553)." 29 CFR $ 780.126 (1995).
This regulation suggests that live-haul crews surely are notengaged in a primary farming operation. The crews could

rank as workers engaged in "secondary" agriculture if they"perform[ed] work on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with the raising of poultry on the farm." Ibid. As wedeveloped earlier, however, see supra, at 402-405, in the
Board's judgment, the crews do not fit that bill. The live-haul crew members perform their work, as the Board sees
it, not "as an incident to" poultry raising by independentgrowers, but "incident to" and "in conjunction with" the
slaughter and processing of chickens at Holly Farms' Wilkes-boro plant. In the Board's words, the crews are tied to
"a separate and distinct business activity," the business ofprocessing poultry for retail sale, see

Imco Poultry, 202N. L. R. B., at 261, not to the anterior work of agriculture.

$ 780.126 (1995), includes a citation to Johnston v. Cotton Producers Assn.,
244 F. 2d, 553, 554 (CA5 1957). That case is readily distinguishable from
the case before us. In Johnston, the Court of Appeals held that an employee of a rural farm supply store was exempt from FLSA minimum
wage and overtime requirements as an agricultural laborer. The supply
store sold baby chicks to farmers, while "retain[ing] title to the chicks
as security for the purchase price and for advances for feed, supplies, or
equipment." Ibid. While the supply store employee caught, cooped, and
loaded chickens onto trucks for delivery to processors--entities independent of the supply store--that employee also "supervise[d] the growing of
chicks by [independent] growers on their farms." Ibid. By contrast, in
this case there is no contention that any of the live-haul employees similarly assist the independent growers in their chick-raising activities.

Thus, 29 CFR $ 780.129 (1995) reiterates that the work "mustbe performed `as an incident to or in conjunction with' the
farming operations," and $ 780.143 adds:

"The fact that a practice performed on a farm is notperformed by or for the farmer is a strong indication

that it is not performed in connection with the farmingoperations there conducted." Ibid.

The same regulation, $ 780.143, further states that, in deter-mining whether a practice is performed "for" a farmer, it is
"highly significant" whether the practice involves propertyto which the farmer has title or for which the farmer otherwise has responsibility. Ibid. Holly Farms retains title tothe chicks and, once the live-haul crew undertakes its catch
and remove operation, the independent grower "divest[s]himself of further responsibility with respect to the product." Ibid.14The Department of Labor candidly observed that "[t]he
line between practices that are and those that are notperformed `as an incident to or in conjunction with' such
farming operations is not susceptible of precise definition."$ 780.144. This acknowledgment accords with our recognition that the meaning of FLSA $ 3(f ) is not so "plain" as tobear only one permissible construction in the context at
hand. IV

In sum, we find persuasive the Board's conclusion that thecollection of broilers for slaughter was an activity serving
14 Petitioners point to 29 CFR $ 780.151(k) (1995), which defines the
FLSA $ 3(f) words "preparation for market" to include "[c]ulling, grading,
cooping, and loading" of poultry. See Brief for Petitioners 23. As another regulation emphasizes, however, " `preparation for market,' like
other practices, must be performed `by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations' in order to be
within [FLSA] section 3(f)." 29 CFR $ 780.150 (1995).

Holly Farms' processing operations, and not Holly Farms'
own or the independent growers' farming operations.
Again, we stress that "the reviewing court's function is limited." Bayside, 429 U. S., at 304, n. 14 (citing Hearst Publications, 322 U. S., at 131). For the Board to prevail, it need
not show that its construction is the best way to read the
statute; rather, courts must respect the Board's judgment so
long as its reading is a reasonable one. See Sure-Tan, Inc.
v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 891 (1984) ("we will uphold any interpretation [of the term `employee' in NLRA $ 2(3)] that is reasonably defensible"). "[R]egardless of how we might have
resolved the question as an initial matter," Bayside, 429
U. S., at 304, the Board's decision here reflects a reasonable
interpretation of the law and, therefore, merits our approbation. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, concurring

in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

Today the Court concludes that three categories of workers fall outside the definition of "agricultural laborer" supplied by $ 3(f) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA)
and $ 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA): (1)
Holly Farms' chicken catchers, who labor on a farm manually
rounding up, catching, and caging live chickens, (2) forklift
operators, who then load the caged chickens onto the bed of a
flatbed truck, and (3) live-haul drivers, who drive the loaded
trucks to Holly Farms' processing plants, where the chickens
are slaughtered and prepared for market. I concur in the
Court's judgment with respect to the live-haul drivers, since
their work is neither performed "by a farmer" nor "on a
farm." But the Court's conclusion that Holly Farms'
chicken catchers and forklift operators do not perform agricultural work runs contrary to common sense and finds no

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
support in the text of the relevant statute. Because thedefinition supplied by Congress makes clear that the chicken

catchers and forklift operators are agricultural workersexempt from the reach of the NLRA, I respectfully dissent.

The Court devotes the bulk of its opinion to an analysis of
the reasonableness of the National Labor Relations Board's(Board) interpretation of the statute, but gives remarkably

short shrift to the statute itself. The Court dismisses HollyFarms' claim that the plain language of the statute covers
the chicken catchers and forklift operators with the con-clusory remark that Holly Farms' reading of the statute is
"a plausible, but not an inevitable, construction of $ 3(f)."
Ante, at 401. In my view, however, the language of the
statute is unambiguous.

As we said in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984): "First, always, is
the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the
precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear,
that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the
agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Id., at 842-843. None of our precedents
sanction blind adherence to the Board's position when it is
directly contrary to the plain language of the relevant statute. See, e. g., NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278, 291 (1965)
("Reviewing courts are not obliged to stand aside and
rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions
that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that
frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute");
American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300, 318
(1965) ("The deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be
allowed to slip into a judicial inertia . . ."). Section 3(f) of
the FLSA defines agriculture as "farming in all its
branches," including "the raising of . . . poultry," as well as
"any practices . . . performed by a farmer or on a farm as
an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations." 29 U. S. C. $ 203(f ) (emphasis added). The coverage

411Cite as: 517 U. S. 392 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
intended by Congress under both the FLSA and the NLRAis best determined by consulting the language of the statute

at issue. Because the relevant portions of $ 3(f) are per-fectly plain and "directly [speak] to the precise question at
issue," Chevron, supra, at 842, I would hold that the chicken
catchers and forklift operators are agricultural laborers andthat the Board's contrary conclusion does not deserve

deference.The Court's determination rests largely upon a misreading
of the statute in two respects. First, the Court tethers the"or on a farm" clause of $ 3(f) to the employment relationship
(or lack thereof) between the chicken catchers and forklift
operators and the independent farmer who is charged with
raising the chickens. And second, the Court decides that
the secondary farming activities performed by the chicken
catchers and forklift operators must not only be "incident"
to the independent farmer's primary farming activities, but
must be "mainly" or "most tightly" tied thereto. Neither
conclusion finds support in the language of $ 3(f).

The Court's first error stems from its adoption of the
Board's focus on the lack of a direct employment relationship between the live-haul workers and the independent
growers. But the "or on a farm" clause nowhere mentions
the nature of the employment relationship. Instead, it is
plainly concerned only with the nature of the work performed by the worker. The Board's interpretation must be
rejected, as it would read the "or on a farm" clause out of
the statute entirely.

The Court relies on the legislative history underlying the
"or on a farm" clause, which we described in Farmers Reservoir & Irrigation Co. v. McComb, 337 U. S. 755, 763 (1949).
That history reveals that the clause was intended to include
within the statutory definition work performed on a farm
that was "necessary to" the farming operations but not
performed by the farmer himself. Id., at 767. One example figures prominently in the legislative history: a wheat

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
thresher who travels from farm to farm performing wheatthreshing chores for small farmers on a contract basis. The

Court reasons that Holly Farms' employees are unlike thefictional wheat thresher, however, in that they are employed
by Holly Farms, rather than by the independent growers
themselves. See ante, at 402, n. 8 ("If the chicken catchingcrews were employed by the independent growers, rather

than by Holly Farms' processing operation, those crewswould more closely resemble the wheat threshers contemplated by the framers of $ 3(f)").The Court and the Board emphasize formal contractual
arrangements to the virtual exclusion of practical realities.
The fact that Holly Farms supplies the services of the
chicken catchers and forklift operators seems entirely beside
the point; the work performed by these employees is precisely the same whether they are hired by Holly Farms or
by the independent growers. And the notion that Congress
intended the status of the chicken catchers and forklift operators to turn on such a readily manipulable criterion strains
credibility. If the live-haul crew's status depends only upon
who "hires" them to perform the work, Holly Farms can simply charge the independent growers with raising and catching, caging, and cooping the chickens, and require the independent growers to hire Holly Farms' own live-haul workers
to perform those tasks.

The Court's quotation from Imco Poultry, Div. of Int'l
Multifoods Corp., 202 N. L. R. B. 259 (1973), reveals precisely where the Board and the Court have gone astray: The
Board takes the position that live-haul workers " `cannot be
performing practices incident to, or in conjunction with,
[their employer's] farming operations.' " Ante, at 405 (quoting Imco Poultry, supra, at 260). But the statute does not
require that work be performed "incident to or in conjunction with" one's employer's farming operations, but only incident to or in conjunction with "such" farming operations--
the antecedent for which term is plainly the first clause of

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

$ 3(f ), to wit, "farming in all its branches," including "theraising of . . . poultry." If the

sine qua non of status as
an agricultural laborer is employment by the farmer or the
independent grower, the "or on a farm" clause is redundant,
because chicken catching crews that are agents or employees
of the farmers themselves fall within the "by a farmer"clause. Ordinarily, "terms connected by a disjunctive [are]

given separate meanings, unless the context dictates other-wise."

Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979).
The "or on a farm" clause has independent significance onlyif the work encompassed by that clause is performed by

someone other than a farmer or the farmer's own agents or
employees. Chevron deference is not owed to a Board construction of the statute that effectively redacts one of the
statute's operative clauses.

The Court also cites with approval a Department of Labor
(DOL) interpretive regulation that addresses contractual arrangements for raising poultry such as those between Holly
Farms and the independent growers. The DOL regulation
declares that "[e]mployees of [a] feed dealer or processor who
perform work on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction
with the raising of poultry on the farm are employed in `secondary' agriculture." 29 CFR $ 780.126 (1995). The Court
thus accepts as reasonable a DOL regulation that plainly
suggests that even workers employed by a poultry processor
such as Holly Farms can be engaged in secondary agriculture
and also accepts as reasonable a Board interpretation of

$ 3(f ) that, in essence, dictates that employees of a processor
cannot be employed in secondary agriculture. See ante, at
404 ("We think it sensible . . . that the Board homed in on
the status of the live-haul crews' employer") (emphasis in
original). The Court cannot have it both ways, and it need
not, since the "or on a farm" clause is plainly indifferent to
the nature of the employment relationship.

The Court's second misstep likewise derives from its deference to a Board construction that lacks foundation in the

414 HOLLY FARMS CORP. v. NLRB

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
statute. Section 3(f) exempts work performed "as an inci-dent to or in conjunction with" primary farming operations.

The statutory language manifestly does not disqualify thework from agricultural status if it also "serve[s],"

ante, at
408, or is "tied to," ante, at 407, some other enterprise.
Even accepting the Court's conclusion that the work of thechicken catchers and forklift operators is "incident to" Holly

Farms' processing operations, those workers fall within the$ 3(f) definition so long as their work is

also "incident to or
in conjunction with" the farming operations performed bythe independent growers.

As Holly Farms points out, the Board's contrary position
hinges on the premise that a given activity can only be incident to one thing--either processing or farming, but not
both. But the Board's position cannot be squared with the
statute itself, which places no conditions upon the statutory
prerequisite that work be "incident to or in conjunction
with" covered farming operations. Indeed, the wheat
thresher of the legislative history was clearly performing
work "incident to" the business operations of the wheat
threshing enterprise as well as "incident to" the farmer's
farming operations. The statutory requirement is simple,
and the imposition of a more stringent prerequisite must be
rejected as contrary to the statute itself.

When the chicken catchers and forklift operators arrive at
the farm of an independent grower to catch, cage, and load
the live chickens in preparation for their delivery to market,
they are certainly doing work that is directly related to the
farming operations that occurred on that very farm during
the preceding weeks: the raising of poultry. As Holly Farms
points out, unless the chickens are caught, caged, and removed from the farm, the independent grower's farming
operations will have been for naught. The independent
grower must see to it that the chickens grow to the designated age and are caught, removed, and replaced with new
chicks for the next growing cycle. See Brief for Petitioners

23. And the fact that $ 3(f ) lists "preparation for market"as one of the activities that customarily is "incident to or

in conjunction with" covered farming operations buttressespetitioners' argument.

The Court's response relies on the facts that the independ-ent grower's contractual duties have ended, that the workers
punch a timeclock in Holly Farms' processing plant ratherthan in Farmer Brown's barn, and that Holly Farms rather
than the independent grower signs their paychecks at theend of the day. But these facts are irrelevant to the statutory definition. Section 3(f) asks only whether the chickencatchers and forklift operators perform work "on a farm"
(which all parties concede they do) and whether that work is"incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations"--that is, whether the activities of the chicken catchingcrews are "incident to" the covered farming operations that
take place on the farms of the independent growers, the rais-ing of poultry for slaughter. To that question, there can be
only one answer.Because the Court today defers to an NLRB interpretation that runs directly contrary to the statutory language, Irespectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion with respect
to the chicken catchers and forklift operators.

Syllabus

CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 94-9247. Argued January 16, 1996--Decided April 29, 1996
At his trial on a federal marijuana charge, petitioner filed his motion for a

judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c)
after the jury returned a guilty verdict and was discharged. The District Court granted the motion even though it was filed one day outside
the time limit prescribed by Rule 29(c), which provides, inter alia, that
"[i]f the jury returns a verdict of guilty . . . , a motion for judgment of
acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the
7-day period." In reversing and remanding for reinstatement of the
verdict and for sentencing, the Sixth Circuit held that under Rule 29 a
district court has no jurisdiction to grant an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal, or to enter such a judgment sua sponte after submission of the case to the jury.

Held: The District Court had no authority to grant petitioner's motion for

judgment of acquittal filed one day outside the Rule 29(c) time limit.
Pp. 419-433.

(a) The Rules do not permit the granting of an untimely postverdict
motion for judgment of acquittal. Rule 29(c)'s text, when read with
Rule 45(b)'s statement that "the court may not extend the time for taking any action under Rul[e] 29 . . . except to the extent and under the
conditions stated in [the Rule]," is plain and unambiguous: If, as in this
case, a guilty verdict is returned, a motion for judgment of acquittal
must be filed either within seven days of the jury's discharge or within
an extended period fixed by the court during that 7-day period. Furthermore, in light of Rule 29(c)'s clarity, petitioner cannot rely either on
Rule 2, which requires that ambiguous Rules "be construed to secure
simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination
of unjustifiable expense and delay," or on Rule 57, which allows district
courts discretion to regulate practice when there is no controlling law.
Pp. 419-425.

(b) This Court rejects petitioner's invocation of courts' "inherent
supervisory power" as alternative authority for the District Court's
action. Whatever the scope of federal courts' inherent power to
formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution
or the Congress, it does not include the power to develop rules that
circumvent or conflict with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Opinion of the Court
See, e. g., Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, 254-255.
Whether the District Court's action is described as the granting of an
untimely motion, or the sua sponte entry of a judgment of acquittal, it
contradicted Rule 29(c)'s plain language and effectively annulled the
7-day filing limit. The cautionary principle that the Court will not
lightly assume that the Rules mean to depart from established principles does not apply in this case, because prior to the enactment of Rule
29, there was no long, unquestioned power of federal district courts
to acquit for insufficient evidence sua sponte, after return of a guilty
verdict. Pp. 425-428.

(c) The Court also rejects petitioner's remaining arguments: (1) that
the District Court had power to order acquittal in this case under the
All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, through the writ of coram nobis; (2)
that the failure to allow the District Court to order acquittal would
violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause; and (3) that prohibiting a district court from granting an acquittal motion filed only one
day late will lead to needless appeals and habeas corpus proceedings.
Pp. 428-430.

(d) The Court rebuts arguments put forward by the dissent, including
the proposition that permissive rules do not withdraw pre-existing inherent powers, and the dissent's reliance on this Court's precedents
to support the existence of the "inherent power" petitioner invokes.
Pp. 430-433.

Opinion of the Court
acquittal filed one day outside the time limit prescribed byFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).

I
Petitioner Charles Carlisle, along with several co-defendants, was tried by jury in the United States District

Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiracy topossess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of
21 U. S. C. $$ 841, 846, 84 Stat. 1260, 1265. He did not moveduring the trial for a judgment of acquittal under Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a). On July 13, 1993, the juryreturned a guilty verdict and was discharged. On July 23,
1993, Carlisle filed a "Motion for a Judgment of AcquittalPursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c)," arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his con-viction. App. 6-9. Rule 29(c) provides that "a motion for
judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 daysafter the jury is discharged or within such further time as
the court may fix during the 7-day period." Excluding theintermediate Saturday and Sunday (as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a) requires), the 7-day period in this caseended on July 22, 1993. The United States' response to Carlisle's motion argued that it should be denied as untimelyand, alternatively, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. The District Court denied Carlisle'smotion on August 19, 1993. Its written opinion did not address the timeliness issue, but concluded that the evidencewas sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a
reasonable doubt that Carlisle knew about, and knowinglyand voluntarily joined, the charged conspiracy.

When Carlisle appeared for sentencing on October 14,1993, the District Court announced that it was reversing its
ruling. When it made its decision in August, the court said,it had prepared two opinions, one granting and one denying
the motion, and it had now decided to substitute the formerfor the latter. The court subsequently entered an order that

Opinion of the Court
(i) withdrew the opinion and order denying the motion toacquit and (ii) granted "Carlisle's motion for a judgment of

acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(c), filed July 23, 1993." App.45. An opinion accompanying the order concluded that
there was insufficient evidence to prove that Carlisle know-ingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy to possess and
distribute marijuana. In a footnote, the opinion acknowl-edged that the motion for judgment of acquittal was filed one
day late, but concluded:

". . . I can conceive of no prejudice to the UnitedStates which will result from consideration of a motion

that is one day lat[e] in this case. Because I believethat refusal to hear this motion would result in grave
injustice, and because [Rule 29(c)] permits the Court toextend the deadline, I will consider this motion as if it
were filed in a timely manner." Id., at 37.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitreversed the judgment of acquittal and remanded to the District Court for reinstatement of the jury's verdict and forsentencing. It held that under Rule 29 a district court has
no jurisdiction to grant an untimely motion for judgment ofacquittal, and that a district court has no jurisdiction to enter
a judgment of acquittal sua sponte after the case has beensubmitted to the jury. 48 F. 3d 190, 192 (1995). We granted
certiorari. 515 U. S. 1191 (1995).

Petitioner argues that district courts "should be given thepower to go outside the strict time limits of Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 29(c)" when (1) there is a claim that thedefendant was legally innocent, (2) the motion is filed prior
to sentencing, and (3) the motion was not timely filed becauseof attorney error. Brief for Petitioner 8. Petitioner seeks
to root this argument in, among other places, the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure.

420 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Rule 29 is reproduced in its entirety below.1 Subdivision
(c) provides, in relevant part, that "[i]f the jury returns a
verdict of guilty . . . , a motion for judgment of acquittal may

1 "Rule 29. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal
"(a) Motion Before Submission to Jury. Motions for directed verdict are abolished and motions for judgment of acquittal shall be used in
their place. The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall
order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged
in the indictment or information after the evidence on either side is closed
if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or
offenses. If a defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of
the evidence offered by the government is not granted, the defendant may
offer evidence without having reserved the right.

"(b) Reservation of Decision on Motion. The court may reserve
decision on a motion for judgment of acquittal, proceed with the trial
(where the motion is made before the close of all the evidence), submit the
case to the jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns a
verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without
having returned a verdict. If the court reserves decision, it must decide
the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was
reserved.

"(c) Motion after Discharge of Jury. If the jury returns a verdict
of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, a motion for
judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the
jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during
the 7-day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned the court may on such
motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal. It shall not
be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has
been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.

"(d) Same: Conditional Ruling on Grant of Motion. If a motion
for judgment of acquittal after verdict of guilty under this Rule is granted,
the court shall also determine whether any motion for a new trial should
be granted if the judgment of acquittal is thereafter vacated or reversed,
specifying the grounds for such determination. If the motion for a new
trial is granted conditionally, the order thereon does not affect the finality
of the judgment. If the motion for a new trial has been granted conditionally and the judgment is reversed on appeal, the new trial shall proceed
unless the appellate court has otherwise ordered. If such motion has
been denied conditionally, the appellee on appeal may assert error in that
denial, and if the judgment is reversed on appeal, subsequent proceedings
shall be in accordance with the order of the appellate court."

Opinion of the Court
be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix
during the 7-day period." Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) provides that whereas certain untimely acts may
be accorded validity upon a showing of excusable neglect,
"the court may not extend the time for taking any action
under Rul[e] 29 . . . except to the extent and under the conditions stated in [the Rule]." These Rules are plain and unambiguous. If, as in this case, a guilty verdict is returned,
a motion for judgment of acquittal must be filed, either
within seven days of the jury's discharge, or within an extended period fixed by the court during that 7-day period.
There is simply no room in the text of Rules 29 and 45(b) for
the granting of an untimely postverdict motion for judgment
of acquittal, regardless of whether the motion is accompanied
by a claim of legal innocence, is filed before sentencing, or
was filed late because of attorney error.

Unable to offer any reading of Rule 29(c) that would
permit an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal to be
granted, Carlisle contends that Rule 29(a) gives a district
court authority to enter a judgment of acquittal sua sponte
at any time before sentencing. Rule 29(a), entitled "Motion
Before Submission to Jury," provides in relevant part:

"The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motion
shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or
more offenses charged in the indictment or information
after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence
is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or
offenses."

It would be quite a surprise to find a district court's sua
sponte power to grant judgment of acquittal after submission of the case to the jury hidden away in a provision entitled "Motion Before Submission to Jury." We are not inclined to adopt an interpretation that creates such a surprise
unless the intent that the text exceed its caption is clear.

422 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Here, to the contrary, the structure of Rule 29 indicates that
subdivision (a) is limited as its caption says.

Petitioner's proposed reading would create an odd system
in which defense counsel could move for judgment of acquittal for only seven days after the jury's discharge, but the
court's power to enter such a judgment would linger. In
United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469 (1947), we declined to
read former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, which
placed a 5-day limit on the making of a motion for new trial,
as "permit[ting] the judge to order retrial without request
and at any time," 331 U. S., at 473. "[I]t would be a strange
rule," we said, "which deprived a judge of power to do what
was asked when request was made by the person most concerned, and yet allowed him to act without petition," and
such an arrangement "would almost certainly subject trial
judges to private appeals or application by counsel or friends
of one convicted," id., at 474, 475. The same is true here.2
In addition, petitioner's reading makes a farce of subdivision
(b) of Rule 29, which provides that a court may reserve decision on the motion for judgment of acquittal and decide it
after submission to the jury. There would be no need for
this procedure if, even without reserving, the court had continuing power to grant judgment of acquittal on its own. In

2 The dissent forcefully argues that Smith does not compel the result we
reach in this case. Post, at 452-453. That is an effective rejoinder to an
argument we have not made. In response to the argument we have
made--that some of the considerations supporting the holding in Smith
apply here--the dissent (i) ignores the portion of Smith discussing the
strangeness of a rule that would give a judge greater power to act sua
sponte than on motion; and (ii) transforms Smith's desire to spare trial
judges "private appeals or application by counsel or friends of the person
convicted" into a concern for the "appearance of impropriety" that "ex
parte approaches" would create, post, at 453, which concern in the present
context (though presumably for some reason not in the Smith context) the
dissent regards as "a highly inappropriate comment on the integrity of
the federal judiciary," ibid., and the dissent says it was dictum in Smith
anyway.

Opinion of the Court
sum, even without the captions (and a fortiori with them) it
is clear that subdivisions (a) and (b) of Rule 29 pertain to
motions made before submission, and subdivisions (c) and (d)
to motions made after discharge.

The Government offers an alternative theory of a court's
power to act sua sponte under Rule 29: Because Rule 29(a)
refers to both a "motion of a defendant" and a court's "own
motion," whereas Rule 29(c) refers only to "a motion" simpliciter, the latter must refer to motions both of defendants and
of courts, permitting both such "motions" to be made within
seven days after the jury's discharge. We do not find this
reading plausible. Rule 29(c) not only provides that "a motion for judgment of acquittal" may be made or renewed
within seven days after the jury is discharged. It goes on
to provide, in its second and third sentences: "If a verdict of
guilty is returned the court may on such motion set aside
the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict is
returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal." The
phrase "on such motion" is notably absent from the third
sentence--conveying the idea that, where a jury has not returned a verdict, a court can act without motion, but where
a jury has returned a guilty verdict, it cannot. But if "on
such motion" includes action taken by a court on its own
initiative, the limiting phrase "on such motion" in the second
sentence has no effect, and a court may act on its own
whether or not a verdict has been returned. That is to say,
the inclusion of the phrase "on such motion" in one sentence
but not in the other would be inexplicable.3

3 Perhaps even more inexplicable is what precisely would be achieved
by the Government's reading, which (unlike petitioner's theories) would
permit the court to act sua sponte only during the 7-day period specified
by the Rule (or any extension thereof ordered by the court during the
7-day period, as Rule 29(c) allows). The sole beneficiary of the Government's textual contortions is the district judge who wants to set aside a
verdict, but lacks the wit to invite a motion for that during the 7-day
period, or (if defendant's counsel is unavailable) to extend the 7-day period,

424 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner contends that even if Rule 29 does not permit acourt to grant an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal,

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 2 vests the court withsupervisory power to enter judgment of acquittal. Rule 2
provides:

"These rules are intended to provide for the just deter-mination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be

construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairnessin administration and the elimination of unjustifiable
expense and delay."
This Rule is of no aid to petitioner. It sets forth a principleof interpretation to be used in construing ambiguous rules,

not a principle of law superseding clear rules that do notachieve the stated objectives. It does not, that is to say,
provide that rules shall be construed to mean somethingother than what they plainly say--which is what petitioner's
proposed construction of Rule 29(c) would require.We must acknowledge that there is precedent in this Court
for using Rule 2 as a basis for deviating from time limitsimposed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In
Fallen v. United States, 378 U. S. 139 (1964), we cited Rule2 in the course of excusing the failure of an incarcerated
paraplegic pro se petitioner to comply with the time limitfor filing a notice of appeal under former Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 37(a). Concluding that the petitioner"had done all that could reasonably be expected" to file a
timely appeal, including mailing a notice of appeal to theclerk's office two days before the notice was due, we "decline[d] to read the Rules so rigidly as to bar a determinationof his appeal on the merits." 378 U. S., at 144.

Fallen hasbeen made obsolete by an amendment to Rule 37(a).

sua sponte, in order to invite such a motion later. It is our hope and
belief that no such district judge exists.

4 Rule 37(a) was amended in 1966 to provide that a district court may

extend the time for filing a notice of appeal "[u]pon a showing of excusable

425Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
of course Fallen was a narrow ruling when it was announced,as is evident from

Berman v. United States, 378 U. S. 530
(1964) (per curiam), a decision announced on the same dayas

Fallen, summarily affirming the dismissal of an appeal
that had been filed one day late.

Finally, petitioner cannot rely on Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 57 as the source of the District Court's authority

in this case. The version of Rule 57 in effect when criminalproceedings against petitioner commenced (and which he relied upon at oral argument) states, in relevant part, that,"[i]n all cases not provided for by rule, the district judges
. . . may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsist-ent with these rules." The relevant portion of the current
version of Rule 57 is captioned "Procedure When There Is
No Controlling Law," and states: "A judge may regulate
practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these
rules, and local rules of the district." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
57(b). We need not decide which version of this Rule controls the present case, because neither authorizes the District Court's action here. A rule permitting a party to submit and prevail on an untimely motion for judgment of
acquittal is "inconsistent" (or not "consistent") with Rule 29's
7-day filing limit; and the question of when a motion for judgment of acquittal may be granted does not present a case
"not provided for" by Rule 29; and Rule 29 is the "controlling
law" governing this question.

As alternative authority for the District Court's action,
petitioner invokes courts' "inherent supervisory power."

abrogated and replaced by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), the
substance of this amendment was transferred to Rule 4(b). See Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 4(b) (1968).

Opinion of the Court
courts "may, within limits, formulate procedural rules not
specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress."
United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 505 (1983). Whatever the scope of this "inherent power," however, it does not
include the power to develop rules that circumvent or conflict
with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As we recognized in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.
250, 254-255 (1988), holding that federal courts may not invoke supervisory power to circumvent Rule 52(a): "[F]ederal
courts have no more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than they do to disregard constitutional or statutory
provisions." Whether the action of the District Court here
is described as the granting of an untimely motion, or the
sua sponte entry of a judgment of acquittal, it contradicted
the plain language of Rule 29(c), and effectively annulled the
7-day filing limit.

In Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991), we
said that we would not " `lightly assume that Congress has
intended to depart from established principles' such as the
scope of a court's inherent power," id., at 47 (quoting Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 313 (1982)). Similarly, in Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 629-632 (1962),
we said that since a district court's authority to dismiss sua
sponte for lack of prosecution was a "sanction of wide usage,"
we would not assume, in the absence of a clear expression,
that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), which allowed a
party to move for dismissal for lack of prosecution, abrogated
this "long . . . unquestioned" power. That cautionary principle does not apply in the present case, not only because of
the clarity of the text, but also because we are unaware of
any "long unquestioned" power of federal district courts to
acquit for insufficient evidence sua sponte, after return of a
guilty verdict. Indeed, we are aware of only two cases prior
to the enactment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
that could be read as asserting in dictum the existence of

such a power. United States v. McCracken, 26 F. Cas. 1069,1069 (No. 15,664) (ED Va. 1878); United States v. Hayden, 26

F. Cas. 236, 238 (No. 15,333) (NDNY 1877).5

5 The dissent's extended discussion of pre-Rule federal cases produces a
lot of smoke, and no fire. Ansley v. United States, 135 F. 2d 207, 208 (CA5
1943), described by the dissent as "establishing a district court's inherent
power to review sua sponte a jury verdict for sufficiency of the evidence,"
post, at 446, establishes no such thing. There, after noting the appellants'
failure to renew their motions for directed verdict at the close of evidence,
the Fifth Circuit said:

"[T]he question of the sufficiency of the evidence was not properly saved
for review by this court. It is true that the question may and should be
raised by the court of its own motion, if necessary to prevent a miscarriage
of justice, but this is not such a case. We have examined the record, and
have found it to contain ample evidence to support the judgment." 135
F. 2d, at 208.

It is obvious that the statement "the question may and should be raised
by the court of its own motion" refers to the power of an appellate court
to review sufficiency of the evidence where the issue has not been preserved for appeal. The cases cited by the dissent deal with the power of
a district court to enter a judgment of acquittal before the return of a

verdict (i. e., to direct a verdict of acquittal), see Cady v. United States,
293 F. 829 (CADC 1923); Nosowitz v. United States, 282 F. 575, 578 (CA2
1922); United States v. Fullerton, 25 F. Cas. 1225 (No. 15,176) (SDNY
1870); the power of a district court to set aside a verdict and order a new
trial, see Wiborg v. United States, 163 U. S. 632, 658-659 (1896); United
States v. Harding, 26 F. Cas. 131, 136 (No. 15,301) (ED Pa. 1846); cf.
Charles v. State, 4 Port. 107, 109-110 (Ala. 1836); the power of a district
court to enter judgment of acquittal where the defendant has made a
preverdict or postverdict motion to acquit, see Ex parte United States,
101 F. 2d 870, 878 (CA7 1939), aff'd by an equally divided Court, United
States v. Stone, 308 U. S. 519 (1939); United States v. Standard Oil Co., 23
F. Supp. 937, 938-939 (WD Wis. 1938); cf. State v. Meen, 171 Wis. 36, 38-39
(1920); and even the power of an appellate court to reverse a district
court's denial of a motion for directed verdict, see Nosowitz, supra, at 578;
Cherry v. United States, 78 F. 2d 334 (CA7 1935); Reiner v. United States,

680 (1897); Romano v. United States, 9 F. 2d 522, 524 (CA2 1925). Not a
single pre-Rule case cited by the dissent purports to exercise the power
at issue here: a district court's power to enter judgment of acquittal for
insufficient evidence, without motion, and after the return of a guilty

517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT
428 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The case law of this Court that petitioner relies upon doesnot establish any "inherent power" to act in contravention

of applicable Rules. In Gaca v. United States, 411 U. S. 618(1973) (per curiam), which reinstated an appeal that had
been dismissed for want of timely prosecution, there was nosuggestion that reinstatement was contrary to any statute
or rule of procedure. And in United States v. Nobles, 422U. S. 225 (1975), which approved exercise of a District
Court's inherent authority to order the disclosure of certainwitness statements, we felt it necessary to make sure that
such exercise did not conflict with Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 16. Petitioner's best case is

Thompson v. INS,375 U. S. 384 (1964), which, contrary to former Federal Rule

of Civil Procedure 73(a), gave effect to a notice of appeal filedmore than 60 days from the entry of judgment.

Thompson,however, is not pertinent here, since it expressly relied upon

the " `unique circumstances' " that the cause of the failure tomeet the Rule's deadline was an erroneous ruling or assurance by the District Court itself. 375 U. S., at 387 (quoting
Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371U. S. 215, 217 (1962) (per curiam)).

IV
Petitioner's three remaining arguments need not detain uslong. First, he argues that the District Court had power to

enter a judgment of acquittal in this case under the All WritsAct, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, through the writ of

coram nobis.Apart from the fact that the District Court was not asked to

verdict. The dissent apparently thinks it an adequate explanation for this
lack of support that, prior to our decision in United States v. Smith, 331
U. S. 469, 474 (1947) (suggesting that sua sponte grant of a new trial may
raise double jeopardy concerns), district courts could order new trials
where there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict. Post,
at 442-443. But if these district courts truly had latent inherent power
to enter a judgment of acquittal, surely at least some of them would have
been willing to give a legally innocent defendant that to which he was
entitled--viz., a judgment of acquittal--rather than just a new trial.

Opinion of the Court
issue, and did not purport to be issuing, a writ of coram
nobis, that writ would not have lain here, since it was traditionally available only to bring before the court factualerrors "material to the validity and regularity of the legal

proceeding itself," such as the defendant's being under age
or having died before the verdict. See United States v.
Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 67-68 (1914). Moreover, "[t]he All
Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writsthat are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute

specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is thatauthority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling."
Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985). As we noted a few
years after enactment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, "it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal
criminal case today where [a writ of coram nobis] would be
necessary or appropriate." United States v. Smith, 331
U. S., at 475, n. 4. In the present case, Rule 29 provides the
applicable law.

Second, petitioner asserts that the failure to allow the District Court to enter a judgment of acquittal would violate
the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. His argument on this point consists of nothing more than bald assertions that Rule 29(c) as applied to the facts of this case
transgresses principles of fundamental fairness, "shocks the
conscience," and interferes with rights "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." Brief for Petitioner 28-29 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Herrera v. Collins, 506
U. S. 390 (1993); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172
(1952); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325-326 (1937)).
Petitioner has failed to proffer any historical, textual, or controlling precedential support for his argument that the inability of a district court to grant an untimely postverdict
motion for judgment of acquittal violates the Fifth Amendment, and we decline to fashion a new due process right out
of thin air.

517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT
430 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Third, petitioner argues that prohibiting a district courtfrom granting a motion for judgment of acquittal filed one

day late will lead to needless appeals and habeas corpus pro-ceedings, where it will be more difficult for defendants to
obtain relief than in motions directed to the trial court. As-suming,

arguendo, that these contentions are accurate, wecannot permit them to alter our analysis, for we are not at

liberty to ignore the mandate of Rule 29 in order to obtain"optimal" policy results. Cf. United States v. Robinson, 361
U. S. 220, 229-230 (1960). We are similarly unmoved bypetitioner's contention that the "rationale" behind Rule
29(c)'s time limit does not apply where the motion for judg-ment of acquittal is filed a mere eight days after the trial.
The only evident "rationale" behind Rule 29(c)'s 7-day timelimit is that a motion for judgment of acquittal filed eight
days after trial is a motion filed one day later than justiceand equity demand. As we said in a case involving the filing
deadline of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of1976, 43 U. S. C. $ 1744 (1988 ed.): "If 1-day late filings are
acceptable, 10-day late filings might be equally acceptable,and so on in a cascade of exceptions that would engulf the
rule erected by the filing deadline; yet regardless of wherethe cutoff line is set, some individuals will always fall just
on the other side of it." United States v. Locke, 471 U. S.84, 101 (1985).

V
Finally, we may respond to some of the many argumentsput forward by the dissent. The dissent makes the sweeping assertion that "a district court clearly has the inherentauthority to ensure that a legally innocent defendant is not
wrongfully convicted," post, at 442. Perhaps so. As thedissent itself recognizes, however, that power has come to an
end once an appeal has been taken. Post, at 452-453. Weare in accord, then, that there is some point at which the
district court is rendered powerless to enter a judgment ofacquittal, and the disagreement between us and the dissent

517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

431Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
comes down to nothing more cosmic than the question of tim-ing--which we find answered by the text of Rule 29.

In an effort to explain why, if a Rule 29(c) motion is inany event unnecessary, it makes any sense to impose a 7-day
deadline upon the making of it, the dissent maintains that
the untimeliness of a motion gives a district court discretionto ignore it.

Post, at 445. This presents the disedifying
prospect of a court vested with "the inherent authority toensure that a legally innocent defendant is not wrongfully

convicted," post, at 442, exercising its discretion to let aninnocent defendant be wrongfully convicted. Quite obviously, this explanation of the deadline is incompatible with
the premise that underlies the dissent's entire argument.
As for the dissent's concern, post, at 448, that our decision
runs afoul of Rule 2's mandate that the rules "be construed
to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration
and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay": We
see neither simplicity, nor fairness, nor elimination of delay
in a regime that makes it discretionary whether an untimely
motion for judgment of acquittal will be entertained.

The dissent asserts that "permissive rules do not withdraw pre-existing inherent powers." Post, at 452. That assertion is really not relevant to the present case since, as we
have discussed, the power to enter postverdict judgments
of acquittal sua sponte was not a "pre-existing inherent
power." See supra, at 426-428, and n. 5. But besides the
lack of factual predicate for its application here, the principle
the dissent proposes would produce some extraordinary consequences. For example, as the cases cited by the dissent
illustrate, see post, at 439-440, courts previously have ordered new trials sua sponte. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, however, provides that "[t]he court on motion of
a defendant may grant a new trial . . . ." Following the
dissent's logic, Rule 33, being permissive, does not preclude
a court from granting a new trial without motion, thereby
leaving open to the court a course of action that may well

Opinion of the Court
violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. But see Advisory
Committee's Notes on 1966 Amendment of Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 33, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 801 ("The amendments to the
first two sentences make it clear that a judge has no power
to order a new trial on his own motion, that he can act only
in response to a motion timely made by a defendant. Problems of double jeopardy arise when the court acts on its own
motion"). Similarly, a pre-existing practice, if there was
one, would allow a subpoena to be served by a party or a
minor despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(d) ("A
subpoena may be served by the marshal, by a deputy marshal or by any other person who is not a party and who is
not less than 18 years of age"); would allow a judge from
another district to take over a jury trial from a disabled
judge despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) ("If
. . . the judge before whom a jury trial has commenced is
unable to proceed with the trial, any other judge regularly
sitting in or assigned to the court . . . may proceed with and
finish the trial"); and would allow a court to correct a technical
error in a sentence more than seven days after the imposition of the sentence, despite Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) ("The court, acting within 7 days after the imposition of sentence, may correct a sentence that was imposed
as a result of arithmetical, technical, or other clear error").

The decisions of Justice Harlan relied upon by the dissent
to support the proposition that permissive rules do not eliminate inherent powers are not germane. We have discussed
Link above, see supra, at 426. In United States v. Ohio
Power Co., 353 U. S. 98, 104 (1957), Justice Harlan noted that
this Court has proceeded on the assumption that we have
inherent authority to "affect judgments by action which
would otherwise be out of time under [our own] Rules."
That statement would be relevant if the present case involved a district court's departure from one of its own
rules--which of course it does not. In Fernandez v. United

517US2$47K 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

433Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
States, 81 S. Ct. 642 (1961), 5 L. Ed. 2d 683 (Harlan, J., inchambers), Justice Harlan recognized that the provision of

former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 46(a) that a "per-son arrested for an offense not punishable by death shall be
admitted to bail" (emphasis added) did not withdraw districtcourts' authority to

revoke bail in a noncapital case. Fer-nandez, supra, at 644, and n. 7, 5 L. Ed. 2d, at 685, and n. 7.

What admitting to bail implies with respect to revocation ofbail is not comparable to what granting judgment on motion
implies with respect to granting judgment without motion.What the dissent needs, in the Fernandez context, is a case
holding that a statute which permits bail for "persons ar-rested for noncapital offenses" does not preclude bail for persons arrested for capital offenses. Of course, such a casewill not be found.

Finally, the dissent contends that United States v. Sisson,399 U. S. 267 (1970), supports existence of the "inherent
power" petitioner invokes. See post, at 448-449. We thinknot.

Sisson did not "implicitly conclude" that it was properto enter a postverdict judgment of acquittal without motion,

because the propriety of the judgment of acquittal was irrel-evant to the decision. The only issue was whether the judgment appealed from was a judgment of acquittal (proper orimproper), because that would mean that the Government's
appeal under the former 18 U. S. C. $ 3731 (which did notapply to judgments of acquittal) must be dismissed. See
United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 351 (1975) (appeal inSisson "was barred solely by the statute").

* * *
We conclude that the District Court had no authority togrant petitioner's motion for judgment of acquittal filed one

day outside the time limit prescribed by Rule 29(c). Wetherefore affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.

It is so ordered.

In Part I of his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevensmakes a persuasive argument that, absent a rule to the contrary, district judges have an "inherent authority" to entera judgment of acquittal, although, for the reasons offered by
the majority, ante, at 426, I am not persuaded that this inher-ent authority extends to the power to act

sua sponte to granta judgment of acquittal after the jury has returned a verdict.

In any event, I accept the received view that inherent powergenerally is subject to legislative abrogation, see

Bank ofNova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, 254-255 (1988);

ante, at 426, and although Congress's power is not necessarilyplenary, its limits are not implicated here. While there may
be some point at which legislative interference with a court's
inherent authority would run afoul of Article III, see Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 58 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Some elements of that inherent authority are soessential to `[t]he judicial Power,' U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1,

that they are indefeasible"), it is not seriously contended thatRule 29(c) is an unconstitutional interference with the court's
inherent authority. I therefore join the Court's opinion.

Kember, 648 F. 2d 1354, 1357-1358 (CADC l980) (per curiam)(commenting on "manifold settings in which we employ the

term [ jurisdiction]" and distinguishing fundamental "jurisdiction" questions from issues of a less basic character); Center for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. United States Nuclear
Regulatory Comm'n, 781 F. 2d 935, 945, n. 4 (CADC 1986)(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (questioning "profligate use" of the

word "jurisdiction," in diverse contexts, "to mean manythings--from the absence of a constitutional grant of judicial
power to a statutory limit on time to appeal").

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) concerns a matter less basic. It is simply a time prescription. Rule 29(c)'s
prescription is a tight one, to be sure. Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 45(b) makes that clear by precluding extensions, even for "excusable neglect," after expiration of
the seven days specified in Rule 29(c). But like limitation
periods generally, see, e. g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans
Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990) ("[t]ime requirements in lawsuits . . . are customarily subject to `equitable tolling' "), the
29(c)/45(b) constraint is not utterly exceptionless.

This Court has recognized one sharply honed exception to
rules of the 29(c)/45(b) genre. That exception covers cases
in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have--
and probably would have--taken timely action had the trial
judge conveyed correct, rather than incorrect, information.
See Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384, 386-387 (1964) (per
curiam) (had trial judge not misinformed party that his new
trial motion was made "in ample time," party "could have,
and presumably would have, filed the appeal within 60 days
of the entry of the original judgment, rather than waiting,
as he did, until after the trial court had disposed of the [new
trial motion]"); Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat
Packers, Inc., 371 U. S. 215, 216-217 (1962) (per curiam) (instructing that petitioner's appeal be heard on the merits

where petitioner had received from trial court an improperlygrounded 14-day extension of the time to file his appeal); see

also 4A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure$ 1168, at 501 (describing Thompson and Harris Truck Lines
as "based on a theory similar to estoppel"). As the Courtobserves, however, this exception "is not pertinent here."
See ante, at 428.Carlisle's counsel was not misled by any trial court statement or action; rather, he neglected to follow plain instruc-tions. Rule 29(c) clearly instructs that a motion for a judgment of acquittal be filed "within 7 days after the jury isdischarged or within such further time as the court may fix
during the 7-day period." Just as clearly, Rule 45(b) ex-cludes motions for enlargement once seven days have run.
I agree that a rule like 29(c) is framed to resist ad hoc relax-ation. A time line must be drawn at some point, and it is
not unreasonable to draw the line as the rulemakers did,rather than extend it out to the day set for sentencing.

It bears emphasis, finally, that the Government recognizeslegal avenues still open to Carlisle to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant his conviction: on appeal
(subject to "plain error" standard); and through a postconvic-tion motion, under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255, asserting ineffective

assistance of counsel. Brief for United States 38-39. Inthe rare situations

Justice Stevens envisions--delay of a
meritorious motion due to an Act of God, see post, at 454, orcases comparable to those in which we would read and grant

an out-of-time rehearing petition, see post, at 450-451--
these modes of relief should provide an adequate corrective.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,dissenting.

As long as a federal court retains jurisdiction over a crimi-nal case, it has the authority to ensure that no conviction is
entered unless the prosecutor has proved the defendant'sguilt. The exercise of the court's inherent power to set

aside a jury verdict unsupported by evidence is not contin-gent on the filing of a timely motion by the defendant. The

question in this case, therefore, is not whether Rule 29 of theFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure authorizes the court to
grant an untimely motion for judgment of acquittal; I agreewith the Court that it does not. Rather, the question is
whether that Rule withdraws the court's pre-existing au-thority to refrain from entering judgment of conviction
against a defendant whom it knows to be legally innocent.Viewed in this light, the majority places more reliance on
the negative implication in Rule 29 than its permissive lan-guage can bear. Assuming it exists at all, this negative implication is far too weak to justify the conclusion that Rule29 manifests that Congress desired to withdraw a federal
court's inherent authority to acquit an innocent defendant.

I
Trial judges are kept busy responding to motions, objec-tions, and requests by the litigants. It is quite wrong, however, to assume that a judge is nothing more than a refereewhose authority is limited to granting or denying motions
advanced by the parties. As Learned Hand tersely noted,a "judge, at least in a federal court, is more than a moderator; he is affirmatively charged with securing a fair trial, andhe must intervene sua sponte to that end, when necessary."
Brown v. Walter, 62 F. 2d 798, 799 (CA2 1933). That dutyencompasses not only the avoidance of error before it occurs,
but the correction of error that may have occurred earlier ina proceeding.

The basic principle has been stated many times. There isa "power `inherent in every court of justice so long as it retains control of the subject matter and of the parties, tocorrect that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its
process.' Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry.

197 (1939). Although that statement was made in a civil
case, we have made it clear that a federal court has even
broader discretion to notice error independently in the trial
of a criminal case than in civil cases. Crawford v. United
States, 212 U. S. 183, 194 (1909).

Examples of the exercise of the federal courts' inherent
powers are abundant in both our civil and our criminal jurisprudence.1 Indeed, when he was serving on the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, then-Judge Kennedy, after
considering a series of cases that recognized various inherent judicial powers,2 correctly pointed out:

1 A few examples illustrate the breadth of that power. We have held
that a district court "has inherent power to dismiss a suit pursuant to the
doctrine of forum non conveniens," Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S.
501, 502 (1947); to dismiss an appeal in a criminal case if the defendant is
a fugitive, Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970); to enforce
compliance with lawful orders through civil contempt, Shillitani v. United
States, 384 U. S. 364, 370 (1966); to order special conferences that will aid
in the disposition of a complex antitrust case, United States v. United
States Gypsum Co., 340 U. S. 76, 81 (1950); and to stay proceedings "to
control the progress of the cause so as to maintain the orderly processes
of justice," Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, 381-382 (1935).
We have also recognized the court's inherent power to enforce its judgments, see Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U. S. 349 (1996), as well as its inherent
power to award attorney's fees in exceptional cases, Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 256 (1975).

"Exercise of judicial power by entry of orders not ex-pressly sanctioned by rule or statute in order to correct

the legal process or avert its misfunction has been ap-proved in varied circumstances." Arizona v. Manypenny, 672 F. 2d 761, 765, cert. denied, 459 U. S. 850(1982).

When a federal court declines to enter a judgment of con-viction against a defendant whom it should have directed the
jury to acquit, it clearly corrects the legal process and avertsits misfunctioning. Given the various

sua sponte powersthat district courts unquestionably may exercise in order to

ensure that legally innocent defendants are not convicted, itis clear that they also possess the inherent authority

suasponte to enter postverdict acquittals when the Government

has failed to prove that a defendant is guilty.District courts have long exercised their inherent power
to direct an acquittal sua sponte when the prosecution failsto prove its case at the close of evidence. See Wiborg v.
United States, 163 U. S. 632, 659 (1896); Cady v. United
States, 293 F. 829 (CADC 1923); Nosowitz v. United States,282 F. 575, 578 (CA2 1922).

3 They have also long exercised

3 Indeed, Cady referred to "the well-established and oft-repeated principle that, unless there is substantial evidence of facts which exclude every
other hypothesis but that of guilt, it is the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the accused . . . ." 293 F., at 830
(emphasis added). Moreover, in both of the cases cited by the majority
as supporting the existence of the power exercised here, United States v.
McCracken, 26 F. Cas. 1069 (No. 15,664) (ED Va. 1878), and United States
v. Hayden, 26 F. Cas. 236, 238 (No. 15,333) (NDNY 1877), see ante, at
426-427, the district judges directed the jury to return a verdict of not
guilty. In the Hayden case, the court went on to describe what I assume
was the settled practice among all federal judges at the time: "I have
made it a rule to direct a verdict of not guilty where, in my opinion the
evidence will not authorize the jury to find a verdict of guilty, or, if so
found, I would set aside the verdict as contrary to evidence. I think this
is a case of that class, and I therefore direct the jury to find a verdict of
not guilty." 26 F. Cas., at 238.

their inherent power to set aside a jury verdict for insuffi-ciency of the evidence sua sponte. See United States v.

Harding, 26 F. Cas. 131, 136 (No. 15,301) (ED Pa. 1846);United States v. Fullerton, 25 F. Cas. 1225 (No. 15,176)
(SDNY 1870); see also F. Wharton, Criminal Law of theUnited States 669 (1846) ("Where, however, evidence is not
sufficient in law to authorize a verdict, a new trial will begranted, even though no objection be made at the trial");

if there be an improper conviction, to arrest the judgment orset aside the verdict"); Charles v. State, 4 Port. 107, 109-110
(Ala. 1836).4The District Courts' longstanding exercise of these inherent powers is entirely consistent with the conclusion that adistrict court acts within its power when it enters a judgment of acquittal upon setting aside an unsupported juryverdict. To be sure, the early cases reveal that District
Courts typically ordered new trials, rather than acquittals,upon concluding that the jury's verdict was not supported
by legally sufficient evidence. However, subsequent casesdemonstrate that as courts became concerned that the new

4 Out of deference to the King, the rule was apparently different in England. See 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 312-
313 (1883); but cf. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *389-*390. Even still,
English judges evaded the procedural bar by declining to enter sentence
and requesting the Crown to pardon wrongfully convicted defendants.
These requests were routinely granted. See Ex parte United States, 101
F. 2d 870, 875, n. 15 (CA7 1939). Judge Kane explained that he did "not
remember to have read of a single instance in which the judicial recommendation has been disregarded by the ministers of the crown, and [he
did] not suppose that it could be without a breach of the constitution of
the realm." United States v. Harding, 26 F. Cas. 131, 137 (No. 15,301)
(ED Pa. 1846). As a result of this consistent practice, he concluded that
"[i]n England, therefore, the denial to the courts of a revisory power over
verdicts in any cases is apparent, rather than real. The judge, if dissatisfied with a conviction on the merits, respites the sentence or reprieves the
prisoner, and the king's prerogative interposes to do justice as a thing of
course." Ibid.

trial remedy trenched on the prohibition against double jeop-ardy, they began to enter judgments of acquittals. See

Ex
parte United States, 101 F. 2d 870, 878 (CA7 1939), aff 'd byan equally divided Court in

United States v. Stone, 308 U. S.
519 (1939).

The earliest cases involve appellate courts entering judg-ments of acquittal in order to remedy a district court's failure

to direct the jury to acquit. See Nosowitz v. United States,282 F. 575 (CA2 1922);

Cherry v. United States, 78 F. 2d 334
(CA7 1935); Reiner v. United States, 92 F. 2d 823 (CA9 1937);see also

France v. United States, 164 U. S. 676 (1897) (remanding to the District Court with directions to enter such
judgment); Romano v. United States, 9 F. 2d 522 (CA2 1925)
(same). Later cases reveal that District Courts soon followed suit, either by ruling on reserved, preverdict acquittal
motions or by granting postverdict motions to acquit. See
Ex parte United States, 101 F. 2d 870 (CA7 1939); United
States v. Standard Oil Co., 23 F. Supp. 937 (WD Wis. 1938),
aff 'd in United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S.
150, 165, n. 1 (1940); State v. Meen, 171 Wis. 36 (1920) (same);
see also Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 29 (endorsing
these practices). Moreover, prior to the adoption of Rule 29
in 1944, the Fifth Circuit explained that, even after a jury
returns a verdict, a court "may and should" sua sponte
review the sufficiency of the evidence. Ansley v. United
States, 135 F. 2d 207, 208 (1943).

In light of this history, it makes no sense to conclude that
a federal district court lacks the inherent power to enter sua
sponte a postverdict judgment of acquittal. A trial court's
postverdict entry of a judgment of acquittal is in substance
no different from an appellate court's order directing entry
of that same judgment. Moreover, the double jeopardy concerns that may bar a district court from ordering a new trial
to remedy its failure to have directed an acquittal cannot
sensibly be understood to prohibit the district court from
providing a defendant some measure of relief from a legally

517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT
442 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
insufficient guilty verdict. See United States v. Smith, 331
U. S. 469, 474 (1947). Finally, given that a motion was not
thought to be needed in order for the District Court to exercise its inherent power either to direct an acquittal, or to set
aside an unsupported verdict and order a new trial, there is
no reason to conclude that a district court is utterly powerless to remedy a wrongful conviction in the exceedingly rare
circumstance in which an unforeseen accident results in the
defendant's failure to file a motion for acquittal.

In all events, a district court clearly has the inherent authority to ensure that a legally innocent defendant is not
wrongfully convicted. It would be most strange to conclude
that this authority, which enables a district court to keep a
case from the jury altogether when the Government fails to
prove its case, does not permit that same court to revise a
guilty verdict that the jury returns despite the Government's insufficient proof. That conclusion is particularly difficult to fathom when one considers that the latter action
may be appealed by the Government, while the former may
not. United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 345 (1975).
Not surprisingly, therefore, numerous courts have recognized that, prior to the passage of Rule 29, district courts
possessed the inherent power to acquit defendants sua
sponte. See United States v. Hughes, 759 F. Supp. 530, 532-
536 (WD Ark.), aff 'd sub nom. United States v. Haren, 952
F. 2d 190 (CA8 1991); United States v. DiBernardo, 880 F. 2d
1216, 1225, n. 4 (CA11 1989); United States v. Coleman, 811
F. 2d 804 (CA3 1987); United States v. Giampa, 758 F. 2d
928, 936, n. 1 (CA3 1985); Arizona v. Manypenny, 672 F. 2d,
at 765; Ansley v. United States, 135 F. 2d, at 208; see also
United States v. Weinstein, 452 F. 2d 704, 713, 714 (CA2
1971); United States v. Broadus, 664 F. Supp. 592, 595-598
(DC 1987).

The majority states that no pre-Rule case establishes the
precise power at issue here. Ante, at 427-428, n. 5. That

is true but unremarkable. The majority does not disputethat, prior to the passage of Rule 29, trial courts possessed

the inherent power to remedy unsupported guilty verdictsby ordering new trials sua sponte. After Rule 29 was
adopted, this Court pointed out the double jeopardy concernsraised by the

sua sponte exercise of the new trial remedy.See United States v. Smith, 331 U. S., at 474. Since that

time, numerous cases have concluded that courts may rem-edy unsupported jury verdicts by entering judgments of acquittal. The majority offers no principled reason for con-cluding that this more recent remedy is beyond the power of
district courts, even though the prior remedy was not.In sum, the error-correcting power that is " `inherent in
every court of justice so long as it retains control of the sub-ject matter and of the parties,' "

Morgan, 307 U. S., at 197,encompasses the kind of error at issue in this case. Therefore, absent some express indication that Congress intendedto withdraw the power that implicitly attends its initial grant
of jurisdiction, a district court acts well within its discretionwhen it sets aside a jury verdict and acquits a defendant
because the prosecution failed to prove its case.

II
Because the Acts of Congress investing federal judgeswith jurisdiction to try criminal cases are the source of a

district court's power to set aside unsupported jury verdicts,I have no occasion to disagree with the Court's view that
petitioner errs in relying on Rule 29 as the source of theDistrict Court's authority in this case. I do, however,
strongly disagree with the Court's own reliance on that Rulefor the quite different conclusion that it clearly prohibits the
power exercised by the District Court here.

In Part III of its opinion, the majority asserts that theDistrict Court's action "contradicted the plain language of

Rule 29(c), and effectively annulled the 7-day filing limit,"

517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT
444 CARLISLE v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
ante, at 426, and that "the clarity of the text" suffices toprohibit the District Court's action,

ibid. The majority assumes that these conclusory assertions follow implicitly fromits determination in Part II of its opinion that Rule 29 does

not authorize the District Court to set aside a jury verdict
sua sponte.In my view, the Rule serves three salutary purposes that

are in no tension with a district court's inherent power toenter a judgment of acquittal

sua sponte. None of these
purposes would be frustrated if the Rule were understood tocoexist with, though not to authorize, a district court's power

to avoid imposing sentence on an innocent defendant in the
truly exceptional case in which evidence of guilt is wholly
lacking.

First, subdivision (a) confirms the view that a judge has a
duty to direct an acquittal if the prosecution has failed to
prove its case at the close of evidence. The Rule's affirmation of that duty is in no way inconsistent with a court's
exercise of its postverdict power to enter sua sponte a judgment of acquittal. As then-Judge Kennedy explained for
the Ninth Circuit in Arizona v. Manypenny, 672 F. 2d, at
764: "We do not read the mention in Rule 29(a) of a court
granting such a judgment `on its own motion' before submission to a jury as an elimination of a court's inherent power
to grant such a judgment after submission to the jury."

Second, subdivision (b) accommodates the defendant's
right to move for a directed acquittal with the Government's
right to seek appellate review. Indeed, the subdivision was
amended in 1994 for the very purpose of striking a more
proper balance between those two interests. See Advisory
Committee's Notes to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b), 18 U. S. C.
App., pp. 784-785. As a result, a district court's sua sponte
decision to acquit after the jury returns a guilty verdict can
hardly be said to undermine the purpose of subdivision (b).
The defendant's interests are obviously fully protected by an
acquittal, while the Government's right to appeal is pro517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

445Cite as: 517 U. S. 416 (1996)
Stevens, J., dissenting
tected because the jury has already returned its verdict of
guilt. See United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S., at 345.5

Third, subdivision (c) requires defense counsel to file the
postverdict motion for judgment of acquittal promptly, while
the trial judge presumably retains a firm recollection of the
evidence and therefore is able to rule expeditiously and efficiently. The untimeliness of a later motion provides the
judge with a sufficient reason for denying it without even
reading it or reviewing the transcript. Thus, a judge's entirely discretionary decision to enter sua sponte an acquittal
after the 7-day period in no way annuls the 7-day deadline.
Defendants are still bound by that time limitation, and the
Rule thus serves the useful function of limiting a defendant's
right to require a judge to reconsider the sufficiency of the
evidence. As then-Judge Kennedy explained: "Rule 29(c)
creates a deadline by which defendants must present motions for judgment of acquittal to the court; it does not address the court's inherent power to grant such a judgment."
Arizona v. Manypenny, 672 F. 2d, at 764.

5 The majority is also wrong to contend that it would make a "farce" of
subdivision (b) to construe it to permit judges to act sua sponte. Ante,
at 422. There are sound reasons for setting forth regulations concerning
a court's power to reserve a defense motion that it must entertain even if
the court also possesses the entirely discretionary power to acquit at any
time on its own initiative as long as it possesses jurisdiction over the case.
For example, the new Rule 29(b) makes clear that the district court, even
if it reserves a motion for acquittal filed after the prosecution's case in
chief, may not consider any evidence submitted thereafter in disposing of
the motion. That limitation on the district court's authority protects a
defendant's right to make a motion for acquittal and to put on rebuttal
evidence without risking that new evidence of guilt will emerge. Such a
protection serves a useful function even though in the absence of a motion
to acquit a court would have the discretionary power to enter judgment
in the defendant's favor. Thus, it is simply not true that there "would be
no need" for the procedures set forth in Rule 29(b) if, "even without reserving, the court had continuing power to grant judgment of acquittal on
its own." Ibid.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The majority nevertheless maintains that the Rule mustbe read to require judges, in some instances, to enter judgments of conviction against defendants they know to be inno-cent. The majority does not argue that Rule 29 expressly
prohibits a district court from acting on its own to set asidean unsupported jury verdict. Rather, it relies solely on the
negative inference that it draws from the absence of threewords in one sentence of Rule 29(c).

Ante, at 423.6 Spe-cifically, the majority seizes upon the "notabl[e] absen[ce]" of

the phrase "on such motion" in the third sentence of theRule, ibid., and concludes that this omission "convey[s] the
idea that, where a jury has not returned a verdict, a courtcan act without motion, but where a jury has returned a
guilty verdict, it cannot," ibid.In light of the pre-Rule precedent establishing a district
court's inherent power to review sua sponte a jury verdictfor sufficiency of the evidence, see

Ansley v. United States,135 F. 2d, at 208, the majority reads far too much into the

omission. The caption to Rule 29(c) makes clear that thesubdivision only contemplates judicial action taken in response to a motion. The first sentence explains that a mo-tion may be made after a jury's discharge whether or not a
guilty verdict has been returned. The next sentence setsforth the action that the district court may take when such
a motion is filed after the jury returns a guilty verdict. Ina similar vein, the third sentence sets forth the action that
the district court may take when no verdict has been re6 Rule 29(c) reads as follows:
"(c) Motion after Discharge of Jury. If the jury returns a verdict
of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, a motion for
judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 7 days after the
jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during
the 7-day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned the court may on such
motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal. It shall not
be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has
been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury."

turned. The omission of the words "on such motion" fromthe third sentence surely just reflects a draftsman's sensible

decision to avoid a patent redundancy rather than a crypticintent to change the law by prohibiting a judge from exercising his or her inherent power to enter a judgment ofacquittal.

Common sense refutes what the text fails to compel.Under the majority's reading, Rule 29(c) establishes a most

inefficient regime for setting aside unsupported jury verdictsby requiring defendants to file appeals and collateral challenges to judgments of conviction that district judges knewto be unsupported. Given that Federal Rule of Criminal

7 The inclusion of the phrase "on such motion" in the second sentence of
Rule 29(c) is no mystery. Unlike the present Rule, the original version
of Rule 29 permitted the defendant to move either for a new trial or for
an acquittal after the jury had been discharged. The next sentences of
the original Rule stated that the district court was authorized to grant
either a new trial or an acquittal whether or not the jury returned a verdict. The inclusion of the phrase "on such motion" was necessary in order
to make clear that the judge could not order a new trial unless the defendant first requested one.

Contrary to the majority's construction of the relevant language, there
is no reason to suppose that the phrase "on such motion" in the old Rule
applied only to the circumstance in which the jury returned a verdict.
Under such a construction, the original Rule would have been intended to
"conve[y] the idea," ante, at 423, that the District Court possessed the
authority to impose a new trial against the defendant's wishes whenever
the jury had been discharged without having returned a verdict. It is
clear that the drafters never intended to convey such a potentially unconstitutional idea. Indeed, it was the drafters' concern that the original
Rule might be subject to the potentially unconstitutional "interpretation
that a motion for judgment of acquittal gives the court power to order a
new trial even though the defendant does not a wish a new trial and has
not asked for one" that led them to eliminate all references to new trial
orders in what is now Rule 29(c). Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 29, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 784-785. There is no hint in the
Advisory Committee's Notes, or the Rule's drafting history, that this limiting revision was simultaneously intended to link the district court's power
to acquit for insufficiency of the evidence with the jury's return of a
verdict.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Procedure 2 directs that the rules "shall be construed to se-cure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and

the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay," there isno reason to read the ambiguity in Rule 29(c) to prohibit a
district court from correcting a plain error that would other-wise be challenged in a subsequent court proceeding.

Indeed, our decision in United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S.267 (1970), reveals that when we previously considered Rule

29 we did not understand it to prohibit a district court from
sua sponte entering a postverdict judgment of acquittal.There, defendant's counsel moved postverdict to arrest judgment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 34. 399U. S., at 276. The District Court purported to grant the
Rule 34 motion on evidentiary and constitutional groundsthat the defendant's motion did not raise.

Id., at 277, n. 6.The Government sought review from this Court pursuant to

18 U. S. C. $ 3731, which at that time permitted governmen-tal appeals from orders arresting judgment but not from orders entering judgments of acquittal. 399 U. S., at 279-280.In holding that we lacked jurisdiction to hear the Government's appeal, we explained that although the District Courttermed its order an "arres[t] [of] judgment," it was in fact
an acquittal. Id., at 288. The portion of Justice Harlan'sopinion that five Members of the Court joined equated the
District Court's sua sponte acquittal with an acquittal by ajury. As support for the comparison, the opinion explained
that, under Rule 29, "judges, like juries, can acquit defend-ants."

Id., at 290. Moreover, it noted that Rules 29(b) and

8 The majority dismisses these concerns by suggesting that because we
agree that a district court lacks the power to enter a judgment of acquittal
after an appeal is taken, we disagree only as to "timing." Ante, at 431.
In truth, our point of disagreement is more fundamental. It concerns the
power of a court to correct a miscarriage of justice while it retains jurisdiction over a case. Because an appeal can only be taken once a judgment
has been entered, the real issue that divides us is whether the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure compel a district court to enter a judgment
of conviction against a defendant whom it knows to be innocent.

(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure "expresslyallow a federal judge to acquit a criminal defendant after the

jury `returns a verdict of guilty.' " Ibid.; see also United
States v. Weinstein, 452 F. 2d, at 713, 714 (explaining that
Sisson determined that the District Court in that case acted
within its jurisdiction in entering the postverdict judgmentof acquittal).

Although the merits of the judgment of acquittal were notbefore the Court in

Sisson, the trial court's jurisdiction to
enter the judgment plainly was. Just as a trial court's post-judgment acquittal could not have mooted a pending appeal,

neither could a jurisdictionally barred action have prevented
an appeal from being taken. Nevertheless, the Sisson
Court did not identify any jurisdictional bar to the judge's
entry of a postverdict acquittal motion, even though no Rule
29 motion had been filed. I am therefore mystified as to
why the Court now concludes that the Rule can only be read
to deprive the district court of jurisdiction to acquit postverdict in the absence of a defendant's motion.

Our prior construction of procedural rules that employ
permissive language similar to that used in Rule 29 reinforces the implicit conclusion that we reached in Sisson. As
we recently explained, our prior cases reveal that although
Congress may limit the exercise of the inherent power of
lower federal courts, " `we do not lightly assume that Congress has intended' " to do so. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,
501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991) (quoting Weinberger v. RomeroBarcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 313 (1982)). That interpretive principle suggests that something far more than an ambiguous
silence is required to withdraw a district court's inherent
power.

Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626 (1962), sets forth the
proper analysis. In Link, we rejected the argument that
the authority granted to a defendant by Rule 41 of the Rules
of Civil Procedure to move for an involuntary dismissal of
a complaint, by negative implication, precluded such a dis517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

missal on the court's own motion. In his opinion for theCourt, Justice Harlan explained:

"We do not read Rule 41(b) as implying any suchrestriction. Neither the permissive language of the
Rule--which merely authorizes a motion by the defend-ant--nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was
the purpose of the Rule to abrogate the power of courts,acting on their own initiative, to clear their calendars of
cases that have remained dormant because of the inac-tion or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief. The
authority of a court to dismiss sua sponte for lack ofprosecution has generally been considered an `inherent
power,' governed not by rule or statute but by the con-trol necessarily vested in courts to manage their own
affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious dis-position of cases." Id., at 630-631 (footnote omitted).

Our practice with respect to petitions for rehearing is alsoinstructive. Such petitions, like motions for a judgment of
acquittal, are routinely filed and almost never granted. Ifnot filed within the time specified in our Rules, it is appropriate to deny such a petition without even reading it. Onrare occasions, however, we have held that the interest in
the evenhanded administration of justice outweighs the in-terest in finality and granted such petitions even though un9 In an effort to distinguish Link, the Court asserts that the practice
of setting aside insufficient jury verdicts in criminal cases is far less
established than was the practice of dismissing cases for want of prosecution. It further contends that the "clarity of the text," ante, at 426, in
this case renders the logic of Link inapplicable. Link cannot fairly be
read to suggest that inherent powers of recent origin may be more easily
withdrawn than those of older vintage. In any event, the court's inherent
power to set aside criminal convictions unsupported by evidence has been
long accepted. Finally, given that Justice Harlan authored both Link and
Sisson, I find most unpersuasive the majority's conclusion that the "clarity
of the text" in Rule 29 should occasion a different result from that reached
in Link.

timely and even though there is not a word in our Rules thatauthorized such action.

Thus, in United States v. Ohio Power Co., 351 U. S. 980(1956), the Court on its own initiative vacated an earlier
order denying a petition for rehearing and, in the following Term, granted the previously denied petition. United
States v. Ohio Power Co., 353 U. S. 98 (1957). While Justice
Harlan dissented from that disposition, he did not disagreewith the proposition that "the Court's inherent power over

its judgments" included the authority to take action that"would otherwise be out of time under the Rules."

Id., at
104.

Just three years after the Ohio Power decision, Justice
Harlan had occasion to endorse the exercise of a District
Court's use of its inherent powers in apparent conflict with
the language of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Explaining his denial of an application for bail, he correctly
observed that those Rules should not be construed to withdraw the District Court's inherent power to revoke bail during the course of a criminal trial. See Fernandez v. United
States, 81 S. Ct. 642, 644, n. 7, 5 L. Ed. 2d 683, 685, n. 7 (1961)
(in chambers). In doing so, he exposed the basic flaw in
an argument comparable to the one accepted by the Court
today.

Justice Harlan explained that even though Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 46(a)(1) stated that a " `person arrested
for an offense not punishable by death shall be admitted to
bail,' " that Rule did not purport to withdraw the district
courts' "authority, as an incident of their inherent powers to
manage the conduct of proceedings before them, to revoke
bail during the course of a criminal trial, when such action
is appropriate to the orderly progress of the trial and the
fair administration of justice." Fernandez v. United States,
81 S. Ct., at 644, 645, n. 7, 5 L. Ed. 2d, at 685, n. 7, 686
(in chambers). He properly read the seemingly mandatory
language of Rule 46(a)(1) against a pre-Rule legal back517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
ground that afforded district courts a greater measure of discretion. Ibid.; see also United States v. Anguilo, 755 F. 2d
969, 972 (CA1 1985) (Breyer, J.). Given that Justice Harlan
also authored Link, which holds that a procedural rule permitting a dismissal on motion does not preclude a dismissal
without motion, I doubt that the majority's attempt to distinguish Fernandez would have been persuasive to its author.

Our decision in United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469
(1947), is consistent with our prior cases holding that permissive rules do not withdraw pre-existing inherent powers.10
Although the majority contends that Smith supports the inference that the draftsmen of Rule 29 intended to limit the
court's authority to take action in response to a timely motion by counsel, that case actually supports the proposition
that the adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
did not modify the pre-existing power of the district court to
set aside an erroneous judgment while it retains jurisdiction
of a case.

The error committed by Judge Smith was his attempt to
assert jurisdiction in a criminal case after the judgment of
conviction had been affirmed on appeal and even after the
defendant had started to serve his sentence. There was not
even an arguable basis for suggesting that the judge then
had jurisdiction to order a new trial. Id., at 474; see United
States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 70 (1914).11 The only theory
that might have justified his action was his lawyer's argument that the Rules had expanded the District Court's jurisdiction beyond the end of the term of court in which the trial

10 That is not to say that permissive rules establish inherent powers.
For that reason, the majority's recitation of various permissive rules for
which no analogous inherent power exists is quite beside the point. Ante,
at 431-432.

11 As the Court pointed out in United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469

(1947), new trial orders are particularly problematic because they raise
serious double jeopardy concerns. Of course, no such concerns are present here.

had been conducted. This Court's reasons for holding thatthe Rules did not enlarge that jurisdiction equally support

the proposition that they did not diminish that jurisdictioneither.

In fact, if one takes note of the extraordinary character of
Judge Smith's attempt to set aside a conviction after it hadbeen affirmed on appeal and after the defendant had been

incarcerated for several months, it is easy to understand whyJustice Jackson's opinion for the Court expressed concern
that such action might give rise to an appearance of impro-priety, and therefore provided us with the dictum concerning
possible ex parte approaches to the judge on which today's
majority relies. The suggestion that that dictum has any
relevance to the period between the return of the jury's verdict and the imposition of sentence is not only misplaced,
but also represents a highly inappropriate comment on the
integrity of the federal judiciary. Judge Smith's singularly
bizarre action a half century ago provides no basis for either
the inference or the rule that today's majority thinks the
Smith opinion supports. See Arizona v. Manypenny, 672
F. 2d, at 765, n. 10 (explaining that "Smith cannot be applied
indiscriminately outside of the particular factual context at
issue there").

The decision in Smith was a correct application of the principle that should control the disposition of this case. There
is a "power `inherent in every court of justice so long as it
retains control of the subject matter and of the parties, to
correct that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its
process.' " United States v. Morgan, 307 U. S., at 197. Of
course, that power does not survive after the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter has expired. It is surely
sufficient, however, to enable the judge to refuse to impose
sentence on a defendant when the record does not contain
evidence of guilt.

As a result, Rule 29(c) is best read to state the proper
procedures for handling and filing defense motions for acquit517US2$47I 02-07-99 17:26:51 PAGES OPINPGT

tals, but to leave unaddressed the court's authority to act onits own initiative.

12 Such a construction comports with the

sound historical and commonsense reasons for concludingthat Congress would not likely have intended to require a

district court to enter a judgment of conviction against adefendant whom it knows to be innocent.

III
A brief final word about the practical significance of to-day's holding. There is no real danger that district judges

will be burdened by a flood of untimely motions. On theother hand, the possibility that an Act of God may preclude
the timely filing of a meritorious motion cannot be denied.Because evidence of guilt is "absolutely vital to defendants,"
Wiborg, 163 U. S., at 658, that possibility, no matter how re-mote, is sufficient to justify a district court's inherent authority to avert the conviction of a legally innocent defendantdespite the absence of a timely motion. Because there is no

12 For this reason, the Government's reliance on Rule 45 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure is misplaced. Although Rule 45 generally
permits a district court to hear an untimely motion if the defendant can
demonstrate that excusable neglect caused the late filing, it specifically
prohibits a district court from extending the time for "tak[ing] any action"
under Rule 29. As I have explained, Rule 29(c) only addresses the rules
that govern a defendant's postverdict acquittal motion; it does not address
the district court's sua sponte postverdict acquittal power. Thus, while
Rule 45 serves to make clear that district courts may not entertain defense
motions for acquittal filed more than seven days after the jury's discharge,
it speaks not at all to the court's inherent power to decline to enter a
judgment of conviction sua sponte when the jury's verdict is not supported
by legally sufficient evidence.

13 The majority contends that if we accept that district courts have the

discretion to refuse to consider untimely motions for acquittal, then we
must also accept that district courts have the discretion to convict defendants whom they know to be innocent. Ante, at 431. The imaginative
suggestion that some district judges might choose to convict those they
believe to be innocent surely does not justify the conclusion that other
judges should be required to do so.

UNITED STATES v. ARMSTRONG et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-157. Argued February 26, 1996--Decided May 13, 1996
In response to their indictment on "crack" cocaine and other federal

charges, respondents filed a motion for discovery or for dismissal, alleging that they were selected for prosecution because they are black.
The District Court granted the motion over the Government's argument, among others, that there was no evidence or allegation that it
had failed to prosecute nonblack defendants. When the Government
indicated it would not comply with the discovery order, the court dismissed the case. The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that
the proof requirements for a selective-prosecution claim do not compel
a defendant to demonstrate that the Government has failed to prosecute
others who are similarly situated.

Held: For a defendant to be entitled to discovery on a claim that he was

singled out for prosecution on the basis of his race, he must make a
threshold showing that the Government declined to prosecute similarly
situated suspects of other races. Pp. 461-471.

(a) Contrary to respondents' contention, Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 16, which governs discovery in criminal cases, does not support the result reached by the Ninth Circuit in this case. Rule
16(a)(1)(C)--which, inter alia, requires the Government to permit discovery of documents that are "material to the preparation of the . . .
defense" or "intended for use by the government as evidence in chief"--
applies only to the preparation of the "defense" against the Government's case in chief, not to the preparation of selective-prosecution
claims. This reading creates a perceptible symmetry between the
types of documents referred to in the Rule. Moreover, its correctness
is established beyond peradventure by Rule 16(a)(2), which, as relevant
here, exempts from discovery the work product of Government attorneys and agents made in connection with the case's investigation. Respondents' construction of "defense" as including selective-prosecution
claims is implausible: It creates the anomaly of a defendant's being able
to examine all Government work product under Rule 16(a)(1)(C), except
that which is most pertinent, the work product in connection with his
own case, under Rule 16(a)(2). Pp. 461-463.

(b) Under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's
Due Process Clause, the decision whether to prosecute may not be based

on an arbitrary classification such as race or religion. Oyler v. Boles,
368 U. S. 448, 456. In order to prove a selective-prosecution claim, the
claimant must demonstrate that the prosecutorial policy had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Ibid.
To establish a discriminatory effect in a race case, the claimant must
show that similarly situated individuals of a different race were not
prosecuted. Ah Sin v. Wittman, 198 U. S. 500. Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U. S. 79, and Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U. S. 222, distinguished.
Although Ah Sin involved federal review of a state conviction, a similar
rule applies where the power of a federal court is invoked to challenge
an exercise of one of the core powers of the Executive Branch of the
Federal Government, the power to prosecute. Discovery imposes many
of the costs present when the Government must respond to a prima facie
case of selective prosecution. Assuming that discovery is available on
an appropriate showing in aid of a selective-prosecution claim, see Wade
v. United States, 504 U. S. 181, the justifications for a rigorous standard
of proof for the elements of such a case thus require a correspondingly
rigorous standard for discovery in aid of it. Thus, in order to establish
entitlement to such discovery, a defendant must produce credible evidence that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been
prosecuted, but were not. In this case, respondents have not met this
required threshold. Pp. 463-471.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
In this case, we consider the showing necessary for a de-fendant to be entitled to discovery on a claim that the prosecuting attorney singled him out for prosecution on the basisof his race. We conclude that respondents failed to satisfy
the threshold showing: They failed to show that the Gov-ernment declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects
of other races.In April 1992, respondents were indicted in the United
States District Court for the Central District of Californiaon charges of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute
more than 50 grams of cocaine base (crack) and conspiring todistribute the same, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841 and 846
(1988 ed. and Supp. IV), and federal firearms offenses. Forthree months prior to the indictment, agents of the Federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the NarcoticsDivision of the Inglewood, California, Police Department had
infiltrated a suspected crack distribution ring by using threeconfidential informants. On seven separate occasions during this period, the informants had bought a total of 124.3grams of crack from respondents and witnessed respondents
carrying firearms during the sales. The agents searchedthe hotel room in which the sales were transacted, arrested

more crack and a loaded gun. The agents later arrested the
other respondents as part of the ring.

In response to the indictment, respondents filed a motion
for discovery or for dismissal of the indictment, alleging that
they were selected for federal prosecution because they are
black. In support of their motion, they offered only an
affidavit by a "Paralegal Specialist," employed by the Office
of the Federal Public Defender representing one of the respondents. The only allegation in the affidavit was that, in
every one of the 24 $ 841 or $ 846 cases closed by the office
during 1991, the defendant was black. Accompanying the
affidavit was a "study" listing the 24 defendants, their race,
whether they were prosecuted for dealing cocaine as well as
crack, and the status of each case.1

The Government opposed the discovery motion, arguing,
among other things, that there was no evidence or allegation
"that the Government has acted unfairly or has prosecuted
non-black defendants or failed to prosecute them." App.
150. The District Court granted the motion. It ordered
the Government (1) to provide a list of all cases from the last
three years in which the Government charged both cocaine
and firearms offenses, (2) to identify the race of the defendants in those cases, (3) to identify what levels of law enforcement were involved in the investigations of those cases, and
(4) to explain its criteria for deciding to prosecute those
defendants for federal cocaine offenses. Id., at 161-162.

participating in the case alleged in affidavits that race played
no role in their investigation. An Assistant United StatesAttorney explained in an affidavit that the decision to prosecute met the general criteria for prosecution, because

"there was over 100 grams of cocaine base involved,over twice the threshold necessary for a ten year mandatory minimum sentence; there were multiple sales involving multiple defendants, thereby indicating a fairlysubstantial crack cocaine ring; . . . there were multiple

United States v.Wayte, 710 F. 2d 1385, 1387 (CA9 1983), aff 'd, 470 U. S. 598

(1985)). The Court of Appeals voted to rehear the case enbanc, and the en banc panel affirmed the District Court's
order of dismissal, holding that "a defendant is not requiredto demonstrate that the government has failed to prosecute
others who are similarly situated." 48 F. 3d 1508, 1516(1995) (emphasis deleted). We granted certiorari to determine the appropriate standard for discovery for a selective-prosecution claim. 516 U. S. 942 (1995).

Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals men-tioned Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which by its
terms governs discovery in criminal cases. Both partiesnow discuss the Rule in their briefs, and respondents contend that it supports the result reached by the Court ofAppeals. Rule 16 provides, in pertinent part:

"Upon request of the defendant the government shallpermit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph
books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects,

some other sanction, is the proper remedy if a court determines that a
defendant has been the victim of prosecution on the basis of his race.
Here, "it was the government itself that suggested dismissal of the indictments to the district court so that an appeal might lie." 48 F. 3d 1508,

buildings or places, or copies or portions thereof, whichare within the possession, custody or control of the government, and which are material to the preparation ofthe defendant's defense or are intended for use by the
government as evidence in chief at the trial, or wereobtained from or belong to the defendant." Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(C).
Respondents argue that documents "within the possession. . . of the government" that discuss the Government's prosecution strategy for cocaine cases are "material" to respond-ents' selective-prosecution claim. Respondents argue that
the Rule applies because any claim that "results in noncon-viction" if successful is a "defense" for the Rule's purposes,
and a successful selective-prosecution claim has that effect.Tr. of Oral Arg. 30.

We reject this argument, because we conclude that in thecontext of Rule 16 "the defendant's defense" means the defendant's response to the Government's case in chief. Whileit might be argued that as a general matter, the concept of
a "defense" includes any claim that is a "sword," challengingthe prosecution's conduct of the case, the term may encompass only the narrower class of "shield" claims, which refutethe Government's arguments that the defendant committed
the crime charged. Rule 16(a)(1)(C) tends to support the"shield-only" reading. If "defense" means an argument in
response to the prosecution's case in chief, there is a percep-tible symmetry between documents "material to the preparation of the defendant's defense," and, in the very nextphrase, documents "intended for use by the government as
evidence in chief at the trial."If this symmetry were not persuasive enough, subdivision
(a)(2) of Rule 16 establishes beyond peradventure that "de-fense" in subdivision (a)(1)(C) can refer only to defenses in
response to the Government's case in chief. Rule 16(a)(2),as relevant here, exempts from defense inspection "reports,
memoranda, or other internal government documents made

Opinion of the Court
by the attorney for the government or other governmentagents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of

the case."Under Rule 16(a)(1)(C), a defendant may examine documents material to his defense, but, under Rule 16(a)(2), he
may not examine Government work product in connec-tion with his case. If a selective-prosecution claim is a

"defense," Rule 16(a)(1)(C) gives the defendant the right toexamine Government work product in every prosecution
except his own. Because respondents' construction of"defense" creates the anomaly of a defendant's being able
to examine all Government work product except the most
pertinent, we find their construction implausible. We hold
that Rule 16(a)(1)(C) authorizes defendants to examine Government documents material to the preparation of their defense against the Government's case in chief, but not to the
preparation of selective-prosecution claims.

In Wade v. United States, 504 U. S. 181 (1992), we considered whether a federal court may review a Government decision not to file a motion to reduce a defendant's sentence
for substantial assistance to the prosecution, to determine
whether the Government based its decision on the defendant's race or religion. In holding that such a decision was
reviewable, we assumed that discovery would be available if
the defendant could make the appropriate threshold showing, although we concluded that the defendant in that case
did not make such a showing. See id., at 186. We proceed
on a like assumption here.

A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion
that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by the Constitution. Our cases delineating the necessary elements to prove a claim of selective prosecution
have taken great pains to explain that the standard is a demanding one. These cases afford a "background presumption," cf. United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U. S. 196, 203

464 UNITED STATES v. ARMSTRONG

Opinion of the Court
(1995), that the showing necessary to obtain discovery shoulditself be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.A selective-prosecution claim asks a court to exercise judicial power over a "special province" of the Executive. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 832 (1985). The Attorney Gen-eral and United States Attorneys retain " `broad discretion' "

to enforce the Nation's criminal laws. Wayte v. United
States, 470 U. S. 598, 607 (1985) (quoting United States v.
Goodwin, 457 U. S. 368, 380, n. 11 (1982)). They have thislatitude because they are designated by statute as the President's delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 3; see 28 U. S. C. $$ 516, 547.
As a result, "[t]he presumption of regularity supports" their
prosecutorial decisions and, "in the absence of clear evidence
to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties." United States v. Chemical
Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926). In the ordinary
case, "so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe
that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the
decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to
file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in
his discretion." Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 364
(1978).

Of course, a prosecutor's discretion is "subject to constitutional constraints." United States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S.
114, 125 (1979). One of these constraints, imposed by the
equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500
(1954), is that the decision whether to prosecute may not be
based on "an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or
other arbitrary classification," Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448,
456 (1962). A defendant may demonstrate that the administration of a criminal law is "directed so exclusively against a
particular class of persons . . . with a mind so unequal and

Opinion of the Court
oppressive" that the system of prosecution amounts to "apractical denial" of equal protection of the law.

Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 373 (1886).In order to dispel the presumption that a prosecutor has

not violated equal protection, a criminal defendant must
present "clear evidence to the contrary." Chemical Foundation, supra, at 14-15. We explained in Wayte why courts
are "properly hesitant to examine the decision whether toprosecute." 470 U. S., at 608. Judicial deference to the decisions of these executive officers rests in part on an assess-ment of the relative competence of prosecutors and courts.
"Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's
general deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind
of analysis the courts are competent to undertake." Id.,
at 607. It also stems from a concern not to unnecessarily
impair the performance of a core executive constitutional
function. "Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the
criminal proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by
subjecting the prosecutor's motives and decisionmaking to
outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforcement policy."
Ibid.

The requirements for a selective-prosecution claim draw
on "ordinary equal protection standards." Id., at 608. The
claimant must demonstrate that the federal prosecutorial
policy "had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated
by a discriminatory purpose." Ibid.; accord, Oyler, supra,
at 456. To establish a discriminatory effect in a race case,
the claimant must show that similarly situated individuals of
a different race were not prosecuted. This requirement has
been established in our case law since Ah Sin v. Wittman,
198 U. S. 500 (1905). Ah Sin, a subject of China, petitioned
a California state court for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking
discharge from imprisonment under a San Francisco County

517US2$48h 02-07-99 17:38:11 PAGES OPINPGT
466 UNITED STATES v. ARMSTRONG

Opinion of the Court
ordinance prohibiting persons from setting up gambling
tables in rooms barricaded to stop police from entering. Id.,
at 503. He alleged in his habeas petition "that the ordinance
is enforced `solely and exclusively against persons of the Chinese race and not otherwise.' " Id., at 507. We rejected his
contention that this averment made out a claim under the
Equal Protection Clause, because it did not allege "that the
conditions and practices to which the ordinance was directed
did not exist exclusively among the Chinese, or that there
were other offenders against the ordinance than the Chinese
as to whom it was not enforced." Id., at 507-508.

The similarly situated requirement does not make a
selective-prosecution claim impossible to prove. Twenty
years before Ah Sin, we invalidated an ordinance, also
adopted by San Francisco, that prohibited the operation of
laundries in wooden buildings. Yick Wo, 118 U. S., at 374.
The plaintiff in error successfully demonstrated that the
ordinance was applied against Chinese nationals but not
against other laundry-shop operators. The authorities had
denied the applications of 200 Chinese subjects for permits
to operate shops in wooden buildings, but granted the applications of 80 individuals who were not Chinese subjects to
operate laundries in wooden buildings "under similar conditions." Ibid. We explained in Ah Sin why the similarly
situated requirement is necessary:

"No latitude of intention should be indulged in a case
like this. There should be certainty to every intent.
Plaintiff in error seeks to set aside a criminal law of the
State, not on the ground that it is unconstitutional on its
face, not that it is discriminatory in tendency and ultimate actual operation as the ordinance was which was
passed on in the Yick Wo case, but that it was made so
by the manner of its administration. This is a matter
of proof, and no fact should be omitted to make it out
completely, when the power of a Federal court is in517US2$48h 02-07-99 17:38:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
voked to interfere with the course of criminal justice ofa State." 198 U. S., at 508 (emphasis added).

Although Ah Sin involved federal review of a state convic-tion, we think a similar rule applies where the power of
a federal court is invoked to challenge an exercise of oneof the core powers of the Executive Branch of the Federal
Government, the power to prosecute.Respondents urge that cases such as Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U. S. 79 (1986), and Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U. S. 222(1985), cut against any absolute requirement that there be a
showing of failure to prosecute similarly situated individuals.We disagree. In

Hunter, we invalidated a state law disen-franchising persons convicted of crimes involving moral

turpitude. Id., at 233. Our holding was consistent withordinary equal protection principles, including the similarly
situated requirement. There was convincing direct evi-dence that the State had enacted the provision for the purpose of disenfranchising blacks, id., at 229-231, and indisput-able evidence that the state law had a discriminatory effect
on blacks as compared to similarly situated whites: Blackswere " `by even the most modest estimates at least 1.7 times
as likely as whites to suffer disfranchisement under' " thelaw in question,

id., at 227 (quoting Underwood v. Hunter,730 F. 2d 614, 620 (CA11 1984)).

Hunter thus affords nosupport for respondents' position.

In Batson, we considered "[t]he standards for assessing aprima facie case in the context of discriminatory selection of
the venire" in a criminal trial. 476 U. S., at 96. We re-quired a criminal defendant to show "that the prosecutor has
exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the veniremembers of the defendant's race" and that this fact, the potential for abuse inherent in a peremptory strike, and "anyother relevant circumstances raise an inference that the
prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen fromthe petit jury on account of their race."

Ibid. During juryselection, the entire res gestae take place in front of the trial

Opinion of the Court
judge. Because the judge has before him the entire venire,he is well situated to detect whether a challenge to the seating of one juror is part of a "pattern" of singling out mem-bers of a single race for peremptory challenges. See

id., at
97. He is in a position to discern whether a challenge to a
black juror has evidentiary significance; the significance maydiffer if the venire consists mostly of blacks or of whites.

Similarly, if the defendant makes out a prima facie case, theprosecutor is called upon to justify only decisions made in
the very case then before the court. See id., at 97-98. Thetrial judge need not review prosecutorial conduct in relation
to other venires in other cases.

Having reviewed the requirements to prove a selectiveprosecution claim, we turn to the showing necessary to obtain discovery in support of such a claim. If discovery is
ordered, the Government must assemble from its own files
documents which might corroborate or refute the defendant's
claim. Discovery thus imposes many of the costs present
when the Government must respond to a prima facie case of
selective prosecution. It will divert prosecutors' resources
and may disclose the Government's prosecutorial strategy.
The justifications for a rigorous standard for the elements of
a selective-prosecution claim thus require a correspondingly
rigorous standard for discovery in aid of such a claim.

The parties, and the Courts of Appeals which have considered the requisite showing to establish entitlement to discovery, describe this showing with a variety of phrases, like
"colorable basis," "substantial threshold showing," Tr. of
Oral Arg. 5, "substantial and concrete basis," or "reasonable
likelihood," Brief for Respondents Martin et al. 30. However, the many labels for this showing conceal the degree
of consensus about the evidence necessary to meet it. The
Courts of Appeals "require some evidence tending to show
the existence of the essential elements of the defense," discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. United States
v. Berrios, 501 F. 2d 1207, 1211 (CA2 1974).

Opinion of the Court
In this case we consider what evidence constitutes "someevidence tending to show the existence" of the discriminatory effect element. The Court of Appeals held that a de-fendant may establish a colorable basis for discriminatory
effect without evidence that the Government has failed toprosecute others who are similarly situated to the defendant.
48 F. 3d, at 1516. We think it was mistaken in this view.The vast majority of the Courts of Appeals require the defendant to produce some evidence that similarly situated de-fendants of other races could have been prosecuted, but were
not, and this requirement is consistent with our equal protec-tion case law.

United States v. Fares, 978 F. 2d 52, 59-60(CA2 1992); United States v. Peete, 919 F. 2d 1168, 1176 (CA6

(CA4 1986); United States v. Mitchell, 778 F. 2d 1271, 1277(CA7 1985). As the three-judge panel explained, " `[s]elective prosecution' implies that a selection has taken place."21 F. 3d, at 1436.

The Court of Appeals reached its decision in part becauseit started "with the presumption that people of all races

commit all types of crimes--not with the premise that anytype of crime is the exclusive province of any particular racial or ethnic group." 48 F. 3d, at 1516-1517. It cited noauthority for this proposition, which seems contradicted by
the most recent statistics of the United States SentencingCommission. Those statistics show: More than 90% of the
persons sentenced in 1994 for crack cocaine trafficking wereblack, United States Sentencing Comm'n, 1994 Annual Report 107 (Table 45); 93.4% of convicted LSD dealers werewhite,

ibid.; and 91% of those convicted for pornography orprostitution were white, id., at 41 (Table 13). Presumptions

[prosecutors] of discriminatory purpose." Brief for United States 15.

Opinion of the Court
at war with presumably reliable statistics have no properplace in the analysis of this issue.

The Court of Appeals also expressed concern about the"evidentiary obstacles defendants face." 48 F. 3d, at 1514.
But all of its sister Circuits that have confronted the issue
have required that defendants produce some evidence of dif-ferential treatment of similarly situated members of other

races or protected classes. In the present case, if the claimof selective prosecution were well founded, it should not have
been an insuperable task to prove that persons of other raceswere being treated differently than respondents. For instance, respondents could have investigated whether similarly situated persons of other races were prosecuted by the
State of California and were known to federal law enforcement officers, but were not prosecuted in federal court. We
think the required threshold--a credible showing of different treatment of similarly situated persons--adequately balances the Government's interest in vigorous prosecution and
the defendant's interest in avoiding selective prosecution.

In the case before us, respondents' "study" did not constitute "some evidence tending to show the existence of the
essential elements of " a selective-prosecution claim. Berrios, supra, at 1211. The study failed to identify individuals
who were not black and could have been prosecuted for the
offenses for which respondents were charged, but were not
so prosecuted. This omission was not remedied by respondents' evidence in opposition to the Government's motion for
reconsideration. The newspaper article, which discussed
the discriminatory effect of federal drug sentencing laws,
was not relevant to an allegation of discrimination in decisions to prosecute. Respondents' affidavits, which recounted one attorney's conversation with a drug treatment
center employee and the experience of another attorney defending drug prosecutions in state court, recounted hearsay
and reported personal conclusions based on anecdotal evidence. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consist-ent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, but in its discussion of Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 only to the extent of its application to the issue in this case.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
I do not understand the Court to have created a "major
limitation" on the scope of discovery available under FederalRule of Criminal Procedure 16. See

post, at 475 (Breyer,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As I seeit, the Court has decided a precise issue: whether the phrase

"defendant's defense," as used in Rule 16(a)(1)(C), encompasses allegations of selective prosecution. I agree withthe Court, for reasons the opinion states, that subdivision

(a)(1)(C) does not apply to selective prosecution claims. TheCourt was not called upon to decide here whether Rule
16(a)(1)(C) applies in any other context, for example, to af-firmative defenses unrelated to the merits. With the caveat
that I do not read today's opinion as precedent foreclosing
issues not tendered for review, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I write separately because, in my view, Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16 does not limit a defendant's discovery rights to documents related to the Government's case in
chief. Ante, at 462-463. The Rule says that "the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy" certain
physical items (I shall summarily call them "documents")
"which are material to the preparation of the defendant's defense." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(C). A "defendant's
defense" can take many forms, including (1) a simple re517US2$48Q 02-07-99 17:38:11 PAGES OPINPGT
472 UNITED STATES v. ARMSTRONG

Opinion of Breyer, J.
sponse to the Government's case in chief, (2) an affirmativedefense unrelated to the merits (such as a Speedy Trial Act

claim), (3) an unrelated claim of constitutional right, (4) aforeseeable surrebuttal to a likely Government rebuttal, and
others. The Rule's language does not limit its scope to the
first item on this list. To interpret the Rule in this limitedway creates a legal distinction that, from a discovery perspective, is arbitrary. It threatens to create two full parallelsets of criminal discovery principles. And, as far as I can
tell, the interpretation lacks legal support.The Court bases its interpretation upon what it says is a
"perceptible symmetry," ante, at 462, between two phrasesin Rule 16(a)(1)(C)--the phrase "material to the preparation
of the defendant's defense," and the next phrase, "intended
for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial."To test the Court's argument, consider these two phrases in

context. The Rule says:

"Upon request of the defendant the government shall
permit the defendant to inspect and copy [documentsand other items] . . . which [1] are material to the preparation of the defendant's defense or [2] are intended foruse by the government as evidence in chief at the trial,
or [3] were obtained from or belong to the defendant."Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(C).

Though symmetry may reside in the eye of the beholder, Ican find no relevant symmetry here. Rather, the language
suggests a simple three-part categorization of the documentsand other physical items that the Rule requires the Government to make available to the defendant. From a purely
linguistic perspective, there is no more reason to import into
the first category a case-in-chief-related limitation (from the
second category) than some kind of defendant's-belongingsrelated limitation (from the third category).

Rule 16 creates these three categories for a reason that
belies "symmetry"--namely, to specify two sets of items (the

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Government's case in chief evidence, the defendant's belong-ings) that the Government must make available to the

defendant without a preliminary showing of "materiality."The Rule's first category creates a residual classification
(items "material to the preparation of the defendant's defense") that require a preliminary "materiality" showing.The Committee thought, however, that "[l]imiting the rule

to situations in which the defendant can show that the evi-dence is material seems unwise. . . . For this reason subdivision (a)(1)(C) also contains language to compel disclosure ifthe government intends to use the property as evidence at
the trial or if the property was obtained from or belongs to
the defendant." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 16, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 762 (second and third categories added to specify that, without a special showing of
materiality, certain items are almost always "material")
(citing 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 254,
p. 510, n. 58, p. 513, n. 70 (1969)). Nothing in the Notes, or

in the Rule's language, suggests that the residual category
of items "material to the preparation of the defendant's
defense," means to cover only those items related to the case
in chief.

The only other reason the majority advances in support of
its "case in chief " limitation concerns a later part of the Rule,
subdivision 16(a)(2). As relevant here, that subdivision exempts Government attorney work product from certain of
Rule 16's disclosure requirements. In the majority's view,
since (1) a defendant asserting a valid "selective prosecution"
defense would likely need prosecution work product to make
his case, but (2) the Rule exempts prosecution work product
from discovery, then (3) the Rule must have some kind of
implicit limitation (such as a "case in chief " limitation) that
makes it irrelevant to defense efforts to assert "selective
prosecution" defenses.

The majority's conclusion, however, does not follow from
its premises. For one thing, Rule 16's work-product excep517US2$48Q 02-07-99 17:38:11 PAGES OPINPGT
474 UNITED STATES v. ARMSTRONG

Opinion of Breyer, J.
tion may itself contain implicit exceptions. After all, "[t]heprivilege derived from the work-product doctrine is not absolute." United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 239 (1975);see also 8 C. Wright, A. Miller, & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2022, p. 324 (2d ed. 1994) (in civil context, work product "is discoverable only on a substantialshowing of `necessity or justification' ") (quoting

Hickman v.
Taylor, 329 U. S. 495, 510 (1947)); J. Ghent, Development,Since Hickman v. Taylor, of Attorney's "Work Product" Doctrine, 35 A. L. R. 3d 412, 465-469, $ 25 (1971) (in civil context,work-product protection is not absolute, but is a "qualified
privilege or immunity"). To the extent such a reading permits a defendant to obtain "work product" in an appropriate
case (say, with a strong prima facie showing of selective
prosecution), the Court's problem does not exist. Of course,
to read the work-product exception as containing some such
implicit exception itself represents a departure from the
Rule's literal language. But, is it not far easier to believe
the Rule's authors intended some such small implicit exception to an exception, consistent with the language and
purpose of the Rule, than that they intended the very large
exception created by the Court?

For another thing, even if one reads the work-product
exception literally, the Court's problem disappears as long
as courts can supplement Rule 16 discovery with discovery
based upon other legal principles. The language of the
work-product exception suggests the possibility of such supplementation, for it says, not that work product is "exemp[t]"
from discovery, ante, at 462, but that "this rule" does not
authorize discovery of the prosecutor's work product. Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 16(a)(2). The Advisory Committee's Notes
make clear that the Committee believed that other rules of
law may authorize (or require) discovery not mentioned in
the Rule. See, e. g., Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule
16, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 762, 763 (discussion of Brady v.

Thus the work-product immunity for discovery in Rule16(a)(2) prohibits discovery under Rule 16 but it does not
alter the prosecutor's duty to disclose material that is withinBrady") (footnotes omitted). Of course, the majority, in a
sense, reads the Rule as permitting supplementation, but it
does more. It goes well beyond the added (say, constitutionally related) rule supplementation needed to overcome its
problem; instead, it shrinks the Rule by unnecessarily creating a major limitation on its scope.

Finally, and in any event, here the defendants sought discovery of information that is not work product. See ante,
at 459. Thus, we need not decide whether in an appropriate
case it would be necessary to find an implicit exception to
the language of Rule 16(a)(2), or to find an independent
constitutional source for the discovery, or to look for some
other basis.

In sum, neither the alleged "symmetry" in the structure
of Rule 16(a)(1)(C), nor the work-product exception of Rule
16(a)(2), supports the majority's limitation of discovery under
Rule 16(a)(1)(C) to documents related to the Government's
"case in chief." Rather, the language and legislative history
make clear that the Rule's drafters meant it to provide a
broad authorization for defendants' discovery, to be supplemented if necessary in an appropriate case. Whether or not
one can also find a basis for this kind of discovery in other
sources of law, Rule 16(a)(1)(C) provides one such source, and
we should consider whether the defendants' discovery request satisfied the Rule's requirement that the discovery be
"material to the preparation of the defendant's defense."

I believe that the defendants' request did not satisfy this
threshold. Were the "selective prosecution" defense valid
in this case--i. e., were there "clear evidence," United States
v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14 (1926), that the
Federal Government's prosecutorial policy "had a discriminatory effect and . . . was motivated by a discriminatory purpose," Wayte v. United States, 470 U. S. 598, 608 (1985), it

should have been fairly easy for the defendants to find, not
only instances in which the Federal Government prosecuted
African-Americans, but also some instances in which the
Federal Government did not prosecute similarly situated
caucasians. The defendants' failure to do so, for the reasons
the Court sets forth, amounts to a failure to make the necessary threshold showing in respect to materiality. See 2
C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 254, pp. 66-67
(2d ed. 1982); United States v. Balk, 706 F. 2d 1056, 1060

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Federal prosecutors are respected members of a respected
profession. Despite an occasional misstep, the excellence
of their work abundantly justifies the presumption that
"they have properly discharged their official duties."
United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1,
14-15 (1926). Nevertheless, the possibility that political or
racial animosity may infect a decision to institute criminal
proceedings cannot be ignored. Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S.
448, 456 (1962). For that reason, it has long been settled
that the prosecutor's broad discretion to determine when
criminal charges should be filed is not completely unbridled.
As the Court notes, however, the scope of judicial review of
particular exercises of that discretion is not fully defined.

The United States Attorney for the Central District ofCalifornia is a member and an officer of the bar of that District Court. As such, she has a duty to the judges of thatCourt to maintain the standards of the profession in the performance of her official functions. If a District Judge has
reason to suspect that she, or a member of her staff, hassingled out particular defendants for prosecution on the basis

of their race, it is surely appropriate for the judge to deter-mine whether there is a factual basis for such a concern. I
agree with the Court that Rule 16 of the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure is not the source of the District Court's
power to make the necessary inquiry. I disagree, however,
with its implicit assumption that a different, relatively rigid
rule needs to be crafted to regulate the use of this seldomexercised inherent judicial power. See Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 16, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 761 (Rule 16 is
"not intended to limit the judge's discretion to order broader
discovery in appropriate cases").

The Court correctly concludes that in this case the facts
presented to the District Court in support of respondents'
claim that they had been singled out for prosecution because
of their race were not sufficient to prove that defense.
Moreover, I agree with the Court that their showing was not
strong enough to give them a right to discovery, either under
Rule 16 or under the District Court's inherent power to
order discovery in appropriate circumstances. Like Chief
Judge Wallace of the Court of Appeals, however, I am persuaded that the District Judge did not abuse her discretion
when she concluded that the factual showing was sufficiently
disturbing to require some response from the United States
Attorney's Office. See 48 F. 3d 1508, 1520-1521 (CA9 1995).
Perhaps the discovery order was broader than necessary, but
I cannot agree with the Court's apparent conclusion that no
inquiry was permissible.

The District Judge's order should be evaluated in light of
three circumstances that underscore the need for judicial

Stevens, J., dissenting
vigilance over certain types of drug prosecutions. First, the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation established a regime of extremely high penalties for the possession and distribution of so-called "crack" cocaine.1 Those
provisions treat one gram of crack as the equivalent of 100
grams of powder cocaine. The distribution of 50 grams of
crack is thus punishable by the same mandatory minimum
sentence of 10 years in prison that applies to the distribution
of 5,000 grams of powder cocaine.2 The Sentencing Guidelines extend this ratio to penalty levels above the mandatory
minimums: For any given quantity of crack, the guideline
range is the same as if the offense had involved 100 times
that amount in powder cocaine.3 These penalties result in
sentences for crack offenders that average three to eight
times longer than sentences for comparable powder offenders.4 United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report
to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 145
(Feb. 1995) (hereinafter Special Report).

1 100 Stat. 3207, 21 U. S. C. $ 841 et seq.
2 Compare 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) with $ 841(b)(1)(A)(ii). Similarly, a mandatory 5-year sentence is prescribed for distribution of 500
grams of cocaine or 5 grams of crack. Compare $ 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) with

$ 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). Simple possession of 5 grams of crack also produces a
mandatory 5-year sentence. The maximum sentence for possession of
any quantity of other drugs is one year. $ 844(a).

With one prior felony drug offense, the sentence for distribution of 50
grams of crack is a mandatory 20 years to life. $ 841(b)(1)(A). With two
prior felony drug offenses, the sentence is a mandatory life term without
parole. Ibid.

3 See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 2D1.1(c) (Nov. 1995) (USSG).

4 Under the Guidelines, penalties increase at a slower rate than drug

quantities. For example, 5 grams of heroin result in a base offense level
of 14 (15-21 months) while 10 grams of heroin (double the amount) result
in an offense level of 16 (21-27 months). USSG $$ 2D1.1(c)(13), (12).
Thus, the 100-to-1 ratio does not translate into sentences that are 100
times as long.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Second, the disparity between the treatment of crack co-caine and powder cocaine is matched by the disparity between the severity of the punishment imposed by federal lawand that imposed by state law for the same conduct. For a
variety of reasons, often including the absence of mandatoryminimums, the existence of parole, and lower baseline penalties, terms of imprisonment for drug offenses tend to be sub-stantially lower in state systems than in the federal system.
The difference is especially marked in the case of crack of-fenses. The majority of States draw no distinction between
types of cocaine in their penalty schemes; of those that do,none has established as stark a differential as the Federal
Government. See id., at x, 129-138. For example, if re-spondent Hampton is found guilty, his federal sentence might
be as long as a mandatory life term. Had he been tried instate court, his sentence could have been as short as 12
years, less worktime credits of half that amount.5Finally, it is undisputed that the brunt of the elevated
federal penalties falls heavily on blacks. While 65% ofthe persons who have used crack are white, in 1993 they

5 Hampton was charged with conspiracy to distribute, four counts of
crack distribution, and the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a
drug crime. According to an information filed by the Government, Hampton had three prior convictions for felony drug offenses. See Information
Establishing Prior Felony Narcotics Convictions (June 24, 1992). Therefore, he potentially faces a mandatory life sentence on the drug charges
alone.

Under California law at the time of the offenses, possession for sale of
cocaine base involving 50 grams carried a penalty of imprisonment for
either three, four, or five years. Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11351.5
(West 1988). If the defendant had no prior convictions, he could be
granted probation. $ 11370. For each prior felony drug conviction, the
defendant received an additional 3-year sentence. $ 11370.2. Thus, with
three priors and the possibility of worktime reductions, see Cal. Penal
Code Ann. $ 2933 (West Supp. 1996), Hampton could have served as little
as six years under California law. Since the time of the offenses, California has raised several of these penalties, but the new punishments could
not be applied to respondents.

represented only 4% of the federal offenders convicted oftrafficking in crack. Eighty-eight percent of such defendants were black. Id., at 39, 161. During the first 18 monthsof full guideline implementation, the sentencing disparity between black and white defendants grew from preguideline
levels: Blacks on average received sentences over 40% longerthan whites. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sentencing

in the Federal Courts: Does Race Matter? 6-7 (Dec. 1993).Those figures represent a major threat to the integrity of
federal sentencing reform, whose main purpose was theelimination of disparity (especially racial) in sentencing.
The Sentencing Commission acknowledges that the heightened crack penalties are a "primary cause of the growing
disparity between sentences for Black and White federal
defendants." Special Report 163.

The extraordinary severity of the imposed penalties and
the troubling racial patterns of enforcement give rise to a
special concern about the fairness of charging practices for
crack offenses. Evidence tending to prove that black defendants charged with distribution of crack in the Central
District of California are prosecuted in federal court,
whereas members of other races charged with similar offenses are prosecuted in state court, warrants close scrutiny
by the federal judges in that district. In my view, the District Judge, who has sat on both the federal and the state
benches in Los Angeles, acted well within her discretion to
call for the development of facts that would demonstrate
what standards, if any, governed the choice of forum where
similarly situated offenders are prosecuted.

Respondents submitted a study showing that of all cases
involving crack offenses that were closed by the Federal
Public Defender's Office in 1991, 24 out of 24 involved black
defendants. To supplement this evidence, they submitted
affidavits from two of the attorneys in the defense team.
The first reported a statement from an intake coordinator at
a local drug treatment center that, in his experience, an

equal number of crack users and dealers were caucasian asbelonged to minorities. App. 138. The second was from

David R. Reed, counsel for respondent Armstrong. Reedwas both an active court-appointed attorney in the Central
District of California and one of the directors of the leading
association of criminal defense lawyers who practice beforethe Los Angeles County courts. Reed stated that he did

not recall "ever handling a [crack] cocaine case involvingnon-black defendants" in federal court, nor had he even
heard of one. Id., at 140. He further stated that "[t]hereare many crack cocaine sales cases prosecuted in state court
that do involve racial groups other than blacks." Id., at 141
(emphasis in original).

The majority discounts the probative value of the affidavits, claiming that they recounted "hearsay" and reported
"personal conclusions based on anecdotal evidence." Ante,
at 470. But the Reed affidavit plainly contained more than
mere hearsay; Reed offered information based on his own
extensive experience in both federal and state courts.
Given the breadth of his background, he was well qualified
to compare the practices of federal and state prosecutors.
In any event, the Government never objected to the admission of either affidavit on hearsay or any other grounds. See
48 F. 3d, at 1518, n. 8. It was certainly within the District
Court's discretion to credit the affidavits of two members of
the bar of that Court, at least one of whom had presumably
acquired a reputation by his frequent appearances there, and
both of whose statements were made on pains of perjury.

The criticism that the affidavits were based on "anecdotal
evidence" is also unpersuasive. I thought it was agreed that
defendants do not need to prepare sophisticated statistical
studies in order to receive mere discovery in cases like this
one. Certainly evidence based on a drug counselor's personal observations or on an attorney's practice in two sets of
courts, state and federal, can " `ten[d] to show the existence' "
of a selective prosecution. Ante, at 468.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Even if respondents failed to carry their burden of show-ing that there were individuals who were not black but who

could have been prosecuted in federal court for the sameoffenses, it does not follow that the District Court abused its
discretion in ordering discovery. There can be no doubt that
such individuals exist, and indeed the Government has never
denied the same. In those circumstances, I fail to see why
the District Court was unable to take judicial notice of this
obvious fact and demand information from the Government's
files to support or refute respondents' evidence. The presumption that some whites are prosecuted in state court is
not "contradicted" by the statistics the majority cites, which
show only that high percentages of blacks are convicted of
certain federal crimes, while high percentages of whites are
convicted of other federal crimes. See ante, at 469-470.
Those figures are entirely consistent with the allegation of
selective prosecution. The relevant comparison, rather,
would be with the percentages of blacks and whites who
commit those crimes. But, as discussed above, in the case
of crack far greater numbers of whites are believed guilty
of using the substance. The District Court, therefore, was
entitled to find the evidence before it significant and to require some explanation from the Government.6

6 Also telling was the Government's response to respondents' evidentiary showing. It submitted a list of more than 3,500 defendants who had
been charged with federal narcotics violations over the previous three
years. It also offered the names of 11 nonblack defendants whom it
had prosecuted for crack offenses. All 11, however, were members of
other racial or ethnic minorities. See 48 F. 3d 1508, 1511 (CA9 1995).
The District Court was authorized to draw adverse inferences from the
Government's inability to produce a single example of a white defendant,
especially when the very purpose of its exercise was to allay the court's
concerns about the evidence of racially selective prosecutions. As another court has said: "Statistics are not, of course, the whole answer, but
nothing is as emphatic as zero . . . ." United States v. Hinds County
School Bd., 417 F. 2d 852, 858 (CA5 1969) (per curiam).

Stevens, J., dissenting
In sum, I agree with the Sentencing Commission that"[w]hile the exercise of discretion by prosecutors and investigators has an impact on sentences in almost all cases to someextent, because of the 100-to-1 quantity ratio and federal
mandatory minimum penalties, discretionary decisions incocaine cases often have dramatic effects." Special Report
138.7 The severity of the penalty heightens both the dangerof arbitrary enforcement and the need for careful scrutiny
of any colorable claim of discriminatory enforcement. Cf.
McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 366 (1987) (Stevens, J.,dissenting). In this case, the evidence was sufficiently disturbing to persuade the District Judge to order discoverythat might help explain the conspicuous racial pattern of
cases before her court. I cannot accept the majority's con-clusion that the District Judge either exceeded her power or
abused her discretion when she did so. I therefore respect-fully dissent.

7 For this and other reasons, the Sentencing Commission in its Special
Report to Congress "strongly recommend[ed] against a 100-to-1 quantity
ratio." Special Report 198. The Commission shortly thereafter, by a
4-to-3 vote, amended the Guidelines so as to equalize the treatment of
crack and other forms of cocaine, and proposed modification of the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack offenses. See Statement
of Commission Majority in Support of Recommended Changes in Cocaine
and Federal Sentencing Policy (May 1, 1995). In October 1995, Congress
overrode the Sentencing Commission's Guideline amendments. See Pub.
L. 104-38, 109 Stat. 334. Nevertheless, Congress at the same time directed the Commission to submit recommendations regarding changes to
the statutory and guideline penalties for cocaine distribution, including
specifically "revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder
cocaine." $ 2(a).

44 LIQUORMART, INC., et al. v. RHODE ISLAND

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 94-1140. Argued November 1, 1995--Decided May 13, 1996
Petitioners, a licensed Rhode Island liquor retailer and a licensed Massachusetts liquor retailer patronized by Rhode Island residents, filed this
action seeking a declaratory judgment that Rhode Island laws banning
the advertisement of retail liquor prices except at the place of sale violate the First Amendment. In concluding that the ban was unconstitutional because it did not directly advance the State's asserted interest
in the promotion of temperance and was more extensive than necessary
to serve that interest, the District Court reasoned that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of
justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did not shift or diminish that burden. In reversing, the Court of Appeals, inter alia,
found "inherent merit" in the State's submission that competitive price
advertising would ultimately increase sales, and agreed with it that the
Twenty-first Amendment gave its advertising ban an added presumption of validity.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
39 F. 3d 5, reversed.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, VII, and VIII, concluding:

1. The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save Rhode Island's price
advertising ban because that Amendment does not qualify the First
Amendment's prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech.
Although the Twenty-first Amendment--which repealed Prohibition
and gave the States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use of,
alcoholic beverages--limits the dormant Commerce Clause's effect on a
State's regulatory power over the delivery or use of liquor within its
borders, the Amendment does not license the States to ignore their
obligations under other constitutional provisions. See, e. g., Capital
Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712. California v. LaRue, 409
U. S. 109, 118-119, disavowed. Because the First Amendment must
be included among those other provisions, the Twenty-first Amendment does not shield the advertising ban from constitutional scrutiny.
Pp. 514-516.

2. Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of justifying its complete ban on price advertising, that ban is invalid. P. 516.

Justice Stevens delivered the principal opinion with respect to
Parts III-VI, concluding that Rhode Island's ban on advertisements
that provide the public with accurate information about retail liquor

prices is an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech.
Pp. 495-514.

(a) Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part III that although the
First Amendment protects the dissemination of truthful and nonmisleading commercial messages about lawful products and services in
order to ensure that consumers receive accurate information, see, e. g.,
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 765, the special nature of commercial speech, including its "greater objectivity" and "greater hardiness," authorizes the
State to regulate potentially deceptive or overreaching advertising
more freely than other forms of protected speech, see, e. g., id., at 771-
772, n. 24, and requires less than strict review of such regulations, Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, 566, n. 9. However, regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a policy not related to consumer protection must be reviewed with "special care," and such blanket bans
should not be approved unless the speech itself was flawed in some way,
either because it was deceptive or related to unlawful activity. See
ibid. Pp. 495-500.

(b) Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice
Ginsburg, concluded in Part IV that a review of the case law reveals
that commercial speech regulations are not all subject to a similar form
of constitutional review simply because they target a similar category
of expression. When a State regulates commercial messages to protect
consumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or
requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the regulation's purpose is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional
protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict
review. However, where a State entirely prohibits the dissemination
of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated
to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason
to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally
demands. The special dangers that attend such complete bans--including, most obviously, the fact that they all but foreclose alternative channels of communication--present sound reasons that justify more careful
review. Pp. 501-504.

(c) Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part V that because Rhode
Island's advertising ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product, and serves an end

Syllabus
unrelated to consumer protection, it must be reviewed with "special
care" under Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9. It cannot survive
that review because it does not satisfy even the less than strict standard
that generally applies in commercial speech cases under Central Hudson, id., at 566. First, the advertising ban does not directly advance
the State's substantial interest in promoting temperance. See ibid.
Because a commercial speech regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose,
id., at 564, the State bears the burden of showing not merely that its
regulation will advance its interest, but also that it will do so "to a
material degree," see, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767. In
this case, therefore, the State must show that the ban will significantly
reduce alcohol consumption, but has presented no evidence to suggest a
significant reduction. Second, the ban is more extensive than necessary
to serve its stated interest, see 447 U. S., at 566, since alternative forms
of regulation that would not involve any speech restrictions--e. g., the
maintenance of higher prices either by direct regulation or by increased
taxation, the rationing of per capita purchases, or the use of educational
campaigns focused on drinking problems--would be more likely to
achieve the goal of promoting temperance. Thus, the State has failed
to establish the requisite "reasonable fit" between its regulation and its
goal. See, e. g., Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.
469, 480. Pp. 504-508.

(d) Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Kennedy, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part VI that the State's
arguments in support of its claim that it merely exercised appropriate
"legislative judgment" in determining that a price advertising ban
would best promote temperance--i. e., (1) that because expert opinions
as to the effectiveness of the ban "go both ways," the Court of Appeals
correctly concluded that the ban constituted a "reasonable choice" by
the legislature; (2) that precedent requires that particular deference be
accorded that legislative choice because the State could, if it chose, ban
the sale of alcoholic beverages outright; and (3) that deference is appropriate because alcoholic beverages are so-called "vice" products--must
be rejected. See Rubin, 514 U. S., at 482-483, n. 2. United States v.
Edge Broadcasting, 509 U. S. 418, distinguished; Posadas de Puerto
Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328, distinguished and
disavowed in part. Pp. 508-514.

Justice Scalia concluded that guidance as to what the First Amendment forbids, where the core offense of suppressing particular political
ideas is not at issue, must be taken from the long accepted practices of
the American people. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514
U. S. 334, 375 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Since, however, the Court has
before it no evidence as to state legislative practices regarding regula517US2$49Z 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT

tion of commercial speech when the First and Fourteenth Amendments
were adopted, or even as to any national consensus on the subject later
developed, he would simply adhere to the Court's existing jurisprudence, which renders the Rhode Island regulation invalid. Pp. 517-518.

Justice Thomas concluded that in cases such as this, in which the
government's asserted interest is to keep legal users of a product or
service ignorant in order to manipulate their choices in the marketplace,
the Central Hudson balancing test should not be applied. Rather, such
an "interest" is per se illegitimate, cf., e. g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy
v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 768-770,
and can no more justify regulation of "commercial" speech than it can
justify regulation of "noncommercial" speech. Pp. 518-528.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Souter,
and Justice Breyer, agreed with the principal opinion that Rhode
Island's prohibition on alcohol-price advertising is invalid and cannot be
saved by the Twenty-first Amendment, but concluded that the First
Amendment question must be resolved more narrowly by applying the
test established in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566. Assuming that the prohibition
satisfies the test's first three prongs--i. e., that (1) the speech at issue
concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, (2) the asserted governmental interest is substantial, and (3) the regulation directly advances
the governmental interest--Rhode Island's regulation fails the final
fourth prong because its ban is more extensive than necessary to serve
its stated interest. Rhode Island justifies its ban on price advertising
on the ground that the ban is intended to keep alcohol prices high as a
way to keep consumption low. In order for a speech restriction to pass
muster under the fourth prong, there must be a reasonable fit between
the legislature's goal and method. Board of Trustees of State Univ. of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480. The fit here is not reasonable, since the
State has other methods at its disposal--e. g., establishing minimum
prices and/or increasing sales taxes on alcoholic beverages--that would
more directly accomplish its stated goal without intruding on sellers'
ability to provide truthful, nonmisleading information to customers.
Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S.
328, 341-344, distinguished. The principal opinion errs in adopting a
new analysis for the evaluation of commercial speech regulation.

Last Term we held that a federal law abridging a brewer'sright to provide the public with accurate information about

the alcoholic content of malt beverages is unconstitutional.
Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 491 (1995). Wenow hold that Rhode Island's statutory prohibition against

advertisements that provide the public with accurate infor-mation about retail prices of alcoholic beverages is also invalid. Our holding rests on the conclusion that such an ad-vertising ban is an abridgment of speech protected by the
First Amendment and that it is not shielded from constitu-tional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment.

I
In 1956, the Rhode Island Legislature enacted two sepa-rate prohibitions against advertising the retail price of alcoholic beverages. The first applies to vendors licensed inRhode Island as well as to out-of-state manufacturers, wholesalers, and shippers. It prohibits them from "advertising inany manner whatsoever" the price of any alcoholic beverage
offered for sale in the State; the only exception is for pricetags or signs displayed with the merchandise within licensed
premises and not visible from the street.2 The second stat1 Although the text of the First Amendment states that "Congress shall
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," the
Amendment applies to the States under the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. See Board of Ed., Island Trees Union Free
School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 855, n. 1 (1982); Grosjean v.
American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 244 (1936); Gitlow v. New York, 268
U. S. 652, 666 (1925).

2 Rhode Island Gen. Laws $ 3-8-7 (1987) provides:

"Advertising price of malt beverages, cordials, wine or distilled liquor.--
No manufacturer, wholesaler, or shipper from without this state and no
holder of a license issued under the provisions of this title and chapter

Opinion of the Court
ute applies to the Rhode Island news media. It contains acategorical prohibition against the publication or broadcast

of any advertisements--even those referring to sales inother States--that "make reference to the price of any alcoholic beverages." 3In two cases decided in 1985, the Rhode Island Supreme
Court reviewed the constitutionality of these two statutes.In

S&S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d 729, a liquorretailer located in Westerly, Rhode Island, a town that borders the State of Connecticut, having been advised that hislicense would be revoked if he advertised his prices in a Connecticut paper, sought to enjoin enforcement of the first stat-ute. Over the dissent of one justice, the court upheld the
statute. It concluded that the statute served the substantialstate interest in " `the promotion of temperance.' "

4 Id., at

shall cause or permit the advertising in any manner whatsoever of the
price of any malt beverage, cordials, wine or distilled liquor offered for
sale in this state; provided, however, that the provisions of this section
shall not apply to price signs or tags attached to or placed on merchandise
for sale within the licensed premises in accordance with rules and regulations of the department."

Regulation 32 of the Rules and Regulations of the Liquor Control
Administrator provides that no placard or sign that is visible from the
exterior of a package store may make any reference to the price of any
alcoholic beverage. App. 2 to Brief for Petitioners.

3 Rhode Island Gen. Laws $ 3-8-8.1 (1987) provides:

"Price advertising by media or advertising companies unlawful.--No
newspaper, periodical, radio or television broadcaster or broadcasting
company or any other person, firm or corporation with a principal place of
business in the state of Rhode Island which is engaged in the business of
advertising or selling advertising time or space shall accept, publish, or
broadcast any advertisement in this state of the price or make reference
to the price of any alcoholic beverages. Any person who shall violate any
of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . ."
The statute authorizes the liquor control administrator to exempt trade
journals from its coverage. Ibid.

4 "We also have little difficulty in finding that the asserted governmental

interests, herein described as the promotion of temperance and the reasonable control of the traffic in alcoholic beverages, are substantial. We note,

Opinion of the Court
737. Because the plaintiff failed to prove that the statute
did not serve that interest, the court held that he had not
carried his burden of establishing a violation of the First
Amendment. In response to the dissent's argument that the
court had placed the burden on the wrong party, the majority
reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statute
" `an added presumption [of] validity.' " Id., at 732. Although that presumption had not been overcome in that case,
the State Supreme Court assumed that in a future case the
record might "support the proposition that these advertising
restrictions do not further temperance objectives." Id., at
734.

In Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call Pub.
Co., 497 A. 2d 331, the plaintiff association 5 sought to enjoin
the publisher of the local newspaper in Woonsocket, Rhode
Island, from accepting advertisements disclosing the retail
price of alcoholic beverages being sold across the state line
in Millville, Massachusetts. In upholding the injunction, the

parenthetically, that the word `temperance' is oftentimes mistaken as a
synonym for `abstinence.' It is not. Webster's Third New International
Dictionary (1961) defines `temperance' as `moderation in or abstinence
from the use of intoxicating drink.' The Rhode Island Legislature has
the authority, derived from the state's inherent police power, to enact a
variety of laws designed to suppress intemperance or to minimize the acknowledged evils of liquor traffic. Thus, there can be no question that
these asserted interests are indeed substantial. Oklahoma Telecasters
Association v. Crisp, 699 F. 2d at 500." S&S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497 A. 2d, at 733-734.

In her dissent in Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call
Pub. Co., 497 A. 2d 331 (R. I. 1985), Justice Murray suggested that the
advertising ban was motivated, at least in part, by an interest in protecting small retailers from price competition. Id., at 342, n. 10. This suggestion is consistent with the position taken by respondent Rhode Island
Liquor Stores Association in this case. We, however, accept the State
Supreme Court's identification of the relevant state interest served by
the legislation.

5 The plaintiff in that case is a respondent in this case and has filed other

actions enforcing the price advertising ban. See id., at 333.

492 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
State Supreme Court adhered to its reasoning in the Pastorecase and rejected the argument that the statute neither "directly advanced" the state interest in promoting temperance,nor was "more extensive than necessary to serve that interest" as required by this Court's decision in Central Hudson
Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.557, 563 (1980). It assumed the existence of other, "perhaps

more effective means" of achieving the State's "goal of tem-perance," but concluded that it was "not unreasonable for the
State of Rhode Island to believe that price advertising willresult in increased sales of alcoholic beverages generally."
Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call Pub. Co.,497 A. 2d, at 336.

II
Petitioners 44 Liquormart, Inc. (44 Liquormart), andPeoples Super Liquor Stores, Inc. (Peoples), are licensed

retailers of alcoholic beverages. Petitioner 44 Liquormartoperates a store in Rhode Island and petitioner Peoples operates several stores in Massachusetts that are patronized byRhode Island residents. Peoples uses alcohol price advertising extensively in Massachusetts, where such advertisingis permitted, but Rhode Island newspapers and other media
outlets have refused to accept such ads.Complaints from competitors about an advertisement
placed by 44 Liquormart in a Rhode Island newspaper in1991 generated enforcement proceedings that in turn led to
the initiation of this litigation. The advertisement did not
state the price of any alcoholic beverages. Indeed, it notedthat "State law prohibits advertising liquor prices." The ad

did, however, state the low prices at which peanuts, potato
chips, and Schweppes mixers were being offered, identifyvarious brands of packaged liquor, and include the word

"WOW" in large letters next to pictures of vodka and rumbottles. Based on the conclusion that the implied reference
to bargain prices for liquor violated the statutory ban on

493Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
price advertising, the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administrator assessed a $400 fine.

After paying the fine, 44 Liquormart, joined by Peoples,
filed this action against the administrator in the Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the two
statutes and the administrator's implementing regulations
violate the First Amendment and other provisions of federal
law. The Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association was allowed to intervene as a defendant and in due course the
State of Rhode Island replaced the administrator as the
principal defendant. The parties stipulated that the price
advertising ban is vigorously enforced, that Rhode Island
permits "all advertising of alcoholic beverages excepting
references to price outside the licensed premises," and that
petitioners' proposed ads do not concern an illegal activity
and presumably would not be false or misleading. 44 Liquor
Mart, Inc. v. Racine, 829 F. Supp. 543, 545 (RI 1993). The
parties disagreed, however, about the impact of the ban on
the promotion of temperance in Rhode Island. On that
question the District Court heard conflicting expert testimony and reviewed a number of studies.

In his findings of fact, the District Judge first noted that
there was a pronounced lack of unanimity among researchers
who have studied the impact of advertising on the level of
consumption of alcoholic beverages. He referred to a 1985
Federal Trade Commission study that found no evidence that
alcohol advertising significantly affects alcohol abuse. Another study indicated that Rhode Island ranks in the upper
30% of States in per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages; alcohol consumption is lower in other States that allow
price advertising. After summarizing the testimony of the
expert witnesses for both parties, he found "as a fact that
Rhode Island's off-premises liquor price advertising ban has
no significant impact on levels of alcohol consumption in
Rhode Island." Id., at 549.

494 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of the Court
As a matter of law, he concluded that the price advertisingban was unconstitutional because it did not "directly advance" the State's interest in reducing alcohol consumptionand was "more extensive than necessary to serve that interest." Id., at 555. He reasoned that the party seeking touphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden
of justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did notshift or diminish that burden. Acknowledging that it might
have been reasonable for the state legislature to "assume acorrelation between the price advertising ban and reduced
consumption," he held that more than a rational basis wasrequired to justify the speech restriction, and that the State
had failed to demonstrate a reasonable " `fit' " between itspolicy objectives and its chosen means. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals reversed. 39 F. 3d 5 (CA1 1994).It found "inherent merit" in the State's submission that competitive price advertising would lower prices and that lowerprices would produce more sales. Id., at 7. Moreover, it
agreed with the reasoning of the Rhode Island SupremeCourt that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statutes
an added presumption of validity. Id., at 8. Alternatively,it concluded that reversal was compelled by this Court's summary action in Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control
Comm'n of Ohio, 459 U. S. 807 (1982). See 39 F. 3d, at 8.In that case the Court dismissed the appeal from a decision

of the Ohio Supreme Court upholding a prohibition againstoff-premises advertising of the prices of alcoholic beverages
sold by the drink. See Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor
Control Comm'n of Ohio, 69 Ohio St. 2d 361, 433 N. E. 2d138 (1982).

Queensgate has been both followed and distinguished insubsequent cases reviewing the validity of similar advertising bans.6 We are now persuaded that the importance of

Advertising has been a part of our culture throughout our
history. Even in colonial days, the public relied on "commercial speech" for vital information about the market.
Early newspapers displayed advertisements for goods and
services on their front pages, and town criers called out
prices in public squares. See J. Wood, The Story of Advertising 21, 45-69, 85 (1958); J. Smith, Printers and Press Freedom 49 (1988). Indeed, commercial messages played such a
central role in public life prior to the founding that Benjamin
Franklin authored his early defense of a free press in support of his decision to print, of all things, an advertisement
for voyages to Barbados. Franklin, An Apology for Printtising. The court explained that Queensgate did not control because it
involved a far narrower alcohol advertising regulation. Id., at 745-746.
By contrast, in Oklahoma Telecasters Assn. v. Crisp, 699 F. 2d 490, 495-
497 (1983), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v.
Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 697 (1984), the Tenth Circuit relied on Queensgate
in considering a prohibition against broadcasting alcohol advertisements.
The Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate stood for the proposition
that the Twenty-first Amendment gives the State greater authority to
regulate liquor advertising than the First Amendment would otherwise
allow. 699 F. 2d, at 495-497.

Other than the two Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions upholding
the constitutionality of the statutes at issue in this case, only one published
state court opinion has considered our summary action in Queensgate in
passing on a liquor advertising restriction. See Michigan Beer & Wine
Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142 Mich. App. 294, 370 N. W. 2d
328 (1985). There, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate did not control because it involved a far narrower restriction on liquor
advertising than the one that Michigan had imposed. 142 Mich. App., at
304-305, 370 N. W. 2d, at 333-335.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
ers, June 10, 1731, reprinted in 2 Writings of BenjaminFranklin 172 (1907).

In accord with the role that commercial messages havelong played, the law has developed to ensure that advertising
provides consumers with accurate information about theavailability of goods and services. In the early years, the
common law, and later, statutes, served the consumers' inter-est in the receipt of accurate information in the commercial
market by prohibiting fraudulent and misleading advertis-ing. It was not until the 1970's, however, that this Court
held that the First Amendment protected the disseminationof truthful and nonmisleading commercial messages about
lawful products and services. See generally Kozinski &Banner, The Anti-History and Pre-History of Commercial
Speech, 71 Texas L. Rev. 747 (1993).In Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), we held that
it was error to assume that commercial speech was entitledto no First Amendment protection or that it was without
value in the marketplace of ideas. Id., at 825-826. Thefollowing Term in

Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. VirginiaCitizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976),

we expanded on our holding in Bigelow and held that theState's blanket ban on advertising the price of prescription
drugs violated the First Amendment.Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy reflected the conclusion that
the same interest that supports regulation of potentially misleading advertising, namely, the public's interest in receivingaccurate commercial information, also supports an interpretation of the First Amendment that provides constitutionalprotection for the dissemination of accurate and nonmisleading commercial messages. We explained:

"Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of infor-mation as to who is producing and selling what product,

for what reason, and at what price. So long as we pre517US2$49I 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
serve a predominantly free enterprise economy, the allo-cation of our resources in large measure will be made

through numerous private economic decisions. It is amatter of public interest that those decisions, in the
aggregate, be intelligent and well informed. To thisend, the free flow of commercial information is indispensable." 425 U. S., at 765.7
The opinion further explained that a State's paternalisticassumption that the public will use truthful, nonmisleading

commercial information unwisely cannot justify a decision tosuppress it:

"There is, of course, an alternative to this highly pa-ternalistic approach. That alternative is to assume that
this information is not in itself harmful, that people willperceive their own best interests if only they are well
enough informed, and that the best means to that end isto open the channels of communication rather than to
close them. If they are truly open, nothing preventsthe `professional' pharmacist from marketing his own assertedly superior product, and contrasting it with thatof the low-cost, high-volume prescription drug retailer.
But the choice among these alternative approaches isnot ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly's.
It is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers ofsuppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if
it is freely available, that the First Amendment makesfor us."

Id., at 770.

On the basis of these principles, our early cases uniformlystruck down several broadly based bans on truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech, each of which served ends unre7 By contrast, the First Amendment does not protect commercial
speech about unlawful activities. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh
Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).

lated to consumer protection.8 Indeed, one of those casesexpressly likened the rationale that Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy employed to the one that Justice Brandeis adoptedin his concurrence in Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357
(1927). See Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431U. S. 85, 97 (1977). There, Justice Brandeis wrote, in explaining his objection to a prohibition of political speech,that "the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced
silence. Only an emergency can justify repression." Whitney, 274 U. S., at 377; see also Carey v. Population ServicesInt'l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977) (applying test for suppressing

political speech set forth in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.444, 447 (1969)).

At the same time, our early cases recognized that theState may regulate some types of commercial advertising
more freely than other forms of protected speech. Specifi-cally, we explained that the State may require commercial
messages to "appear in such a form, or include such addi-tional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive," Virginia Bd. of Phar-macy, 425 U. S., at 772, n. 24, and that it may restrict some
forms of aggressive sales practices that have the potential toexert "undue influence" over consumers, see Bates v. State
Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 366 (1977).Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy attributed the State's authority
to impose these regulations in part to certain "commonsense

8 See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 355 (1977) (ban on lawyer
advertising); Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678, 700 (1977)
(ban on contraceptive advertising); Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 92-94 (1977) (ban on "For Sale" signs); Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748
(1976) (ban on prescription drug prices); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809,
825 (1975) (ban on abortion advertising). Although Linmark involved a
prohibition against a particular means of advertising the sale of one's
home, we treated the restriction as if it were a complete ban because it
did not leave open "satisfactory" alternative channels of communication.

differences" that exist between commercial messages andother types of protected expression. 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24.

Our opinion noted that the greater "objectivity" of commer-cial speech justifies affording the State more freedom to distinguish false commercial advertisements from true ones,
ibid., and that the greater "hardiness" of commercial speech,inspired as it is by the profit motive, likely diminishes the

chilling effect that may attend its regulation, ibid.Subsequent cases explained that the State's power to regulate commercial transactions justifies its concomitant powerto regulate commercial speech that is "linked inextricably"
to those transactions. Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U. S. 1, 10,
n. 9 (1979); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447,
456 (1978) (commercial speech "occurs in an area traditionally
subject to government regulation"). As one commentator
has explained: "The entire commercial speech doctrine, after
all, represents an accommodation between the right to speak
and hear expression about goods and services and the right
of government to regulate the sales of such goods and services." L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law $ 12-15,
p. 903 (2d ed. 1988). Nevertheless, as we explained in Linmark, the State retains less regulatory authority when its
commercial speech restrictions strike at "the substance of
the information communicated" rather than the "commercial
aspect of [it]--with offerors communicating offers to offerees." 431 U. S., at 96; Carey v. Population Services Int'l,
431 U. S., at 701, n. 28.

In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), we took stock of our
developing commercial speech jurisprudence. In that case,
we considered a regulation "completely" banning all promotional advertising by electric utilities. Ibid. Our decision
acknowledged the special features of commercial speech but
identified the serious First Amendment concerns that attend
blanket advertising prohibitions that do not protect consumers from commercial harms.

517US2$49I 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT
500 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Five Members of the Court recognized that the state in-terest in the conservation of energy was substantial, and

that there was "an immediate connection between advertis-ing and demand for electricity." Id., at 569. Nevertheless,
they concluded that the regulation was invalid because re-spondent commission had failed to make a showing that a
more limited speech regulation would not have adequatelyserved the State's interest.

Id., at 571.9In reaching its conclusion, the majority explained that although the special nature of commercial speech may requireless than strict review of its regulation, special concerns
arise from "regulations that entirely suppress commercialspeech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy." Id.,
at 566, n. 9. In those circumstances, "a ban on speech couldscreen from public view the underlying governmental policy." Ibid. As a result, the Court concluded that "specialcare" should attend the review of such blanket bans, and it
pointedly remarked that "in recent years this Court has notapproved a blanket ban on commercial speech unless the expression itself was flawed in some way, either because it wasdeceptive or related to unlawful activity."

Ibid.10

9 In other words, the regulation failed the fourth step in the four-part
inquiry that the majority announced in its opinion. It wrote:

"In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed.
At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected
by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that
provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.
If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the
regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and
whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest."
Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566.

10 The Justices concurring in the judgment adopted a somewhat broader

view. They expressed "doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered product is ever a
permissible way for the State to `dampen' the demand for or use of the
product." Id., at 574. Indeed, Justice Blackmun believed that even

Opinion of Stevens, J.

IV
As our review of the case law reveals, Rhode Island errsin concluding that

all commercial speech regulations are sub-ject to a similar form of constitutional review simply because

they target a similar category of expression. The mere factthat messages propose commercial transactions does not in
and of itself dictate the constitutional analysis that shouldapply to decisions to suppress them. See Rubin v. Coors
Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491-494 (Stevens, J., concurringin judgment).

When a State regulates commercial messages to protectconsumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales
practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer
information, the purpose of its regulation is consistent withthe reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review.
However, when a State entirely prohibits the disseminationof truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons

unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process,there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review
that the First Amendment generally demands.Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech regulation more carefully. Most obviously,complete speech bans, unlike content-neutral restrictions
on the time, place, or manner of expression, see Kovacs v.
Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 89 (1949), are particularly dangerousbecause they all but foreclose alternative means of disseminating certain information.Our commercial speech cases have recognized the dangers
that attend governmental attempts to single out certainmessages for suppression. For example, in

Linmark, 431
U. S., at 92-94, we concluded that a ban on "For Sale" signs

"though `commercial' speech is involved, such a regulation strikes at the
heart of the First Amendment." Ibid.

was "content based" and failed to leave open "satisfactory"
alternative channels of communication; see also Virginia Bd.

upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal
solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers. Florida Bar v. Went
For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 633-634 (1995).11

The special dangers that attend complete bans on truthful,
nonmisleading commercial speech cannot be explained away
by appeals to the "commonsense distinctions" that exist between commercial and noncommercial speech. Virginia Bd.
of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24. Regulations that suppress the truth are no less troubling because they target
objectively verifiable information, nor are they less effective
because they aim at durable messages. As a result, neither
the "greater objectivity" nor the "greater hardiness" of
truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its complete suppression with added deference. Ibid.

It is the State's interest in protecting consumers from
"commercial harms" that provides "the typical reason why
commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental
regulation than noncommercial speech." Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426 (1993). Yet bans

that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messagesrarely protect consumers from such harms.

12 Instead, such

bans often serve only to obscure an "underlying govern-mental policy" that could be implemented without regulating speech. Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9.In this way, these commercial speech bans not only hinder
consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issuesof public policy. See

id., at 575 (Blackmun, J., concurringin judgment).

Precisely because bans against truthful, nonmisleadingcommercial speech rarely seek to protect consumers from

either deception or overreaching, they usually rest solely onthe offensive assumption that the public will respond "irrationally" to the truth. Linmark, 431 U. S., at 96. The FirstAmendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what thegovernment perceives to be their own good. That teaching
applies equally to state attempts to deprive consumers ofaccurate information about their chosen products:

"The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of oursocial and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas
and information flourish. Some of the ideas and infor-mation are vital, some of slight worth. But the general
rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the gov12 In Discovery Network, we held that the city's categorical ban on commercial newsracks attached too much importance to the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech. After concluding that the
esthetic and safety interests served by the newsrack ban bore no relationship whatsoever to the prevention of commercial harms, we rejected the
State's attempt to justify its ban on the sole ground that it targeted commercial speech. See 507 U. S., at 428.

13 This case bears out the point. Rhode Island seeks to reduce alcohol

consumption by increasing alcohol price; yet its means of achieving that
goal deprives the public of their chief source of information about the
reigning price level of alcohol. As a result, the State's price advertising
ban keeps the public ignorant of the key barometer of the ban's effectiveness: the alcohol beverages' prices.

In this case, there is no question that Rhode Island's priceadvertising ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against
truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product.There is also no question that the ban serves an end unrelated to consumer protection. Accordingly, we must reviewthe price advertising ban with "special care," Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9, mindful that speech prohibitionsof this type rarely survive constitutional review,

ibid.The State argues that the price advertising prohibition

should nevertheless be upheld because it directly advancesthe State's substantial interest in promoting temperance, and
because it is no more extensive than necessary. Cf. id., at566. Although there is some confusion as to what Rhode
Island means by temperance, we assume that the State as-serts an interest in reducing alcohol consumption.

14

14 Before the District Court, the State argued that it sought to reduce
consumption among irresponsible drinkers. App. 67. In its brief to this
Court, it equates its interest in promoting temperance with an interest
in reducing alcohol consumption among all drinkers. See, e. g., Brief for
Respondents 28. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has characterized the
State's interest in "promoting temperance" as both "the state's interest in
reducing the consumption of liquor," S&S Liquormart, Inc. v. Pastore, 497
A. 2d 729, 734 (1985), and the State's interest in discouraging "excessive
consumption of alcoholic beverages," id., at 735. A state statute declares
the ban's purpose to be "the promotion of temperance and for the rea517US2$49I 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT

505Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
In evaluating the ban's effectiveness in advancing the
State's interest, we note that a commercial speech regulation
"may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose." Id., at 564.
For that reason, the State bears the burden of showing not
merely that its regulation will advance its interest, but also
that it will do so "to a material degree." Edenfield, 507
U. S., at 771; see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S.,
at 486-488. The need for the State to make such a showing is particularly great given the drastic nature of its
chosen means--the wholesale suppression of truthful, nonmisleading information. Accordingly, we must determine
whether the State has shown that the price advertising ban
will significantly reduce alcohol consumption.

We can agree that common sense supports the conclusion
that a prohibition against price advertising, like a collusive
agreement among competitors to refrain from such advertising,15 will tend to mitigate competition and maintain prices
at a higher level than would prevail in a completely free market. Despite the absence of proof on the point, we can even
agree with the State's contention that it is reasonable to assume that demand, and hence consumption throughout the
market, is somewhat lower whenever a higher, noncompetitive price level prevails. However, without any findings of
fact, or indeed any evidentiary support whatsoever, we cannot agree with the assertion that the price advertising ban
will significantly advance the State's interest in promoting
temperance.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Although the record suggests that the price advertisingban may have some impact on the purchasing patterns of

temperate drinkers of modest means, 829 F. Supp., at 546,the State has presented no evidence to suggest that its
speech prohibition will significantly reduce marketwide consumption.16 Indeed, the District Court's considered and un-contradicted finding on this point is directly to the contrary.

Id., at 549.17 Moreover, the evidence suggests that the abu-sive drinker will probably not be deterred by a marginal
price increase, and that the true alcoholic may simply reducehis purchases of other necessities.

In addition, as the District Court noted, the State has notidentified what price level would lead to a significant reduction in alcohol consumption, nor has it identified the amount

16 Petitioners' stipulation that they each expect to realize a $100,000 benefit per year if the ban is lifted is not to the contrary. App. 47. The
stipulation shows only that petitioners believe they will be able to compete
more effectively for existing alcohol consumers if there is no ban on price
advertising. It does not show that they believe either the number of alcohol consumers, or the number of purchases by those consumers, will increase in the ban's absence. Indeed, the State's own expert conceded that
"plaintiffs' expectation of realizing additional profits through price advertising has no necessary relationship to increased overall consumption."
829 F. Supp., at 549.

Moreover, we attach little significance to the fact that some studies suggest that people budget the amount of money that they will spend on
alcohol. 39 F. 3d 5, 7 (CA1 1994). These studies show only that, in a
competitive market, people will tend to search for the cheapest product in
order to meet their budgets. The studies do not suggest that the amount
of money budgeted for alcohol consumption will remain fixed in the face
of a marketwide price increase.

17 Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulation directly

advanced the State's interest, it did not dispute the District Court's conclusion that the evidence suggested that, at most, a price advertising ban
would have a marginal impact on overall alcohol consumption. Id., at 7-8;
cf. Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142
Mich. App., at 311, 370 N. W. 2d, at 336 (explaining that "any additional
impact on the level of consumption attributable to the absence of price
advertisements would be negligible").

507Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
that it believes prices would decrease without the ban.
Ibid. Thus, the State's own showing reveals that any connection between the ban and a significant change in alcohol
consumption would be purely fortuitous.

As is evident, any conclusion that elimination of the ban
would significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to engage in the sort of "speculation or conjecture"
that is an unacceptable means of demonstrating that a restriction on commercial speech directly advances the State's
asserted interest. Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770.18 Such speculation certainly does not suffice when the State takes aim
at accurate commercial information for paternalistic ends.

The State also cannot satisfy the requirement that its restriction on speech be no more extensive than necessary. It
is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that
would not involve any restriction on speech would be more
likely to achieve the State's goal of promoting temperance.
As the State's own expert conceded, higher prices can be
maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation. 829 F. Supp., at 549. Per capita purchases could be
limited as is the case with prescription drugs. Even educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or
even moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.

As a result, even under the less than strict standard that
generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has
failed to establish a "reasonable fit" between its abridgment
of speech and its temperance goal. Board of Trustees of
State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989); see also

18 Outside the First Amendment context, we have refused to uphold alcohol advertising bans premised on similarly speculative assertions about
their impact on consumption. See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,
467 U. S., at 715-716 (holding ban pre-empted by Federal Communications
Commission regulations); California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980) (holding ban violated the Sherman
Act). It would be anomalous if the First Amendment were more tolerant
of speech bans than federal regulations and statutes.

Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491 (explaining thatdefects in a federal ban on alcohol advertising are "further

highlighted by the availability of alternatives that wouldprove less intrusive to the First Amendment's protections
for commercial speech"); Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97 (suggest-ing that the State use financial incentives or counterspeech,
rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests). Itnecessarily follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that Central
Hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the completesuppression of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech.

447 U. S., at 566, n. 9. VI

The State responds by arguing that it merely exercisedappropriate "legislative judgment" in determining that a
price advertising ban would best promote temperance. Re-lying on the

Central Hudson analysis set forth in Posadasde Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S.

328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509U. S. 418 (1993), Rhode Island first argues that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price advertisingban "go both ways," the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban constituted a "reasonable choice" by thelegislature. 39 F. 3d, at 7. The State next contends that
precedent requires us to give particular deference to thatlegislative choice because the State could, if it chose, ban the
sale of alcoholic beverages outright. See Posadas, 478 U. S.,at 345-346. Finally, the State argues that deference is appropriate because alcoholic beverages are so-called "vice"products. See

Edge, 509 U. S., at 426; Posadas, 478 U. S., at346-347. We consider each of these contentions in turn.

The State's first argument fails to justify the speech pro-hibition at issue. Our commercial speech cases recognize
some room for the exercise of legislative judgment. See
Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 507-508 (1981).However, Rhode Island errs in concluding that Edge and

509Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
Posadas establish the degree of deference that its decisionto impose a price advertising ban warrants.

In Edge, we upheld a federal statute that permitted onlythose broadcasters located in States that had legalized lotteries to air lottery advertising. The statute was designed to
regulate advertising about an activity that had been deemedillegal in the jurisdiction in which the broadcaster was located. 509 U. S., at 433-434. Here, by contrast, the com-mercial speech ban targets information about entirely lawful behavior.

Posadas is more directly relevant. There, a five-Member
majority held that, under the Central Hudson test, it was
"up to the legislature" to choose to reduce gambling by suppressing in-state casino advertising rather than engaging in
educational speech. Posadas, 478 U. S., at 344. Rhode Island argues that this logic demonstrates the constitutionality
of its own decision to ban price advertising in lieu of raising
taxes or employing some other less speech-restrictive means
of promoting temperance.

The reasoning in Posadas does support the State's argument, but, on reflection, we are now persuaded that Posadas
erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis. The
casino advertising ban was designed to keep truthful, nonmisleading speech from members of the public for fear that
they would be more likely to gamble if they received it. As
a result, the advertising ban served to shield the State's antigambling policy from the public scrutiny that more direct,
nonspeech regulation would draw. See id., at 351 (Brennan,
J., dissenting).

Given our longstanding hostility to commercial speech regulation of this type, Posadas clearly erred in concluding that

it was "up to the legislature" to choose suppression over a
less speech-restrictive policy. The Posadas majority's conclusion on that point cannot be reconciled with the unbroken
line of prior cases striking down similarly broad regulations
on truthful, nonmisleading advertising when non-speech517US2$49I 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT

related alternatives were available. See id., at 350 (Bren-nan, J., dissenting) (listing cases); Kurland, Posadas de

Puerto Rico v. Tourism Company: " `Twas Strange, `TwasPassing Strange; `Twas Pitiful, `Twas Wondrous Pitiful,"
1986 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 12-15.

Because the 5-to-4 decision in Posadas marked such asharp break from our prior precedent, and because it concerned a constitutional question about which this Court isthe final arbiter, we decline to give force to its highly deferential approach. Instead, in keeping with our prior hold-ings, we conclude that a state legislature does not have the
broad discretion to suppress truthful, nonmisleading information for paternalistic purposes that the Posadas majority
was willing to tolerate. As we explained in Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy, "[i]t is precisely this kind of choice, between the
dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its
misuse if it is freely available, that the First Amendment
makes for us." 425 U. S., at 770.

We also cannot accept the State's second contention, which
is premised entirely on the "greater-includes-the-lesser" reasoning endorsed toward the end of the majority's opinion
in Posadas. There, the majority stated that "the greater
power to completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertising of casino
gambling." 478 U. S., at 345-346. It went on to state that
"because the government could have enacted a wholesale
prohibition of [casino gambling] it is permissible for the
government to take the less intrusive step of allowing the
conduct, but reducing the demand through restrictions on
advertising." Id., at 346. The majority concluded that it

would "surely be a strange constitutional doctrine which
would concede to the legislature the authority to totally ban
a product or activity, but deny to the legislature the authority to forbid the stimulation of demand for the product or
activity through advertising on behalf of those who would
profit from such increased demand." Ibid. On the basis of

511Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
these statements, the State reasons that its undisputed
authority to ban alcoholic beverages must include the power
to restrict advertisements offering them for sale.

In Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476 (1995), the
United States advanced a similar argument as a basis for
supporting a statutory prohibition against revealing the alcoholic content of malt beverages on product labels. We rejected the argument, noting that the statement in the Posadas opinion was made only after the majority had concluded
that the Puerto Rican regulation "survived the Central Hudson test." 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2. Further consideration
persuades us that the "greater-includes-the-lesser" argument should be rejected for the additional and more important reason that it is inconsistent with both logic and
well-settled doctrine.

Although we do not dispute the proposition that greater
powers include lesser ones, we fail to see how that syllogism
requires the conclusion that the State's power to regulate
commercial activity is "greater" than its power to ban truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech. Contrary to the assumption made in Posadas, we think it quite clear that banning speech may sometimes prove far more intrusive than
banning conduct. As a venerable proverb teaches, it may
prove more injurious to prevent people from teaching others
how to fish than to prevent fish from being sold.19 Similarly,
a local ordinance banning bicycle lessons may curtail freedom
far more than one that prohibits bicycle riding within city
limits. In short, we reject the assumption that words are
necessarily less vital to freedom than actions, or that logic
somehow proves that the power to prohibit an activity is
necessarily "greater" than the power to suppress speech
about it.

512 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of Stevens, J.
As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, the Posadas
syllogism is even less defensible. The text of the First
Amendment makes clear that the Constitution presumes that
attempts to regulate speech are more dangerous than attempts to regulate conduct. That presumption accords with
the essential role that the free flow of information plays in a
democratic society. As a result, the First Amendment directs that government may not suppress speech as easily as
it may suppress conduct, and that speech restrictions cannot
be treated as simply another means that the government
may use to achieve its ends.

These basic First Amendment principles clearly apply to
commercial speech; indeed, the Posadas majority impliedly
conceded as much by applying the Central Hudson test.
Thus, it is no answer that commercial speech concerns products and services that the government may freely regulate.
Our decisions from Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy on have made
plain that a State's regulation of the sale of goods differs in
kind from a State's regulation of accurate information about
those goods. The distinction that our cases have consistently drawn between these two types of governmental action
is fundamentally incompatible with the absolutist view that
the State may ban commercial speech simply because it may
constitutionally prohibit the underlying conduct.20

20 It is also no answer to say that it would be "strange" if the First
Amendment tolerated a seemingly "greater" regulatory measure while
forbidding a "lesser" one. We recently held that although the government had the power to proscribe an entire category of speech, such as
obscenity or so-called fighting words, it could not limit the scope of its ban
to obscene or fighting words that expressed a point of view with which
the government disagrees. R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992).
Similarly, in Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410 (1993),
we assumed that States could prevent all newsracks from being placed on
public sidewalks, but nevertheless concluded that they could not ban only
those newsracks that contained certain commercial publications. Id., at
428.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
That the State has chosen to license its liquor retailersdoes not change the analysis. Even though government is

under no obligation to provide a person, or the public, a par-ticular benefit, it does not follow that conferral of the benefit
may be conditioned on the surrender of a constitutional right.
See, e. g., Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm'n
of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 594 (1926). In Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593 (1972), relying on a host of cases applying thatprinciple during the preceding quarter century, the Court

explained that government "may not deny a benefit to a per-son on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected
interests--especially his interest in freedom of speech."
Id., at 597. That teaching clearly applies to state attempts
to regulate commercial speech, as our cases striking down
bans on truthful, nonmisleading speech by licensed professionals attest. See, e. g., Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433
U. S., at 355; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens
Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976).

Thus, just as it is perfectly clear that Rhode Island could
not ban all obscene liquor ads except those that advocated
temperance, we think it equally clear that its power to ban
the sale of liquor entirely does not include a power to censor all advertisements that contain accurate and nonmisleading information about the price of the product. As the
entire Court apparently now agrees, the statements in the
Posadas opinion on which Rhode Island relies are no longer
persuasive.

Finally, we find unpersuasive the State's contention that,
under Posadas and Edge, the price advertising ban should
be upheld because it targets commercial speech that pertains
to a "vice" activity. Respondents premise their request for
a so-called "vice" exception to our commercial speech doctrine on language in Edge which characterized gambling as
a "vice." Edge, 509 U. S., at 426; see also Posadas, 478 U. S.,
at 346-347. Respondents misread our precedent. Our decision last Term striking down an alcohol-related advertising

Opinion of the Court
restriction effectively rejected the very contention respond-ents now make. See

Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S.,
at 478, 482, n. 2.Moreover, the scope of any "vice" exception to the protection afforded by the First Amendment would be difficult, if
not impossible, to define. Almost any product that posessome threat to public health or public morals might reasonably be characterized by a state legislature as relating to"vice activity." Such characterization, however, is anomalous when applied to products such as alcoholic beverages,lottery tickets, or playing cards, that may be lawfully purchased on the open market. The recognition of such an ex-ception would also have the unfortunate consequence of
either allowing state legislatures to justify censorship by the
simple expedient of placing the "vice" label on selected lawful activities, or requiring the federal courts to establish a
federal common law of vice. See Kurland, 1986 S. Ct. Rev.,
at 15. For these reasons, a "vice" label that is unaccompanied by a corresponding prohibition against the commercial
behavior at issue fails to provide a principled justification for
the regulation of commercial speech about that activity.

VII
From 1919 until 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment to the
Constitution totally prohibited "the manufacture, sale, or
transportation of intoxicating liquors" in the United States
and its territories. Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed that prohibition, and $ 2 delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use
of, alcoholic beverages.21 The States' regulatory power over
this segment of commerce is therefore largely "unfettered

by the Commerce Clause." Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U. S.132, 138 (1939).

As is clear, the text of the Twenty-first Amendment sup-ports the view that, while it grants the States authority over
commerce that might otherwise be reserved to the FederalGovernment, it places no limit whatsoever on other constitutional provisions. Nevertheless, Rhode Island argues, andthe Court of Appeals agreed, that in this case the Twentyfirst Amendment tilts the First Amendment analysis in theState's favor. See 39 F. 3d, at 7-8.

In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied onour decision in

California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 (1972).22In LaRue, five Members of the Court relied on the Twentyfirst Amendment to buttress the conclusion that the FirstAmendment did not invalidate California's prohibition of certain grossly sexual exhibitions in premises licensed to servealcoholic beverages. Specifically, the opinion stated that the
Twenty-first Amendment required that the prohibition begiven an added presumption in favor of its validity. See

id.,at 118-119. We are now persuaded that the Court's analysis

in LaRue would have led to precisely the same result if ithad placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment.

Entirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, theState has ample power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate locations. Moreover, in subsequentcases, the Court has recognized that the States' inherent
police powers provide ample authority to restrict the kindof "bacchanalian revelries" described in the

LaRue opinionregardless of whether alcoholic beverages are involved.

Id., at 118; see, e. g., Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc.,427 U. S. 50 (1976);

Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S.560 (1991). As we recently noted: "LaRue did not involve

Twenty-first Amendment analysis set forth in LaRue. See New York
State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981), and Newport v.
Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986).

commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned theregulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was

served." Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2.Without questioning the holding in LaRue, we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-firstAmendment. As we explained in a case decided more than a
decade after LaRue, although the Twenty-first Amendmentlimits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause on a
State's regulatory power over the delivery or use of intox-icating beverages within its borders, "the Amendment does
not license the States to ignore their obligations under otherprovisions of the Constitution."

Capital Cities Cable, Inc.v.
Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984). That general conclusionreflects our specific holdings that the Twenty-first Amendment does not in any way diminish the force of the SupremacyClause, ibid.; California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 112-114 (1980), the Es-tablishment Clause, Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S.
116, 122, n. 5 (1982), or the Equal Protection Clause, Craigv.

Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 209 (1976). We see no reason whythe First Amendment should not also be included in that list.

Accordingly, we now hold that the Twenty-first Amendmentdoes not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws
abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the FirstAmendment. The Twenty-first Amendment, therefore, cannot save Rhode Island's ban on liquor price advertising.

VIII
Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burdenof justifying its complete ban on price advertising, we conclude that R. I. Gen. Laws $$ 3-8-7 and 3-8-8.1 (1987), aswell as Regulation 32 of the Rhode Island Liquor Control
Administration, abridge speech in violation of the FirstAmendment as made applicable to the States by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judg-ment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

I share Justice Thomas's discomfort with the CentralHudson test, which seems to me to have nothing more than
policy intuition to support it. I also share Justice Stevens's aversion towards paternalistic governmental policiesthat prevent men and women from hearing facts that might

not be good for them. On the other hand, it would also bepaternalism for us to prevent the people of the States from
enacting laws that we consider paternalistic, unless we havegood reason to believe that the Constitution itself forbids
them. I will take my guidance as to what the Constitutionforbids, with regard to a text as indeterminate as the First
Amendment's preservation of "the freedom of speech," andwhere the core offense of suppressing particular political
ideas is not at issue, from the long accepted practices of theAmerican people. See

McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,514 U. S. 334, 375 (1995) (

Scalia, J., dissenting).The briefs and arguments of the parties in the present

case provide no illumination on that point; understandablyso, since both sides accepted

Central Hudson. The amicusbrief on behalf of the American Advertising Federation et

al. did examine various expressions of view at the time theFirst Amendment was adopted; they are consistent with
First Amendment protection for commercial speech, but cer-tainly not dispositive. I consider more relevant the state
legislative practices prevalent at the time the First Amend-ment was adopted, since almost all of the States had free
speech constitutional guarantees of their own, whose mean-ing was not likely to have been different from the federal
constitutional provision derived from them. Perhaps morerelevant still are the state legislative practices at the time
the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, since it is mostimprobable that that adoption was meant to overturn any
existing national consensus regarding free speech. Indeed,it is rare that any nationwide practice would develop contrary to a proper understanding of the First Amendment

itself--for which reason I think also relevant any nationalconsensus that had formed regarding state regulation of

advertising after the Fourteenth Amendment, and beforethis Court's entry into the field. The parties and their amici
provide no evidence on these points.Since I do not believe we have before us the wherewithal
to declare Central Hudson wrong--or at least the where-withal to say what ought to replace it--I must resolve this
case in accord with our existing jurisprudence, which all ex-cept

Justice Thomas agree would prohibit the challengedregulation. I am not disposed to develop new law, or reinforce old, on this issue, and accordingly I merely concur inthe judgment of the Court. I believe, however, that

Justice Stevens's treatment of the application of the Twenty-first Amendment to this case is correct, and accordingly join

Parts I, II, VII, and VIII of Justice Stevens's opinion.

Justice Thomas, concurring in Parts I, II, VI, and VII,and concurring in the judgment.

In cases such as this, in which the government's assertedinterest is to keep legal users of a product or service ignorant in order to manipulate their choices in the marketplace,the balancing test adopted in Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980),should not be applied, in my view. Rather, such an "interest" is per se illegitimate and can no more justify regulationof "commercial" speech than it can justify regulation of "noncommercial" speech. I

In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976), this Court heldthat speech that does " `no more than propose a commercial

transaction' " was protected by the First Amendment, andstruck down a ban on price advertising regarding prescription drugs. The Court asserted that a "particular consum-er's interest in the free flow of commercial information" may

be as keen as, or keener than, his interest in "the day's mosturgent political debate," id., at 763, and that "the proper allocation of resources" in our free enterprise system requiresthat consumer decisions be "intelligent and well informed,"
id., at 765. The Court also explained that, unless consumers
are kept informed about the operations of the free marketsystem, they cannot form "intelligent opinions as to how that

system ought to be regulated or altered." Ibid. See also
id., at 765-766, nn. 19-20.1 The Court sharply rebuffed the
State's argument that consumers would make irresponsiblechoices if they were able to choose between higher priced but

higher quality pharmaceuticals accompanied by high qualityprescription monitoring services resulting from a "stable
pharmacist-customer relationshi[p]," id., at 768, on the onehand, and cheaper but lower quality pharmaceuticals unaccompanied by such services, on the other:

"[T]he State's protectiveness of its citizens rests in large
measure on the advantages of their being kept in igno-rance. The advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other. It affects
them only through the reactions it is assumed peoplewill have to the free flow of drug price information.

. . . . .
"There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic approach. That alternative is to assume thatthis information is not in itself harmful, that people will

perceive their own best interests, if only they are wellenough informed, and that the best means to that end is
to open the channels of communication rather than to
close them. . . . It is precisely this kind of choice, be-tween the dangers of suppressing information, and the

dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the

First Amendment makes for us. Virginia is free to re-quire whatever professional standards it wishes of its

pharmacists; it may subsidize them or protect them fromcompetition in other ways. But it may not do so by
keeping the public in ignorance of the entirely lawfulterms that competing pharmacists are offering. In this
sense, the justifications Virginia has offered for sup-pressing the flow of prescription drug price information,
far from persuading us that the flow is not protected bythe First Amendment, have reinforced our view that it
is." Id., at 769-770 (citation omitted).
The Court opined that false or misleading advertising wasnot protected, on the grounds that the accuracy of advertising claims may be more readily verifiable than is the accu-racy of political or other claims, and that "commercial"
speech is made more durable by its profit motive. Id., at771, and n. 24. The Court also made clear that it did not
envision protection for advertising that proposes an illegaltransaction.

the Court, and individual Members of the Court, have contin-ued to stress the importance of free dissemination of information about commercial choices in a market economy; theantipaternalistic premises of the First Amendment; the impropriety of manipulating consumer choices or public opinionthrough the suppression of accurate "commercial" information; the near impossibility of severing "commercial" speechfrom speech necessary to democratic decisionmaking; and the
dangers of permitting the government to do covertly whatit might not have been able to muster the political support

Opinion of Thomas, J.
In other decisions, however, the Court has appeared to
accept the legitimacy of laws that suppress information in
order to manipulate the choices of consumers--so long as the
government could show that the manipulation was in fact
successful. Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public
Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), was the first
decision to clearly embrace this position, although the Court
applied a very strict overbreadth analysis to strike down the
advertising ban at issue.3 In two other decisions, Posadas
de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S.
328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509
U. S. 418 (1993), the Court simply presumed that advertising
of a product or service leads to increased consumption; since,
as in Central Hudson, the Court saw nothing impermissible
in the government's suppressing information in order to discourage consumption, it upheld the advertising restrictions

in those cases. Posadas, supra, at 341-342; Edge, supra, at425, 433-434.

The Court has at times appeared to assume that "commer-cial" speech could be censored in a variety of ways for any
of a variety of reasons because, as was said without clear
rationale in some post-Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy cases, suchspeech was in a "subordinate position in the scale of First

Amendment values," Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436U. S. 447, 456 (1978);

Board of Trustees of State Univ. of
N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 478 (1989); Florida Bar v. Went
For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623 (1995), or of "less constitutional

419 (1993) (rejecting this assertion); id., at 431 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring) (same). I do not see a philosophical or historical
basis for asserting that "commercial" speech is of "lower
value" than "noncommercial" speech. Indeed, some historical materials suggest to the contrary. See, e. g., ante, at
495-496 (citing Franklin's Apology for Printers); Ex parte
Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878) (dictum that Congress could
not, consistent with freedom of the press, prevent the circulation of lottery advertising through methods other than the
United States mail); see also In re Rapier, 143 U. S. 110,
134-135 (1892) (continuing to assume that freedom of the
press prevents Congress from prohibiting circulation of
newspapers containing lottery advertisements); Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, 229 U. S. 288, 315 (1913) (same); see
generally Brief for American Advertising Federation et al.
as Amici Curiae 12-24 (citing authorities for propositions
that commercial activity and advertising were integral to life
in colonial America and that Framers' political philosophy
equated liberty and property and did not distinguish between commercial and noncommercial messages). Nor do I
believe that the only explanations that the Court has ever
advanced for treating "commercial" speech differently from
other speech can justify restricting "commercial" speech in

order to keep information from legal purchasers so as tothwart what would otherwise be their choices in the

marketplace.4 II

I do not join the principal opinion's application of the Cen-tral Hudson balancing test because I do not believe that such
a test should be applied to a restriction of "commercial"speech, at least when, as here, the asserted interest is one
that is to be achieved through keeping would-be recipientsof the speech in the dark.

5 Application of the advancementof-state-interest prong of Central Hudson makes little senseto me in such circumstances. Faulting the State for failing

to show that its price advertising ban decreases alcohol con-sumption "significantly," as

Justice Stevens does, ante, at507 (emphasis deleted), seems to imply that if the State had

been more successful at keeping consumers ignorant andthereby decreasing their consumption, then the restriction
might have been upheld. This contradicts Virginia Bd. of

4 As noted above, the asserted rationales for differentiating "commercial" speech from other speech are (1) that the truth of "commercial"
speech is supposedly more verifiable, and (2) that "commercial speech, the
offspring of economic self-interest" is supposedly a "hardy breed of expression that is not particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad
regulation." Central Hudson, supra, at 564, n. 6 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The degree to which these rationales truly justify treating "commercial" speech differently from other speech (or indeed, whether
the requisite distinction can even be drawn) is open to question, in my
view. See Kozinski & Banner, Who's Afraid of Commercial Speech, 76
Va. L. Rev. 627, 634-638 (1990) (questioning basis for drawing distinction);
id., at 638-650 (questioning coherence of distinction). In any event, neither of these rationales provides any basis for permitting government to
keep citizens ignorant as a means of manipulating their choices in the
commercial or political marketplace.

5 In other words, I do not believe that a Central Hudson-type balancing

test should apply when the asserted purpose is like the one put forth by
the government in Central Hudson itself. Whether some type of balancing test is warranted when the asserted state interest is of a different
kind is a question that I do not consider here.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Pharmacy's rationale for protecting "commercial" speech inthe first instance.

Both Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor appear toadopt a stricter, more categorical interpretation of the fourth
prong of Central Hudson than that suggested in some of ourother opinions,

6 one that could, as a practical matter, go a

long way toward the position I take. The State argues thatkeeping information about lower priced alcohol from consumers will tend to raise the total price of alcohol to consumers(defined as money price plus the costs of searching out lower
priced alcohol, see Brief for Respondents 23), thus discourag-ing alcohol consumption. In their application of the fourth
prong, both Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor holdthat because the State can ban the sale of lower priced alcohol altogether by instituting minimum prices or levyingtaxes, it cannot ban advertising regarding lower priced liquor. Although the tenor of Justice O'Connor's opinion(and, to a lesser extent, that of

Justice Stevens' opinion)might suggest that this is just another routine case-by-case

application of Central Hudson's fourth prong, the Court'sholding will in fact be quite sweeping if applied consistently
in future cases. The opinions would appear to commit thecourts to striking down restrictions on speech whenever a
direct regulation (i. e., a regulation involving no restrictionon speech regarding lawful activity at all) would be an
equally effective method of dampening demand by legalusers. But it would seem that directly banning a product
(or rationing it, taxing it, controlling its price, or otherwiserestricting its sale in specific ways) would virtually always

be at least as effective in discouraging consumption asmerely restricting advertising regarding the product would
be, and thus virtually all restrictions with such a purposewould fail the fourth prong of the

Central Hudson test.

6 E. g., Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 417, n. 13 (commercial speech restrictions impermissible if alternatives are "numerous"
and obvious).

525Cite as: 517 U. S. 484 (1996)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
This would be so even if the direct regulation is, in one sense,more restrictive of conduct generally. In this case, for example, adoption of minimum prices or taxes will mean thatthose who, under the current legal system, would have happened across cheap liquor or would have sought it out, willbe forced to pay more. Similarly, a State seeking to discourage liquor sales would have to ban sales by conveniencestores rather than banning convenience store liquor advertising; it would have to ban liquor sales after midnight, ratherthan banning advertising by late-night liquor sellers; and so
on.The upshot of the application of the fourth prong in the
opinions of Justice Stevens and of Justice O'Connorseems to be that the government may not, for the purpose
of keeping would-be consumers ignorant and thus decreasingdemand, restrict advertising regarding commercial transactions--or at least that it may not restrict advertising regard-ing commercial transactions except to the extent that it outlaws or otherwise directly restricts the same transactionswithin its own borders.

7 I welcome this outcome; but,

7 The two most obvious situations in which no equally effective direct
regulation will be available for discouraging consumption (and thus, the
two situations in which the Court and I might differ on the outcome) are:
(1) When a law directly regulating conduct would violate the Constitution
(e. g., because the item is constitutionally protected), or (2) when the sale
is to occur outside the State's borders.

As to the first situation: Although the Court's application of the fourth
prong today does not specifically foreclose regulations or bans of advertising regarding items that cannot constitutionally be banned, it would seem
strange to hold that the government's power to interfere with transmission of information regarding these items, in order to dampen demand for
them, is more extensive than its power to restrict, for the same purpose,
advertising of items that are not constitutionally protected. Cf. Bigelow
v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 822 (1975).

As to the second situation: When a State seeks to dampen consumption
by its citizens of products or services outside its borders, it does not have
the option of direct regulation. Here, a respondent correctly points out
that alternatives such as taxes will not be effective in discouraging sales

526 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

Opinion of Thomas, J.
rather than "applying" the fourth prong of Central Hudsonto reach the inevitable result that all or most such advertising restrictions must be struck down, I would adhere tothe doctrine adopted in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy and in
Justice Blackmun's Central Hudson concurrence, that all at-tempts to dissuade legal choices by citizens by keeping them
ignorant are impermissible.

III
Although the Court took a sudden turn away from Vir-ginia Bd. of Pharmacy in Central Hudson, it has never explained why manipulating the choices of consumers by keep-ing them ignorant is more legitimate when the ignorance
is maintained through suppression of "commercial" speechthan when the same ignorance is maintained through suppression of "noncommercial" speech. The courts, including this
to Rhode Island residents of lower priced alcohol outside the State, see
Brief for Respondent Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association 27; yet the
Court strikes down the ban against price advertising even as applied to
out-of-state liquor sellers such as petitioner Peoples Super Liquor Stores.
Perhaps Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor would distinguish a
situation in which a State had actually banned sales of lower priced alcohol
within the State and had then, through a ban of advertising by out-of-state
sellers, sought to keep residents ignorant of the fact that lower priced
alcohol was legally available in other States. Cf. United States v. Edge
Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993). See ante, at 508-510.

The outcome in Edge may well be in conflict with the principles espoused in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy and ratified by me today. See Edge,
supra, at 436-439 (Stevens, J., dissenting). (In Edge, respondent did not
put forth the broader principles adopted in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy,
but rather argued that the advertising restriction did not have a sufficiently close fit under Central Hudson.) Because the issue of restrictions
on advertising of products or services to be purchased legally outside a
State that has itself banned or regulated the same purchases within the
State is not squarely presented in this case, I will not address here
whether the decision in Edge can be reconciled with the position I take
today.

Court, have found the Central Hudson "test" to be, as ageneral matter, very difficult to apply with any uniformity.

8

This may result in part from the inherently nondetermina-tive nature of a case-by-case balancing "test" unaccompanied

by any categorical rules, and the consequent likelihood that
individual judicial preferences will govern application of the
test.9 Moreover, the second prong of Central Hudson, as
applied to the facts of that case and to those here, apparently

8 See, e. g., Kozinski & Banner, 76 Va. L. Rev., at 630-631 (citing cases);

Speech, 72 Denver U. L. Rev. 137, 162-166 (1994) (citing cases); Kasakove,

an Agenda, 65 Conn. Bar J. 437, 440, n. 20 (1991) (citing cases).

9 The third prong of Central Hudson is far from a mechanical one. In

Posadas, Edge, and other cases, the Court has presumed that advertising
bans decrease consumption. Here, by contrast, the principal opinion demands proof of a "significant" decrease in consumption, and finds it lacking. But petitioners' own expert testified at one point that, taking into
account disposable income, price was a "potent" influence on alcohol consumption, see App. 79; and the American Medical Association had apparently concluded that advertising of alcohol in general increased total alcohol consumption sufficiently to make a ban on advertising worthwhile, see
44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine, 829 F. Supp. 543, 548 (RI 1993). A court
more inclined to uphold the ban here could have pointed to these facts
in support.

The courts have also had difficulty applying the fourth prong because
the outcome has depended upon the level of generality with which the
interest was described. See Faille, supra, at 58, 60. If today's strict
application of the fourth prong survives, it will clarify the prong's application in a large number of cases, since, as noted above, it will simply
invalidate most restrictions in which the government attempts to manipulate consumption through enforced ignorance rather than through direct
regulation.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
requires judges to delineate those situations in which citi-zens cannot be trusted with information, and invites judges

to decide whether they themselves think that consumptionof a product is harmful enough that it should be discouraged.10 In my view, the Central Hudson test asks thecourts to weigh incommensurables--the value of knowledge
versus the value of ignorance--and to apply contradictorypremises--that informed adults are the best judges of their
own interests, and that they are not. Rather than continu-ing to apply a test that makes no sense to me when the asserted state interest is of the type involved here, I wouldreturn to the reasoning and holding of

Virginia Bd. of Phar-macy. Under that decision, these restrictions fall.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, concurringin the judgment.

Rhode Island prohibits advertisement of the retail price ofalcoholic beverages, except at the place of sale. The State's
only asserted justification for this ban is that it promotestemperance by increasing the cost of alcoholic beverages.
Brief for Respondent State of Rhode Island 22. I agreewith the Court that Rhode Island's price-advertising ban is
invalid. I would resolve this case more narrowly, however,by applying our established Central Hudson test to determine whether this commercial speech regulation survivesFirst Amendment scrutiny.

Under that test, we first determine whether the speechat issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, and
whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.If both these conditions are met, we must decide whether
the regulation "directly advances the governmental interestasserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson Gas & Elec.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566(1980).

Given the means by which this regulation purportedlyserves the State's interest, our conclusion is plain: Rhode
Island's regulation fails First Amendment scrutiny.

Both parties agree that the first two prongs of the Central
Hudson test are met. Even if we assume, arguendo, that
Rhode Island's regulation also satisfies the requirement thatit directly advance the governmental interest, Rhode Island's

regulation fails the final prong; that is, its ban is more exten-sive than necessary to serve the State's interest.

As we have explained, in order for a speech restriction to
pass muster under the final prong, there must be a fit between the legislature's goal and method, "a fit that is not
necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in
proportion to the interest served." Board of Trustees of
State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (internal
quotation marks omitted). While the State need not employ
the least restrictive means to accomplish its goal, the fit between means and ends must be "narrowly tailored." Ibid.
The scope of the restriction on speech must be reasonably,
though it need not be perfectly, targeted to address the harm
intended to be regulated. See Florida Bar v. Went For It,
Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 632-634 (1995). The State's regulation
must indicate a "carefu[l] calculat[ion of] the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition." Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S.
410, 417 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
availability of less burdensome alternatives to reach the
stated goal signals that the fit between the legislature's ends
and the means chosen to accomplish those ends may be too
imprecise to withstand First Amendment scrutiny. See
Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 486-487 (1995);
Cincinnati, supra, at 417, n. 13. If alternative channels permit communication of the restricted speech, the regulation is

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
more likely to be considered reasonable. See Florida Bar,
supra, at 632-634.

Rhode Island offers one, and only one, justification for itsban on price advertising. Rhode Island says that the ban is

intended to keep alcohol prices high as a way to keep consumption low. By preventing sellers from informing cus-tomers of prices, the regulation prevents competition from

driving prices down and requires consumers to spend moretime to find the best price for alcohol. Brief for Respondent
State of Rhode Island 22. The higher cost of obtaining alco-hol, Rhode Island argues, will lead to reduced consumption.

The fit between Rhode Island's method and this particular
goal is not reasonable. If the target is simply higher prices
generally to discourage consumption, the regulation imposes
too great, and unnecessary, a prohibition on speech in order
to achieve it. The State has other methods at its disposal--
methods that would more directly accomplish this stated
goal without intruding on sellers' ability to provide truthful,
nonmisleading information to customers. Indeed, Rhode Island's own expert conceded that " `the objective of lowering
consumption of alcohol by banning price advertising could
be accomplished by establishing minimum prices and/or by
increasing sales taxes on alcoholic beverages.' " 39 F. 3d 5,
7 (CA1 1994). A tax, for example, is not normally very difficult to administer and would have a far more certain and
direct effect on prices, without any restriction on speech.
The principal opinion suggests further alternatives, such as
limiting per capita purchases or conducting an educational
campaign about the dangers of alcohol consumption. Ante,
at 507. The ready availability of such alternatives--at least
some of which would far more effectively achieve Rhode Island's only professed goal, at comparatively small additional
administrative cost--demonstrates that the fit between ends
and means is not narrowly tailored. Too, this regulation
prevents sellers of alcohol from communicating price information anywhere but at the point of purchase. No channels

exist at all to permit them to publicize the price of theirproducts.

Respondents point for support to Posadas de Puerto Rico
Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986),
where, applying the Central Hudson test, we upheld the
constitutionality of a Puerto Rico law that prohibited theadvertising of casino gambling aimed at residents of Puerto

Rico, but permitted such advertising aimed at tourists.The Court there accepted as reasonable the legislature's
belief that the regulation would be effective, and concludedthat, because the restriction affected only advertising of
casino gambling aimed at residents of Puerto Rico, not that
aimed at tourists, the restriction was narrowly tailored to
serve Puerto Rico's interest. 478 U. S., at 341-344. The
Court accepted without question Puerto Rico's account of the
effectiveness and reasonableness of its speech restriction.
Respondents ask us to make a similar presumption here to
uphold the validity of Rhode Island's law.

It is true that Posadas accepted as reasonable, without
further inquiry, Puerto Rico's assertions that the regulations
furthered the government's interest and were no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. Since Posadas, however, this Court has examined more searchingly the
State's professed goal, and the speech restriction put into
place to further it, before accepting a State's claim that the
speech restriction satisfies First Amendment scrutiny. See,
e. g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., supra; Rubin v. Coors
Brewing Co., supra; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and
Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S. 136
(1994); Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993); Cincinnati v.
Discovery Network, Inc., supra. In each of these cases we
declined to accept at face value the proffered justification for
the State's regulation, but examined carefully the relationship between the asserted goal and the speech restriction
used to reach that goal. The closer look that we have required since Posadas comports better with the purpose of

532 44 LIQUORMART, INC. v. RHODE ISLAND

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
the analysis set out in Central Hudson, by requiring theState to show that the speech restriction directly advances

its interest and is narrowly tailored. Under such a closerlook, Rhode Island's price-advertising ban clearly fails to
pass muster.

Because Rhode Island's regulation fails even the less strin-gent standard set out in

Central Hudson, nothing here
requires adoption of a new analysis for the evaluation ofcommercial speech regulation. The principal opinion acknowledges that "even under the less than strict standardthat generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State
has failed to establish a reasonable fit between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal." Ante, at 507 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because we need go no
further, I would not here undertake the question whether
the test we have employed since Central Hudson should
be displaced.

Respondents argue that an additional factor, the Twentyfirst Amendment, tips the First Amendment analysis in
Rhode Island's favor.

The Twenty-first Amendment repealed the prohibition on
the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors that had been established by the Eighteenth Amendment. Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment created an
exception to the normal operation of the Commerce Clause,
to permit States to prohibit commerce in, or the use of, alcoholic beverages. Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 206 (1976).

In its examination of Rhode Island's statute, the Court of
Appeals erroneously concluded that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an "added presumption in favor of the validity
of the state regulation." 39 F. 3d, at 7-9 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save
an otherwise invalid restriction on speech.

Nothing in the Amendment's text or history justifies its
use to alter the application of the First Amendment. "[O]ur
prior cases have made clear that the [Twenty-first] Amend517US2$49J 02-04-99 19:52:11 PAGES OPINPGT

ment does not license the States to ignore their obligationsunder other provisions of the Constitution."

Capital Cities
Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984). See also Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982) ("The
State may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first
Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establish-ment Clause of the First Amendment");

Craig, supra, at 206
("Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-firstAmendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendmentwhere the sale or use of liquor is concerned" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Twenty-first Amendment does
not trump First Amendment rights or add a presumption of
validity to a regulation that cannot otherwise satisfy First
Amendment requirements.

The Court of Appeals relied on California v. LaRue, 409
U. S. 109, 118-119 (1972), for its determination that the
Twenty-first Amendment provided an "added presumption"
of the regulation's validity. There, this Court upheld a
State's regulations prohibiting establishments licensed to
sell liquor by the drink from offering explicitly sexual entertainment. As we recently explained in Coors, "LaRue
did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead
concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where
alcohol was served." 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2. The cases
following LaRue similarly involved the regulation of nude
or nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve
alcohol. New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452
U. S. 714 (1981) (per curiam); Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S.
92 (1986) (per curiam). Nothing in LaRue suggested that
the Twenty-first Amendment would permit a State to prohibit the kind of speech at issue here, and as discussed above,
the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment clearly
indicate that the Amendment was not intended to supplant
the general application of constitutional provisions, except
for its limited exception to the Commerce Clause's normal

operation. Indeed, LaRue notes that prior decisions "didnot go so far as to hold or say that the Twenty-first Amendment supersedes all other provisions of the United StatesConstitution in the area of liquor regulations," 409 U. S., at
115, and LaRue certainly does not stand for that proposition.The Court of Appeals' reliance on

LaRue was misplaced.Rhode Island's prohibition on alcohol-price advertising, as

a means to keep alcohol prices high and consumption low,cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny. The Twentyfirst Amendment cannot save this otherwise invalid regula-tion. While I agree with the Court's finding that the regulation is invalid, I would decide that issue on narrowergrounds. I therefore concur in the judgment.

535OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. NOLAND, trustee for

debtor FIRST TRUCK LINES, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 95-323. Argued March 25, 1996--Decided May 13, 1996
The Internal Revenue Service filed claims in the Bankruptcy Court for

taxes, interest, and penalties that accrued after debtor First Truck
Lines, Inc., sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
(Code) but before the case was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
The court found that all of the IRS's claims were entitled to first priority as administrative expenses under 11 U. S. C. $$ 503(b)(1)(C) and
507(a)(1), but held that the penalty claim was subject to "equitable subordination" under $ 510(c), which the court interpreted as giving it authority not only to deal with inequitable Government conduct, but also
to adjust a statutory priority of a category of claims. The court's decision to subordinate the penalty claim to the claims of the general unsecured creditors was affirmed by the District Court and the Sixth Circuit,
which concluded that postpetition, nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims
are susceptible to subordination by their very nature.

Held: A bankruptcy court may not equitably subordinate claims on a categorical basis in derogation of Congress's priorities scheme. The language of $ 510(c), principles of statutory construction, and legislative
history clearly indicate Congress's intent in its 1978 revision of the Code
to use the existing judge-made doctrine of equitable subordination as
the starting point for deciding when subordination is appropriate. By
adopting "principles of equitable subordination," $ 510(c) allows a bankruptcy court to reorder a tax penalty when justified by particular facts.
It is also clear that Congress meant to give courts some leeway to develop the doctrine. However, a reading of the statute that would give
courts leeway broad enough to allow subordination at odds with the
congressional ordering of priorities by category is improbable in the
extreme. The statute would then empower a court to modify the priority provision's operation at the same level at which Congress operated
when it made its characteristically general judgment to establish the
hierarchy of claims in the first place, thus delegating legislative revision,
not authorizing equitable exception. Nonetheless, just such a legislative type of decision underlies the reordering of priorities here. The
Sixth Circuit's decision runs directly counter to Congress's policy judgment that a postpetition tax penalty should receive the priority of an

Opinion of the Court
administrative expense. Since the Sixth Circuit's rationale was inappropriately categorical in nature, this Court need not decide whether a
bankruptcy court must always find creditor misconduct before a claim
may be equitably subordinated. Pp. 538-543.

48 F. 3d 210, reversed and remanded.

Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Kent L. Jones argued the cause for the United States.With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Days, Assistant Attorney General Argrett, Deputy Solicitor GeneralWallace, Gary D. Gray, and Edward T. Perelmuter.

Raymond J. Pikna, Jr., argued the cause for respondent.With him on the brief were

Thomas R. Noland and GregoryP. Garner.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is the scope of a bankruptcy court'spower of equitable subordination under 11 U. S. C. $ 510(c).

Here, in the absence of any finding of inequitable conduct onthe part of the Government, the Bankruptcy Court subordinated the Government's claim for a postpetition, noncom-pensatory tax penalty, which would normally receive first
priority in bankruptcy as an "administrative expense,"$$ 503(b)(1)(C), 507(a)(1). We hold that the bankruptcy
court may not equitably subordinate claims on a categoricalbasis in derogation of Congress's scheme of priorities.

In April 1986, First Truck Lines, Inc., voluntarily filedfor relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and
in the subsequent operation of its business as a debtor-in-possession incurred, but failed to discharge, tax liabilities to
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). First Truck moved toconvert the case to a Chapter 7 liquidation in June 1988, and
in August 1988 the Bankruptcy Court granted that motionand appointed respondent Thomas R. Noland as trustee.
The liquidation of the estate's assets raised insufficient fundsto pay all of the creditors.

Opinion of the Court
After the conversion, the IRS filed claims for taxes, interest, and penalties that accrued after the Chapter 11
filing but before the Chapter 7 conversion, and although the
parties agreed that the claims for taxes and interest were
entitled to priority as administrative expenses, $$ 503(b),
507(a)(1), and 726(a)(1),1 they disagreed about the priority to
be given tax penalties. The Bankruptcy Court determined
that the penalties (like the taxes and interest) were administrative expenses under $ 503(b) but held them to be subject
to equitable subordination under $ 510(c).2 In so doing, the
court read that section to provide authority not only to deal
with inequitable conduct on the Government's part, but also
to adjust a statutory priority of a category of claims. The
Bankruptcy Court accordingly weighed the relative equities
that seemed to flow from what it described as "the Code's
preference for compensating actual loss claims," and subordinated the tax penalty claim to those of the general unsecured
creditors. In re First Truck Lines, Inc., 141 B. R. 621, 629
(SD Ohio 1992). The District Court affirmed. Internal
Revenue Service v. Noland, 190 B. R. 827 (SD Ohio 1993).

After reviewing the legislative history of the 1978 revision
to the Bankruptcy Code and several recent appeals cases on
equitable subordination of tax penalties, the Sixth Circuit
affirmed, as well. In re First Truck Lines, Inc., 48 F. 3d 210
(1995). The Sixth Circuit stated that it did

1 Section 507(a)(1) provides, in relevant part: "(a) The following expenses
and claims have priority in the following order: (1) First, administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b) of this title . . . ." Under

$ 503(b)(1), administrative expenses include "any tax . . . incurred by the
estate" (with certain exceptions not relevant here), as well as "any fine
[or] penalty . . . relating to [such] a tax . . . ." Section 726(a)(1) adopts the
order of payment specified in $ 507 for Chapter 7 proceedings.

2 Section 510(c) provides that "the court may . . . under principles of

equitable subordination, subordinate for purposes of distribution all or
part of an allowed claim . . . ."

Opinion of the Court
"not see the fairness or the justice in permitting theCommissioner's claim for tax penalties, which are not

being assessed because of pecuniary losses to the Inter-nal Revenue Service, to enjoy an equal or higher priority with claims based on the extension of value to thedebtor, whether secured or not. Further, assessing tax
penalties against the estate of a debtor no longer inexistence serves no punitive purpose. Because of the
nature of postpetition, nonpecuniary loss tax penaltyclaims in a Chapter 7 case, we believe such claims are
susceptible to subordination. To hold otherwise wouldbe to allow creditors who have supported the business
during its attempt to reorganize to be penalized oncethat effort has failed and there is not enough to go
around." Id., at 218.
See also Burden v. United States, 917 F. 2d 115, 120 (CA31990);

F. 2d 1246, 1250 (CA7 1990). We granted certiorari to deter-mine the appropriate scope of the power under the Bankruptcy Code (Code) to subordinate a tax penalty, 516 U. S.1005 (1995), and we now reverse.

The judge-made doctrine of equitable subordination pre-dates Congress's revision of the Code in 1978. Relying in
part on our earlier cases, see, e. g., Comstock v. Group of

Institutional Investors, 335 U. S. 211 (1948); Pepper v. Lit-ton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939); Taylor v. Standard Gas & Elec.

Co., 306 U. S. 307 (1939), the Fifth Circuit, in its influentialopinion in In re Mobile Steel Co., 563 F. 2d 692, 700 (1977),
observed that the application of the doctrine was generallytriggered by a showing that the creditor had engaged in
"some type of inequitable conduct." Mobile Steel discussedtwo further conditions relating to the application of the doctrine: that the misconduct have "resulted in injury to thecreditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair advantage
on the claimant," and that the subordination "not be incon517US2$50M 02-07-99 17:58:22 PAGES OPINPGT

sistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act." Ibid.
This last requirement has been read as a "reminder to the
bankruptcy court that although it is a court of equity, it is
not free to adjust the legally valid claim of an innocent party
who asserts the claim in good faith merely because the court
perceives that the result is inequitable. " DeNatale &
Abram, The Doctrine of Equitable Subordination as Applied
to Nonmanagement Creditors, 40 Bus. Law. 417, 428 (1985).
The District Courts and Courts of Appeals have generally
followed the Mobile Steel formulation, In re Baker & Getty
Financial Services, Inc., 974 F. 2d 712, 717 (CA6 1992).

Although Congress included no explicit criteria for equitable subordination when it enacted $ 510(c)(1), the reference
in $ 510(c) to "principles of equitable subordination" clearly
indicates congressional intent at least to start with existing
doctrine. This conclusion is confirmed both by principles of
statutory construction, see Midlantic Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S. 494, 501
(1986) ("The normal rule of statutory construction is that if
Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation
of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.
The Court has followed this rule with particular care in
construing the scope of bankruptcy codifications") (citation
omitted), and by statements in the legislative history that
Congress "intended that the term `principles of equitable
subordination' follow existing case law and leave to the
courts development of this principle," 124 Cong. Rec. 32398
(1978) (Rep. Edwards); see also id., at 33998 (Sen. DeConcini). In keeping with pre-1978 doctrine, many Courts of
Appeals have continued to require inequitable conduct before allowing the equitable subordination of most claims, see,
e. g., In re Fabricators, Inc., 926 F. 2d 1458, 1464 (CA5 1991);
In re Bellanca Aircraft Corp., 850 F. 2d 1275, 1282-1283
(CA8 1988), although several have done away with the requirement when the claim in question was a tax penalty.

540 UNITED STATES v. NOLAND

Opinion of the Court
See, e. g., Burden, supra, at 120; Schultz, supra, at 234; In re
Virtual Network, supra, at 1250.

Section 510(c) may of course be applied to subordinate atax penalty, since the Code's requirement that a Chapter 7

trustee must distribute assets "in the order specified in . . .
section 507" (which gives a first priority to administra-tive expense tax penalties) is subject to the qualification,

"[e]xcept as provided in section 510 of this title . . . ." 11U. S. C. $ 726(a). Thus, "principles of equitable subordination" may allow a bankruptcy court to reorder a tax penaltyin a given case. It is almost as clear that Congress meant
to give courts some leeway to develop the doctrine, 124
Cong. Rec. 33998 (1978), rather than to freeze the pre-1978
law in place. The question is whether that leeway is broad
enough to allow subordination at odds with the congressional
ordering of priorities by category.

The answer turns on Congress's probable intent to preserve the distinction between the relative levels of generality at which trial courts and legislatures respectively function in the normal course. Hence, the adoption in $ 510(c) of
"principles of equitable subordination" permits a court to
make exceptions to a general rule when justified by particular facts, cf. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329 (1944)
("The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of
the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the
necessities of the particular case"). But if the provision also
authorized a court to conclude on a general, categorical level
that tax penalties should not be treated as administrative
expenses to be paid first, it would empower a court to modify
the operation of the priority statute at the same level at
which Congress operated when it made its characteristically
general judgment to establish the hierarchy of claims in the
first place. That is, the distinction between characteristic
legislative and trial court functions would simply be swept
away, and the statute would delegate legislative revision, not
authorize equitable exception. We find such a reading im517US2$50M 02-07-99 17:58:22 PAGES OPINPGT

541Cite as: 517 U. S. 535 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
probable in the extreme. "Decisions about the treatment ofcategories of claims in bankruptcy proceedings . . . are not

dictated or illuminated by principles of equity and do not fallwithin the judicial power of equitable subordination . . . ."
Burden, 917 F. 2d, at 122 (Alito, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part).

Just such a legislative type of decision, however, underliesthe Bankruptcy Court's reordering of priorities in question
here, as approved by the District Court and the Court ofAppeals. Despite language in its opinion about requiring a
balancing of the equities in individual cases, the Court ofAppeals actually concluded that "postpetition, nonpecuniary
loss tax penalty claims" are "susceptible to subordination"by their very "nature." 48 F. 3d, at 218. And although the
court said that not every tax penalty would be equitablysubordinated, ibid., that would be the inevitable result of
consistent applications of the rule employed here, which de-pends not on individual equities but on the supposedly general unfairness of satisfying "postpetition, nonpecuniary losstax penalty claims" before the claims of a general creditor.

The Court of Appeals's decision thus runs directly counterto Congress's policy judgment that a postpetition tax penalty
should receive the priority of an administrative expense, 11U. S. C. $$ 503(b)(1)(C), 507(a)(1), and 726(a)(1). This is true
regardless of Noland's argument that the Bankruptcy Courtmade a distinction between compensatory and noncompensatory tax penalties, for this was itself a categorical distinctionat a legislative level of generality. Indeed, Congress recognized and employed that distinction elsewhere in the priorityprovisions: Congress specifically assigned 8th priority to
certain compensatory tax penalties, see $ 507(a)(8)(G), and12th priority to prepetition, noncompensatory penalties, see

$$ 726(a)(1) and (4).3

3 Noland argues that "although the penalties at issue arose postpetition,"
this claim should be viewed as a prepetition penalty because a "reorganized debtor is in many respects similar to a prepetition debtor . . . [and]

542 UNITED STATES v. NOLAND

Opinion of the Court
The Sixth Circuit, to be sure, invoked a more modest authority than legislative revision when it relied on statements
by the congressional leaders of the 1978 Code revisions, see
48 F. 3d, at 215, 217-218, and it is true that Representative
Edwards and Senator DeConcini stated that "under existing
law, a claim is generally subordinated only if [the] holder of
such claim is guilty of inequitable conduct, or the claim itself
is of a status susceptible to subordination, such as a penalty
or a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of
a security of the debtor." 124 Cong. Rec. 32398 (1978) (Rep.
Edwards); see also id., at 33998 (Sen. DeConcini). But their
remarks were not statements of existing law and the Sixth
Circuit's reliance on the unexplained reference to subordinated penalties ran counter to this Court's previous endorsement of priority treatment for postpetition tax penalties.
See Nicholas v. United States, 384 U. S. 678, 692-695 (1966).

the conversion of [this] case to chapter 7 was tantamount to the filing of a
new petition." Brief for Respondent 16, n. 7. But we agree with the
Sixth Circuit, see In re First Truck Lines, Inc., 48 F. 3d 210, 214 (1995),
that the penalties at issue here are postpetition administrative expenses
pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $$ 348(d), 503(b)(1). Although $ 348(d) provides
that a "claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order
for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section
1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, other than a claim specified in section
503(b) of this title, shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had
arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition," the claim
for priority here is "specified in section 503(b)" and Congress has already
determined that it is not to be treated like prepetition penalties. Noland
may or may not have a valid policy argument, but it is up to Congress,
not this Court, to revise the determination if it so chooses.

Opinion of the Court
Given our conclusion that the Sixth Circuit's rationale wasinappropriately categorical in nature, we need not decide

today whether a bankruptcy court must always find creditormisconduct before a claim may be equitably subordinated.
We do hold that (in the absence of a need to reconcile con-flicting congressional choices) the circumstances that prompt
a court to order equitable subordination must not occur atthe level of policy choice at which Congress itself operated
in drafting the Code. Cf. In re Ahlswede, 516 F. 2d 784, 787(CA9) ("[T]he [equity] chancellor never did, and does not now,
exercise unrestricted power to contradict statutory or com-mon law when he feels a fairer result may be obtained by
application of a different rule"), cert. denied sub nom. Steb-bins v. Crocker Citizens Nat. Bank, 423 U. S. 913 (1975); In
re Columbia Ribbon Co., 117 F. 2d 999, 1002 (CA3 1941)(court cannot "set up a subclassification of claims . . . and
fix an order of priority for the sub-classes according to itstheory of equity").

In this instance, Congress could have, but did not, denynoncompensatory, postpetition tax penalties the first priority
given to other administrative expenses, and bankruptcycourts may not take it upon themselves to make that categorical determination under the guise of equitable subordina-tion. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERSUNION LOCAL 751

v. BROWN GROUP, INC.,
dba BROWN SHOE CO.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 95-340. Argued February 20, 1996--Decided May 13, 1996
Petitioner union filed this suit, alleging that respondent company began to

lay off workers in connection with the closing of one of its plants before
giving the union the closing notice required by the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), and seeking backpay for
each of its affected members. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the suit was
barred because the union failed to meet the third part of the test for
determining associational standing.

Held:

1. The WARN Act grants a union authority to sue for damages on
behalf of its members, North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29,
31; the writ of certiorari therefore was not improvidently granted.
Pp. 548-550.

2. The union has standing to bring this action. Pp. 551-558.

(a) Under modern associational standing doctrine, an organization
may sue to redress its members' injuries when: "(a) its members would
otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it
seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit." Hunt v. Washington State
Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 343. The requirement of
individual participation has been understood to preclude associational
standing when an organization seeks damages on behalf of its members.
The question here is whether a bar to the union's suit found in this
third prong of the test is constitutional and absolute, or prudential and
malleable by Congress. The Court of Appeals apparently concluded
that the test's third prong is of constitutional character, for it denied
standing even though the WARN Act permits the union to sue for its
members' damages. Pp. 551-554.

(b) The test's first prong is grounded in Article III as an element of
the constitutional case or controversy requirement. Resort to general
principles, however, leads to the conclusion that the third prong is a
prudential impediment that Congress may abrogate. Hunt's require517US2$51Z 02-04-99 20:35:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ment that an organization suing as representative include at least one
member with standing to present, in his or her own right, the claim
pleaded by the association is an Article III necessity for the association's
representative suit. Hunt's second prong is complementary to the first,
because it raises an assurance that the association's litigators will themselves have a stake in the resolution of the dispute, and thus be in a
position to serve as the defendant's natural adversary. But once an
association has satisfied Hunt's first and second prongs assuring adversarial vigor in pursuing a claim for which member Article III standing
exists, it is difficult to see a constitutional necessity for anything more.
The third prong is best seen as focusing on matters of administrative
convenience and efficiency, not on elements of a case or controversy.
Circumstantial evidence of that prong's prudential nature is seen in
the wide variety of other contexts in which a statute, federal rule,
or accepted common-law practice permits one person to sue on behalf
of another, even where damages are sought. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e-5(f)(1). Pp. 554-558.

60 days' notice before a plant closing or mass layoff. If anemployer fails to give the notice, the employees may sue for

backpay for each day of the violation, and, in the alternative,the union is ostensibly authorized to sue on their behalf.
See North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29 (1995); PartII,

infra.Permitting a union to sue under the Act on behalf of its

employee-members raises a question of standing. In Huntv. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S.
333 (1977), we described a three-prong test for an associa-tion's standing to sue based on injury to one of its members.
The third element, at issue here, would bar such a suit when"the claim asserted [or] the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit." Id., at 343.Relying on

Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), Hunt heldthat "individual participation" is not normally necessary

when an association seeks prospective or injunctive relief forits members, but indicated that such participation would be
required in an action for damages to an association's mem-bers, thus suggesting that an association's action for damages
running solely to its members would be barred for want ofthe association's standing to sue. See

Hunt, supra, at 343.The questions presented here are whether, in enacting

the WARN Act, Congress intended to abrogate this other-wise applicable standing limitation so as to permit the
union to sue for damages running to its workers, and, if it did,whether it had the constitutional authority to do so. We
answer yes to each question.

I
On January 17, 1992, respondent Brown Shoe Companywrote to a representative of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, stating that Brown Shoewould shut down its Dixon, Missouri, plant and permanently
lay off 277 employees beginning on March 20, 1992. App.62-63. The complaint filed by petitioner United Food and

Opinion of the Court
Commercial Workers Union Local 751 charged that Brown
Shoe's representations were false insofar as they are relevant here, and that in fact, even before sending the letter,
Brown Shoe had begun the layoffs, which continued through
February and into March. App. 8-9.1 The union accordingly claimed a violation of the WARN Act and sought the
statutory remedy of 60-days' backpay for each of its affected members.

The District Court dismissed the complaint under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), saying that "when an organization seeks to recover monetary relief on behalf of its
members, courts have found that such claims necessarily require participation of individual members in the suit." 820
F. Supp. 1192, 1193-1194 (ED Mo. 1993). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that "[e]ach
union member who wishes to recover WARN Act damages
from Brown Shoe must participate in the suit so that his or
her right to damages can be determined and the quantum
of damages can be calculated by the court on the basis of
particularized proof. Therefore, the union cannot meet the
third part of the Hunt test and is precluded from asserting
associational standing." 50 F. 3d 1426, 1432 (1995).2 We
granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 930 (1995), and now reverse.

1 Because the District Court dismissed the complaint, for the purposes
of deciding this appeal we assume the truth of this allegation. Nor do we
reach the merits of, or any other issue about, the union's further complaint
that Brown Shoe's letter was defective because it was sent to an individual
who worked for the International. The complaint alleges that United
Food Local 751, not the International or its employee, is the exclusive
representative of the affected employees and is thus statutorily entitled
to notice of the closing and mass layoff.

2 The District Court had also denied the union's motion to amend its

complaint to add employees as plaintiffs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a-19a.
The Court of Appeals held that the District Court's decision in this respect
did not represent an abuse of its discretion. 50 F. 3d, at 1432. The correctness of this determination is outside the scope of the questions presented here. See Pet. for Cert. i.

BROWN GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

II
At the outset, Brown Shoe argues that the WARN Act
grants a union no authority to sue for damages on behalf of
its members. Because the question on which we granted
certiorari (whether Congress has the constitutional authority
to alter the third prong of the associational standing enquiry)
assumes that the WARN Act does grant the union such authority, Brown Shoe urges us to declare the writ of certiorari
improvidently granted. In North Star Steel, however, we
noted, contrary to Brown Shoe's position, that "[t]he class of
plaintiffs" who may sue for backpay under the WARN Act
"includes aggrieved employees (or their unions, as representatives)." 515 U. S., at 31, and on further consideration
we have no doubt that we were reading the statute correctly.

The key requirement of the Act is found in $ 2102, which
prohibits an employer from ordering "a plant closing or mass
layoff until the end of a 60-day period" running from the date
of the employer's written notice of the closing or layoff "(1)
to each representative of the affected employees as of the
time of the notice or, if there is no such representative at
that time, to each affected employee," and "(2) to the State
dislocated worker unit . . . and the chief elected official of the
unit of local government within which such closing or layoff
is to occur." 29 U. S. C. $ 2102(a). Congress defined the
"representative" to which $ 2102(a)(1) refers as the employees' union, "an exclusive representative of employees within
the meaning of section 9(a) or 8(f) of the National Labor
Relations Act (29 U. S. C. 159(a), 158(f)) or section 2 of the
Railway Labor Act (45 U. S. C. 152)." 102 Stat. 890, 29
U. S. C. $ 2101(a)(4).

Enforcement of the $ 2102 notice requirement is addressed
in $ 2104(a), the following provisions of which answer Brown
Shoe's argument. Section 2104(a)(1) makes a violating employer liable to "each aggrieved employee" for backpay and

517US2$51M 02-04-99 20:35:04 PAGES OPINPGT

549Cite as: 517 U. S. 544 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
benefits for each day of the violation.3 Section 2104(a)(5)provides that "[a] person seeking to enforce such liability,

including a representative of employees . . . aggrieved underparagraph (1) . . . , may sue either for such person or for
other persons similarly situated, or both, [in an appropriatedistrict court]."

Since the union is the "representative of employees . . .aggrieved," it is a person who may sue on behalf of the "persons similarly situated" in order to "enforce such liability.""[S]uch liability" must refer to liability under $ 2104, since
its remedies are exclusive. See 29 U. S. C. $ 2104(b). Be-cause the section makes no provision for liability to the union
itself, any "such liability" sought by the union must (so faras concerns us here) be liability to its employee-members, so
long as they can be understood to be "persons similarly situ-ated" for the purposes of the Act. We believe they may
be so understood, since each is aggrieved by the employer'sfailure to give timely notice.

Brown Shoe's alternative construction is unconvincing. Itcontends that a previous bill would have imposed civil liability on employers who failed to notify the union of a plant

3 102 Stat. 893, as set forth in 29 U. S. C. $ 2104(a)(1):
"Any employer who orders a plant closing or mass layoff in violation of
section 2102 of this title shall be liable to each aggrieved employee who
suffers an employment loss as a result of such closing or layoff for--

"(A) back pay for each day of violation at a rate of compensation not
less than the higher of--

"(i) the average regular rate received by such employee during the last
3 years of the employee's employment; or

"(ii) the final regular rate received by such employee; and
"(B) benefits under an employee benefit plan . . . , including the cost of
medical expenses incurred during the employment loss which would have
been covered under an employee benefit plan if the employment loss had
not occurred.

"Such liability shall be calculated for the period of the violation, up to a
maximum of 60 days, but in no event for more than one-half the number
of days the employee was employed by the employer."

Opinion of the Court

closing or mass layoff, and would have permitted the union
to sue to recover a penalty where an employer failed to provide the required notice. See S. 538, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.
(1987). In the ultimately enacted version of the legislation,
Congress eliminated this provision, with the result that the
WARN Act no longer speaks to the "rights and welfare of
unions," Brief for Respondent 12. Brown Shoe's argument
is that the class of persons "similarly situated" is the class
entitled to sue for damages, so that the elimination of the
union's entitlement to a civil penalty requires the conclusion
that the union is no longer "similarly situated" to "employees
. . . aggrieved under paragraph (1)," and thus not permitted
to sue under the Act.

The flaw in this argument is that it would force us to conclude that the provision for suits by unions is attributable
only to congressional inadvertence, whereas inadvertence is
not the only possible, or even plausible, explanation for the
authorization. For one, the statutory reference to persons
"similarly situated" can very readily be understood to mean
the class of persons to whom notice is owed but not given.
In this respect, the union and its members are certainly persons "similarly situated." Brown Shoe's argument also fails
to explain why Congress would necessarily have intended to
eliminate the union's power to sue on behalf of members (as
Brown Shoe assumes the union could have done prior to the
amendment) just because the union was no longer entitled to
a penalty in its own right. The argument for Brown Shoe's
preferred construction simply rests on one speculative possibility in opposing a straightforward reading of the provision
that a union may bring suit on behalf of its members, who
are "employees . . . aggrieved under paragraph (1)." Speculation loses, for the more natural reading of the statute's
text, which would give effect to all of its provisions, always
prevails over a mere suggestion to disregard or ignore duly
enacted law as legislative oversight.

Opinion of the Court

III
This brings us to the primary question in the case:whether the union has standing to bring this action on behalf

of its members.4 Article III of the Constitution limits thefederal judicial power to "Cases" or "Controversies," thereby
entailing as an "irreducible minimum" that there be (1) aninjury in fact, (2) a causal relationship between the injury
and the challenged conduct, and (3) a likelihood that the in-jury will be redressed by a favorable decision. See,

e. g.,
Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors ofAmerica v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 663 (1993); Valley

Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separa-tion of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982).
Supplementing these constitutional requirements, the pru-dential doctrine of standing has come to encompass "several
judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal juris-diction." See

Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984); seealso Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 97 (1968). The question

here is whether a bar to the union's suit found in the test forso-called associational standing is constitutional and absolute, or prudential and malleable by Congress.

A
The notion that an organization might have standing toassert its members' injury has roots in

NAACP v. Alabamaex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 459 (1958), where the Court

noted that for the purpose of determining the scope of the

4 The union also argues that it has standing because it suffered direct
injury. The Court of Appeals held that the union lacked standing to assert its direct injury because neither backpay to the employees nor its
"catch-all prayer for relief " would redress the union's injury. 50 F. 3d
1426, 1431, n. 7 (CA8 1995). The union argues here that its injury would
be redressed because an award of damages to the employees would deter
future violations and would facilitate the union's role in assisting its members. In light of our resolution of the associational standing question, we
do not have occasion today to address this issue.

Opinion of the Court

National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo-ple's (NAACP's) rights as a litigant, the association "and its

members are in every practical sense identical." The Courtaccordingly permitted the NAACP to rely on violations of
its members' First Amendment associational rights in suing
to bar the State of Alabama from compelling disclosure of theassociation's membership lists. See also

Joint Anti-Fascist
Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 183-187 (1951)(Jackson, J., concurring);

Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249,
255-259 (1953); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428 (1963);
National Motor Freight Traffic Assn., Inc. v. United States,
372 U. S. 246, 247 (1963); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S.727, 739 (1972).

The modern doctrine of associational standing, under
which an organization may sue to redress its members' in-juries, even without a showing of injury to the association

itself, emerges from a trilogy of cases. We first squarelyrecognized an organization's standing to bring such a suit
in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975).

"The association must allege that its members, or any
one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened in-jury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that

would make out a justiciable case had the membersthemselves brought suit. . . . [S]o long as the nature of
the claim and of the relief sought does not make theindividual participation of each injured party indispensable to proper resolution of the cause, the association
may be an appropriate representative of its members,entitled to invoke the court's jurisdiction."

Id., at 511.

Warth's requirements for associational standing were elaborated in Hunt. There we held that the Washington State
Apple Advertising Commission, a state agency whose statutory charge was to promote the State's apple industry, had
standing to bring a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a
North Carolina statute forbidding the display of Washington

Opinion of the Court
State apple grades on apple containers. Relying on Warth,the Hunt Court stated a three-prong associational standing

test:

"[W]e have recognized that an association has standingto bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their ownright; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane
to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claimasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit." 432 U. S.,at 343.

Finally, in Automobile Workers v. Brock, 477 U. S. 274(1986), we held that a union had standing to challenge an
agency's construction of a statute providing benefits to work-ers who lost their jobs because of competition from imports.
The union there did not allege any injury to itself, nor was itargued that the members' associational rights were affected.
Reaffirming and applying the three-part test emerging fromWarth and Hunt, we held that the union had standing to
bring the suit. 477 U. S., at 281-288. See also Pennell v.
San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 7, and n. 3 (1988).

B
The Court of Appeals here concluded that the union'smembers would have had standing to sue on their own (the

first prong), and recognized that the interests the unionsought to protect were germane to its purpose (the second
prong). But it denied the union's claim of standing becauseit found that the relief sought by the union, damages on behalf of its members, would require the participation of indi-vidual members in the lawsuit. 50 F. 3d, at 1431. It relied
on the statement in Warth that "[i]f in a proper case theassociation seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other
form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed thatthe remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those

Opinion of the Court

members of the association actually injured. Indeed, in allcases in which we have expressly recognized standing in associations to represent their members, the relief sought hasbeen of this kind." 422 U. S., at 515. These and later precedents have been understood to preclude associational stand-ing when an organization seeks damages on behalf of its
members. See, e. g., Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. Allnet Communication Services, Inc., 806F. 2d 1093, 1094-1095 (CADC 1986) ("[L]ower federal courts

have consistently rejected association assertions of standingto seek monetary, as distinguished from injunctive or declaratory, relief on behalf of the organization's members") (col-lecting cases).

5

One court has suggested that this bar is of constitutionalmagnitude, see National Assn. of Realtors v. National Real

Estate Assn., Inc., 894 F. 2d 937, 941 (CA7 1990) ("[A]ssocia-tions have been held to have standing under Article III of
the Constitution to seek injunctive relief--but never dam-ages"). The Court of Appeals here apparently agreed with
that suggestion, and so dismissed for lack of union standingdespite the WARN Act's provision permitting the union to
sue. We therefore take up the question whether the thirdprong of the associational standing enquiry is of constitutional character. C

Although Warth noted that the test's first requirement,that at least one of the organization's members would have
standing to sue on his own, is grounded on Article III asan element of "the constitutional requirement of a case or

5 United Food argues that "given the simplified nature of the monetary
relief here provided," Brief for Petitioner 44, n. 17, the third prong of the
Hunt test is satisfied despite its claim for damages. In light of our conclusion that in the WARN Act Congress has abrogated the third prong of
the associational standing test, we need not decide here whether, absent
congressional action, the third prong would bar a "simplified" claim for
damages.

Opinion of the Court
controversy," Warth, supra, at 511, our cases have not other-wise clearly disentangled the constitutional from the prudential strands of the associational standing test. Cf. Valley
Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S., at 471 ("[I]t has
not always been clear in the opinions of this Court whetherparticular features of the `standing' requirement have been

required by Art. III ex proprio vigore, or whether they arerequirements that the Court itself has erected and which
were not compelled by the language of the Constitution");June, The Structure of Standing Requirements for Citizen
Suits and the Scope of Congressional Power, 24 Envtl. L.
761, 793 (1994) (noting uncertainty "whether requirements
such as [associational] standing are constitutional or prudential in nature"). Resort to general principles, however,
leads us to say that the associational standing test's third
prong is a prudential one.

There are two ways in which Hunt addresses the Article
III requirements of injury in fact, causal connection to the
defendant's conduct, and redressability. First and most obviously, it guarantees the satisfaction of these elements by
requiring an organization suing as representative to include
at least one member with standing to present, in his or her
own right, the claim (or the type of claim) pleaded by the
association. As Hunt's most direct address to Article III
standing, this first prong can only be seen as itself an Article III necessity for an association's representative suit.
Cf. Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426
U. S. 26, 40 (1976) (the association "can establish standing
only as representatives of those of their members who have
been injured in fact, and thus could have brought suit in their
own right"). Hunt's second prong is, at the least, complementary to the first, for its demand that an association plaintiff be organized for a purpose germane to the subject of
its member's claim raises an assurance that the association's
litigators will themselves have a stake in the resolution of

the dispute, and thus be in a position to serve as the defend-ant's natural adversary.

6 But once an association has satisfied Hunt's first and second prongs assuring adversarialvigor in pursuing a claim for which member Article III

standing exists, it is difficult to see a constitutional necessityfor anything more. See generally

Lujan v. Defenders ofWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992). To see Hunt's third

prong as resting on less than constitutional necessity is not,of course, to rob it of its value. It may well promote adversarial intensity. It may guard against the hazard of litigat-ing a case to the damages stage only to find the plaintiff
lacking detailed records or the evidence necessary to showthe harm with sufficient specificity. And it may hedge
against any risk that the damages recovered by the associa-tion will fail to find their way into the pockets of the members on whose behalf injury is claimed. But these consider-ations are generally on point whenever one plaintiff sues for

6 Because the union is statutorily entitled to receive notice under the
WARN Act, and because of the paramount role, under federal labor law,
that unions play in protecting the interests of their members, it is clear
that this test is satisfied here. We therefore need not decide whether this
prong is prudential in the sense that Congress may definitively declare
that a particular relation is sufficient.

The germaneness of a suit to an association's purpose may, of course,
satisfy a standing requirement without necessarily rendering the association's representation adequate to justify giving the association's suit preclusive effect as against an individual ostensibly represented. See generally Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797 (1985); Matsushita
Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367, 395-399 (1996) (Ginsburg,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also Automobile Workers v. Brock, 477 U. S. 274, 289 (1986) ("[A]n association might prove an
inadequate representative of its members' legal interests for a number of
reasons"); Note, Associational Standing and Due Process: The Need for an
Adequate Representation Scrutiny, 61 B. U. L. Rev. 174 (1981). In this
case, of course, no one disputes the adequacy of the union, selected by the
employees following procedures governed by a detailed body of federal
law and serving as the duly authorized collective-bargaining representative of the employees, as an associational representative. See generally
NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575 (1969).

another's injury. And although we noted in Flast that "alitigant will ordinarily not be permitted to assert the rights

of absent third parties," 392 U. S., at 99, n. 20; see also ValleyForge, supra, at 474, we recognized in Allen v. Wright, 468
U. S., at 751, that "the general prohibition on a litigant's rais-ing another person's legal rights" is a "judicially self-imposed
limi[t] on the exercise of federal jurisdiction," not a constitu-tional mandate. Indeed, the entire doctrine of "representational standing," of which the notion of "associational stand-ing" is only one strand, rests on the premise that in certain
circumstances, particular relationships (recognized either bycommon-law tradition

7 or by statute 8) are sufficient to rebut

the background presumption (in the statutory context, aboutCongress's intent) that litigants may not assert the rights

of absent third parties. Hence the third prong of the as-sociational standing test is best seen as focusing on these
matters of administrative convenience and efficiency, not onelements of a case or controversy within the meaning of
the Constitution.Circumstantial evidence of the prudential nature of this
requirement is seen in the wide variety of other contexts inwhich a statute, federal rule, or accepted common-law practice permits one person to sue on behalf of another, evenwhere damages are sought. "[R]epresentative damages litigation is common--from class actions under Fed. R. Civ.

to sue for backpay on behalf of employees who are victimsof employment discrimination, General Telephone Co. of

sue for the recovery of unpaid minimum wages and overtimecompensation, 29 U. S. C. $ 216(c). If these provisions for
representative actions were generally resulting in nonad-versarial actions that failed to resolve the claims of the individuals ultimately interested, their disservice to the coreArticle III requirements would be no secret. There is no
reason to expect that union actions under the WARN Actportend any greater Article III incursions.

D
Because Congress authorized the union to sue for its mem-bers' damages, and because the only impediment to that suit

is a general limitation, judicially fashioned and prudentiallyimposed, there is no question that Congress may abrogate
the impediment. As we noted in Warth, prudential limita-tions are rules of "judicial self-governance" that "Congress
may remove . . . by statute." 422 U. S., at 509. It has doneso without doubt in this instance.

559OCTOBER TERM, 1995

BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE
certiorari to the supreme court of alabama
No. 94-896. Argued October 11, 1995--Decided May 20, 1996
After respondent Gore purchased a new BMW automobile from an authorized Alabama dealer, he discovered that the car had been repainted.
He brought this suit for compensatory and punitive damages against
petitioner, the American distributor of BMW's, alleging, inter alia, that
the failure to disclose the repainting constituted fraud under Alabama
law. At trial, BMW acknowledged that it followed a nationwide policy
of not advising its dealers, and hence their customers, of predelivery
damage to new cars when the cost of repair did not exceed 3 percent of
the car's suggested retail price. Gore's vehicle fell into that category.
The jury returned a verdict finding BMW liable for compensatory damages of $4,000, and assessing $4 million in punitive damages. The trial
judge denied BMW's post-trial motion to set aside the punitive damages
award, holding, among other things, that the award was not "grossly
excessive" and thus did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 454. The Alabama Supreme Court agreed,
but reduced the award to $2 million on the ground that, in computing
the amount, the jury had improperly multiplied Gore's compensatory
damages by the number of similar sales in all States, not just those
in Alabama.

Held: The $2 million punitive damages award is grossly excessive and

therefore exceeds the constitutional limit. Pp. 568-586.

(a) Because such an award violates due process only when it can fairly
be categorized as "grossly excessive" in relation to the State's legitimate
interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition, cf.
TXO, 509 U. S., at 456, the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately
begins with an identification of the state interests that such an award
is designed to serve. Principles of state sovereignty and comity forbid
a State to enact policies for the entire Nation, or to impose its own
policy choice on neighboring States. See, e. g., Healy v. Beer Institute,
491 U. S. 324, 335-336. Accordingly, the economic penalties that a State
inflicts on those who transgress its laws, whether the penalties are legislatively authorized fines or judicially imposed punitive damages, must
be supported by the State's interest in protecting its own consumers
and economy, rather than those of other States or the entire Nation.
Gore's award must therefore be analyzed in the light of conduct that

517US2$52Z 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT
560 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Syllabus
occurred solely within Alabama, with consideration being given only to
the interests of Alabama consumers. Pp. 568-574.

(b) Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in this Court's constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of
the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity
of the penalty that a State may impose. Three guideposts, each of
which indicates that BMW did not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose, lead to the conclusion
that the $2 million award is grossly excessive. Pp. 574-575.

(c) None of the aggravating factors associated with the first (and perhaps most important) indicium of a punitive damages award's excessiveness--the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, see,
e. g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371--is present here. The harm
BMW inflicted on Gore was purely economic; the presale repainting had
no effect on the car's performance, safety features, or appearance; and
BMW's conduct evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for the
health and safety of others. Gore's contention that BMW's nondisclosure was particularly reprehensible because it formed part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct is rejected, because a corporate executive could reasonably have interpreted the relevant state statutes as
establishing safe harbors for nondisclosure of presumptively minor repairs, and because there is no evidence either that BMW acted in bad
faith when it sought to establish the appropriate line between minor
damage and damage requiring disclosure to purchasers, or that it persisted in its course of conduct after it had been adjudged unlawful. Finally, there is no evidence that BMW engaged in deliberate false statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of evidence of
improper motive. Pp. 575-580.

(d) The second (and perhaps most commonly cited) indicium of excessiveness--the ratio between the plaintiff's compensatory damages and
the amount of the punitive damages, see, e. g., TXO, 509 U. S., at 459--
also weighs against Gore, because his $2 million award is 500 times the
amount of his actual harm as determined by the jury, and there is no
suggestion that he or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with
any additional potential harm by BMW's nondisclosure policy. Although it is not possible to draw a mathematical bright line between the
constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that
would fit every case, see, e. g., id., at 458, the ratio here is clearly outside
the acceptable range. Pp. 580-583.

(e) Gore's punitive damages award is not saved by the third relevant
indicium of excessiveness--the difference between it and the civil or
criminal sanctions that could be imposed for comparable misconduct,
see, e. g., Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 23--because

$2 million is substantially greater than Alabama's applicable $2,000 fine
and the penalties imposed in other States for similar malfeasance, and
because none of the pertinent statutes or interpretive decisions would
have put an out-of-state distributor on notice that it might be subject to
a multimillion dollar sanction. Moreover, in the absence of a BMW history of noncompliance with known statutory requirements, there is no
basis for assuming that a more modest sanction would not have been
sufficient. Pp. 583-585.

(f) Thus, BMW's conduct was not sufficiently egregious to justify the
severe punitive sanction imposed against it. Whether the appropriate
remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent determination by
the Alabama Supreme Court of the award necessary to vindicate Alabama consumers' economic interests is a matter for that court to address
in the first instance. Pp. 585-586.

is whether a $2 million punitive damages award to the pur-chaser of one of these cars exceeds the constitutional limit.

I
In January 1990, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr. (respondent), purchaseda black BMW sports sedan for $40,750.88 from an authorized

BMW dealer in Birmingham, Alabama. After driving thecar for approximately nine months, and without noticing any
flaws in its appearance, Dr. Gore took the car to "Slick Fin-ish," an independent detailer, to make it look " `snazzier than
it normally would appear.' " 646 So. 2d 619, 621 (Ala. 1994).Mr. Slick, the proprietor, detected evidence that the car had
been repainted.1 Convinced that he had been cheated, Dr.Gore brought suit against petitioner BMW of North America
(BMW), the American distributor of BMW automobiles.2Dr. Gore alleged,

inter alia, that the failure to disclose thatthe car had been repainted constituted suppression of a material fact.3 The complaint prayed for $500,000 in compensa-tory and punitive damages, and costs.

At trial, BMW acknowledged that it had adopted a nation-wide policy in 1983 concerning cars that were damaged in
the course of manufacture or transportation. If the cost ofrepairing the damage exceeded 3 percent of the car's sug1 The top, hood, trunk, and quarter panels of Dr. Gore's car were repainted at BMW's vehicle preparation center in Brunswick, Georgia.
The parties presumed that the damage was caused by exposure to acid
rain during transit between the manufacturing plant in Germany and the
preparation center.

2 Dr. Gore also named the German manufacturer and the Birmingham

dealership as defendants.

3 Alabama codified its common-law cause of action for fraud in a 1907

statute that is still in effect. Hackmeyer v. Hackmeyer, 268 Ala. 329, 333,
106 So. 2d 245, 249 (1958). The statute provides: "Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an obligation to communicate constitutes
fraud. The obligation to communicate may arise from the confidential relations of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case."
Ala. Code $ 6-5-102 (1993); see Ala. Code $ 4299 (1907).

Opinion of the Court
gested retail price, the car was placed in company service
for a period of time and then sold as used. If the repair
cost did not exceed 3 percent of the suggested retail price,
however, the car was sold as new without advising the dealer
that any repairs had been made. Because the $601.37 cost
of repainting Dr. Gore's car was only about 1.5 percent of its
suggested retail price, BMW did not disclose the damage or
repair to the Birmingham dealer.

Dr. Gore asserted that his repainted car was worth less
than a car that had not been refinished. To prove his actual
damages of $4,000, he relied on the testimony of a former
BMW dealer, who estimated that the value of a repainted
BMW was approximately 10 percent less than the value of a
new car that had not been damaged and repaired.4 To support his claim for punitive damages, Dr. Gore introduced evidence that since 1983 BMW had sold 983 refinished cars as
new, including 14 in Alabama, without disclosing that the
cars had been repainted before sale at a cost of more than
$300 per vehicle.5 Using the actual damage estimate of
$4,000 per vehicle, Dr. Gore argued that a punitive award of
$4 million would provide an appropriate penalty for selling
approximately 1,000 cars for more than they were worth.

In defense of its disclosure policy, BMW argued that it was
under no obligation to disclose repairs of minor damage to
new cars and that Dr. Gore's car was as good as a car with
the original factory finish. It disputed Dr. Gore's assertion
that the value of the car was impaired by the repainting and
argued that this good-faith belief made a punitive award
inappropriate. BMW also maintained that transactions in
jurisdictions other than Alabama had no relevance to Dr.
Gore's claim.

4 The dealer who testified to the reduction in value is the former owner
of the Birmingham dealership sued in this action. He sold the dealership
approximately one year before the trial.

5 Dr. Gore did not explain the significance of the $300 cutoff.

Opinion of the Court
The jury returned a verdict finding BMW liable for com-pensatory damages of $4,000. In addition, the jury assessed

$4 million in punitive damages, based on a determinationthat the nondisclosure policy constituted "gross, oppressive
or malicious" fraud.6 See Ala. Code $$ 6-11-20, 6-11-21(1993).

BMW filed a post-trial motion to set aside the punitive
damages award. The company introduced evidence to es-tablish that its nondisclosure policy was consistent with the

laws of roughly 25 States defining the disclosure obligationsof automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. The
most stringent of these statutes required disclosure of re-pairs costing more than 3 percent of the suggested retail
price; none mandated disclosure of less costly repairs.7 Re-lying on these statutes, BMW contended that its conduct was
lawful in these States and therefore could not provide thebasis for an award of punitive damages.

BMW also drew the court's attention to the fact that its
nondisclosure policy had never been adjudged unlawful before this action was filed. Just months before Dr. Gore's
case went to trial, the jury in a similar lawsuit filed by another Alabama BMW purchaser found that BMW's failure
to disclose paint repair constituted fraud. Yates v. BMW of
North America, Inc., 642 So. 2d 937 (Ala. 1993).8 Before the

6 The jury also found the Birmingham dealership liable for Dr. Gore's
compensatory damages and the German manufacturer liable for both the
compensatory and punitive damages. The dealership did not appeal the
judgment against it. The Alabama Supreme Court held that the trial
court did not have jurisdiction over the German manufacturer and therefore reversed the judgment against that defendant.

7 BMW acknowledged that a Georgia statute enacted after Dr. Gore purchased his car would require disclosure of similar repairs to a car before
it was sold in Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. $$ 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994).

8 While awarding a comparable amount of compensatory damages, the

Yates jury awarded no punitive damages at all. In Yates, the plaintiff also
relied on the 1983 nondisclosure policy, but instead of offering evidence of
983 repairs costing more than $300 each, he introduced a bulk exhibit

566 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Opinion of the Court
judgment in this case, BMW changed its policy by takingsteps to avoid the sale of any refinished vehicles in Alabama

and two other States. When the $4 million verdict was re-turned in this case, BMW promptly instituted a nationwide
policy of full disclosure of all repairs, no matter how minor.

In response to BMW's arguments, Dr. Gore asserted thatthe policy change demonstrated the efficacy of the punitive

damages award. He noted that while no jury had held thepolicy unlawful, BMW had received a number of customer
complaints relating to undisclosed repairs and had settledsome lawsuits.

9 Finally, he maintained that the disclosure

statutes of other States were irrelevant because BMW hadfailed to offer any evidence that the disclosure statutes supplanted, rather than supplemented, existing causes of actionfor common-law fraud.

The trial judge denied BMW's post-trial motion, holding,
inter alia, that the award was not excessive. On appeal,
the Alabama Supreme Court also rejected BMW's claim that
the award exceeded the constitutionally permissible amount.
646 So. 2d 619 (1994). The court's excessiveness inquiry applied the factors articulated in Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539
So. 2d 218, 223-224 (Ala. 1989), and approved in Pacific Mut.
Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 21-22 (1991). 646 So. 2d,
at 624-625. Based on its analysis, the court concluded that
BMW's conduct was "reprehensible"; the nondisclosure was
profitable for the company; the judgment "would not have
a substantial impact upon [BMW's] financial position"; the
litigation had been expensive; no criminal sanctions had been
imposed on BMW for the same conduct; the award of no pucontaining 5,856 repair bills to show that petitioner had sold over 5,800
new BMW vehicles without disclosing that they had been repaired.

9 Prior to the lawsuits filed by Dr. Yates and Dr. Gore, BMW and various

BMW dealers had been sued 14 times concerning presale paint or damage
repair. According to the testimony of BMW's in-house counsel at the
postjudgment hearing on damages, only one of the suits concerned a car
repainted by BMW.

Opinion of the Court
nitive damages in Yates reflected "the inherent uncertaintyof the trial process"; and the punitive award bore a "reasonable relationship" to "the harm that was likely to occur from[BMW's] conduct as well as . . . the harm that actually occurred." 646 So. 2d, at 625-627.The Alabama Supreme Court did, however, rule in BMW's
favor on one critical point: The court found that the juryimproperly computed the amount of punitive damages by
multiplying Dr. Gore's compensatory damages by the num-ber of similar sales in other jurisdictions.

Id., at 627. Hav-ing found the verdict tainted, the court held that "a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in this case is$2,000,000,"

id., at 629, and therefore ordered a remittitur inthat amount.

10 The court's discussion of the amount of its

remitted award expressly disclaimed any reliance on "actsthat occurred in other jurisdictions"; instead, the court explained that it had used a "comparative analysis" that consid-ered Alabama cases, "along with cases from other jurisdictions, involving the sale of an automobile where the sellermisrepresented the condition of the vehicle and the jury
awarded punitive damages to the purchaser." 11 Id., at 628.

10 The Alabama Supreme Court did not indicate whether the $2 million
figure represented the court's independent assessment of the appropriate
level of punitive damages, or its determination of the maximum amount
that the jury could have awarded consistent with the Due Process Clause.

11 Other than Yates v. BMW of North America, Inc., 642 So. 2d 937

(1993), in which no punitive damages were awarded, the Alabama Supreme
Court cited no such cases. In another portion of its opinion, 646 So. 2d,
at 629, the court did cite five Alabama cases, none of which involved either
a dispute arising out of the purchase of an automobile or an award
of punitive damages. G. M. Mosley Contractors, Inc. v. Phillips, 487 So.
2d 876, 879 (1986); Hollis v. Wyrosdick, 508 So. 2d 704 (1987); Campbell
v. Burns, 512 So. 2d 1341, 1343 (1987); Ashbee v. Brock, 510 So. 2d 214
(1987); and Jawad v. Granade, 497 So. 2d 471 (1986). All of these cases
support the proposition that appellate courts in Alabama presume that
jury verdicts are correct. In light of the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (1) the jury had computed its award by multiplying $4,000
by the number of refinished vehicles sold in the United States and

Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further aState's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct

U. S. 247, 266-267 (1981); Haslip, 499 U. S., at 22. In ourfederal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that theywill allow in different classes of cases and in any particular
case. Most States that authorize exemplary damages affordthe jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damages
awarded be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's le-gitimate interests in punishment and deterrence. See

TXO,509 U. S., at 456; Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21, 22. Only when

an award can fairly be categorized as "grossly excessive" inrelation to these interests does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. Cf.

TXO, 509 U. S., at 456. For that reason,the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins with

an identification of the state interests that a punitive awardis designed to serve. We therefore focus our attention first
on the scope of Alabama's legitimate interests in punishingBMW and deterring it from future misconduct.

No one doubts that a State may protect its citizens byprohibiting deceptive trade practices and by requiring auto(2) that the award should have been based on Alabama conduct, respect
for the error-free portion of the jury verdict would seem to produce an
award of $56,000 ($4,000 multiplied by 14, the number of repainted vehicles
sold in Alabama).

mobile distributors to disclose presale repairs that affect thevalue of a new car. But the States need not, and in fact

do not, provide such protection in a uniform manner. SomeStates rely on the judicial process to formulate and enforce
an appropriate disclosure requirement by applying principles
of contract and tort law.12 Other States have enacted various forms of legislation that define the disclosure obligations
of automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.13

Opinion of the Court
The result is a patchwork of rules representing the diversepolicy judgments of lawmakers in 50 States.

That diversity demonstrates that reasonable people maydisagree about the value of a full disclosure requirement.
Some legislatures may conclude that affirmative disclosurerequirements are unnecessary because the self-interest of
those involved in the automobile trade in developing andmaintaining the goodwill of their customers will motivate
them to make voluntary disclosures or to refrain from sellingcars that do not comply with self-imposed standards. Those
legislatures that do adopt affirmative disclosure obligationsmay take into account the cost of government regulation,
choosing to draw a line exempting minor repairs from sucha requirement. In formulating a disclosure standard, States
may also consider other goals, such as providing a "safe har-bor" for automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers
against lawsuits over minor repairs.14We may assume, arguendo, that it would be wise for every
State to adopt Dr. Gore's preferred rule, requiring full disclo-sure of every presale repair to a car, no matter how trivial
and regardless of its actual impact on the value of the car.
quires dealers to disclose paint repair costing more than $100 of which
they have actual knowledge. Fla. Stat. $ 320.27(9)(n) (1992). Oregon requires manufacturers to disclose all "postmanufacturing" damage and repairs. It is unclear whether this mandate would apply to repairs such as
those at issue here. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 650.155 (1991).

Many, but not all, of the statutes exclude from the computation of repair
cost the value of certain components--typically items such as glass, tires,
wheels and bumpers--when they are replaced with identical manufacturer's original equipment. E. g., Cal. Veh. Code Ann. $$ 9990-9991 (West
Supp. 1996); Ga. Code Ann. $$ 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815,

$ 710/5 (1994); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 190.0491(5) (Baldwin 1988); Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 47, $ 1112.1 (1991); Va. Code Ann. $ 46.2-1571(D) (Supp. 1995); Vt. Stat.
Ann., Tit. 9, $ 4087(d) (1993).

14 Also, a state legislature might plausibly conclude that the administrative costs associated with full disclosure would have the effect of raising
car prices to the State's residents.

But while we do not doubt that Congress has ample authority to enact such a policy for the entire Nation,15 it is clear
that no single State could do so, or even impose its own policy choice on neighboring States. See Bonaparte v. Tax

except with reference to its own jurisdiction. . . . Each State

market for automobiles is not only subordinate to the federal
power over interstate commerce, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat.

Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 643 (1982).We think it follows from these principles of state sovereignty and comity that a State may not impose economic
sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changingthe tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States.

17 Before this

Court Dr. Gore argued that the large punitive damagesaward was necessary to induce BMW to change the nationwide policy that it adopted in 1983.18 But by attempting toalter BMW's nationwide policy, Alabama would be infringing
on the policy choices of other States. To avoid such en-croachment, the economic penalties that a State such as Alabama inflicts on those who transgress its laws, whether thepenalties take the form of legislatively authorized fines or
judicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported by
the State's interest in protecting its own consumers and its
own economy. Alabama may insist that BMW adhere to a
particular disclosure policy in that State. Alabama does not

17 State power may be exercised as much by a jury's application of a
state rule of law in a civil lawsuit as by a statute. See New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 265 (1964) ("The test is not the form in
which state power has been applied but, whatever the form, whether such
power has in fact been exercised"); San Diego Building Trades Council
v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959) ("[R]egulation can be as effectively
exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief ").

18 Brief for Respondent 11-12, 23, 27-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-54. Dr.

Gore's interest in altering the nationwide policy stems from his concern
that BMW would not (or could not) discontinue the policy in Alabama
alone. Brief for Respondent 11. "If Alabama were limited to imposing
punitive damages based only on BMW's gain from fraudulent sales in Alabama, the resulting award would have no prospect of protecting Alabama
consumers from fraud, as it would provide no incentive for BMW to alter
the unitary, national policy of nondisclosure which yielded BMW millions
of dollars in profits." Id., at 23. The record discloses no basis for Dr.
Gore's contention that BMW could not comply with Alabama's law without
changing its nationwide policy.

Opinion of the Court
have the power, however, to punish BMW for conduct that
was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its residents.19 Nor may Alabama impose sanctions
on BMW in order to deter conduct that is lawful in other
jurisdictions.

In this case, we accept the Alabama Supreme Court's interpretation of the jury verdict as reflecting a computation
of the amount of punitive damages "based in large part on
conduct that happened in other jurisdictions." 646 So. 2d,
at 627. As the Alabama Supreme Court noted, neither the
jury nor the trial court was presented with evidence that
any of BMW's out-of-state conduct was unlawful. "The only
testimony touching the issue showed that approximately 60%
of the vehicles that were refinished were sold in states where
failure to disclose the repair was not an unfair trade practice." Id., at 627, n. 6.20 The Alabama Supreme Court
therefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW's out-of-state
conduct, id., at 628, and based its remitted award solely on

19 See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 363 (1978) ("To punish a
person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due
process violation of the most basic sort"). Our cases concerning recidivist
statutes are not to the contrary. Habitual offender statutes permit the
sentencing court to enhance a defendant's punishment for a crime in light
of prior convictions, including convictions in foreign jurisdictions. See
e. g., Ala. Code $ 13A-5-9 (1994); Cal. Penal Code Ann. $$ 667.5(f), 668
(West Supp. 1996); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 5/33B-1 (1994); N. Y. Penal
Law $$ 70.04, 70.06, 70.08, 70.10 (McKinney 1987 and Supp. 1996); Tex.
Penal Code Ann. $ 12.42 (1994 and Supp. 1995-1996). A sentencing judge
may even consider past criminal behavior which did not result in a conviction and lawful conduct that bears on the defendant's character and prospects for rehabilitation. Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949). But
we have never held that a sentencing court could properly punish lawful
conduct. This distinction is precisely the one we draw here. See n. 21,
infra.

20 Given that the verdict was based in part on out-of-state conduct that

was lawful where it occurred, we need not consider whether one State
may properly attempt to change a tortfeasor's unlawful conduct in another State.

Opinion of the Court
conduct that occurred within Alabama.21 The award mustbe analyzed in the light of the same conduct, with consideration given only to the interests of Alabama consumers,rather than those of the entire Nation. When the scope of
the interest in punishment and deterrence that an Alabamacourt may appropriately consider is properly limited, it is
apparent--for reasons that we shall now address--that thisaward is grossly excessive.

III
Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitu-tional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice

not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose.22 Three guideposts, each of which indicates that BMWdid not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose for adhering to the nondis-closure policy adopted in 1983, lead us to the conclusion that

21 Of course, the fact that the Alabama Supreme Court correctly concluded that it was error for the jury to use the number of sales in other
States as a multiplier in computing the amount of its punitive sanction
does not mean that evidence describing out-of-state transactions is irrelevant in a case of this kind. To the contrary, as we stated in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 462, n. 28 (1993),
such evidence may be relevant to the determination of the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.

22 See Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987) (Ex Post Facto Clause

violated by retroactive imposition of revised sentencing guidelines that
provided longer sentence for defendant's crime); Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964) (retroactive application of new construction of
statute violated due process); id., at 350-355 (citing cases); Lankford
v. Idaho, 500 U. S. 110 (1991) (due process violated because defendant and
his counsel did not have adequate notice that judge might impose death
sentence). The strict constitutional safeguards afforded to criminal defendants are not applicable to civil cases, but the basic protection against
"judgments without notice" afforded by the Due Process Clause, Shaffer
v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 217 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment),
is implicated by civil penalties.

Opinion of the Court
the $2 million award against BMW is grossly excessive: thedegree of reprehensibility of the nondisclosure; the disparity

between the harm or potential harm suffered by Dr. Goreand his punitive damages award; and the difference between
this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed incomparable cases. We discuss these considerations in turn.

Degree of Reprehensibility

Perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonable-ness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.23 As the Court statednearly 150 years ago, exemplary damages imposed on a
defendant should reflect "the enormity of his offense." Dayv.

Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852). See also St. Louis,I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Williams, 251 U. S. 63, 66-67 (1919)

(punitive award may not be "wholly disproportioned to theoffense");

Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. KelcoDisposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 301 (1989) (

O'Connor, J., con-curring in part and dissenting in part) (reviewing court

"should examine the gravity of the defendant's conduct andthe harshness of the award of punitive damages").

24 This

principle reflects the accepted view that some wrongs aremore blameworthy than others. Thus, we have said that

23 "The flagrancy of the misconduct is thought to be the primary consideration in determining the amount of punitive damages." Owen, A Punitive Damages Overview: Functions, Problems and Reform, 39 Vill. L. Rev.
363, 387 (1994).

24 The principle that punishment should fit the crime "is deeply rooted

and frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence." Solem v. Helm,
463 U. S. 277, 284 (1983). See Burkett v. Lanata, 15 La. Ann. 337, 339
(1860) (punitive damages should be "commensurate to the nature of the
offence"); Blanchard v. Morris, 15 Ill. 35, 36 (1853) ("[W]e cannot say [the
exemplary damages] are excessive under the circumstances; for the proofs
show that threats, violence, and imprisonment, were accompanied by mental fear, torture, and agony of mind"); Louisville & Northern R. Co. v.
Brown, 127 Ky. 732, 749, 106 S. W. 795, 799 (1908) ("We are not aware of
any case in which the court has sustained a verdict as large as this one
unless the injuries were permanent").

Opinion of the Court
"nonviolent crimes are less serious than crimes marked byviolence or the threat of violence." Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S.

277, 292-293 (1983). Similarly, "trickery and deceit," TXO,509 U. S., at 462, are more reprehensible than negligence.
In TXO, both the West Virginia Supreme Court and the Jus-tices of this Court placed special emphasis on the principle
that punitive damages may not be "grossly out of proportionto the severity of the offense."

25 Id., at 453, 462. Indeed,

for Justice Kennedy, the defendant's intentional malicewas the decisive element in a "close and difficult" case.

Id.,at 468.
26

In this case, none of the aggravating factors associatedwith particularly reprehensible conduct is present. The

harm BMW inflicted on Dr. Gore was purely economic innature. The presale refinishing of the car had no effect on
its performance or safety features, or even its appearancefor at least nine months after his purchase. BMW's conduct
evinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for thehealth and safety of others. To be sure, infliction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through af-firmative acts of misconduct,

id., at 453, or when the targetis financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty.

But this observation does not convert all acts that causeeconomic harm into torts that are sufficiently reprehensible
to justify a significant sanction in addition to compensatorydamages.

Dr. Gore contends that BMW's conduct was particularlyreprehensible because nondisclosure of the repairs to his car
formed part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct.Certainly, evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged
in prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that itwas unlawful would provide relevant support for an argu25 Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 22 (1991).

ment that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant'sdisrespect for the law. See id., at 462, n. 28. Our holdings

that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a firstoffender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance. See
Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948).In support of his thesis, Dr. Gore advances two arguments.

First, he asserts that the state disclosure statutes supple-ment, rather than supplant, existing remedies for breach of
contract and common-law fraud. Thus, according to Dr.Gore, the statutes may not properly be viewed as immunizing from liability the nondisclosure of repairs costing lessthan the applicable statutory threshold. Brief for Respondent 18-19. Second, Dr. Gore maintains that BMW shouldhave anticipated that its failure to disclose similar repair
work could expose it to liability for fraud. Id., at 4-5.We recognize, of course, that only state courts may authoritatively construe state statutes. As far as we are aware,at the time this action was commenced no state court had
explicitly addressed whether its State's disclosure statuteprovides a safe harbor for nondisclosure of presumptively
minor repairs or should be construed instead as supplement-ing common-law duties.

27 A review of the text of the stat27 In Jeter v. M & M Dodge, Inc., 634 So. 2d 1383 (La. App. 1994), a
Louisiana Court of Appeals suggested that the Louisiana disclosure statute functions as a safe harbor. Finding that the cost of repairing presale
damage to the plaintiff's car exceeded the statutory disclosure threshold,
the court held that the disclosure statute did not provide a defense to the
action. Id., at 1384.

During the pendency of this litigation, Alabama enacted a disclosure
statute which defines "material" damage to a new car as damage requiring
repairs costing in excess of 3 percent of suggested retail price or $500,
whichever is greater. Ala. Code $ 8-19-5(22) (1993). After its decision
in this case, the Alabama Supreme Court stated in dicta that the remedies
available under this section of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not
displace or alter pre-existing remedies available under either the common
law or other statutes. Hines v. Riverside Chevrolet-Olds, Inc., 655 So.
2d 909, 917, n. 2 (1994). It refused, however, to "recognize, or impose on

Opinion of the Court
utes, however, persuades us that in the absence of a state-court determination to the contrary, a corporate executive

could reasonably interpret the disclosure requirements as es-tablishing safe harbors. In California, for example, the disclosure statute defines "material" damage to a motor vehicleas damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percent
of the suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater.Cal. Veh. Code Ann. $ 9990 (West Supp. 1996). The Illinois
statute states that in cases in which disclosure is not re-quired, "nondisclosure does not constitute a misrepresentation or omission of fact." Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, $ 710/5(1994).

28 Perhaps the statutes may also be interpreted in

another way. We simply emphasize that the record containsno evidence that BMW's decision to follow a disclosure policy

that coincided with the strictest extant state statute wassufficiently reprehensible to justify a $2 million award of
punitive damages.

921. Instead, it held that whether a defendant has a duty to disclose is a
question of fact "for the jury to determine." Id., at 918. In reaching
that conclusion it overruled two earlier decisions that seemed to indicate
that as a matter of law there was no disclosure obligation in cases comparable to this one. Id., at 920 (overruling Century 21-Reeves Realty, Inc.

Opinion of the Court
Dr. Gore's second argument for treating BMW as a recidi-vist is that the company should have anticipated that its actions would be considered fraudulent in some, if not all, juris-dictions. This contention overlooks the fact that actionable
fraud requires a material misrepresentation or omission.29This qualifier invites line-drawing of just the sort engaged
in by States with disclosure statutes and by BMW. We do
not think it can be disputed that there may exist minor im-perfections in the finish of a new car that can be repaired (or

indeed, left unrepaired) without materially affecting thecar's value.

30 There is no evidence that BMW acted in bad

faith when it sought to establish the appropriate line be-tween presumptively minor damage and damage requiring

disclosure to purchasers. For this purpose, BMW could rea-sonably rely on state disclosure statutes for guidance. In
this regard, it is also significant that there is no evidencethat BMW persisted in a course of conduct after it had been
adjudged unlawful on even one occasion, let alone repeated
occasions.31

Finally, the record in this case discloses no deliberate false
statements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment of
evidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslip
and TXO. Haslip, 499 U. S., at 5; TXO, 509 U. S., at 453.
We accept, of course, the jury's finding that BMW suppressed

29 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 538 (1977); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 108 (5th
ed. 1984).

30 The Alabama Supreme Court has held that a car may be considered

"new" as a matter of law even if its finish contains minor cosmetic flaws.
Wilburn v. Larry Savage Chevrolet, Inc., 477 So. 2d 384 (1985). We note
also that at trial respondent only introduced evidence of undisclosed paint
damage to new cars repaired at a cost of $300 or more. This decision
suggests that respondent believed that the jury might consider some
repairs too de minimis to warrant disclosure.

31 Before the verdict in this case, BMW had changed its policy with respect to Alabama and two other States. Five days after the jury award,
BMW altered its nationwide policy to one of full disclosure.

a material fact which Alabama law obligated it to communi-cate to prospective purchasers of repainted cars in that

State. But the omission of a material fact may be less rep-rehensible than a deliberate false statement, particularly
when there is a good-faith basis for believing that no duty todisclose exists.

That conduct is sufficiently reprehensible to give rise totort liability, and even a modest award of exemplary damages does not establish the high degree of culpability thatwarrants a substantial punitive damages award. Because
this case exhibits none of the circumstances ordinarily asso-ciated with egregiously improper conduct, we are persuaded
that BMW's conduct was not sufficiently reprehensible towarrant imposition of a $2 million exemplary damages

Ratio

The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium ofan unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its

ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff. See TXO,509 U. S., at 459;

Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23. The principle thatexemplary damages must bear a "reasonable relationship" to

compensatory damages has a long pedigree.32 Scholars haveidentified a number of early English statutes authorizing the

32 See, e. g., Grant v. McDonogh, 7 La. Ann. 447, 448 (1852) ("[E]xemplary damages allowed should bear some proportion to the real damage
sustained"); Saunders v. Mullen, 66 Iowa 728, 729, 24 N. W. 529 (1885)
("When the actual damages are so small, the amount allowed as exemplary
damages should not be so large"); Flannery v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,
15 D. C. 111, 125 (1885) (when punitive damages award "is out of all proportion to the injuries received, we feel it our duty to interfere"); Houston &
Texas Central R. Co. v. Nichols, 9 Am. & Eng. R. R. Cas. 361, 365 (Tex.
1882) ("Exemplary damages, when allowed, should bear proportion to the
actual damages sustained"); McCarthy v. Niskern, 22 Minn. 90, 91-92
(1875) (punitive damages "enormously in excess of what may justly be
regarded as compensation" for the injury must be set aside "to prevent
injustice").

Opinion of the Court
award of multiple damages for particular wrongs. Some 65different enactments during the period between 1275 and

1753 provided for double, treble, or quadruple damages.33Our decisions in both Haslip and TXO endorsed the proposition that a comparison between the compensatory award andthe punitive award is significant.

In Haslip we concluded that even though a punitive dam-ages award of "more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages" might be "close to the line," it did not "crossthe line into the area of constitutional impropriety." 499
U. S., at 23-24. TXO, following dicta in Haslip, refined thisanalysis by confirming that the proper inquiry is " `whether
there is a reasonable relationship between the punitivedamages award and the harm likely to result from the
defendant's conduct as well as the harm that actually hasoccurred.' " TXO, 509 U. S., at 460 (emphasis in original),
quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21. Thus, in upholding the $10million award in TXO, we relied on the difference between
that figure and the harm to the victim that would have en-sued if the tortious plan had succeeded. That difference
suggested that the relevant ratio was not more than 10 to 1.34

33 Owen, supra n. 23, at 368, and n. 23. One English statute, for example, provides that officers arresting persons out of their jurisdiction shall
pay double damages. 3 Edw., I., ch. 35. Another directs that in an action
for forcible entry or detainer, the plaintiff shall recover treble damages.
8 Hen. VI, ch. 9, $ 6.

Present-day federal law allows or mandates imposition of multiple damages for a wide assortment of offenses, including violations of the antitrust
laws, see $ 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 15,
and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, see 18

582 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Opinion of the Court
The $2 million in punitive damages awarded to Dr. Goreby the Alabama Supreme Court is 500 times the amount of

his actual harm as determined by the jury.35 Moreover,there is no suggestion that Dr. Gore or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm byBMW's nondisclosure policy. The disparity in this case is
thus dramatically greater than those considered in Haslipand

TXO.36Of course, we have consistently rejected the notion that

the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematicalformula, even one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award. TXO, 509 U. S., at 458.37 In-deed, low awards of compensatory damages may properly
support a higher ratio than high compensatory awards, if,for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in only
a small amount of economic damages. A higher ratio mayalso be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect
or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have beendifficult to determine. It is appropriate, therefore, to reiterate our rejection of a categorical approach. Once again, "wereturn to what we said . . . in

Haslip: `We need not, and

tween $5 million and $8.3 million, but is closer to $4 million, or $2 million,
or even $1 million, the disparity between the punitive award and the potential harm does not, in our view, `jar one's constitutional sensibilities.' "
TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18.

35 Even assuming each repainted BMW suffers a diminution in value of

approximately $4,000, the award is 35 times greater than the total damages of all 14 Alabama consumers who purchased repainted BMW's.

36 The ratio here is also dramatically greater than any award that would

be permissible under the statutes and proposed statutes summarized in the
appendix to Justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion. Post, at 615-616.

37 Conceivably the Alabama Supreme Court's selection of a 500-to-1 ratio

was an application of Justice Scalia's identification of one possible reading of the plurality opinion in TXO: Any future due process challenge to
a punitive damages award could be disposed of with the simple observation that "this is no worse than TXO." 509 U. S., at 472 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment). As we explain in the text, this award is
significantly worse than the award in TXO.

will not be justified on this basis. When the ratio is abreathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely "raise

Sanctions for Comparable Misconduct

Comparing the punitive damages award and the civil orcriminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct provides a third indicium of excessiveness. As Justice O'Connor has correctly observed, a reviewing courtengaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should "accord `substantial deference' tolegislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for
the conduct at issue." Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,
Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S., at 301 (opinion concur-ring in part and dissenting in part). In Haslip, 499 U. S., at

23, the Court noted that although the exemplary award was"much in excess of the fine that could be imposed," imprisonment was also authorized in the criminal context.38 In this

38 Although the Court did not address the size of the punitive damages
award in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984), the dissenters commented on its excessive character, noting that the "$10 million
[punitive damages award] that the jury imposed is 100 times greater than
the maximum fine that may be imposed . . . for a single violation of federal
standards" and "more than 10 times greater than the largest single fine
that the Commission has ever imposed." Id., at 263 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), the
Court observed that the punitive award for libel was "one thousand times
greater than the maximum fine provided by the Alabama criminal statute," and concluded that the "fear of damage awards under a rule such as

Opinion of the Court
case the $2 million economic sanction imposed on BMW issubstantially greater than the statutory fines available in

Alabama and elsewhere for similar malfeasance.The maximum civil penalty authorized by the Alabama
Legislature for a violation of its Deceptive Trade PracticesAct is $2,000;

39 other States authorize more severe sanctions,

with the maxima ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.40 Signifi-cantly, some statutes draw a distinction between first offenders and recidivists; thus, in New York the penalty is $50 fora first offense and $250 for subsequent offenses. None of
these statutes would provide an out-of-state distributor withfair notice that the first violation--or, indeed the first 14 violations--of its provisions might subject an offender to amultimillion dollar penalty. Moreover, at the time BMW's
policy was first challenged, there does not appear to havebeen any judicial decision in Alabama or elsewhere indicating that application of that policy might give rise to suchsevere punishment.

The sanction imposed in this case cannot be justified onthe ground that it was necessary to deter future misconduct
without considering whether less drastic remedies could beexpected to achieve that goal. The fact that a multimillion
dollar penalty prompted a change in policy sheds no light on
the question whether a lesser deterrent would have ade-quately protected the interests of Alabama consumers. In

Opinion of the Court
the absence of a history of noncompliance with known statu-tory requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a more

modest sanction would not have been sufficient to motivatefull compliance with the disclosure requirement imposed by
the Alabama Supreme Court in this case.

IV
We assume, as the juries in this case and in the Yates casefound, that the undisclosed damage to the new BMW's affected their actual value. Notwithstanding the evidence ad-duced by BMW in an effort to prove that the repainted cars
conformed to the same quality standards as its other cars,we also assume that it knew, or should have known, that as
time passed the repainted cars would lose their attractiveappearance more rapidly than other BMW's. Moreover, we
of course accept the Alabama courts' view that the stateinterest in protecting its citizens from deceptive trade
practices justifies a sanction in addition to the recovery ofcompensatory damages. We cannot, however, accept the
conclusion of the Alabama Supreme Court that BMW's con-duct was sufficiently egregious to justify a punitive sanction
that is tantamount to a severe criminal penalty.The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an
impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement tofair notice of the demands that the several States impose on
the conduct of its business. Indeed, its status as an activeparticipant in the national economy implicates the federal
interest in preventing individual States from imposing undueburdens on interstate commerce. While each State has
ample power to protect its own consumers, none may usethe punitive damages deterrent as a means of imposing its
regulatory policies on the entire Nation.As in

Haslip, we are not prepared to draw a bright linemarking the limits of a constitutionally acceptable punitive

damages award. Unlike that case, however, we are fullyconvinced that the grossly excessive award imposed in this

case transcends the constitutional limit.41 Whether the ap-propriate remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent determination by the Alabama Supreme Court ofthe award necessary to vindicate the economic interests of
Alabama consumers is a matter that should be addressed bythe state court in the first instance.

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Souter join, concurring.

The Alabama state courts have assessed the defendant $2million in "punitive damages" for having knowingly failed to

tell a BMW automobile buyer that, at a cost of $600, it hadrepainted portions of his new $40,000 car, thereby lowering
its potential resale value by about 10%. The Court's opin-ion, which I join, explains why we have concluded that this
award, in this case, was "grossly excessive" in relation tolegitimate punitive damages objectives, and hence an arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property in violation ofthe Due Process Clause. See TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 453, 454 (1993) (A"grossly excessive" punitive award amounts to an "arbitrary
deprivation of property without due process of law") (plural-ity opinion). Members of this Court have generally thought,
however, that if "fair procedures were followed, a judgmentthat is a product of that process is entitled to a strong pre41 Justice Ginsburg expresses concern that we are "the only federal
court policing" this limit. Post, at 613. The small number of punitive
damages questions that we have reviewed in recent years, together with
the fact that this is the first case in decades in which we have found that
a punitive damages award exceeds the constitutional limit, indicates that
this concern is at best premature. In any event, this consideration surely
does not justify an abdication of our responsibility to enforce constitutional
protections in an extraordinary case such as this one.

sumption of validity." Id., at 457. See also Pacific Mut.
Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 40-42 (1991) (Kennedy,
J., concurring in judgment). And the Court also has foundthat punitive damages procedures very similar to those followed here were not, by themselves, fundamentally unfair.
Id., at 15-24. Thus, I believe it important to explain whythis presumption of validity is overcome in this instance.

The reason flows from the Court's emphasis in Haslip uponthe constitutional importance of legal standards that provide
"reasonable constraints" within which "discretion is exer-cised," that assure "meaningful and adequate review by the
trial court whenever a jury has fixed the punitive damages,"
and permit "appellate review [that] makes certain that the
punitive damages are reasonable in their amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred
and to deter its repetition." Id., at 20-21. See also id., at
18 ("[U]nlimited jury discretion--or unlimited judicial discretion for that matter--in the fixing of punitive damages
may invite extreme results that jar one's constitutional
sensibilities").

This constitutional concern, itself harkening back to the
Magna Carta, arises out of the basic unfairness of depriving
citizens of life, liberty, or property, through the application,
not of law and legal processes, but of arbitrary coercion.
Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986); Dent v. West
Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 123 (1889). Requiring the application of law, rather than a decisionmaker's caprice, does more
than simply provide citizens notice of what actions may subject them to punishment; it also helps to assure the uniform
general treatment of similarly situated persons that is the
essence of law itself. See Railway Express Agency, Inc. v.
New York, 336 U. S. 106, 112 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring)
("[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against
arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require
that the principles of law which officials would impose upon
a minority must be imposed generally").

588 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Breyer, J., concurring
Legal standards need not be precise in order to satisfy thisconstitutional concern. See

Haslip, supra, at 20 (comparing
punitive damages standards to such legal standards as "rea-sonable care," "due diligence," and "best interests of the

child") (internal quotation marks omitted). But they must
offer some kind of constraint upon a jury or court's discre-tion, and thus protection against purely arbitrary behavior.

The standards the Alabama courts applied here are vagueand open ended to the point where they risk arbitrary results. In my view, although the vagueness of those stand-ards does not, by itself, violate due process, see

Haslip,
supra, it does invite the kind of scrutiny the Court has given
the particular verdict before us. See id., at 18 ("[C]oncerns
of . . . adequate guidance from the court when the case is
tried to a jury properly enter into the constitutional calculus"); TXO, supra, at 475 ("[I]t cannot be denied that the
lack of clear guidance heightens the risk that arbitrariness,
passion, or bias will replace dispassionate deliberation as
the basis for the jury's verdict") (O'Connor, J., dissenting). This is because the standards, as the Alabama
Supreme Court authoritatively interpreted them here, provided no significant constraints or protection against arbitrary results.

First, the Alabama statute that permits punitive damages
does not itself contain a standard that readily distinguishes
between conduct warranting very small, and conduct warranting very large, punitive damages awards. That statute
permits punitive damages in cases of "oppression, fraud,
wantonness, or malice." Ala. Code $ 6-11-20(a) (1993). But
the statute goes on to define those terms broadly, to encompass far more than the egregious conduct that those terms,
at first reading, might seem to imply. An intentional misrepresentation, made through a statement or silence, can
easily amount to "fraud" sufficient to warrant punitive damages. See $ 6-11-20(b)(1) ("Fraud" includes "intentional . . .
concealment of a material fact the concealing party had a

duty to disclose, which was gross, oppressive, or maliciousand committed with the intention . . . of thereby depriving a

person or entity of property") (emphasis added); $ 6-11-20(b)(2) ("Malice" includes

any "wrongful act without just
cause or excuse . . . [w]ith an intent to injure the . . . property of another") (emphasis added); $ 6-11-20(b)(5) ("Oppres-sion" includes "[s]ubjecting a person to . . . unjust hardship

in conscious disregard of that person's rights"). The statutethereby authorizes punitive damages for the most serious
kinds of misrepresentations, say, tricking the elderly out oftheir life savings, for much less serious conduct, such as the
failure to disclose repainting a car, at issue here, and for a
vast range of conduct in between.

Second, the Alabama courts, in this case, have applied the
"factors" intended to constrain punitive damages awards in
a way that belies that purpose. Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby,
539 So. 2d 218 (Ala. 1989), sets forth seven factors that appellate courts use to determine whether or not a jury award
was "grossly excessive" and which, in principle, might make
up for the lack of significant constraint in the statute. But,
as the Alabama courts have authoritatively interpreted
them, and as their application in this case illustrates, they
impose little actual constraint.

(a) Green Oil requires that a punitive damages award
"bear a reasonable relationship to the harm that is likely to
occur from the defendant's conduct as well as to the harm
that actually has occurred." Id., at 223. But this standard
does little to guide a determination of what counts as a "reasonable" relationship, as this case illustrates. The record
evidence of past, present, or likely future harm consists of
(a) $4,000 of harm to Dr. Gore's BMW; (b) 13 other similar
Alabama instances; and (c) references to about 1,000 similar
instances in other States. The Alabama Supreme Court,
disregarding BMW's failure to make relevant objection to
the out-of-state instances at trial (as was the court's right),
held that the last mentioned, out-of-state instances did not

590 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Breyer, J., concurring
count as relevant harm. It went on to find "a reasonable
relationship" between the harm and the $2 million punitive
damages award without "consider[ing] those acts that occurred in other jurisdictions." 646 So. 2d 619, 628 (1994)
(emphasis added). For reasons explored by the majority in
greater depth, see ante, at 574-586, the relationship between
this award and the underlying conduct seems well beyond
the bounds of the "reasonable." To find a "reasonable relationship" between purely economic harm totaling $56,000,
without significant evidence of future repetition, and a punitive award of $2 million is to empty the "reasonable relationship" test of meaningful content. As thus construed, it does
not set forth a legal standard that could have significantly
constrained the discretion of Alabama factfinders.

(b) Green Oil's second factor is the "degree of reprehensibility" of the defendant's conduct. Green Oil, supra, at 223.
Like the "reasonable relationship" test, this factor provides
little guidance on how to relate culpability to the size of an
award. The Alabama court, in considering this factor, found
"reprehensible" that BMW followed a conscious policy of not
disclosing repairs to new cars when the cost of repairs
amounted to less than 3% of the car's value. Of course, any
conscious policy of not disclosing a repair--where one knows
the nondisclosure might cost the customer resale value--is
"reprehensible" to some degree. But, for the reasons discussed by the majority, ante, at 575-580, I do not see how
the Alabama courts could find conduct that (they assumed)
caused $56,000 of relevant economic harm especially or unusually reprehensible enough to warrant $2 million in punitive damages, or a significant portion of that award. To find
to the contrary, as the Alabama courts did, is not simply unreasonable; it is to make "reprehensibility" a concept without
constraining force, i. e., to deprive the concept of its constraining power to protect against serious and capricious
deprivations.

591Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)
Breyer, J., concurring
(c) Green Oil's third factor requires "punitive damages" to"remove the profit" of the illegal activity and "be in excess

of the profit, so that the defendant recognizes a loss." Green
Oil, 539 So. 2d, at 223. This factor has the ability to limit
awards to a fixed, rational amount. But as applied, that concept's potential was not realized, for the court did not limitthe award to anywhere near the $56,000 in profits evidenced

in the record. Given the record's description of the conductand its prevalence, this factor could not justify much of the
$2 million award.(d)

Green Oil's fourth factor is the "financial position" of
the defendant. Ibid. Since a fixed dollar award will punish
a poor person more than a wealthy one, one can understand
the relevance of this factor to the State's interest in retribution (though not necessarily to its interest in deterrence,
given the more distant relation between a defendant's wealth
and its responses to economic incentives). See TXO, 509
U. S., at 462, and n. 28 (plurality opinion); id., at 469 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21-22; Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 300 (1989)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
This factor, however, is not necessarily intended to act as a
significant constraint on punitive awards. Rather, it provides an open-ended basis for inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy, as this case may illustrate. That does
not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means
that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as "reprehensibility," to constrain significantly an
award that purports to punish a defendant's conduct.

(e) Green Oil's fifth factor is the "costs of litigation" and
the State's desire "to encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial." 539 So. 2d, at 223. This standard provides
meaningful constraint to the extent that the enhancement it
authorized is linked to a fixed, ascertainable amount approximating actual costs, even when defined generously to reflect

592 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Breyer, J., concurring
the contingent nature of plaintiffs' victories. But as thiscase shows, the factor cannot operate as a constraint when

an award much in excess of costs is approved for other rea-sons. An additional aspect of the standard--the need to
"encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial"--is a
factor that does not constrain, but enhances, discretionarypower--especially when unsupported by evidence of a

special need to encourage litigation (which the Alabama courtshere did not mention).

(f) Green Oil's sixth factor is whether or not "criminalsanctions have been imposed on the defendant for his conduct." Ibid. This factor did not apply here.

(g) Green Oil's seventh factor requires that "other civil
actions" filed "against the same defendant, based on the same
conduct," be considered in mitigation. Id., at 224. That
factor did not apply here.

Thus, the first, second, and third Green Oil factors, in principle, might sometimes act as constraints on arbitrary behavior. But as the Alabama courts interpreted those standards
in this case, even taking those three factors together, they
could not have significantly constrained the court system's
ability to impose "grossly excessive" awards.

Third, the state courts neither referred to, nor made any
effort to find, nor enunciated any other standard that either
directly, or indirectly as background, might have supplied the
constraining legal force that the statute and Green Oil standards (as interpreted here) lack. Dr. Gore did argue to the
jury an economic theory based on the need to offset the totality of the harm that the defendant's conduct caused. Some
theory of that general kind might have provided a significant
constraint on arbitrary awards (at least where confined to
the relevant harm-causing conduct, see ante, at 570-574).
Some economists, for example, have argued for a standard
that would deter illegal activity causing solely economic
harm through the use of punitive damages awards that, as a
whole, would take from a wrongdoer the total cost of the

harm caused. See, e. g., S. Shavell, Economic Analysis ofAccident Law 162 (1987) ("If liability equals losses caused

multiplied by . . . the inverse of the probability of suit, in-jurers will act optimally under liability rules despite the
chance that they will escape suit"); Cooter, Punitive Damages for Deterrence: When and How Much, 40 Ala. L. Rev.1143, 1146-1148 (1989). My understanding of the intuitive

essence of some of those theories, which I put in crude form(leaving out various qualifications), is that they could permit
juries to calculate punitive damages by making a rough esti-mate of global harm, dividing that estimate by a similarly
rough estimate of the number of successful lawsuits that
would likely be brought, and adding generous attorney's fees
and other costs. Smaller damages would not sufficiently
discourage firms from engaging in the harmful conduct,
while larger damages would "over-deter" by leading potential defendants to spend more to prevent the activity that
causes the economic harm, say, through employee training,
than the cost of the harm itself. See Galligan, Augmented
Awards: The Efficient Evolution of Punitive Damages, 51 La.
L. Rev. 3, 17-20, 28-30 (1990). Larger damages might also
"double count" by including in the punitive damages award
some of the compensatory, or punitive, damages that subsequent plaintiffs would also recover.

The record before us, however, contains nothing suggesting that the Alabama Supreme Court, when determining the
allowable award, applied any "economic" theory that might
explain the $2 million recovery. Cf. Browning-Fer r is,
supra, at 300 (noting that the Constitution "does not incorporate the views of the Law and Economics School," nor does it
" `require the States to subscribe to any particular economic
theory' ") (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part) (quoting CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481
U. S. 69, 92 (1987)). And courts properly tend to judge the
rationality of judicial actions in terms of the reasons that
were given, and the facts that were before the court, cf. TXO,

509 U. S., at 468 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and con-curring in judgment), not those that might have been given

on the basis of some conceivable set of facts (unlike the ra-tionality of economic statutes enacted by legislatures subject
to the public's control through the ballot box, see, e. g., FCC
v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 315 (1993)).Therefore, reference to a constraining "economic" theory,

which might have counseled more deferential review by thisCourt, is lacking in this case.

Fourth, I cannot find any community understanding or his-toric practice that this award might exemplify and which,
therefore, would provide background standards constraining
arbitrary behavior and excessive awards. A punitive damages award of $2 million for intentional misrepresentation
causing $56,000 of harm is extraordinary by historical standards, and, as far as I am aware, finds no analogue until relatively recent times. Amici for Dr. Gore attempt to show
that this is not true, pointing to various historical cases
which, according to their calculations, represented roughly
equivalent punitive awards for similarly culpable conduct.
See Brief for James D. A. Boyle et al. as Amici Curiae 4-5
(hereinafter Legal Historians' Brief). Among others, they
cite Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 98 Eng. Rep. 489 (C. P. 1763)
(#1,000 said to be equivalent of $1.5 million, for warrantless
search of papers); Huckle v. Money, 2 Wills. 205, 95 Eng.
Rep. 768 (K. B. 1763) (#300, said to be $450,000, for 6-hour
false imprisonment); Hewlett v. Cruchley, 5 Taunt. 277, 128
Eng. Rep. 696 (C. P. 1813) (#2,000, said to be $680,000, for
malicious prosecution); Merest v. Harvey, 5 Taunt. 442, 128
Eng. Rep. 761 (C. P. 1814) (#500, said to be $165,000, for
poaching). But amici apparently base their conversions on
a mathematical assumption, namely, that inflation has progressed at a constant 3% rate of inflation. See Legal Historians' Brief 4. In fact, consistent, cumulative inflation is a
modern phenomenon. See McCusker, How Much Is That in
Real Money? A Historical Price Index for Use as a Deflator

of Money Values in the Economy of the United States, 101Proceedings of American Antiquarian Society 297, 310, 323-

332 (1992). Estimates based on historical rates of valuation,while highly approximate, suggest that the ancient extraordinary awards are small compared to the $2 million here at
issue, or other modern punitive damages figures. See Ap-pendix to this opinion,

infra, at 597-598 (suggesting that the
modern equivalent of the awards in the above cases is some-thing like $150,000, $45,000, $100,000, and $25,000, respectively). And, as the majority opinion makes clear, the rec-ord contains nothing to suggest that the extraordinary size
of the award in this case is explained by the extraordinary
wrongfulness of the defendant's behavior, measured by historical or community standards, rather than arbitrariness
or caprice.

Fifth, there are no other legislative enactments here that
classify awards and impose quantitative limits that would
significantly cabin the fairly unbounded discretion created by
the absence of constraining legal standards. Cf., e. g., Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $ 41.008 (Supp. 1996) (punitive
damages generally limited to greater of double damages, or
$200,000, except cap does not apply to suits arising from
certain serious criminal acts enumerated in the statute);
Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 52-240b (1995) (punitive damages may not
exceed double compensatory damages in product liability
cases); Fla. Stat. $ 768.73(1) (Supp. 1993) (punitive damages
in certain actions limited to treble compensatory damages);
Ga. Code Ann. $ 51-12-5.1(g) (Supp. 1995) ($250,000 cap in
certain actions).

The upshot is that the rules that purport to channel discretion in this kind of case, here did not do so in fact. That
means that the award in this case was both (a) the product
of a system of standards that did not significantly constrain
a court's, and hence a jury's, discretion in making that award;
and (b) grossly excessive in light of the State's legitimate
punitive damages objectives.

The first of these reasons has special importance wherecourts review a jury-determined punitive damages award.

That is because one cannot expect to direct jurors like legis-lators through the ballot box; nor can one expect those jurors
to interpret law like judges, who work within a discipline
and hierarchical organization that normally promotesroughly uniform interpretation and application of the law.

Yet here Alabama expects jurors to act, at least a little, likelegislators or judges, for it permits them, to a certain extent,
to create public policy and to apply that policy, not to com-pensate a victim, but to achieve a policy-related objective
outside the confines of the particular case.

To the extent that neither clear legal principles nor fairly
obvious historical or community-based standards (defining,
say, especially egregious behavior) significantly constrain punitive damages awards, is there not a substantial risk of outcomes so arbitrary that they become difficult to square with
the Constitution's assurance, to every citizen, of the law's
protection? The standards here, as authoritatively interpreted, in my view, make this threat real and not theoretical.
And, in these unusual circumstances, where legal standards
offer virtually no constraint, I believe that this lack of constraining standards warrants this Court's detailed examination of the award.

The second reason--the severe disproportionality between
the award and the legitimate punitive damages objectives--
reflects a judgment about a matter of degree. I recognize
that it is often difficult to determine just when a punitive
award exceeds an amount reasonably related to a State's
legitimate interests, or when that excess is so great as to
amount to a matter of constitutional concern. Yet whatever
the difficulties of drawing a precise line, once we examine
the award in this case, it is not difficult to say that this award
lies on the line's far side. The severe lack of proportionality
between the size of the award and the underlying punitive
damages objectives shows that the award falls into the cate517US2$52Q 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT

gory of "gross excessiveness" set forth in this Court's priorcases.

These two reasons taken together overcome what wouldotherwise amount to a "strong presumption of validity."
TXO, 509 U. S., at 457. And, for those two reasons, I con-clude that the award in this unusual case violates the basic
guarantee of nonarbitrary governmental behavior that theDue Process Clause provides.

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER, J.
Although I recognize that all estimates of historic rates ofinflation are subject to dispute, including, I assume, the

sources below, those sources suggest that the value of the18th and 19th century judgments cited by

amici is much lessthan the figures amici arrived at under their presumption of

a constant 3% rate of inflation.In 1763, #1 (Eng.) was worth #1.73 Pennsylvania currency.
See U. S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of theUnited States: Colonial Times to 1970, Series Z-585, p. 1198
(Bicentennial ed. 1975). For the period 1766-1772, #1(Penn.) was worth $45.99 (U. S. 1991). See McCusker, How
Much Is That in Real Money? A Historical Price Index forUse as a Deflator of Money Values in the Economy of the
United States, 101 American Antiquarian Society 297, 333(1992). Thus, #1 (Eng. 1763) is worth about $79.56 (U. S.
1991). Accounting for the 12% inflation of the U. S. dollarbetween 1991 and 1995 (when amici filed their brief), see
Economic Indicators, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 23 (Feb. 1996),#1 (Eng. 1763) is worth about $89.11 (U. S. 1995).

Calculated another way, #1 (Eng. 1763) is worth about#72.84 (Eng. 1991). See McCusker,

supra, at 312, 342, 350.And #1 (Eng. 1991) is worth $1.77 (U. S. 1991). See 78 Fed.

Reserve Bulletin A68 (Feb. 1992). Thus, #1 (Eng. 1763)amounts to about $128.93 (U. S. 1991). Again, accounting for
inflation between 1991 and 1995, this amounts to about$144.40 (U. S. 1995).

598 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Scalia, J., dissenting
Thus, the above sources suggest that the #1,000 award inWilkes in 1763 roughly amounts to between $89,110 and

$144,440 today, not $1.5 million. And the #300 award inHuckle that same year would seem to be worth between
$26,733 and $43,320 today, not $450,000.For the period of the

Hewlett and Merest decisions, #1(Eng. 1813) is worth about #25.3 (Eng. 1991). See McCusker, supra, at 344, 350. Using the 1991 exchange rate,#1 (Eng. 1813) is worth about $44.78 (U. S. 1991). Accounting for inflation between 1991 and 1995, this amounts toabout $50.16 (U. S. 1995).

Thus, the #2,000 and #500 awards in Hewlett and Merestwould seem to be closer to $100,320 and $25,080, respectively,
than to amici's estimates of $680,000 and $165,000.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

Today we see the latest manifestation of this Court's re-cent and increasingly insistent "concern about punitive damages that `run wild.' " Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,499 U. S. 1, 18 (1991). Since the Constitution does not make
that concern any of our business, the Court's activities inthis area are an unjustified incursion into the province of
state governments.In earlier cases that were the prelude to this decision, I
set forth my view that a state trial procedure that commitsthe decision whether to impose punitive damages, and the
amount, to the discretion of the jury, subject to some judicialreview for "reasonableness," furnishes a defendant with all
the process that is "due." See TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 470 (1993) (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment);

Haslip, supra, at 25-28 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment); cf. Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512U. S. 415, 435-436 (1994) (

Scalia, J., concurring). I do not
regard the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clauseas a secret repository of substantive guarantees against

Scalia, J., dissenting
"unfairness"--neither the unfairness of an excessive civilcompensatory award, nor the unfairness of an "unreasonable" punitive award. What the Fourteenth Amendment'sprocedural guarantee assures is an opportunity to contest
the reasonableness of a damages judgment in state court;but there is no federal guarantee a damages award actually
be reasonable. See TXO, supra, at 471 (Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment).

This view, which adheres to the text of the Due ProcessClause, has not prevailed in our punitive damages cases.
See TXO, 509 U. S., at 453-462 (plurality opinion); id., at 478-481 (

O'Connor, J., dissenting); Haslip, supra, at 18. When,however, a constitutional doctrine adopted by the Court is

not only mistaken but also insusceptible of principled appli-cation, I do not feel bound to give it

stare decisis effect--indeed, I do not feel justified in doing so. See, e. g., Witte v.

United States, 515 U. S. 389, 406 (1995) (Scalia, J., concur-ring in judgment); Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 673
(1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dis-senting in part). Our punitive damages jurisprudence compels such a response. The Constitution provides no warrantfor federalizing yet another aspect of our Nation's legal culture (no matter how much in need of correction it may be),and the application of the Court's new rule of constitutional
law is constrained by no principle other than the Justices'subjective assessment of the "reasonableness" of the award
in relation to the conduct for which it was assessed.Because today's judgment represents the first instance of
this Court's invalidation of a state-court punitive assessmentas simply unreasonably large, I think it a proper occasion to
discuss these points at some length.

I
The most significant aspects of today's decision--the iden-tification of a "substantive due process" right against a

"grossly excessive" award, and the concomitant assumption

517US2$52K 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT
600 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Scalia, J., dissenting
of ultimate authority to decide anew a matter of "reasonable-ness" resolved in lower court proceedings--are of course not

new. Haslip and TXO revived the notion, moribund sinceits appearance in the first years of this century, that the
measure of civil punishment poses a question of constitutional dimension to be answered by this Court. Neither ofthose cases, however, nor any of the precedents upon which

they relied, actually took the step of declaring a punitiveaward unconstitutional simply because it was "too big."

At the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,it was well understood that punitive damages represent the
assessment by the jury, as the voice of the community, of the
measure of punishment the defendant deserved. See, e. g.,
Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886); Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Humes, 115 U. S. 512, 521 (1885); Day v.
Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852). See generally Haslip,
supra, at 25-27 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Today's decision, though dressed up as a legal opinion, is really
no more than a disagreement with the community's sense of
indignation or outrage expressed in the punitive award of
the Alabama jury, as reduced by the State Supreme Court.
It reflects not merely, as the concurrence candidly acknowledges, "a judgment about a matter of degree," ante, at 596;
but a judgment about the appropriate degree of indignation
or outrage, which is hardly an analytical determination.

There is no precedential warrant for giving our judgment
priority over the judgment of state courts and juries on this
matter. The only support for the Court's position is to be
found in a handful of errant federal cases, bunched within a
few years of one other, which invented the notion that an
unfairly severe civil sanction amounts to a violation of constitutional liberties. These were the decisions upon which the
TXO plurality relied in pronouncing that the Due Process
Clause "imposes substantive limits `beyond which penalties
may not go,' " 509 U. S., at 454 (quoting Seaboard Air Line
R. Co. v. Seegers, 207 U. S. 73, 78 (1907)); see also 509 U. S.,

Scalia, J., dissenting
at 478-481 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Haslip, supra, at 18.Although they are our precedents, they are themselves too

shallowly rooted to justify the Court's recent undertaking.The only case relied upon in which the Court actually invalidated a civil sanction does not even support constitutional
review for excessiveness, since it really concerned the valid-ity, as a matter of

procedural due process, of state legislation
that imposed a significant penalty on a common carrier whichlacked the means of determining the legality of its actions

before the penalty was imposed. See Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238 U. S. 482, 489-491
(1915). The amount of the penalty was not a subject of independent scrutiny. As for the remaining cases, while the
opinions do consider arguments that statutory penalties can,
by reason of their excessiveness, violate due process, not a
single one of these judgments invalidates a damages award.
See Seaboard, supra, at 78-79; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v.
Texas (No. 1), 212 U. S. 86, 111-112 (1909); Standard Oil Co.
of Ind. v. Missouri, 224 U. S. 270, 286, 290 (1912); St. Louis,
I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Williams, 251 U. S. 63, 66-67 (1919).

More importantly, this latter group of cases--which again
are the sole precedential foundation put forward for the rule
of constitutional law espoused by today's Court--simply fabricated the "substantive due process" right at issue. Seaboard assigned no precedent to its bald assertion that the
Constitution imposes "limits beyond which penalties may not
go," 207 U. S., at 78. Waters-Pierce cited only Coffey v.
County of Harlan, 204 U. S. 659 (1907), a case which inquired
into the constitutionality of state procedure, id., at 662-663.
Standard Oil simply cited Waters-Pierce, and St. Louis,
I. M. & S. R. Co. offered in addition to these cases only Collins v. Johnston, 237 U. S. 502 (1915), which said nothing to
support the notion of a "substantive due process" right
against excessive civil penalties, but to the contrary asserted
that the prescribing and imposing of criminal punishment
were "functions peculiarly belonging to the several States,"

id., at 509-510. Thus, the only authority for the Court's po-sition is simply not authoritative. These cases fall far short

of what is needed to supplant this country's longstandingpractice regarding exemplary awards, see, e. g., Haslip, 499
U. S., at 15-18; id., at 25-28 (Scalia, J., concurring injudgment).

II
One might understand the Court's eagerness to enter thisfield, rather than leave it with the state legislatures, if it

had something useful to say. In fact, however, its opinionprovides virtually no guidance to legislatures, and to state
and federal courts, as to what a "constitutionally proper"level of punitive damages might be.

We are instructed at the outset of Part II of the Court'sopinion--the beginning of its substantive analysis--that "the
federal excessiveness inquiry . . . begins with an identifica-tion of the state interests that a punitive award is designed
to serve." Ante, at 568. On first reading this, one is facedwith the prospect that federal punitive damages law (the
new field created by today's decision) will be beset by thesort of "interest analysis" that has laid waste the formerly
comprehensible field of conflict of laws. The thought thateach assessment of punitive damages, as to each offense,
must be examined to determine the precise "state interests"pursued, is most unsettling. Moreover, if those "interests"
are the most fundamental determinant of an award, onewould think that due process would require the assessing
jury to be instructed about them.It appears, however (and I certainly hope), that all this is
a false alarm. As Part II of the Court's opinion unfolds,it turns out to be directed, not to the question "How much
punishment is too much?" but rather to the question "Whichacts can be punished?" "Alabama does not have the power,"
the Court says, "to punish BMW for conduct that was lawfulwhere it occurred and that had no impact on Alabama or its
residents." Ante, at 572-573. That may be true, though

517US2$52K 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT

603Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)
Scalia, J., dissenting
only in the narrow sense that a person cannot be held liable
to be punished on the basis of a lawful act. But if a person
has been held subject to punishment because he committedan

unlawful act, the degree of his punishment assuredly can
be increased on the basis of any other conduct of his that
displays his wickedness, unlawful or not. Criminal sen-tences can be computed, we have said, on the basis of "information concerning every aspect of a defendant's life," Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 250-252 (1949). The Court
at one point seems to acknowledge this, observing that, al-though a sentencing court "[cannot] properly

punish lawful
conduct," it may in assessing the penalty "consider . . . lawful
conduct that bears on the defendant's character." Ante, at
573, n. 19. That concession is quite incompatible, however,
with the later assertion that, since "neither the jury nor the
trial court was presented with evidence that any of BMW's
out-of-state conduct was unlawful," the Alabama Supreme
Court "therefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW's outof-state conduct, . . . and based its remitted award solely on
conduct that occurred within Alabama." Ante, at 573-574.
Why could the Supreme Court of Alabama not consider lawful (but disreputable) conduct, both inside and outside Alabama, for the purpose of assessing just how bad an actor
BMW was?

The Court follows up its statement that "Alabama does not
have the power . . . to punish BMW for conduct that was
lawful where it occurred" with the statement: "Nor may Alabama impose sanctions on BMW in order to deter conduct
that is lawful in other jurisdictions." Ante, at 572-573.
The Court provides us no citation of authority to support this
proposition--other than the barely analogous cases cited earlier in the opinion, see ante, at 571-572--and I know of none.

These significant issues pronounced upon by the Court are
not remotely presented for resolution in the present case.
There is no basis for believing that Alabama has sought to
control conduct elsewhere. The statutes at issue merely

604 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Scalia, J., dissenting
permit civil juries to treat conduct such as petitioner's asfraud, and authorize an award of appropriate punitive damages in the event the fraud is found to be "gross, oppressive,or malicious," Ala. Code $ 6-11-20(b)(1) (1993). To be sure,
respondent did invite the jury to consider out-of-state con-duct in its calculation of damages, but any increase in the
jury's initial award based on that consideration is not a com-ponent of the remitted judgment before us. As the Court
several times recognizes, in computing the amount of the re-mitted award the Alabama Supreme Court--whether it was
constitutionally required to or not--"expressly disclaimedany reliance on acts that occurred in other jurisdictions."
Ante, at 567 (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoante, at 573-574.* Thus, the only question presented by
this case is whether that award, limited to petitioner's Ala-bama conduct and viewed in light of the factors identified
as properly informing the inquiry, is excessive. The Court'ssweeping (and largely unsupported) statements regarding
the relationship of punitive awards to lawful or unlawfulout-of-state conduct are the purest dicta.

III
In Part III of its opinion, the Court identifies "[t]hreeguideposts" that lead it to the conclusion that the award in

this case is excessive: degree of reprehensibility, ratio be-tween punitive award and plaintiff 's actual harm, and legisla*The Alabama Supreme Court said:
"[W]e must conclude that the award of punitive damages was based in
large part on conduct that happened in other jurisdictions. . . . Although
evidence of similar acts in other jurisdictions is admissible as to the issue
of `pattern and practice' of such acts, . . . this jury could not use the number
of similar acts that a defendant has committed in other jurisdictions as a
multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a punitive damages
award. Such evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the
civil penalty, because neither the jury nor the trial court had evidence
before it showing in which states the conduct was wrongful." 646 So. 2d
619, 627 (1994).

tive sanctions provided for comparable misconduct. Ante,at 574-585. The legal significance of these "guideposts" is

nowhere explored, but their necessary effect is to establishfederal standards governing the hitherto exclusively state
law of damages. Apparently (though it is by no means clear)
all three federal "guideposts" can be overridden if "neces-sary to deter future misconduct,"

ante, at 584--a loophole
that will encourage state reviewing courts to uphold awardsas necessary for the "adequat[e] protect[ion]" of state

consumers, ibid. By effectively requiring state review-ing courts to concoct rationalizations--whether within the
"guideposts" or through the loophole--to justify the intuitive
punitive reactions of state juries, the Court accords neither
category of institution the respect it deserves.

Of course it will not be easy for the States to comply with
this new federal law of damages, no matter how willing they
are to do so. In truth, the "guideposts" mark a road to nowhere; they provide no real guidance at all. As to "degree
of reprehensibility" of the defendant's conduct, we learn that
" `nonviolent crimes are less serious than crimes marked by
violence or the threat of violence,' " ante, at 576 (quoting
Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 292-293 (1983)), and that
" `trickery and deceit' " are "more reprehensible than negligence," ante, at 576. As to the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, we are told that a " `general concer[n] of
reasonableness . . . enter[s] into the constitutional calculus,' "
ante, at 583 (quoting TXO, 509 U. S., at 458)--though even "a
breathtaking 500 to 1" will not necessarily do anything more
than " `raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow,' " ante, at 583
(quoting TXO, supra, at 481 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), an
opinion which, when confronted with that "breathtaking"
ratio, approved it). And as to legislative sanctions provided
for comparable misconduct, they should be accorded " `substantial deference,' " ante, at 583 (quoting Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257,
301 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting

in part)). One expects the Court to conclude: "To thine ownself be true."

These crisscrossing platitudes yield no real answers in noreal cases. And it must be noted that the Court nowhere
says that these three "guideposts" are the only guideposts;
indeed, it makes very clear that they are not--explainingaway the earlier opinions that do not really follow these

"guideposts" on the basis of additional factors, thereby "re-iterat[ing] our rejection of a categorical approach."

Ante,
at 582. In other words, even these utter platitudes, if theyshould ever happen to produce an answer, may be overridden

by other unnamed considerations. The Court has constructed a framework that does not genuinely constrain, that
does not inform state legislatures and lower courts--that
does nothing at all except confer an artificial air of doctrinal
analysis upon its essentially ad hoc determination that this
particular award of punitive damages was not "fair."

The Court distinguishes today's result from Haslip and
TXO partly on the ground that "the record in this case
discloses no deliberate false statements, acts of affirmative
misconduct, or concealment of evidence of improper motive,
such as were present in Haslip and TXO." Ante, at 579.
This seemingly rejects the findings necessarily made by the
jury--that petitioner had committed a fraud that was "gross,
oppressive, or malicious," Ala. Code $ 6-11-20(b)(1) (1993).
Perhaps that rejection is intentional; the Court does not say.

The relationship between judicial application of the new
"guideposts" and jury findings poses a real problem for the
Court, since as a matter of logic there is no more justification
for ignoring the jury's determination as to how reprehensible
petitioner's conduct was (i. e., how much it deserves to be
punished), than there is for ignoring its determination that
it was reprehensible at all (i. e., that the wrong was willful
and punitive damages are therefore recoverable). That the
issue has been framed in terms of a constitutional right
against unreasonably excessive awards should not obscure

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
the fact that the logical and necessary consequence of theCourt's approach is the recognition of a constitutional right

against unreasonably imposed awards as well. The eleva-tion of "fairness" in punishment to a principle of "substantive
due process" means that every punitive award unreasonablyimposed is unconstitutional; such an award is by definition
excessive, since it attaches a penalty to conduct undeservingof punishment. Indeed, if the Court is correct, it must be
that every claim that a state jury's award of compensatorydamages is "unreasonable" (because not supported by the
evidence) amounts to an assertion of constitutional injury.See

TXO, supra, at 471 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).And the same would be true for determinations of liability.

By today's logic, every dispute as to evidentiary sufficiencyin a state civil suit poses a question of constitutional moment, subject to review in this Court. That is a stupefy-ing proposition.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, dissenting.
The Court, I am convinced, unnecessarily and unwiselyventures into territory traditionally within the States' domain, and does so in the face of reform measures recentlyadopted or currently under consideration in legislative arenas. The Alabama Supreme Court, in this case, endeavoredto follow this Court's prior instructions; and, more recently,
Alabama's highest court has installed further controls onawards of punitive damages (see

infra, at 613-614, n. 6). Iwould therefore leave the state court's judgment undisturbed, and resist unnecessary intrusion into an area domi-nantly of state concern.

siveness of the award is the sole issue genuinely presented.The Court ultimately so recognizes, see ante, at 573-574, but

further clarification is in order.Dr. Gore's experience was not unprecedented among
customers who bought BMW vehicles sold as flawless andbrand-new. In addition to his own encounter, Gore showed,
through paint repair orders introduced at trial, that on 983other occasions since 1983, BMW had shipped new vehicles
to dealers without disclosing paint repairs costing at least$300, Tr. 585-586; at least 14 of the repainted vehicles, the
evidence also showed, were sold as new and undamaged toconsumers in Alabama. 646 So. 2d 619, 623 (Ala. 1994).
Sales nationwide, Alabama's Supreme Court said, were ad-missible "as to the issue of a `pattern and practice' of such
acts." Id., at 627. There was "no error," the court reiter-ated, "in the admission of the evidence that showed how pervasive the nondisclosure policy was and the intent behindBMW NA's adoption of it." Id., at 628. That determination
comports with this Court's expositions. See TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 462,and n. 28 (1993) (characterizing as "well-settled" the admissibility of "evidence of [defendant's] alleged wrongdoing inother parts of the country" and of defendant's "wealth"); see
also Brief for Petitioner 22 (recognizing that similar acts,out-of-state, traditionally have been considered relevant "for
the limited purpose of determining that the conduct beforethe [c]ourt was reprehensible because it was part of a pattern rather than an isolated incident").Alabama's highest court next declared that the

"jury could not use the number of similar acts that adefendant has committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a puni-tive damages award. Such evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the civil penalty, becauseneither the jury nor the trial court had evidence before
it showing in which states the conduct was wrong517US2$52P 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT

ful." 646 So. 2d, at 627 (emphasis in original) (footnote
omitted).

Because the Alabama Supreme Court provided this clear
statement of the State's law, the multiplier problem encountered in Gore's case is not likely to occur again. Now, as a
matter of Alabama law, it is plainly impermissible to assess
punitive damages by multiplication based on out-of-state
events not shown to be unlawful. See, e. g., Independent
Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Harrington, 658 So. 2d 892,
902-903 (Ala. 1994) (under BMW v. Gore, trial court erred
in relying on defendant insurance company's out-of-state insurance policies in determining harm caused by defendant's
unlawful actions).

No Alabama authority, it bears emphasis--no statute, judicial decision, or trial judge instruction--ever countenanced
the jury's multiplication of the $4,000 diminution in value
estimated for each refinished car by the number of such cars
(approximately 1,000) shown to have been sold nationwide.
The sole prompt to the jury to use nationwide sales as a
multiplier came from Gore's lawyer during summation.
App. 31, Tr. 812-813. Notably, counsel for BMW failed to
object to Gore's multiplication suggestion, even though
BMW's counsel interrupted to make unrelated objections
four other times during Gore's closing statement. Tr. 810-
811, 854-855, 858, 870-871. Nor did BMW's counsel request
a charge instructing the jury not to consider out-of-state
sales in calculating the punitive damages award. See Record 513-529 (listing all charges requested by counsel).

Following the verdict, BMW's counsel challenged the admission of the paint repair orders, but not, alternately, the
jury's apparent use of the orders in a multiplication exercise.
Curiously, during postverdict argument, BMW's counsel
urged that if the repair orders were indeed admissible, then
Gore would have a "full right" to suggest a multiplier-based
disgorgement. Tr. 932.

In brief, Gore's case is idiosyncratic. The jury's impropermultiplication, tardily featured by petitioner, is unlikely to

recur in Alabama and does not call for error correction bythis Court.

Because the jury apparently (and erroneously) had usedacts in other States as a multiplier to arrive at a $4 million
sum for punitive damages, the Alabama Supreme Court itselfdetermined " `the maximum amount that a properly functioning jury could have awarded.' " 646 So. 2d, at 630 (Houston,J., concurring specially) (quoting

Big B, Inc. v. Cottingham,634 So. 2d 999, 1006 (Ala. 1993)). The per curiam opinion

emphasized that in arriving at $2 million as "the amount of
punitive damages to be awarded in this case, [the court did]not consider those acts that occurred in other jurisdictions."

646 So. 2d, at 628 (emphasis in original). As this Court rec-ognizes, the Alabama high court "properly eschewed reliance
on BMW's out-of-state conduct and based its remitted awardsolely on conduct that occurred within Alabama." Ante, at
573-574 (citation omitted). In sum, the Alabama SupremeCourt left standing the jury's decision that the facts warranted an award of punitive damages--a determination notcontested in this Court--and the state court concluded that,
considering only acts in Alabama, $2 million was "a constitu-tionally reasonable punitive damages award." 646 So. 2d,

10%,1 the financial position of the defendant, and the costs oflitigation. Id., at 625-626. These standards, we previously

held, "impos[e] a sufficiently definite and meaningful con-straint on the discretion of Alabama factfinders in awarding
punitive damages." Haslip, 499 U. S., at 22; see also TXO,509 U. S., at 462, n. 28. Alabama's highest court could have
displayed its labor pains more visibly,2 but its judgment isnonetheless entitled to a presumption of legitimacy. See
Rowan v. Runnels, 5 How. 134, 139 (1847) ("[T]his court willalways feel itself bound to respect the decisions of the State
courts, and from the time they are made will regard them asconclusive in all cases upon the construction of their own
constitution and laws.").We accept, of course, that Alabama's Supreme Court
applied the State's own law correctly. Under that law, theState's objectives--"punishment and deterrence"--guide punitive damages awards. See Birmingham v. Benson, 631So. 2d 902, 904 (Ala. 1994). Nor should we be quick to find
a constitutional infirmity when the highest state court en-deavored a corrective for one counsel's slip and the other's
oversight--counsel for plaintiff 's excess in summation, unob-jected to by counsel for defendant, see

supra, at 609--andwhen the state court did so intending to follow the process

approved in our Haslip and TXO decisions.

The Court finds Alabama's $2 million award not simplyexcessive, but grossly so, and therefore unconstitutional.

refinished cars out of Alabama and two other States. Tr. 964. The jury

BMW changed its national policy to one of full disclosure. Id., at 1026.

612 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GORE

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The decision leads us further into territory traditionally
within the States' domain,3 and commits the Court, now and
again, to correct "misapplication of a properly stated rule of
law." But cf. this Court's Rule 10 ("A petition for a writ of
certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error consists
of erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of law.").4 The Court is not well equipped

3 See ante, at 568 ("In our federal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that they
will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case.");
Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S.
257, 278 (1989) (In any "lawsuit where state law provides the basis of
decision, the propriety of an award of punitive damages for the conduct in
question, and the factors the jury may consider in determining their
amount, are questions of state law."); Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464
U. S. 238, 255 (1984) ("Punitive damages have long been a part of traditional state tort law.").

4 Petitioner invites the Court to address the question of multiple punitive damages awards stemming from the same alleged misconduct. The
Court does not take up the invitation, and rightly so, in my judgment, for
this case does not present the issue. For three reasons, the question of
multiple awards is hypothetical, not real, in Gore's case. First, the punitive damages award in favor of Gore is the only such award yet entered
against BMW on account of its nondisclosure policy.

Second, BMW did not raise the issue of multiple punitives below. Indeed, in its reply brief before the Alabama Supreme Court, BMW stated:
"Gore confuses our point about fairness among plaintiffs. He treats this
point as a premature `multiple punitive damages' argument. But, contrary to Gore's contention, we are not asking this Court to hold, as a
matter of law, that a `constitutional violation occurs when a defendant is
subjected to punitive damages in two separate cases.' " Reply Brief for
Appellant in Nos. 1920324, 1920325 (Ala. Sup. Ct.), p. 48 (internal citations omitted).

Third, if BMW had already suffered a punitive damages judgment in
connection with its nondisclosure policy, Alabama's highest court presumably would have taken that fact into consideration. In reviewing punitive
damages awards attacked as excessive, the Alabama Supreme Court considers whether "there have been other civil actions against the same defendant, based on the same conduct." 646 So. 2d 619, 624 (1994) (quoting
Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So. 2d 218, 224 (Ala. 1989)). If so, "this

for this mission. Tellingly, the Court repeats that it bringsto the task no "mathematical formula," ante, at 582, no "categorical approach," ibid., no "bright line," ante, at 585. Ithas only a vague concept of substantive due process, a
"raised eyebrow" test, see ante, at 583, as its ultimate guide.5In contrast to habeas corpus review under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254, the Court will work at this business alone. It willnot be aided by the federal district courts and courts of appeals. It will be the only federal court policing the area.The Court's readiness to superintend state-court punitive
damages awards is all the more puzzling in view of theCourt's longstanding reluctance to countenance review, even
by courts of appeals, of the size of verdicts returned by juriesin federal district court proceedings. See generally 11 C.
Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Proce-dure $ 2820 (2d ed. 1995). And the reexamination prominent
in state courts 6 and in legislative arenas, see Appendix,
should be taken into account in mitigation of the punitive damages award."
646 So. 2d, at 624. The Alabama court accordingly observed that Gore's
counsel had filed 24 other actions against BMW in Alabama and Georgia,
but that no other punitive damages award had so far resulted. Id., at 626.

5 Justice Breyer's concurring opinion offers nothing more solid.

Under Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1 (1991), he acknowledges, Alabama's standards for punitive damages, standing alone, do not
violate due process. Ante, at 588. But they "invit[e] the kind of scrutiny
the Court has given the particular verdict before us." Ibid. Pursuing that
invitation, Justice Breyer concludes that, matching the particular facts of
this case to Alabama's "legitimate punitive damages objectives," ante, at
596, the award was " `gross[ly] excessiv[e],' " ante, at 597. The exercise is
engaging, but ultimately tells us only this: too big will be judged unfair.
What is the Court's measure of too big? Not a cap of the kind a legislature
could order, or a mathematical test this Court can divine and impose. Too
big is, in the end, the amount at which five Members of the Court bridle.

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF GINSBURG, J.

State Legislative Activity Regarding

Punitive Damages

State legislatures have in the hopper or have enacted avariety of measures to curtail awards of punitive damages.

At least one state legislature has prohibited punitive dam-ages altogether, unless explicitly provided by statute. See
N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 507:16 (1994). We set out in thisappendix some of the several controls enacted or under consideration in the States. The measures surveyed are: (1)caps on awards; (2) provisions for payment of sums to state
agencies rather than to plaintiffs; and (3) mandatory bifur-cated trials with separate proceedings for punitive damages
determinations.
Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wash. 2d 826, 852, 726 P. 2d 8, 23 (1986) (en
banc) (same).

In Life Ins. Co. of Georgia v. Johnson, No. 1940357 (Nov. 17, 1995), the
Alabama Supreme Court revised the State's regime for assessments of
punitive damages. Henceforth, trials will be bifurcated. Initially, juries
will be instructed to determine liability and the amount of compensatory
damages, if any; also, the jury is to return a special verdict on the question
whether a punitive damages award is warranted. If the jury answers
yes to the punitive damages question, the trial will be resumed for the
presentation of evidence and instructions relevant to the amount appropriate to award as punitive damages. After postverdict trial court review
and subsequent appellate review, the amount of the final punitive damages
judgment will be paid into the trial court. The trial court will then order
payment of litigation expenses, including the plaintiff's attorney's fees, and
instruct the clerk to divide the remainder equally between the plaintiff
and the State General Fund. The provision for payment to the State
General Fund is applicable to all judgments not yet satisfied, and therefore
would apply to the judgment in Gore's case.

ROMER, GOVERNOR OF COLORADO, et al. v.EVANS

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of colorado
No. 94-1039. Argued October 10, 1995--Decided May 20, 1996
After various Colorado municipalities passed ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment, education,
public accommodations, health and welfare services, and other transactions and activities, Colorado voters adopted by statewide referendum
"Amendment 2" to the State Constitution, which precludes all legislative, executive, or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the status of persons based on their "homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships."
Respondents, who include aggrieved homosexuals and municipalities,
commenced this litigation in state court against petitioner state parties
to declare Amendment 2 invalid and enjoin its enforcement. The trial
court's grant of a preliminary injunction was sustained by the Colorado
Supreme Court, which held that Amendment 2 was subject to strict
scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it infringed the fundamental right of gays and lesbians to
participate in the political process. On remand, the trial court found
that the amendment failed to satisfy strict scrutiny. It enjoined Amendment 2's enforcement, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause. Pp. 626-636.

(a) The State's principal argument that Amendment 2 puts gays and
lesbians in the same position as all other persons by denying them special rights is rejected as implausible. The extent of the change in legal
status effected by this law is evident from the authoritative construction
of Colorado's Supreme Court--which establishes that the amendment's
immediate effect is to repeal all existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities barring discrimination
based on sexual orientation, and that its ultimate effect is to prohibit
any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more protective,
measures in the future absent state constitutional amendment--and
from a review of the terms, structure, and operation of the ordinances
that would be repealed and prohibited by Amendment 2. Even if, as
the State contends, homosexuals can find protection in laws and policies
of general application, Amendment 2 goes well beyond merely depriving
them of special rights. It imposes a broad disability upon those persons
alone, forbidding them, but no others, to seek specific legal protection

Syllabus
from injuries caused by discrimination in a wide range of public and
private transactions. Pp. 626-631.

(b) In order to reconcile the Fourteenth Amendment's promise that
no person shall be denied equal protection with the practical reality that
most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, the Court has
stated that it will uphold a law that neither burdens a fundamental right
nor targets a suspect class so long as the legislative classification bears
a rational relation to some independent and legitimate legislative end.
See, e. g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320. Amendment 2 fails,
indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry. First, the amendment is
at once too narrow and too broad, identifying persons by a single trait
and then denying them the possibility of protection across the board.
This disqualification of a class of persons from the right to obtain specific
protection from the law is unprecedented and is itself a denial of equal
protection in the most literal sense. Second, the sheer breadth of
Amendment 2, which makes a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not have any particular protections from the law, is so far
removed from the reasons offered for it, i. e., respect for other citizens'
freedom of association, particularly landlords or employers who have
personal or religious objections to homosexuality, and the State's interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups,
that the amendment cannot be explained by reference to those reasons;
the amendment raises the inevitable inference that it is born of animosity toward the class that it affects. Amendment 2 cannot be said to be
directed to an identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It
is a status-based classification of persons undertaken for its own sake,
something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit. Pp. 631-636.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
One century ago, the first Justice Harlan admonished thisCourt that the Constitution "neither knows nor tolerates

classes among citizens." Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537,559 (1896) (dissenting opinion). Unheeded then, those words
now are understood to state a commitment to the law's neu-trality where the rights of persons are at stake. The Equal
Protection Clause enforces this principle and today requiresus to hold invalid a provision of Colorado's Constitution.

I
The enactment challenged in this case is an amendment tothe Constitution of the State of Colorado, adopted in a 1992

statewide referendum. The parties and the state courtsrefer to it as "Amendment 2," its designation when submitted to the voters. The impetus for the amendment and thecontentious campaign that preceded its adoption came in
large part from ordinances that had been passed in variousColorado municipalities. For example, the cities of Aspen
and Boulder and the city and County of Denver each had

Opinion of the Court
enacted ordinances which banned discrimination in manytransactions and activities, including housing, employment,

education, public accommodations, and health and welfareservices. Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art. IV, $$ 28-91 to
28-116 (1991); Aspen Municipal Code $ 13-98 (1977); BoulderRev. Code $$ 12-1-1 to 12-1-11 (1987). What gave rise to
the statewide controversy was the protection the ordinancesafforded to persons discriminated against by reason of their
sexual orientation. See Boulder Rev. Code $ 12-1-1 (defin-ing "sexual orientation" as "the choice of sexual partners,
i. e., bisexual, homosexual or heterosexual"); Denver Rev.Municipal Code, Art. IV, $ 28-92 (defining "sexual orientation" as "[t]he status of an individual as to his or her hetero-sexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality"). Amendment 2
repeals these ordinances to the extent they prohibit discrimi-nation on the basis of "homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships." Colo. Const.,Art. II, $ 30b.

Yet Amendment 2, in explicit terms, does more than repealor rescind these provisions. It prohibits all legislative, executive or judicial action at any level of state or local govern-ment designed to protect the named class, a class we shall
refer to as homosexual persons or gays and lesbians. Theamendment reads:

"No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian orBisexual Orientation. Neither the State of Colorado,
through any of its branches or departments, nor any ofits agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or
school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute,regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual,
lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or re-lationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of
or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claimany minority status, quota preferences, protected status
or claim of discrimination. This Section of the Consti-tution shall be in all respects self-executing." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
Soon after Amendment 2 was adopted, this litigation todeclare its invalidity and enjoin its enforcement was commenced in the District Court for the City and County of Den-ver. Among the plaintiffs (respondents here) were homosexual persons, some of them government employees. They
alleged that enforcement of Amendment 2 would subjectthem to immediate and substantial risk of discrimination on

the basis of their sexual orientation. Other plaintiffs (alsorespondents here) included the three municipalities whose
ordinances we have cited and certain other governmentalentities which had acted earlier to protect homosexuals from
discrimination but would be prevented by Amendment 2
from continuing to do so. Although Governor Romer had
been on record opposing the adoption of Amendment 2, he
was named in his official capacity as a defendant, together
with the Colorado Attorney General and the State of
Colorado.

The trial court granted a preliminary injunction to stay
enforcement of Amendment 2, and an appeal was taken to
the Supreme Court of Colorado. Sustaining the interim injunction and remanding the case for further proceedings, the
State Supreme Court held that Amendment 2 was subject to
strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment because it
infringed the fundamental right of gays and lesbians to participate in the political process. Evans v. Romer, 854 P. 2d
1270 (Colo. 1993) (Evans I). To reach this conclusion, the
state court relied on our voting rights cases, e. g., Reynolds
v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U. S.
89 (1965); Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663
(1966); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), and on our
precedents involving discriminatory restructuring of governmental decisionmaking, see, e. g., Hunter v. Erickson, 393
U. S. 385 (1969); Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 (1967);
Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457
(1982); Gordon v. Lance, 403 U. S. 1 (1971). On remand, the
State advanced various arguments in an effort to show that

517US2$53L 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT
626 ROMER v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
Amendment 2 was narrowly tailored to serve compelling in-terests, but the trial court found none sufficient. It enjoined

enforcement of Amendment 2, and the Supreme Court ofColorado, in a second opinion, affirmed the ruling. 882 P. 2d
1335 (1994) (Evans II). We granted certiorari, 513 U. S.1146 (1995), and now affirm the judgment, but on a rationale
different from that adopted by the State Supreme Court.

II
The State's principal argument in defense of Amendment2 is that it puts gays and lesbians in the same position as all

other persons. So, the State says, the measure does nomore than deny homosexuals special rights. This reading of
the amendment's language is implausible. We rely not uponour own interpretation of the amendment but upon the authoritative construction of Colorado's Supreme Court. Thestate court, deeming it unnecessary to determine the full extent of the amendment's reach, found it invalid even on amodest reading of its implications. The critical discussion
of the amendment, set out in Evans I, is as follows:

"The immediate objective of Amendment 2 is, at aminimum, to repeal existing statutes, regulations, ordinances, and policies of state and local entities thatbarred discrimination based on sexual orientation.

SeeAspen, Colo., Mun. Code $ 13-98 (1977) (prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing and public accom-modations on the basis of sexual orientation); Boulder,
Colo., Rev. Code $$ 12-1-2 to -4 (1987) (same); Denver,Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. IV, $$ 28-91 to -116 (1991)
(same); Executive Order No. D0035 (December 10, 1990)(prohibiting employment discrimination for `all state
employees, classified and exempt' on the basis of sexualorientation); Colorado Insurance Code, $ 10-3-1104, 4A

based on an applicant's, a beneficiary's, or an insured's

Opinion of the Court
sexual orientation); and various provisions prohibit-ing discrimination based on sexual orientation at state

colleges.26

"26 Metropolitan State College of Denver prohibits college sponsored social clubs from discriminating in membership on the basis of
sexual orientation and Colorado State University has an antidiscrimination policy which encompasses sexual orientation.

"The `ultimate effect' of Amendment 2 is to prohibit
any governmental entity from adopting similar, or more
protective statutes, regulations, ordinances, or policies
in the future unless the state constitution is first
amended to permit such measures." 854 P. 2d, at 1284-
1285, and n. 26.

Sweeping and comprehensive is the change in legal status
effected by this law. So much is evident from the ordinances the Colorado Supreme Court declared would be void
by operation of Amendment 2. Homosexuals, by state decree, are put in a solitary class with respect to transactions
and relations in both the private and governmental spheres.
The amendment withdraws from homosexuals, but no others,
specific legal protection from the injuries caused by discrimination, and it forbids reinstatement of these laws and policies.

The change Amendment 2 works in the legal status of gays
and lesbians in the private sphere is far reaching, both on its
own terms and when considered in light of the structure and
operation of modern antidiscrimination laws. That structure is well illustrated by contemporary statutes and ordinances prohibiting discrimination by providers of public accommodations. "At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and
others who `made profession of a public employment,' were
prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer." Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 571 (1995).
The duty was a general one and did not specify protection for
particular groups. The common-law rules, however, proved

628 ROMER v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
insufficient in many instances, and it was settled early thatthe Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress a general

power to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations,
Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 25 (1883). In consequence,
most States have chosen to counter discrimination by enacting detailed statutory schemes. See, e. g., S. D. CodifiedLaws $$ 20-13-10, 20-13-22, 20-13-23 (1995); Iowa Code

$$ 216.6-216.8 (1994); Okla. Stat., Tit. 25, $$ 1302, 1402 (1987);43 Pa. Cons. Stat. $$ 953, 955 (Supp. 1995); N. J. Stat. Ann.

$$ 10:5-3, 10:5-4 (West Supp. 1995); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann.$$ 354-A:7, 354-A:10, 354-A:17 (1995); Minn. Stat. $ 363.03
(1991 and Supp. 1995).

Colorado's state and municipal laws typify this emerging
tradition of statutory protection and follow a consistent pattern. The laws first enumerate the persons or entities subject to a duty not to discriminate. The list goes well beyond
the entities covered by the common law. The Boulder ordinance, for example, has a comprehensive definition of entities
deemed places of "public accommodation." They include
"any place of business engaged in any sales to the general
public and any place that offers services, facilities, privileges,
or advantages to the general public or that receives financial
support through solicitation of the general public or through
governmental subsidy of any kind." Boulder Rev. Code

$ 12-1-1( j) (1987). The Denver ordinance is of similar
breadth, applying, for example, to hotels, restaurants, hospitals, dental clinics, theaters, banks, common carriers, travel
and insurance agencies, and "shops and stores dealing with
goods or services of any kind," Denver Rev. Municipal Code,
Art. IV, $ 28-92 (1991).

These statutes and ordinances also depart from the common law by enumerating the groups or persons within their
ambit of protection. Enumeration is the essential device
used to make the duty not to discriminate concrete and to
provide guidance for those who must comply. In following
this approach, Colorado's state and local governments have

629Cite as: 517 U. S. 620 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
not limited antidiscrimination laws to groups that have sofar been given the protection of heightened equal protection

scrutiny under our cases. See, e. g., J. E. B. v. Alabama ex
rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 135 (1994) (sex); Lalli v. Lalli, 439
U. S. 259, 265 (1978) (illegitimacy); McLaughlin v. Florida,
379 U. S. 184, 191-192 (1964) (race); Oyama v. California,332 U. S. 633 (1948) (ancestry). Rather, they set forth an

extensive catalog of traits which cannot be the basis for dis-crimination, including age, military status, marital status,
pregnancy, parenthood, custody of a minor child, political af-filiation, physical or mental disability of an individual or of
his or her associates---and, in recent times, sexual orientation. Aspen Municipal Code $ 13-98(a)(1) (1977); Boulder
Rev. Code $$ 12-1-1 to 12-1-4 (1987); Denver Rev. Municipal
Code, Art. IV, $$ 28-92 to 28-119 (1991); Colo. Rev. Stat.

$$ 24-34-401 to 24-34-707 (1988 and Supp. 1995).

Amendment 2 bars homosexuals from securing protection
against the injuries that these public-accommodations laws
address. That in itself is a severe consequence, but there
is more. Amendment 2, in addition, nullifies specific legal
protections for this targeted class in all transactions in housing, sale of real estate, insurance, health and welfare services, private education, and employment. See, e. g., Aspen
Municipal Code $$ 13-98(b), (c) (1977); Boulder Rev. Code

$$ 12-1-2, 12-1-3 (1987); Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art.
IV, $$ 28-93 to 28-95, 28-97 (1991).

Not confined to the private sphere, Amendment 2 also operates to repeal and forbid all laws or policies providing specific protection for gays or lesbians from discrimination by
every level of Colorado government. The State Supreme
Court cited two examples of protections in the governmental
sphere that are now rescinded and may not be reintroduced.
The first is Colorado Executive Order D0035 (1990), which
forbids employment discrimination against " `all state employees, classified and exempt' on the basis of sexual orientation." 854 P. 2d, at 1284. Also repealed, and now forbid517US2$53L 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT
630 ROMER v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
den, are "various provisions prohibiting discrimination basedon sexual orientation at state colleges."

Id., at 1284, 1285.
The repeal of these measures and the prohibition againsttheir future reenactment demonstrate that Amendment 2

has the same force and effect in Colorado's governmental
sector as it does elsewhere and that it applies to policies aswell as ordinary legislation.

Amendment 2's reach may not be limited to specific lawspassed for the benefit of gays and lesbians. It is a fair, if
not necessary, inference from the broad language of theamendment that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the
protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary
discrimination in governmental and private settings. See,
e. g., Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 24-4-106(7) (1988) (agency action subject to judicial review under arbitrary and capricious standard); $ 18-8-405 (making it a criminal offense for a public
servant knowingly, arbitrarily, or capriciously to refrain from
performing a duty imposed on him by law); $ 10-3-1104(1)(f)
(prohibiting "unfair discrimination" in insurance); 4 Colo.
Code of Regulations 801-1, Policy 11-1 (1983) (prohibiting
discrimination in state employment on grounds of specified
traits or "other non-merit factor"). At some point in the
systematic administration of these laws, an official must determine whether homosexuality is an arbitrary and, thus,
forbidden basis for decision. Yet a decision to that effect
would itself amount to a policy prohibiting discrimination on
the basis of homosexuality, and so would appear to be no
more valid under Amendment 2 than the specific prohibitions
against discrimination the state court held invalid.

If this consequence follows from Amendment 2, as its
broad language suggests, it would compound the constitutional difficulties the law creates. The state court did not
decide whether the amendment has this effect, however, and
neither need we. In the course of rejecting the argument
that Amendment 2 is intended to conserve resources to fight
discrimination against suspect classes, the Colorado Su517US2$53L 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT

631Cite as: 517 U. S. 620 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
preme Court made the limited observation that the amend-ment is not intended to affect many antidiscrimination laws

protecting nonsuspect classes, Romer II, 882 P. 2d, at 1346,n. 9. In our view that does not resolve the issue. In any
event, even if, as we doubt, homosexuals could find some safeharbor in laws of general application, we cannot accept the
view that Amendment 2's prohibition on specific legal protec-tions does no more than deprive homosexuals of special
rights. To the contrary, the amendment imposes a specialdisability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek withoutconstraint. They can obtain specific protection against discrimination only by enlisting the citizenry of Colorado toamend the State Constitution or perhaps, on the State's view,
by trying to pass helpful laws of general applicability. Thisis so no matter how local or discrete the harm, no matter how
public and widespread the injury. We find nothing special inthe protections Amendment 2 withholds. These are protections taken for granted by most people either because theyalready have them or do not need them; these are protections
against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transac-tions and endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a
free society. III

The Fourteenth Amendment's promise that no person shallbe denied the equal protection of the laws must coexist with
the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for onepurpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various
groups or persons. Personnel Administrator of Mass. v.
Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 271-272 (1979); F. S. Royster Guano
Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920). We have at-tempted to reconcile the principle with the reality by stating

that, if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targetsa suspect class, we will uphold the legislative classification
so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.See, e. g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319-320 (1993).

517US2$53L 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT
632 ROMER v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional
inquiry. First, the amendment has the peculiar property of
imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single
named group, an exceptional and, as we shall explain, invalid
form of legislation. Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment
seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class
it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state
interests.

Taking the first point, even in the ordinary equal protection case calling for the most deferential of standards, we
insist on knowing the relation between the classification
adopted and the object to be attained. The search for the
link between classification and objective gives substance to
the Equal Protection Clause; it provides guidance and discipline for the legislature, which is entitled to know what sorts
of laws it can pass; and it marks the limits of our own authority. In the ordinary case, a law will be sustained if it can be
said to advance a legitimate government interest, even if the
law seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for it seems tenuous. See New
Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297 (1976) (tourism benefits justified classification favoring pushcart vendors of certain longevity); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S.
483 (1955) (assumed health concerns justified law favoring
optometrists over opticians); Railway Express Agency, Inc.
v. New York, 336 U. S. 106 (1949) (potential traffic hazards
justified exemption of vehicles advertising the owner's products from general advertising ban); Kotch v. Board of River
Port Pilot Comm'rs for Port of New Orleans, 330 U. S. 552
(1947) (licensing scheme that disfavored persons unrelated
to current river boat pilots justified by possible efficiency and
safety benefits of a closely knit pilotage system). The laws
challenged in the cases just cited were narrow enough in
scope and grounded in a sufficient factual context for us to

517US2$53L 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT

633Cite as: 517 U. S. 620 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
ascertain some relation between the classification and the
purpose it served. By requiring that the classification bear
a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end, we ensure that classifications are not drawn for
the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the
law. See Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166,
181 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring) ("If the adverse impact
on the disfavored class is an apparent aim of the legislature,
its impartiality would be suspect").

Amendment 2 confounds this normal process of judicial review. It is at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies
persons by a single trait and then denies them protection
across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of
persons from the right to seek specific protection from the
law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence. The absence of
precedent for Amendment 2 is itself instructive; "[d]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful
consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to
the constitutional provision." Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v.
Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37-38 (1928).

It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws
of this sort. Central both to the idea of the rule of law and
to our own Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is
the principle that government and each of its parts remain
open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance.
" `Equal protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.' " Sweatt v. Painter,
339 U. S. 629, 635 (1950) (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer, 334
U. S. 1, 22 (1948)). Respect for this principle explains why
laws singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored
legal status or general hardships are rare. A law declaring
that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of
citizens than for all others to seek aid from the government
is itself a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most
literal sense. "The guaranty of `equal protection of the laws

Opinion of the Court
is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' " Skinner v.
Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942)
(quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 369 (1886)).

Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), not cited by the
parties but relied upon by the dissent, is not evidence that
Amendment 2 is within our constitutional tradition, and anyreliance upon it as authority for sustaining the amendment

is misplaced. In Davis, the Court approved an Idaho terri-torial statute denying Mormons, polygamists, and advocates
of polygamy the right to vote and to hold office because, asthe Court construed the statute, it "simply excludes from the
privilege of voting, or of holding any office of honor, trust or
profit, those who have been convicted of certain offences, and
those who advocate a practical resistance to the laws of the
Territory and justify and approve the commission of crimes
forbidden by it." Id., at 347. To the extent Davis held that
persons advocating a certain practice may be denied the
right to vote, it is no longer good law. Brandenburg v. Ohio,
395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). To the extent it held that
the groups designated in the statute may be deprived of the
right to vote because of their status, its ruling could not
stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 337 (1972); cf.
United States v. Brown, 381 U. S. 437 (1965); United States
v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258 (1967). To the extent Davis held that
a convicted felon may be denied the right to vote, its holding
is not implicated by our decision and is unexceptionable.
See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U. S. 24 (1974).

A second and related point is that laws of the kind now
before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage
imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected. "[I]f the constitutional conception of `equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the very least
mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular
group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest."

Opinion of the Court
(1973). Even laws enacted for broad and ambitious pur-poses often can be explained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages theyimpose on certain persons. Amendment 2, however, in making a general announcement that gays and lesbians shall not
have any particular protections from the law, inflicts on themimmediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and

belie any legitimate justifications that may be claimed for it.We conclude that, in addition to the far-reaching deficiencies
of Amendment 2 that we have noted, the principles it of-fends, in another sense, are conventional and venerable; a
law must bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487
U. S. 450, 462 (1988), and Amendment 2 does not.

The primary rationale the State offers for Amendment 2
is respect for other citizens' freedom of association, and in
particular the liberties of landlords or employers who have
personal or religious objections to homosexuality. Colorado
also cites its interest in conserving resources to fight discrimination against other groups. The breadth of the
amendment is so far removed from these particular justifications that we find it impossible to credit them. We cannot
say that Amendment 2 is directed to any identifiable legitimate purpose or discrete objective. It is a status-based enactment divorced from any factual context from which we
could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests; it
is a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake,
something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.

the Fourteenth Amendment . . . ." Civil Rights Cases, 109

We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them
unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A
State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its
laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause,

and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado isaffirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court has mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit of spite.The constitutional amendment before us here is not the manifestation of a " `bare . . . desire to harm' " homosexuals, ante,at 634, but is rather a modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve traditional sexual mores againstthe efforts of a politically powerful minority to revise
those mores through use of the laws. That objective, andthe means chosen to achieve it, are not only unimpeachable under any constitutional doctrine hitherto pronounced(hence the opinion's heavy reliance upon principles of
righteousness rather than judicial holdings); they have beenspecifically approved by the Congress of the United States
and by this Court.In holding that homosexuality cannot be singled out for
disfavorable treatment, the Court contradicts a decision, unchallenged here, pronounced only 10 years ago, see Bowersv.

Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), and places the prestige
of this institution behind the proposition that opposition tohomosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias.

Whether it is or not is precisely the cultural debate that gaverise to the Colorado constitutional amendment (and to the
preferential laws against which the amendment was di-rected). Since the Constitution of the United States says
nothing about this subject, it is left to be resolved by normal
democratic means, including the democratic adoption of pro-visions in state constitutions. This Court has no business

imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by theelite class from which the Members of this institution are
selected, pronouncing that "animosity" toward homosexual-ity,

ante, at 634, is evil. I vigorously dissent.

I
Let me first discuss Part II of the Court's opinion, its long-est section, which is devoted to rejecting the State's arguments that Amendment 2 "puts gays and lesbians in thesame position as all other persons," and "does no more than
deny homosexuals special rights," ante, at 626. The Courtconcludes that this reading of Amendment 2's language is
"implausible" under the "authoritative construction" givenAmendment 2 by the Supreme Court of Colorado. Ibid.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court considers it unneces-sary to decide the validity of the State's argument that
Amendment 2 does not deprive homosexuals of the "protec-tion [afforded by] general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings."
Ante, at 630. I agree that we need not resolve that dispute,because the Supreme Court of Colorado has resolved it for

us. In the case below, 882 P. 2d 1335 (1994), the Coloradocourt stated:

"[I]t is significant to note that Colorado law currentlyproscribes discrimination against persons who are not
suspect classes, including discrimination based on age,$ 24-34-402(1)(a), 10A C. R. S. (1994 Supp.); marital or
family status, $ 24-34-502(1)(a), 10A C. R. S. (1994Supp.); veterans' status, $ 28-3-506, 11B C. R. S. (1989);
and for any legal, off-duty conduct such as smokingtobacco, $ 24-34-402.5, 10A C. R. S. (1994 Supp.).

Ofcourse Amendment 2 is not intended to have any effect

on this legislation, but seeks only to prevent the adop-tion of anti-discrimination laws intended to protect
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals." Id., at 1346, n. 9 (em-phasis added).

The Court utterly fails to distinguish this portion of the Col-orado court's opinion. Colorado Rev. Stat. $ 24-34-402.5
(Supp. 1995), which this passage authoritatively declares notto be affected by Amendment 2, was respondents' primary

Scalia, J., dissenting
example of a generally applicable law whose protectionswould be unavailable to homosexuals under Amendment 2.

See Brief for Respondents Evans et al. 11-12. The clearimport of the Colorado court's conclusion that it is not affected is that "general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination" would continue to prohibit discrimina-tion on the basis of homosexual conduct as well. This

analysis, which is fully in accord with (indeed, follows ines-capably from) the text of the constitutional provision, lays to
rest such horribles, raised in the course of oral argument, asthe prospect that assaults upon homosexuals could not be
prosecuted. The amendment prohibits special treatment of
homosexuals, and nothing more. It would not affect, for example, a requirement of state law that pensions be paid to
all retiring state employees with a certain length of service;
homosexual employees, as well as others, would be entitled
to that benefit. But it would prevent the State or any municipality from making death-benefit payments to the "life
partner" of a homosexual when it does not make such payments to the long-time roommate of a nonhomosexual employee. Or again, it does not affect the requirement of the
State's general insurance laws that customers be afforded
coverage without discrimination unrelated to anticipated
risk. Thus, homosexuals could not be denied coverage, or
charged a greater premium, with respect to auto collision
insurance; but neither the State nor any municipality could
require that distinctive health insurance risks associated
with homosexuality (if there are any) be ignored.

Despite all of its hand wringing about the potential effect
of Amendment 2 on general antidiscrimination laws, the
Court's opinion ultimately does not dispute all this, but assumes it to be true. See ante, at 630. The only denial of
equal treatment it contends homosexuals have suffered is
this: They may not obtain preferential treatment without
amending the State Constitution. That is to say, the principle underlying the Court's opinion is that one who is ac517US2$53K 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
corded equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readilyas others obtain

preferential treatment under the laws, has
been denied equal protection of the laws. If merely statingthis alleged "equal protection" violation does not suffice to

refute it, our constitutional jurisprudence has achieved terminal silliness.The central thesis of the Court's reasoning is that any

group is denied equal protection when, to obtain advantage(or, presumably, to avoid disadvantage), it must have recourse to a more general and hence more difficult level ofpolitical decisionmaking than others. The world has never
heard of such a principle, which is why the Court's opinion
is so long on emotive utterance and so short on relevant legal
citation. And it seems to me most unlikely that any multilevel democracy can function under such a principle. For
whenever a disadvantage is imposed, or conferral of a benefit
is prohibited, at one of the higher levels of democratic decisionmaking (i. e., by the state legislature rather than local
government, or by the people at large in the state constitution rather than the legislature), the affected group has
(under this theory) been denied equal protection. To take
the simplest of examples, consider a state law prohibiting
the award of municipal contracts to relatives of mayors or
city councilmen. Once such a law is passed, the group
composed of such relatives must, in order to get the benefit
of city contracts, persuade the state legislature--unlike all
other citizens, who need only persuade the municipality. It
is ridiculous to consider this a denial of equal protection,
which is why the Court's theory is unheard of.

The Court might reply that the example I have given is
not a denial of equal protection only because the same "rational basis" (avoidance of corruption) which renders constitutional the substantive discrimination against relatives
(i. e., the fact that they alone cannot obtain city contracts)
also automatically suffices to sustain what might be called
the electoral-procedural discrimination against them (i. e.,

640 ROMER v. EVANS

Scalia, J., dissenting
the fact that they must go to the state level to get thischanged). This is of course a perfectly reasonable response,

and would explain why "electoral-procedural discrimination"has not hitherto been heard of: A law that is valid in its
substance is automatically valid in its level of enactment.
But the Court cannot afford to make this argument, for as Ishall discuss next, there is no doubt of a rational basis for

the substance of the prohibition at issue here. The Court'sentire novel theory rests upon the proposition that there is
something special--something that cannot be justified bynormal "rational basis" analysis--in making a disadvantaged
group (or a nonpreferred group) resort to a higher decisionmaking level. That proposition finds no support in law or
logic.

II

I turn next to whether there was a legitimate rational
basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment--for
the prohibition of special protection for homosexuals.1 It is
unsurprising that the Court avoids discussion of this question, since the answer is so obviously yes. The case most
relevant to the issue before us today is not even mentioned
in the Court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186
(1986), we held that the Constitution does not prohibit what
virtually all States had done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years--making homosexual conduct a
crime. That holding is unassailable, except by those who

1 The Court evidently agrees that "rational basis"--the normal test for
compliance with the Equal Protection Clause--is the governing standard.
The trial court rejected respondents' argument that homosexuals constitute a "suspect" or "quasi-suspect" class, and respondents elected not to
appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court of Colorado. See 882 P. 2d 1335,
1341, n. 3 (1994). And the Court implicitly rejects the Supreme Court of
Colorado's holding, Evans v. Romer, 854 P. 2d 1270, 1282 (1993), that
Amendment 2 infringes upon a "fundamental right" of "independently
identifiable class[es]" to "participate equally in the political process." See
ante, at 625.

think that the Constitution changes to suit current fashions.But in any event it is a given in the present case: Respondents' briefs did not urge overruling Bowers, and at oral argu-ment respondents' counsel expressly disavowed any intent to
seek such overruling, Tr. of Oral Arg. 53. If it is constitutionally permissible for a State to make homosexual conductcriminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for a State

to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct.(As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
has aptly put it: "If the Court [in Bowers] was unwilling toobject to state laws that criminalize the behavior that defines the class, it is hardly open . . . to conclude that state
sponsored discrimination against the class is invidious.
After all, there can hardly be more palpable discrimination
against a class than making the conduct that defines the class
criminal." Padula v. Webster, 822 F. 2d 97, 103 (1987).)
And a fortiori it is constitutionally permissible for a State
to adopt a provision not even disfavoring homosexual conduct, but merely prohibiting all levels of state government
from bestowing special protections upon homosexual conduct. Respondents (who, unlike the Court, cannot afford the
luxury of ignoring inconvenient precedent) counter Bowers
with the argument that a greater-includes-the-lesser rationale cannot justify Amendment 2's application to individuals
who do not engage in homosexual acts, but are merely of
homosexual "orientation." Some Courts of Appeals have
concluded that, with respect to laws of this sort at least, that
is a distinction without a difference. See Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. v. Cincinnati, 54 F. 3d 261,
267 (CA6 1995) ("[F]or purposes of these proceedings, it is
virtually impossible to distinguish or separate individuals of
a particular orientation which predisposes them toward a
particular sexual conduct from those who actually engage in
that particular type of sexual conduct"); Steffan v. Perry, 41
F. 3d 677, 689-690 (CADC 1994). The Supreme Court of
Colorado itself appears to be of this view. See 882 P. 2d, at

642 ROMER v. EVANS

Scalia, J., dissenting
1349-1350 ("Amendment 2 targets this class of persons basedon four characteristics: sexual orientation; conduct; practices,

and relationships. Each characteristic provides a poten-tially different way of identifying that class of persons who
are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. These four characteristics are
not truly severable from one another because each providesnothing more than a different way of identifying

the same
class of persons") (emphasis added).But assuming that, in Amendment 2, a person of homosexual "orientation" is someone who does not engage in homo-sexual conduct but merely has a tendency or desire to do
so, Bowers still suffices to establish a rational basis for the
provision. If it is rational to criminalize the conduct, surely
it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those
with a self-avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct. Indeed, where criminal sanctions are not involved,
homosexual "orientation" is an acceptable stand-in for homosexual conduct. A State "does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its
laws are imperfect," Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471,
485 (1970). Just as a policy barring the hiring of methadone
users as transit employees does not violate equal protection
simply because some methadone users pose no threat to passenger safety, see New York City Transit Authority v.
Beazer, 440 U. S. 568 (1979), and just as a mandatory retirement age of 50 for police officers does not violate equal protection even though it prematurely ends the careers of many
policemen over 50 who still have the capacity to do the job,
see Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U. S.
307 (1976) (per curiam), Amendment 2 is not constitutionally
invalid simply because it could have been drawn more precisely so as to withdraw special antidiscrimination protections only from those of homosexual "orientation" who actually engage in homosexual conduct. As Justice Kennedy
wrote, when he was on the Court of Appeals, in a case involving discharge of homosexuals from the Navy: "Nearly any

statute which classifies people may be irrational as appliedin particular cases. Discharge of the particular plaintiffs

before us would be rational, under minimal scrutiny, notbecause their particular cases present the dangers which
justify Navy policy, but instead because the general policyof discharging all homosexuals is rational."

Beller v. Mid-dendorf, 632 F. 2d 788, 808-809, n. 20 (CA9 1980) (citation

omitted). See also Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881 F. 2d 454,464 (CA7 1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1004 (1990).

Moreover, even if the provision regarding homosexual"orientation" were invalid, respondents' challenge to Amendment 2--which is a facial challenge--must fail. "A facialchallenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult
challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger mustestablish that no set of circumstances exists under which the
Act would be valid." United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.739, 745 (1987). It would not be enough for respondents to
establish (if they could) that Amendment 2 is unconstitu-tional as applied to those of homosexual "orientation"; since,
under Bowers, Amendment 2 is unquestionably constitu-tional as applied to those who engage in homosexual conduct,
the facial challenge cannot succeed. Some individuals ofhomosexual "orientation" who do not engage in homosexual
acts might successfully bring an as-applied challenge toAmendment 2, but so far as the record indicates, none of
the respondents is such a person. See App. 4-5 (complaintdescribing each of the individual respondents as either "a
gay man" or "a lesbian").2

2 The Supreme Court of Colorado stated: "We hold that the portions of
Amendment 2 that would remain if only the provision concerning sexual
orientation were stricken are not autonomous and thus, not severable,"
882 P. 2d, at 1349. That statement was premised, however, on the proposition that "[the] four characteristics [described in the Amendment--sexual orientation, conduct, practices, and relationships] are not truly severable from one another because each provides nothing more than a different
way of identifying the same class of persons." Id., at 1349-1350 (emphasis added). As I have discussed above, if that premise is true--if the

The foregoing suffices to establish what the Court's failureto cite any case remotely in point would lead one to suspect:

No principle set forth in the Constitution, nor even any imag-ined by this Court in the past 200 years, prohibits what Colorado has done here. But the case for Colorado is muchstronger than that. What it has done is not only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable, with close, congressionallyapproved precedent in earlier constitutional practice.

First, as to its eminent reasonableness. The Court's opin-ion contains grim, disapproving hints that Coloradans have
been guilty of "animus" or "animosity" toward homosexual-ity, as though that has been established as un-American. Of
course it is our moral heritage that one should not hate anyhuman being or class of human beings. But I had thought
that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible--mur-der, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals--and
could exhibit even "animus" toward such conduct. Surelythat is the only sort of "animus" at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct, the same sort of moral disap-proval that produced the centuries-old criminal laws that we
held constitutional in Bowers. The Colorado amendmentdoes not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favoredfor many reasons--for example, because they are senior citizens or members of racial minorities. But it prohibits giv-ing them favored status because of their homosexual conduct--that is, it prohibits favored status for homosexuality.But though Coloradans are, as I say,

entitled to be hostiletoward homosexual conduct, the fact is that the degree of

hostility reflected by Amendment 2 is the smallest conceiventire class affected by the Amendment takes part in homosexual conduct,
practices, and relationships--Bowers alone suffices to answer all constitutional objections. Separate consideration of persons of homosexual
"orientation" is necessary only if one believes (as the Supreme Court of
Colorado did not) that that is a distinct class.

able. The Court's portrayal of Coloradans as a society fallenvictim to pointless, hate-filled "gay-bashing" is so false as to

be comical. Colorado not only is one of the 25 States thathave repealed their antisodomy laws, but was among the first
to do so. See 1971 Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 121, $ 1. But the
society that eliminates criminal punishment for homosexualacts does not necessarily abandon the view that homosexuality is morally wrong and socially harmful; often, abolitionsimply reflects the view that enforcement of such criminal
laws involves unseemly intrusion into the intimate lives ofcitizens. Cf. Brief for Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae in Bowers v. Hardwick,
O. T. 1985, No. 85-140, p. 25, n. 21 (antisodomy statutes are
"unenforceable by any but the most offensive snooping and
wasteful allocation of law enforcement resources"); Kadish,
The Crisis of Overcriminalization, 374 The Annals of the
American Academy of Political and Social Science 157, 161
(1967) ("To obtain evidence [in sodomy cases], police are
obliged to resort to behavior which tends to degrade and
demean both themselves personally and law enforcement as
an institution").

There is a problem, however, which arises when criminal
sanction of homosexuality is eliminated but moral and social
disapprobation of homosexuality is meant to be retained.
The Court cannot be unaware of that problem; it is evident
in many cities of the country, and occasionally bubbles to the
surface of the news, in heated political disputes over such
matters as the introduction into local schools of books teaching that homosexuality is an optional and fully acceptable
"alternative life style." The problem (a problem, that is, for
those who wish to retain social disapprobation of homosexuality) is that, because those who engage in homosexual conduct tend to reside in disproportionate numbers in certain
communities, see Record, Exh. MMM, have high disposable
income, see ibid.; App. 254 (affidavit of Prof. James Hunter),
and, of course, care about homosexual-rights issues much

Scalia, J., dissenting
more ardently than the public at large, they possess political
power much greater than their numbers, both locally and
statewide. Quite understandably, they devote this political
power to achieving not merely a grudging social toleration,
but full social acceptance, of homosexuality. See, e. g., Jacobs, The Rhetorical Construction of Rights: The Case of the
Gay Rights Movement, 1969-1991, 72 Neb. L. Rev. 723, 724
(1993) ("[T]he task of gay rights proponents is to move the
center of public discourse along a continuum from the rhetoric of disapprobation, to rhetoric of tolerance, and finally to
affirmation").

By the time Coloradans were asked to vote on Amendment
2, their exposure to homosexuals' quest for social endorsement was not limited to newspaper accounts of happenings
in places such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Key West. Three Colorado cities--Aspen, Boulder, and
Denver--had enacted ordinances that listed "sexual orientation" as an impermissible ground for discrimination, equating
the moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and
religious bigotry. See Aspen Municipal Code $ 13-98 (1977);
Boulder Rev. Municipal Code $$ 12-1-1 to 12-1-11 (1987);
Denver Rev. Municipal Code, Art. IV, $$ 28-91 to 28-116
(1991). The phenomenon had even appeared statewide: The
Governor of Colorado had signed an executive order pronouncing that "in the State of Colorado we recognize the
diversity in our pluralistic society and strive to bring an end
to discrimination in any form," and directing state agencyheads to "ensure non-discrimination" in hiring and promotion
based on, among other things, "sexual orientation." Executive Order No. D0035 (Dec. 10, 1990). I do not mean to be
critical of these legislative successes; homosexuals are as
entitled to use the legal system for reinforcement of their
moral sentiments as is the rest of society. But they are
subject to being countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as well.

That is where Amendment 2 came in. It sought to coun-ter both the geographic concentration and the disproportionate political power of homosexuals by (1) resolving thecontroversy at the statewide level, and (2) making the election a single-issue contest for both sides. It put directly, to
all the citizens of the State, the question: Should homosexu-ality be given special protection? They answered no. The

Court today asserts that this most democratic of proceduresis unconstitutional. Lacking any cases to establish that
facially absurd proposition, it simply asserts that it mustbe unconstitutional, because it has never happened before.

"[Amendment 2] identifies persons by a single trait andthen denies them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of persons from theright to seek specific protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence. The absence of precedentfor Amendment 2 is itself instructive . . . .

"It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact
laws of this sort. Central both to the idea of the ruleof law and to our own Constitution's guarantee of equal

protection is the principle that government and each ofits parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek
its assistance." Ante, at 633.
As I have noted above, this is proved false every time a state
law prohibiting or disfavoring certain conduct is passed, be-cause such a law prevents the adversely affected group--

whether drug addicts, or smokers, or gun owners, or motor-cyclists--from changing the policy thus established in "each
of [the] parts" of the State. What the Court says is even
demonstrably false at the constitutional level. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, for example,
deprived those who drank alcohol not only of the power
to alter the policy of prohibition locally or through state
legislation, but even of the power to alter it through state
constitutional amendment or federal legislation. The

Establishment Clause of the First Amendment preventstheocrats from having their way by converting their fellow

citizens at the local, state, or federal statutory level; asdoes the Republican Form of Government Clause prevent
monarchists.

But there is a much closer analogy, one that involves pre-cisely the effort by the majority of citizens to preserve its

view of sexual morality statewide, against the efforts of ageographically concentrated and politically powerful minority to undermine it. The Constitutions of the States of Ari-zona, Idaho, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah

to this day
contain provisions stating that polygamy is "forever prohibited." See Ariz. Const., Art. XX, par. 2; Idaho Const., Art.
I, $ 4; N. M. Const., Art. XXI, $ 1; Okla. Const., Art. I, $ 2;
Utah Const., Art. III, $ 1. Polygamists, and those who have
a polygamous "orientation," have been "singled out" by these
provisions for much more severe treatment than merely
denial of favored status; and that treatment can only be
changed by achieving amendment of the state constitutions.
The Court's disposition today suggests that these provisions
are unconstitutional, and that polygamy must be permitted
in these States on a state-legislated, or perhaps even localoption, basis--unless, of course, polygamists for some reason
have fewer constitutional rights than homosexuals.

The United States Congress, by the way, required the inclusion of these antipolygamy provisions in the Constitutions
of Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah, as a condition
of their admission to statehood. See Arizona Enabling Act,
36 Stat. 569; New Mexico Enabling Act, 36 Stat. 558; Oklahoma Enabling Act, 34 Stat. 269; Utah Enabling Act, 28 Stat.
108. (For Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, moreover, the
Enabling Acts required that the antipolygamy provisions be
"irrevocable without the consent of the United States and
the people of said State"--so that not only were "each of
[the] parts" of these States not "open on impartial terms"
to polygamists, but even the States as a whole were not;

polygamists would have to persuade the whole country totheir way of thinking.) Idaho adopted the constitutional

provision on its own, but the 51st Congress, which admittedIdaho into the Union, found its Constitution to be "republican
in form and . . . in conformity with the Constitution of the
United States." Act of Admission of Idaho, 26 Stat. 215 (em-phasis added). Thus, this "singling out" of the sexual practices of a single group for statewide, democratic vote--soutterly alien to our constitutional system, the Court would
have us believe--has not only happened, but has received theexplicit approval of the United States Congress.

I cannot say that this Court has explicitly approved any ofthese state constitutional provisions; but it has approved a
territorial statutory provision that went even further, depriving polygamists of the ability even to achieve a constitu-tional amendment, by depriving them of the power to vote.

In Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), Justice Field wrotefor a unanimous Court:

"In our judgment, $ 501 of the Revised Statutes of IdahoTerritory, which provides that `no person . . . who is a
bigamist or polygamist or who teaches, advises, coun-sels, or encourages any person or persons to become bigamists or polygamists, or to commit any other crime de-fined by law, or to enter into what is known as plural
or celestial marriage, or who is a member of any order,organization or association which teaches, advises, counsels, or encourages its members or devotees or any other
persons to commit the crime of bigamy or polygamy, orany other crime defined by law . . . is permitted to vote

at any election, or to hold any position or office of honor,
trust, or profit within this Territory,' is not open to any
constitutional or legal objection." Id., at 346-347 (emphasis added).

of adverse consequences upon mere abstract advocacy of po517US2$53K 02-07-99 18:56:56 PAGES OPINPGT

lygamy, it has, of course, been overruled by later cases. SeeBrandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam).

But the proposition that polygamy can be criminalized, andthose engaging in that crime deprived of the vote, remains
good law. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U. S. 24, 53(1974).

Beason rejected the argument that "such discrimi-nation is a denial of the equal protection of the laws." Brief

for Appellant in Davis v. Beason, O. T. 1889, No. 1261, p. 41.Among the Justices joining in that rejection were the two
whose views in other cases the Court today treats as equalprotection lodestars--Justice Harlan, who was to proclaim
in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (dissentingopinion), that the Constitution "neither knows nor tolerates
classes among citizens," quoted ante, at 623, and JusticeBradley, who had earlier declared that "class legislation . . .
[is] obnoxious to the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amend-ment,"

Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 24 (1883), quoted ante,at 635.

3 The Court labors mightily to get around Beason, see ante, at 634, but
cannot escape the central fact that this Court found the statute at issue--
which went much further than Amendment 2, denying polygamists not
merely special treatment but the right to vote--"not open to any constitutional or legal objection," rejecting the appellant's argument (much like
the argument of respondents today) that the statute impermissibly "single[d] him out," Brief for Appellant in Davis v. Beason, O. T. 1889, No.
1261, p. 41. The Court adopts my conclusions that (a) insofar as Beason
permits the imposition of adverse consequences based upon mere advocacy, it has been overruled by subsequent cases, and (b) insofar as Beason
holds that convicted felons may be denied the right to vote, it remains
good law. To these conclusions, it adds something new: the claim that
"[t]o the extent [Beason] held that the groups designated in the statute
may be deprived of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling
could not stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome." Ante, at 634. But if that is so, it is only because we have declared the right to vote to be a "fundamental political right," see, e. g.,
Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336 (1972), deprivation of which triggers
strict scrutiny. Amendment 2, of course, does not deny the fundamental
right to vote, and the Court rejects the Colorado court's view that there
exists a fundamental right to participate in the political process. Strict
scrutiny is thus not in play here. See ante, at 631. Finally, the Court's

Scalia, J., dissenting
This Court cited Beason with approval as recently as 1993,in an opinion authored by the same Justice who writes for

the Court today. That opinion said: "[A]dverse impact willnot always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting. For
example, a social harm may have been a legitimate concernof government for reasons quite apart from discrimination. . . . See, e. g., . . . Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890)."
Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S.520, 535 (1993). It remains to be explained how $ 501 of the

Idaho Revised Statutes was not an "impermissible target-ing" of polygamists, but (the much more mild) Amendment
2 is an "impermissible targeting" of homosexuals. Has theCourt concluded that the perceived social harm of polygamy
is a "legitimate concern of government," and the perceivedsocial harm of homosexuality is not?

IV
I strongly suspect that the answer to the last question isyes, which leads me to the last point I wish to make: The

Court today, announcing that Amendment 2 "defies . . . con-ventional [constitutional] inquiry," ante, at 632, and "confounds [the] normal process of judicial review," ante, at 633,employs a constitutional theory heretofore unknown to frustrate Colorado's reasonable effort to preserve traditionalAmerican moral values. The Court's stern disapproval of
"animosity" towards homosexuality might be compared withwhat an earlier Court (including the revered Justices Harlan
and Bradley) said in Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U. S. 15 (1885),rejecting a constitutional challenge to a United States statute that denied the franchise in federal territories to thosewho engaged in polygamous cohabitation:

"[C]ertainly no legislation can be supposed more whole-some and necessary in the founding of a free, selfsuggestion that $ 501 of the Revised Statutes of Idaho, and Amendment 2,
deny rights on account of "status" (rather than conduct) opens up a
broader debate involving the significance of Bowers to this case, a debate
which the Court is otherwise unwilling to join, see supra, at 640-643.

to establish it on the basis of the idea of the family, asconsisting in and springing from the union for life of one
man and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our
civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent moralitywhich is the source of all beneficent progress in social
and political improvement." Id., at 45.
I would not myself indulge in such official praise for hetero-sexual monogamy, because I think it no business of the

courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides inthis culture war.

But the Court today has done so, not only by inventinga novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine to take the
victory away from traditional forces, but even by verballydisparaging as bigotry adherence to traditional attitudes.
To suggest, for example, that this constitutional amendmentsprings from nothing more than " `a bare . . . desire to harm
a politically unpopular group,' " ante, at 634, quoting Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534 (1973),is nothing short of insulting. (It is also nothing short of

preposterous to call "politically unpopular" a group whichenjoys enormous influence in American media and politics,
and which, as the trial court here noted, though composingno more than 4% of the population had the support of 46% of
the voters on Amendment 2, see App. to Pet. for Cert. C-18.)When the Court takes sides in the culture wars, it tends
to be with the knights rather than the villeins--and morespecifically with the Templars, reflecting the views and values of the lawyer class from which the Court's Members aredrawn. How that class feels about homosexuality will be
evident to anyone who wishes to interview job applicants atvirtually any of the Nation's law schools. The interviewer
may refuse to offer a job because the applicant is a Republi-can; because he is an adulterer; because he went to the wrong

prep school or belongs to the wrong country club; because heeats snails; because he is a womanizer; because she wears

real-animal fur; or even because he hates the Chicago Cubs.But if the interviewer should wish not to be an associate or
partner of an applicant because he disapproves of the appli-cant's homosexuality,

then he will have violated the pledgewhich the Association of American Law Schools requires all

its member schools to exact from job interviewers: "assur-ance of the employer's willingness" to hire homosexuals.
Bylaws of the Association of American Law Schools, Inc.$ 6-4(b); Executive Committee Regulations of the Association of American Law Schools $ 6.19, in 1995 Handbook, As-sociation of American Law Schools. This law-school view of
what "prejudices" must be stamped out may be contrastedwith the more plebeian attitudes that apparently still prevail
in the United States Congress, which has been unresponsiveto repeated attempts to extend to homosexuals the protections of federal civil rights laws, see, e. g., Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1994, S. 2238, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.
(1994); Civil Rights Amendments of 1975, H. R. 5452, 94thCong., 1st Sess. (1975), and which took the pains to exclude
them specifically from the Americans with Disabilities Actof 1990, see 42 U. S. C. $ 12211(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

* * *
Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitu-tional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado

have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which doesnot even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but
merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not onlyan appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means
that Americans have employed before. Striking it downis an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will. I

HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 95-232. Argued March 19, 1996--Decided May 20, 1996
Petitioner Henderson filed this suit under the Suits in Admiralty Act for

injuries he received as a seaman aboard a vessel owned by the United
States. He accomplished service on the United States in the manner
and within the time allowed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, which
sets an extendable 120-day period for service. Service on the Attorney
General occurred 47 days after the complaint was filed, but service on
the United States Attorney, though timely under Rule 4's extendable
deadline, took 148 days. The United States moved to dismiss the
action, arguing that although the time and manner of service satisfied
Rule 4's requirements, Henderson had failed to serve process "forthwith" as required by $ 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act. The District
Court dismissed Henderson's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, based on Circuit precedent holding that $ 2's service "forthwith"
requirement conditions the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity
and is therefore a jurisdictional prerequisite. The Court of Appeals
affirmed.

Held: The Suits in Admiralty Act's "forthwith" instruction for service of

process has been superseded by Rule 4. Pp. 661-672.

(a) Rule 4's regime conflicts irreconcilably with $ 2's service "forthwith" instruction. The Federal Rules convey a clear message that complaints are not to be dismissed if served within 120 days, or within such
additional time as the court may allow, but $ 2's "forthwith" instruction
is indicative of a far shorter time. The Government urges that the conflict dissolves if one reads Rule 4 as establishing not an affirmative right
to serve a complaint within 120 days, but an outer boundary for timely
service. Reading Rule 4 in its historical context, however, leads to the
conclusion that the 120-day provision operates as an irreducible allowance. Pp. 661-663.

(b) In the Rules Enabling Act, Congress ordered that, in matters of
"practice and procedure," 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(a), the Federal Rules shall
govern, and "[a]ll laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further
force or effect," $ 2072(b). Correspondingly, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 82 provides that the Rules cannot be construed to extend or limit
federal jurisdiction. Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act contains a

broad waiver of sovereign immunity in its first sentence, but this does
not mean, as the United States asserts, that $ 2 in its entirety is "jurisdictional." Several of $ 2's provisions, notably its generous venue and
transfer provisions, as well as its service provision, are not sensibly
typed "substantive" or "jurisdictional." Instead, they have a distinctly
facilitative, "procedural" cast, dealing with case processing, not substantive rights or consent to suit. The service "forthwith" prescription is
not made "substantive" or "jurisdictional" by its inclusion--along with
broad venue choices--in $ 2. The prescription is best characterized as
a rule of procedure, of the kind Rule 4 supersedes. A plaintiff like
Henderson, on commencement of an action under the Suits in Admiralty
Act, must resort to Rule 4 for instructions on service of process. In
that Rule, one finds instructions governing, inter alia, form and issuance of the summons, service of the summons together with the complaint, who may serve process, and proof of service. The Rule also
describes how service shall or may be effected on various categories of
defendants. It is uncontested that all these prescriptions apply in Suits
in Admiralty Act cases, just as they apply in other federal cases. There
is no reason why the prescription governing time for service is not, as
is the whole of Rule 4, a nonjurisdictional rule governing "practice and
procedure" in federal cases, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(a), consistent with the
Rules Enabling Act and Rule 82, and rendering provisions like the Suits
in Admiralty Act's service "forthwith" requirement "of no further force
or effect," $ 2072(b). Pp. 663-672.

656 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the period allowed for service of proc-ess in a civil action commenced by a seaman injured aboard

a vessel owned by the United States. Recovery in suchcases is governed by the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C.
App. $ 741 et seq., which broadly waives the Government'ssovereign immunity. See $ 742 (money judgments); $ 743
(costs and interest). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure allows 120 days to effect service of the summons
and timely filed complaint, a period extendable by the court.The Suits in Admiralty Act, however, instructs that service
shall be made "forthwith." $ 742. The question presentedis whether the Act's "forthwith" instruction for service of
process has been superseded by the Federal Rule.In the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2071

et seq., Con-gress ordered that, in matters of "practice and procedure,"

$ 2072(a), the Federal Rules shall govern, and "[a]ll laws inconflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect,"

$ 2072(b). We hold that, in actions arising under federal law,commenced in compliance with the governing statute of limitations, the manner and timing of serving process are gener-ally nonjurisdictional matters of "procedure" controlled by
the Federal Rules. I

On August 27, 1991, petitioner Lloyd Henderson, a mer-chant mariner, was injured while working aboard a vessel
owned and operated by the United States. On April 8, 1993,after exhausting administrative remedies, Henderson filed a
seaman's personal injury action against the United States,pursuant to the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, as
amended, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 741 et seq.1 Under that Act,

1 Henderson's complaint also invoked the Public Vessels Act, 43 Stat.
1112, as amended, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 781 et seq. The Government maintains, however, that Henderson's suit falls under the exclusive governance
of the Suits in Admiralty Act, because his claim arose from employment
aboard a Maritime Administration vessel. See Brief for United States 8,

Opinion of the Court
suits of the kind Henderson commenced "may be brought . . .within two years after the cause of action arises." $ 745.

Henderson brought his action well within that time period.He commenced suit, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3
instructs, simply "by filing a complaint with the court." 2Having timely filed his complaint, Henderson attempted to
follow the Federal Rules on service. It is undisputed thatthe following Rules, and nothing in the Suits in Admiralty
Act, furnished the immediately relevant instructions. Fed-eral Rule of Civil Procedure 4(a) (1988) provided: "Upon the
filing of the complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a sum-mons and deliver the summons to the plaintiff or the plaintiff 's attorney, who shall be responsible for prompt serv-ice of the summons and a copy of the complaint." Rule
4(b) provided: "The summons shall be signed by the clerk,[and] be under the seal of the court." Rule 4(d) stated: "The
summons and complaint shall be served together." 3A series of slips occurred in obtaining the summons
required by Rule 4. Henderson's counsel requested the ap-propriate summons forms and file-stamped copies of the
complaint on April 8, 1993, the day he filed Henderson's
n. 9 (citing 57 Stat. 45, as amended, 50 U. S. C. App. $ 1291(a) (1988 ed.)).
Henderson apparently does not contest this assertion. In any case, claims
under both Acts proceed the same way. See 46 U. S. C. App. $ 782 (suits
under the Public Vessels Act "shall be subject to and proceed in accordance with the provisions" of the Suits in Admiralty Act).

2 In a suit on a right created by federal law, filing a complaint suffices to

satisfy the statute of limitations. See West v. Conrail, 481 U. S. 35, 39
(1987). In a federal-court suit on a state-created right, however, a plaintiff must serve process before the statute of limitations has run, if state
law so requires for a similar state-court suit. See Walker v. Armco Steel
Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 752-753 (1980) (reaffirming Ragan v. Merchants
Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949)). But cf. Hanna v.
Plumer, 380 U. S. 460 (1965) (method of service, as distinguished from time
period for commencement of civil action, is governed by Federal Rules in
all actions, including suits based on state-created rights).

3 The substance of these provisions is retained in current Rules 4(a), (b),

and (c)(1).

complaint. But the court clerk did not respond immediately.Counsel eventually obtained the forms on April 21, 1993, and

completed and returned them to the clerk. On May 4, coun-sel received the summons mailed to him from the clerk's office, and on May 19, counsel sent the summons and complaint,by certified mail, to the Attorney General,

4 who received

them on May 25.Service on the local United States Attorney took longer.

On May 25, Henderson's counsel forwarded the summons andcomplaint, as received from the clerk, to a "constable" with
a request to effect service. On June 1, the constable's officereturned the documents, informing Henderson's counsel that
the summons was not in proper form, because it lacked thecourt's seal. Counsel thereupon wrote to the court clerk
requesting new summons forms with the appropriate courtseal. Counsel repeated this request on August 19; ultimately, on August 25, Henderson's counsel received the prop-erly sealed summons.

Once again, Henderson's counsel requested the constable'sservice and, on August 30, moved for an extension of time to
serve the United States Attorney.5 The court granted themotion, extending the time for service until September 15.
The United States Attorney received personal service of thesummons and complaint, in proper form, on September 3,
1993.

4 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(4), effective at that time, instructed that "a copy of the summons and of the complaint [be sent] by
registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States
at Washington, District of Columbia." The same instruction currently
appears in Rule 4(i)(1)(B).

5 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(j), then in force, provided for service

of the summons and complaint within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, a time limit subject to extension for good cause. The substance of
this provision is retained in current Rule 4(m), which permits a district
court to enlarge the time for service "even if there is no good cause
shown." Advisory Committee's Notes on 1993 Amendments to Fed. Rule

Opinion of the Court
Thus, the Attorney General received the complaint 47 daysafter Henderson filed suit, and the United States Attorney

was personally served 148 days after Henderson commencedthe action by filing his complaint with the court. On November 17, 1993, the United States moved to dismiss theaction. The grounds for, and disposition of, that motion led
to Henderson's petition for certiorari.The United States has never maintained that it lacked notice of Henderson's complaint within the 2-year limitationperiod prescribed for Suits in Admiralty Act claims. See 46
U. S. C. App. $ 745; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-39 (counsel for UnitedStates acknowledged that service on Attorney General gave
Government actual notice three months before 2-year limita-tion period ended).

6 Nor has the Government asserted any

prejudice to the presentation of its defense stemming fromthe delayed service of the summons and complaint. And the

manner and timing of service, it appears beyond debate, sat-isfied the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
4 (titled "Summons" and detailing prescriptions on serviceof process).

In support of its motion to dismiss, the United Statesrelied exclusively on $ 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46
U. S. C. App. $ 742, which provides in part:

"The libelant [plaintiff] shall forthwith serve a copy ofhis libel [complaint] on the United States attorney for

[the] district [where suit is brought] and mail a copythereof by registered mail to the Attorney General of
the United States."
This provision has remained unchanged since its enactmentin 1920, 18 years before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

became effective, and 46 years before admiralty cases werebrought within the realm of the Civil Rules. The Government argued that Henderson's failure to serve process

6 In any event, the filing of the complaint within the limitation period
rendered the action timely. See supra, at 657, n. 2.

660 HENDERSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"forthwith," as required by $ 742, deprived the DistrictCourt of subject-matter jurisdiction because $ 742 describes

the conditions of the United States' waiver of sovereignimmunity.

The District Court initially denied the Government's mo-tion, but reconsidered the matter based on an intervening
Fifth Circuit decision, United States v. Holmberg, 19 F. 3d1062, cert. denied, 513 U. S. 986 (1994). The court in

Holm-berg, agreeing with the United States, held that the $ 742

service "forthwith" requirement "is a condition of the Gov-ernment's waiver of sovereign immunity and, thus, a jurisdictional prerequisite." 19 F. 3d, at 1064. In so ruling, the
Holmberg court rejected the argument that service of proc-ess under the Suits in Admiralty Act, as in the generality of

cases arising and timely filed under federal law, is a matterof procedure, now governed by the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.Bound by Holmberg, the District Court dismissed Henderson's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, andthe Court of Appeals, adhering to

Holmberg, affirmed. 51F. 3d 574 (CA5 1995).
7 We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among lower courts on the question whether Fed-eral Rule 4, which authorizes an extendable 120-day period

for service of process, supersedes the Suits in Admiralty Actprovision that service on the United States be made
"forthwith." 8

7 The Holmberg court "agree[d] that there has been no uniform definition of forthwith," as that term is used in $ 742, 19 F. 3d, at 1065, and the
Court of Appeals in the instant case took no position on whether service
on the Attorney General 47 days after commencement of the action could
count as "forthwith." 51 F. 3d, at 577. The court held, however, that the
"forthwith" requirement applies to service on both officers--the United
States Attorney and the Attorney General--and stated that "completing
service in 148 days [through service on the United States Attorney] is not
forthwith." Id., at 576.

Opinion of the Court

II
The United States first suggests that Rule 4's extendable120-day time prescription, and the Suits in Admiralty Act's

service "forthwith" instruction, can and should be read har-moniously. The Rule 4 time limit for service, Rule 4( j) at
the time Henderson's action commenced,9 provided:

"( j) Summons: Time Limit for Service. If a serviceof the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaintand the party on whose behalf such service was required
cannot show good cause why such service was not madewithin that period, the action shall be dismissed as to
that defendant . . . ." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4( j) (1988).
Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 742,prescribes service "forthwith," see

supra, at 659, a word notprecisely defined in the Act or in case law, but indicative

of a time far shorter than 120 days. The apparent conflictdissolves, the Government urges, if one reads Rule 4 as establishing not "an affirmative right to serve [a] complaint"within 120 days, but only an outer boundary for timely service. See Brief for United States 14, 18, 26; Tr. of Oral Arg.28, 30.

We reject the Government's view of the time the FederalRules authorize for service. Reading Rule 4 in its historical context, we conclude that the 120-day provision operatesnot as an outer limit subject to reduction, but as an irreducible allowance. Prior to 1983, Rule 4 contained no timelimit for service. Until the changes installed that year,

Opinion of the Court
United States marshals attended to service. The relevantRule 4 provisions read:

"(a) Summons: issuance. Upon the filing of the com-plaint the clerk shall forthwith issue a summons and deliver it for service to the marshal or to any other personauthorized by Rule 4(c) to serve it. . . .

. . . . .
"(c) By whom served. Service of process shall be
made by a United States marshal, by his deputy, or bysome person specially appointed by the court for that

purpose . . . ." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(a), (c) (1980).
Marshals were expected to effect service expeditiously, and
Rule 41(b), providing for dismissal "[f]or failure of the plain-tiff to prosecute," could be invoked as a check against unreasonable delay. See 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2370, pp. 374-376 (2d ed. 1995); 2 J.Moore, Moore's Federal Practice || 4.18, p. 436 (2d ed. 1995).

Rule 4 changes made operative in 1983 completed a shiftin responsibility for service from the United States marshals
to the plaintiff. See Mullenix, Hope Over Experience: Mandatory Informal Discovery and the Politics of Rulemaking,
69 N. C. L. Rev. 795, 845 (1991). With marshals no longer
available as routine process servers, the Judicial Conference
considered a time control necessary; the Conference proposed, and this Court approved, 120 days from the filing of
the complaint as the appropriate limit. Congress relaxed
the rule change by authorizing an extension of the 120-day
period if the party responsible for service showed "good
cause." See supra, at 661; 128 Cong. Rec. 30931-30932
(1982), reprinted in 28 U. S. C. App., p. 647.

Most recently, in 1993 amendments to the Rules, courts
have been accorded discretion to enlarge the 120-day period
"even if there is no good cause shown." See Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4, 28 U. S. C. App.,

p. 654.10 And tellingly, the text of Rule 4 sets out, as "[a]specific instance of good cause," ibid., allowance of "a reasonable time" to "cur[e] the failure to serve multiple officers . . .of the United States if the plaintiff has effected service on
either the United States attorney or the Attorney General"within the prescribed 120 days. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(i)(3).

The Federal Rules thus convey a clear message: Com-plaints are not to be dismissed if served within 120 days, or
within such additional time as the court may allow. Fur-thermore, the United States acknowledges that, $ 2 of the
Suits in Admiralty Act aside, Rule 4's extendable 120-daytime prescription applies to the full range of civil litigation,
including cases brought against the United States under theFederal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2675, and the Tucker
Act, ch. 359, 24 Stat. 505 (1887) (current version 28 U. S. C.$$ 1346, 1491 and other scattered sections of 28 U. S. C.).
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. We are therefore satisfied that Rule4's regime conflicts irreconcilably with Suits in Admiralty
Act $ 2's service "forthwith" instruction, and we turn to thedispositive question: Does the Rule supersede the inconsistent statutory direction?

The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2071 et seq., author-izes the Supreme Court "to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure . . . for cases in the United States districtcourts . . . and courts of appeals," $ 2072(a), and directs:

10 Rule 4(m), captioned "Time Limit for Service," currently provides:
"If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant
within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion
or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action
without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected
within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for
the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate
period. . . ." (Emphasis added.)

Opinion of the Court
"Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify anysubstantive right. All laws in conflict with such rules

shall be of no further force or effect after such ruleshave taken effect." $ 2072(b).

Correspondingly, and in confirmation of the understandingand practice under the former Federal Equity Rules, Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 82 provides: "[The Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure] shall not be construed to extend or limit the
jurisdiction of the United States district courts or the venueof actions therein." See 1937 Advisory Committee's Notes
on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 82, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 821 (Rule 82confirms that the Rules' broad allowance of claim joinder
"does not extend federal jurisdiction."); see also 12 Wright &Miller,

supra, $ 3141, at 210-214.According to the United States, Rule 4 cannot supersede

$ 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 742, forthe latter is "jurisdictional" and affects "substantive rights"
by setting the terms on which the United States waives itssovereign immunity. Henderson, in contrast, characterizes
the Suits in Admiralty Act's service "forthwith" instructionas a nonjurisdictional processing rule. Service "forthwith,"
he urges, forms no part of the immunity waiver or $ 745'sstatute of limitations, but is simply a direction for the conduct of litigation once the case is timely launched in court--a characteristically "how to" direction in conflict with, and
therefore superseded by, Rule 4.Before examining the text of $ 742 to determine the character of the service "forthwith" provision, we note that theconflict with Rule 4 is of relatively recent vintage. The
Suits in Admiralty Act, which allows in personam suitsagainst the United States for maritime torts, was enacted
in 1920, 18 years before the advent of the Federal Rules.Furthermore, admiralty cases were processed, from 1845
until 1966, under discrete Admiralty Rules. Even after1966, the year admiralty cases were brought under the governance of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4 and

Opinion of the Court
the Suits in Admiralty Act service "forthwith" provisioncould coexist. Rule 4, as just recounted, originally contained no time prescription, only the direction that, "[u]ponthe filing of the complaint the clerk shall forthwith issue
a summons and deliver it for service," generally to aUnited States marshal. See

supra, at 662. It was only in1983, when plaintiffs were made responsible for service without the aid of the marshal, that the 120-day provision cameinto force, a provision that rendered Rule 4's time frame
irreconcilable with $ 742's service "forthwith" instruction.Section 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 742, captioned "Libel in personam," contains a broad waiverof sovereign immunity in its first sentence:

"In cases where if [a vessel owned or operated by theUnited States] were privately owned or operated . . . a
proceeding in admiralty could be maintained, any appro-priate nonjury proceeding in personam may be brought
against the United States . . . ."
Section 3 of the Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 743, although cap-tioned "Procedure in cases of libel in personam," completes

the immunity waiver by providing for costs and interest onmoney judgments against the United States.

11 See United

States v. Bodcaw Co., 440 U. S. 202, 203-204, n. 3 (1979); Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)(1) (absent an authorizing statute,

United States is not liable for costs); Library of Congress v.
Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 314 (1986) (absent an authorizing stat-ute, United States is not liable for interest).

The United States asserts that not just the first sentenceof $ 742, but that section in its entirety is "jurisdictional,"
spelling out the terms and conditions of the Government's

"A decree against the United States . . . may include costs of suit, and
when the decree is for a money judgment, interest at the rate of 4 per
centum per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall be
stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based."

Opinion of the Court
waiver of sovereign immunity, in contrast to the next sectionof the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 743, which

governs "procedure," specifying in its first sentence: "Suchsuits shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practiceobtaining in like cases between private parties." See Brief
for United States 26-27; see also Holmberg, 19 F. 3d, at 1064;
Libby v. United States, 840 F. 2d 818, 820 (CA11 1988) ("Thefact that the waiver of sovereign immunity is declared in

section 742, while the procedures governing admiralty suitsagainst the United States are specified in section 743, indicates that the requirements contained in section 742 aremore than procedural."). The dissent adopts this argument
hook, line, and sinker. See post, at 674-675 (finding key totext and structure of the Suits in Admiralty Act in Congress'
placement of service requirement in $ 2 (46 U. S. C. App.$ 742) rather than $ 3 (46 U. S. C. App. $ 743)). But just as

$ 743 is not "purely procedural," for it waives the Sovereign'simmunity as to costs and interest, so $ 742 is not pervasively "jurisdictional."The sentence immediately following $ 742's broad waiver,
and immediately preceding the sentence on service, reads:

"Such suits shall be brought in the district court of theUnited States for the district in which the parties so

suing, or any of them, reside or have their principalplace of business in the United States, or in which the
vessel . . . charged with liability is found."
This notably generous-to-plaintiffs provision will be rec-ognized instantly as one describing venue choices, not

subject-matter jurisdiction. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1391 ("Venuegenerally").

Section 742's final sentence provides:

"Upon application of either party the cause may, inthe discretion of the court, be transferred to any other

district court of the United States."

667Cite as: 517 U. S. 654 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1404 (change of venue to more convenientforum); $ 1406 (authorizing transfer, rather than dismissal,

when venue is improperly laid). Congress simultaneouslyadded to the Suits in Admiralty Act, the Public Vessels Act,
and the Federal Tort Claims Act the transfer provision justset out so that "jurisdictional" dismissals could be avoided
when plaintiffs commenced suit under the wrong statute.See S. Rep. No. 1894, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 2-5 (1960); cf.
28 U. S. C. $ 1631 (authorizing transfer, inter alia, when re-view of agency action is sought in the wrong federal court).
In short, far from reining in "jurisdiction," $ 742's venue andtransfer provisions afford plaintiffs multiple forum choices
and spare plaintiffs from dismissal for suing in the wrongplace or under the wrong Act.

12

Section 742's critical sentence on service reads:

"The libelant [plaintiff] shall forthwith serve a copy ofhis libel [complaint] on the United States attorney for

such district and mail a copy thereof by registered mailto the Attorney General . . . ."

Rule 4, as observed at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg.27-28, provides for dispatch of the summons and complaint
to the Attorney General "by registered or certified mail."See supra, at 658, and n. 4. The Government's sovereignimmunity waiver, counsel for the United States agreed, didnot depend on registered mail service, the sole form of mailing $ 742 authorizes; "in this day and age," counsel said, "cer-tified mail would be acceptable." Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29.
But see post, at 678, n. 4 ("jurisdiction in [a Suits in Admi-ralty Act] suit may turn upon the plaintiff 's use of registered
mail"). It thus appears that several of $ 742's provisions arenot sensibly typed "substantive" or "jurisdictional." Instead, they have a distinctly facilitative, "procedural" cast.

12 While striving for fidelity to what Congress wrote, see post, at 674,
679, the dissent inexplicably writes off many of $ 742's words as "largely
beside the point," post, at 674.

If the service "forthwith" prescription is not made "sub-stantive" or "jurisdictional" by its inclusion--along with

broad venue choices--in $ 742, is it a rule of procedure super-seded by Rule 4? Before we address that dispositive question, we note a preliminary issue. Rule 4( j), which con-tained the 120-day prescription at the time Henderson filed
suit, was not simply prescribed by this Court pursuant tothe Rules Enabling Act. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2074 (rules transmitted by Court to Congress "not later than May 1" becomeeffective "no earlier than December 1" of the same year unless Congress otherwise provides). Instead, the Rule wasenacted into law by Congress as part of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure Amendments Act of 1982, $ 2, 96 Stat.2527. See supra, at 662. As the United States acknowledges, however, a Rule made law by Congress supersedesconflicting laws no less than a Rule this Court prescribes.
See Brief for United States 16, n. 14 ("We agree with peti-tioner . . . that Section 2072(b) provides the best evidence of

13 Even before admiralty proceedings were placed under the governance
of the Federal Rules, Judge Henry Friendly trenchantly observed:

"I cannot believe Congress meant [to render `jurisdictional' every failure
by a libelant to comply with a procedural step outlined in the Suits in
Admiralty Act]; I should have supposed that, once Congress gave the basic
consent to sue the United States, as it did in the first sentence of [$ 742],
it was content to have the courts decide the effect of various procedural
lapses in the same manner as `if such vessel were privately owned or
operated.' " Battaglia v. United States, 303 F. 2d, at 686 (concurring
opinion).

Circuit precedent was otherwise, however, and therefore Judge
Friendly reluctantly concurred in the "Draconian conclusion" that a 4-
month delay in mailing the pleadings to the Attorney General called for
dismissal of the case, despite "forthwith" service on the United States
Attorney. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(i)(3) ("court shall allow a reasonable
time" to "cur[e] the failure to serve multiple officers . . . of the United
States if the plaintiff has effected service on either the United States
attorney or the Attorney General").

congressional intent regarding the proper construction ofRule 4( j) and its interaction with other laws.").

Returning to the dispositive question, we need not lingerover the answer. What we have so far said, and the further
elaboration below, lead securely to this response: Rule 4 gov-erns summons and service in this case in whole and not in
part.A plaintiff like Henderson, on commencement of an action
under the Suits in Admiralty Act, must immediately resortto Rule 4 for instructions on service of process. See

supra,at 657, and nn. 3, 4. In that Rule, one finds instructions governing, inter alia, form and issuance of the summons, serviceof the summons together with the complaint, who may serve
process, and proof of service.14 The Rule also describes howservice shall or may be effected on various categories of defendants,15 including, in detail, "the United States, and ItsAgencies, Corporations, or Officers."

16 All these prescriptions, it is uncontested, apply in Suits in Admiralty Act cases,just as they apply in other federal cases. We see no reason

why the prescription governing time for service 17 is not, as

supersedes, allowing "registered or certified mail"). The current Rule--

is the whole of Rule 4, a nonjurisdictional rule governing"practice and procedure" in federal cases, see 28 U. S. C.

$ 2072(a), consistent with the Rules Enabling Act and Fed-eral Rule 82, and rendering provisions like the Suits in Admiralty Act's service "forthwith" requirement "of no further
force or effect," $ 2072(b). See Jones & Laughlin Steel, Inc.v.

Mon River Towing, Inc., 772 F. 2d 62, 66 (CA3 1985) ( just
as Rule 4 "now governs the method of service of process inadmiralty actions, as well as service of process on the United

States in all civil cases to which it is a party," so the "con-gressional enactment of a uniform 120-day period for accomplishing service of process" supersedes inconsistent priorlaw, in particular, "the Suits in Admiralty Act's requirement
of forthwith service"); Kenyon v. United States, 676 F. 2d
1229, 1232 (CA9 1981) (Boochever, J., concurring) ("I can see
no logical reason why there should be a different method of
service in this one instance [Suits in Admiralty Act cases] in
which the United States is a defendant.").18

n. 18. Current Rule 4(i)(3) shows why the suggested separation of "time"
from "method" or "manner" in this context is not credible. That provision, addressing "time" in relation to "manner," instructs:

"The court shall allow a reasonable time for service of process . . . for
the purpose of curing the failure to serve multiple officers . . . of the United
States if the plaintiff has effected service on either the United States
attorney or the Attorney General of the United States."

18 Judge Boochever, like Judge Friendly, see supra, at 668, n. 13, reluctantly concurred in Circuit precedent, which ranked service "forthwith"
"a condition precedent to the congressional waiver of the Government's
sovereign immunity," Kenyon, 676 F. 2d, at 1231. But he stated cogently
the view he would take "if freed from the bounds of stare decisis":

"Section 742 does not constitute an integral part of the substantive waiver
of sovereign immunity, but is a mere procedural provision necessary at
the time of the statute's enactment, to effectuate that waiver. As such it
was superseded by the Federal Rules." Id., at 1232 (concurring opinion).

Curiously, although the Ninth Circuit, in Kenyon and other cases, has
typed the Suits in Admiralty Act service "forthwith" provision "jurisdictional," that Court of Appeals has pointed to a remedy for litigants in
Henderson's situation: Amend the complaint, even after the 2-year statute

Service of process, we have come to understand, is properly regarded as a matter discrete from a court's jurisdiction

a particular individual or entity.20 Its essential purpose is

in this light, and in view of the uniform system Rule 4 of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, we are satisfied

I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately tomake clear that it is not my view, and I do not understand
the Court to hold, that no procedural provision can be juris-dictional. It assuredly is within the power of Congress to
condition its waiver of sovereign immunity upon strict com-pliance with procedural provisions attached to the waiver,
with the result that failure to comply will deprive a court of
U. S. 273, 287 (1983). But cf. Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484 (1967) (Trading with Enemy Act $ 34(f) provided a 60-day claim-filing limitation; Court

jurisdiction. For the reasons stated by the Court, I do notthink that the legislative scheme here makes the "forthwith"

service requirement such a condition.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

The Suits in Admiralty Act (SAA or Act) entitles theUnited States to be served with process "forthwith" in all

admiralty proceedings brought under the Act. As a statu-tory condition on the Government's waiver of its immunity,
this time restriction on service demands strict complianceand delimits the district court's jurisdiction to entertain suits
in admiralty against the United States. The majority's con-clusion that this requirement is supplanted by former Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4( j) (now Rule 4(m)) rests on amisreading of the SAA and is irreconcilable with our sovereign immunity jurisprudence. Because I believe that Con-gress intended to restrict admiralty suits against the United
States to those cases in which the United States receivesservice of process forthwith, I respectfully dissent.

As a sovereign, the United States "is immune from suit
save as it consents to be sued." United States v. Sherwood,312 U. S. 584, 586 (1941). "A necessary corollary of this rule

is that when Congress attaches conditions to legislationwaiving the sovereign immunity of the United States, those
conditions must be strictly observed, and exceptions theretoare not to be lightly implied."

Block v. North Dakota ex
rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 287(1983). See also

Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 160-

which must be `unequivocally expressed,' `this Court haslong decided that limitations and conditions upon which the

Government consents to be sued must be strictly observedand exceptions thereto are not to be implied' " (citations
omitted)). The fact that the condition involves a matter ofprocedure does not affect the analysis, for "in many cases

Thomas, J., dissenting
this Court has read procedural rules embodied in statuteswaiving immunity strictly, with an eye to effectuating a

restrictive legislative purpose when Congress relinquishessovereign immunity."

Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484, 501
(1967).

As always, the starting point in interpreting the extent ofa waiver of sovereign immunity is the text of the statute.

Section 2 of the Act contains the actual waiver. It providesthat "[i]n cases where if [a] vessel [of the United States] were
privately owned or operated, or if . . . cargo [of the UnitedStates] were privately owned or possessed, or if a private
person or property were involved, a proceeding in admiralty
could be maintained, any appropriate nonjury proceeding in
personam may be brought against the United States." 46
U. S. C. App. $ 742. Section 2 also contains the service provision at issue in this case, which states that a plaintiff suing
the United States in admiralty "shall forthwith serve a copy
of his libel on the United States attorney for such district
and mail a copy thereof by registered mail to the Attorney
General of the United States, and shall file a sworn return
of such service and mailing. Such service and mailing shall
constitute valid service on the United States." Ibid. Section 3 of the Act, aptly titled "Procedure in cases of libel in
personam," provides that suits under the SAA "shall proceed
and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases
between private parties." $ 743.

The text and structure of the SAA lead me to conclude
that Congress intended to allow admiralty suits to proceed
against the United States only in cases in which process is
served "forthwith." The key to understanding the scheme
enacted by Congress lies not so much in Congress' decision
to place this service requirement in $ 2 as in its decision not

668, is largely beside the point. Section 3 provides that the

Thomas, J., dissenting
ordinary rules of procedure governing private parties in ad-miralty also govern suits under the SAA. But Congress excepted from this provision the service-of-process require-ment and placed it in a separate section altogether. This
suggests not only that Congress attached greater significance to the requirement that process be served forthwiththan to other procedural rules, but, more importantly, that

Congress expected process to be served forthwith in SAAcases regardless of the "principles of law and . . . rules of
practice obtaining in like cases between private parties."46 U. S. C. App. $ 743.

Even were I not convinced that the SAA's requirement of
prompt service is a condition on the Government's waiver of
sovereign immunity, I still could not agree with the majority
that it clearly is not a condition on the waiver. At best, the
SAA is ambiguous on this point, and when interpreting the
breadth of a waiver of sovereign immunity, ambiguity must
always be resolved in favor of the Government. See United
States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995). We have consistently reaffirmed "the traditional principle that the Government's consent to be sued must be construed strictly in
favor of the sovereign, and not enlarge[d] . . . beyond what
the language requires." United States v. Nordic Village,
Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (citations and internal quotation
marks omitted). See also Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478
U. S. 310, 318 (1986). It is at least plausible to interpret the
SAA's service provision as a condition on the waiver, and
that is enough to justify construing the statute in the Government's favor. Cf. Nordic Village, supra, at 37.

Because the SAA's service requirement is best read as a
condition on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity, it necessarily follows that this requirement cannot be
superseded by a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Sovereign immunity is by nature jurisdictional, FDIC v. Meyer,
510 U. S. 471, 475 (1994), and the terms of the United States'
" `consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdic517us2$54N 02-05-99 11:39:02 PAGES OPINPGT

tion to entertain the suit.' " Ibid. (quoting Sherwood, 312U. S., at 586). Though the Rules Enabling Act provides that

all previously enacted laws that are "in conflict with" theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure "shall be of no further force
or effect," 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(b), it also expressly provides thatthe Federal Rules "shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any
substantive right," ibid. Allowing SAA claims in whichprocess is not served forthwith to proceed against the United
States infringes upon the Government's immunity andthereby alters a substantive right in direct contravention of
the Rules Enabling Act. Moreover, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 82 makes clear that the Rules of Procedure "shall
not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of theUnited States district courts." Given the jurisdictional nature of a waiver of sovereign immunity, allowing this suit toproceed also violates Rule 82.

I do not mean to imply that ordinary procedural rules au-tomatically become jurisdictional prerequisites in civil cases
simply because the United States is a defendant; they do not.But Congress certainly has the power to impose a procedural
requirement as a condition on a waiver of sovereign immunity and to require strict compliance with that condition asa prerequisite to invoking or maintaining the court's jurisdiction. The text and structure of the SAA demonstrate thatCongress exercised this power when it enacted the SAA, and
"nothing in the . . . rules of civil practice so far as they maybe applicable in suits brought in district courts [against the
Government] authorizes the maintenance of any suit againstthe United States to which it has not otherwise consented."
Sherwood, supra, at 589.1

1 For instance, in United States v. Sherwood, 312 U. S. 584 (1941), we
held that the possibility of joinder under the liberal joinder provisions of
the Federal Rules does not authorize a district court to hear a claim
brought against the Government for breach of contract by a party not
specifically authorized to bring suit against the United States under the
Tucker Act. Notwithstanding the possibility of joinder in a similar case

The majority rejects the proposition, accepted by four ofthe five Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue,

that a service requirement can serve as a condition on awaiver of sovereign immunity.

2 This cannot be, the majority concludes, because service is "not sensibly typed `sub-stantive' or `jurisdictional,' " and instead has a " `procedural'

cast" and "deal[s] with case processing." Ante, at 667-668.But the proper inquiry is not whether the condition is in
nature "procedural" or "substantive," for we have long main-tained that even procedural rules can condition a waiver of
sovereign immunity. See Honda, 386 U. S., at 501. Thefact that Congress has determined to limit the scope of its
consent to suit is sufficient to restrict federal-court jurisdic-tion over the United States, regardless of the nature of the
condition Congress has attached. For instance, though noone would claim that failure to satisfy a statute of limitations
in a case between private parties would serve as a jurisdic-tional bar to the plaintiff 's suit, we have long held that a
statute of limitations attached to a waiver of sovereign im-munity functions as a condition on the waiver and defines the
limits of the district court's jurisdiction to hear a claim
against the United States. See Williams, 514 U. S., at 534,n. 7;

Block, 461 U. S., at 287; United States v. Kubrick, 444
U. S. 111, 117-118 (1979); Soriano v. United States, 352U. S. 270, 271, 273 (1957). See generally 14 C. Wright,

between private parties, we explained that "[t]he matter [was] not one of
procedure but of jurisdiction whose limits are marked by the Government's consent to be sued," and held that the Government's consent to suit
"may be conditioned . . . on the restriction of the issues to be adjudicated
in the suit, to those between the claimant and the Government." Id.,
at 591.

3 The same is true of the SAA's

service requirement. While service of process in a case be-tween private parties may generally be understood to be "a

matter discrete from a court's jurisdiction to adjudicate acontroversy of a particular kind,"

ante, at 671, a waiver ofsovereign immunity conditioned upon a particular method of

service would transform what is ordinarily a nonjurisdic-tional rule into a jurisdictional one.

4

Once the majority concludes that Congress attached noparticular significance to the SAA's requirement that process

be served forthwith, the conclusion that Rule 4( j), by opera-tion of the Rules Enabling Act, displaces $ 2's service requirement would appear to flow naturally. But that is notthe case. As the Government concedes, the Rules Enabling

3 Although we held in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S.
89, 95-96 (1990), that statutes of limitations in cases brought against the
Government are presumptively subject to equitable tolling, we also reaffirmed in that case that a time restriction on suit against the United States
"is a condition to the waiver of sovereign immunity and thus must be
strictly construed." Id., at 94. Irwin did mark a departure from our
earlier, and stricter, treatment of statutes of limitations in the sovereign
immunity context, but our decision in United States v. Williams, 514 U. S.
527 (1995), makes clear that statutes of limitations in suits brought against
the United States are no less jurisdictional prerequisites than they were
before Irwin. Williams confirmed that a statute of limitations "narrow[s]
the waiver of sovereign immunity," 514 U. S., at 534, n. 7, and cited for
this proposition United States v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596 (1990), which held
that failure to file a claim against the Government for a federal tax refund
within the statute of limitations operates as a jurisdictional bar to suit.

4 I recognize that, under my reading of the Act, jurisdiction in an SAA

suit may turn upon the plaintiff's use of registered mail, which is also
specified in the sentence of $ 2 that requires process to be served forthwith. 46 U. S. C. App. $ 742. Though this may seem like an odd requirement from our modern perspective, the most sensible textual reading of
the Act is still that Congress sought to impose a specific method of service
in SAA cases without regard to the rules governing service generally.
Congress is free to amend the statute if it determines that the SAA has
fallen out of date with modern mailing practices.

Act is "technically inapplicable" in this case, Brief for UnitedStates 16, n. 14, because Rule 4( j) was not promulgated by

this Court but rather was enacted by Congress, see Pub. L.97-462, 96 Stat. 2528, and the Rules Enabling Act by its
terms nullifies only statutory rules of procedure that conflict
with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court.The majority acknowledges the inapplicability of the Rules

Enabling Act, ante, at 668, but appears to apply the Actnonetheless,

ante, at 669-670 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 2072(b)).
The majority is not entirely clear on this point, however, andit appears that the majority may instead find that Rule 4( j)

effected an implied repeal of $ 2's service requirement independent of the Rules Enabling Act. See ante, at 668 ("[A]
Rule made law by Congress supersedes conflicting laws no
less than a Rule this Court prescribes"). The majority may
mean by this statement only that the Rules Enabling Act
pertains equally to Rules of Procedure promulgated by this
Court and by Congress, but I am reluctant to assume, absent
clearer indication, the Court's reliance on a method of statutory construction that allows us to rewrite a statute when
the text does not address the specific situation before us or
when it does not generate an outcome that we desire. Regardless of the rubric under which this case is actually decided, the Court, in my opinion, reaches the wrong conclusion. In contrast to the rest of the procedures that apply in
SAA cases, the Act requires a specific method of service even
though the procedures that govern similar cases may differ.
This, in combination with the critical fact that this case involves a waiver of sovereign immunity, leads me to conclude
that Rule 4( j) does not displace the service requirement of

$ 2 either under the Rules Enabling Act or as an implied
repeal.

The only question remaining is whether Henderson served
his complaint on the United States "forthwith." There is
no reasonable argument that he did. Henderson served his
complaint on the United States Attorney 148 days after he

filed it in the District Court. Although we have neverundertaken to define "forthwith" as it is used in the SAA,

it is clear that the term "connotes action which is immedi-ate, without delay, prompt, and with reasonable dispatch."

Whatever problems Henderson may have had in serving hiscomplaint upon the United States, the 148-day delay can
hardly be described as process served forthwith under eventhe most generous definition of the term. I respectfully

certiorari to the supreme court of montana

No. 95-559. Argued April 16, 1996--Decided May 20, 1996
When a dispute arose between parties to a standard form franchise agreement for the operation of a Subway sandwich shop in Montana, respondent franchisee sued petitioners, franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc.
(DAI), and its agent, Lombardi, in a Montana state court. The court
stayed the lawsuit pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause
set out in ordinary type on page nine of the franchise agreement. The
Montana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the arbitration clause
was unenforceable because it did not meet the state-law requirement
that "[n]otice that a contract is subject to arbitration" be "typed in
underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract." Mont.
Code Ann. $ 27-5-114(4). DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued
that $ 27-5-114(4) was preempted by $ 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA), which declares written provisions for arbitration "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in
equity for the revocation of any contract." In arguing for preemption,
DAI and Lombardi dominantly relied on Southland Corp. v. Keating,
465 U. S. 1, and Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, in which this Court
established that "state law . . . is applicable if that law arose to govern
issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally," but not if the state-law principle "takes its meaning
precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue." Id.,
at 493, n. 9 (emphasis added). The Montana Supreme Court, however,
thought Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, limited $ 2's preemptive force and
correspondingly qualified Southland and Perry; the proper inquiry, the
Montana Supreme Court said, should focus not on the bare words of

$ 2 but on the question: Would the application of $ 27-5-114(4)'s notice
requirement undermine the FAA's goals and policies. In the Montana
court's judgment, the notice requirement did not undermine these goals
and policies, for it did not preclude arbitration agreements altogether.
On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Allied-Bruce
Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, the Montana court adhered to
its original ruling.

Held: Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not "any

contract," but specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration,"

Opinion of the Court
conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal measure. Generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements
without contravening $ 2, see, e. g., Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281, but
courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions, see, e. g., ibid. By enacting $ 2,
Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for
suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon
the same footing as other contracts. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417
U. S. 506, 511. Montana's $ 27-5-114(4) directly conflicts with $ 2 because the State's law conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable
to contracts generally. The Montana Supreme Court misread Volt in
reaching a contrary conclusion. The state rule examined in Volt determined only the efficient order of proceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself. Applying $ 27-5-114(4)
here, in contrast, would invalidate the arbitration clause. Pp. 686-688.

Opinion of the Court
When a dispute arose between parties to the agreement,franchisee Paul Casarotto sued franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc. (DAI), and DAI's Montana development agent,Nick Lombardi, in a Montana state court. DAI and Lombardi sought to stop the litigation pending arbitration pur-suant to the arbitration clause set out on page nine of the
franchise agreement.The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) declares written provisions for arbitration "valid, irrevocable, and en-forceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2. Montanalaw, however, declares an arbitration clause unenforceable
unless "[n]otice that [the] contract is subject to arbitration"is "typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of
the contract." Mont. Code Ann. $ 27-5-114(4) (1995). Thequestion here presented is whether Montana's law is compatible with the federal Act. We hold that Montana's first-pagenotice requirement, which governs not "any contract," but
specifically and solely contracts "subject to arbitration," con-flicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal measure. I

Petitioner DAI is the national franchisor of Subway sand-wich shops. In April 1988, DAI entered a franchise agreement with respondent Paul Casarotto, which permittedCasarotto to open a Subway shop in Great Falls, Montana.
The franchise agreement stated, on page nine and in ordi-nary type: "Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof shall be settled byArbitration . . . ." App. 75.

In October 1992, Casarotto sued DAI and its agent, NickLombardi, in Montana state court, alleging state-law contract and tort claims relating to the franchise agreement.DAI demanded arbitration of those claims, and successfully
moved in the Montana trial court to stay the lawsuit pendingarbitration. Id., at 10-11.

684 DOCTOR'S ASSOCIATES, INC. v. CASAROTTO

Opinion of the Court
The Montana Supreme Court reversed. Casarotto v.Lombardi, 268 Mont. 369, 886 P. 2d 931 (1994). That court

left undisturbed the trial court's findings that the franchiseagreement fell within the scope of the FAA and covered the
claims Casarotto stated against DAI and Lombardi. TheMontana Supreme Court held, however, that Mont. Code
Ann. $ 27-5-114(4) rendered the agreement's arbitrationclause unenforceable. The Montana statute provides:

"Notice that a contract is subject to arbitration . . .shall be typed in underlined capital letters on the first
page of the contract; and unless such notice is displayedthereon, the contract may not be subject to arbitration."

Notice of the arbitration clause in the franchise agreementdid not appear on the first page of the contract. Nor was
anything relating to the clause typed in underlined capitalletters. Because the State's statutory notice requirement
had not been met, the Montana Supreme Court declared theparties' dispute "not subject to arbitration." 268 Mont., at
382, 886 P. 2d, at 939.DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued before the Montana Supreme Court that $ 27-5-114(4) was preempted by $ 2of the FAA.

1 DAI and Lombardi dominantly relied on our

decisions in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984),and

Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987). In Southland,we held that $ 2 of the FAA applies in state as well as federal

courts, see 465 U. S., at 12, and "withdr[aws] the power ofthe states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of
claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve byarbitration,"

id., at 10. We noted in the pathmarking South1 Section 2 provides, in relevant part:
"A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving
commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of
such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any
part thereof, . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2.

Opinion of the Court
land decision that the FAA established a "broad principle of
enforceability," id., at 11, and that $ 2 of the federal Act provided for revocation of arbitration agreements only upon
"grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any
contract." In Perry, we reiterated: "[S]tate law, whether of
legislative or judicial origin, is applicable if that law arose to
govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally. A state-law principle
that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract
to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with [the text of

$ 2]." 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9.

The Montana Supreme Court, however, read our decision
in Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468 (1989), as limiting the preemptive force of $ 2 and correspondingly qualifying Southland and Perry. 268 Mont., at 378-381, 886 P. 2d,
at 937-939. As the Montana Supreme Court comprehended
Volt, the proper inquiry here should focus not on the bare
words of $ 2, but on this question: Would the application of
Montana's notice requirement, contained in $ 27-5-114(4),
"undermine the goals and policies of the FAA." 268 Mont.,
at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Section 27-5-114(4), in the Montana court's judgment, did
not undermine the goals and policies of the FAA, for the
notice requirement did not preclude arbitration agreements
altogether; it simply prescribed "that before arbitration
agreements are enforceable, they be entered knowingly."
Id., at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 939.

DAI and Lombardi petitioned for certiorari. Last Term,
we granted their petition, vacated the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court, and remanded for further consideration
in light of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S.
265 (1995). See 515 U. S. 1129 (1995). In Allied-Bruce, we
restated what our decisions in Southland and Perry had
established:

Opinion of the Court
"States may regulate contracts, including arbitrationclauses, under general contract law principles and they

may invalidate an arbitration clause `upon such groundsas exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract.' 9 U. S. C. $ 2 (emphasis added). WhatStates may not do is decide that a contract is fair enough
to enforce all its basic terms (price, service, credit), butnot fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause. The
Act makes any such state policy unlawful, for that kindof policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal
`footing,' directly contrary to the Act's language andCongress's intent." 513 U. S., at 281.

On remand, without inviting or permitting further briefingor oral argument,

2 the Montana Supreme Court adhered to

its original ruling. The court stated: "After careful review,we can find nothing in the

[Allied-Bruce] decision whichrelates to the issues presented to this Court in this case."

Casarotto v. Lombardi, 274 Mont. 3, 7, 901 P. 2d 596, 598(1995). Elaborating, the Montana court said it found "no
suggestion in [Allied-Bruce] that the principles from Volt onwhich we relied [to uphold $ 27-5-114(4)] have been modified
in any way." Id., at 8, 901 P. 2d, at 598-599. We againgranted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1036 (1996), and now reverse.

agreements without contravening $ 2. See Allied-Bruce,513 U. S., at 281;

Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/AmericanExpress, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 483-484 (1989); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.

at 493, n. 9. By enacting $ 2, we have several times said,Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provi-sions be placed "upon the same footing as other contracts."
Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 511 (1974) (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). Montana's $ 27-5-114(4) directly conflicts with $ 2 of the FAA because the State's lawconditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on
compliance with a special notice requirement not applicableto contracts generally. The FAA thus displaces the Montana statute with respect to arbitration agreements coveredby the Act. See 2 I. Macneil, R. Speidel, T. Stipanowich, &
G. Shell, Federal Arbitration Law $ 19.1.1, pp. 19:4-19:5(1995) (under Southland and Perry, "state legislation requiring greater information or choice in the making of agree-ments to arbitrate than in other contracts is preempted").

3 At oral argument, counsel for Casarotto urged a broader view, under
which $ 27-5-114(4) might be regarded as harmless surplus. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 29-32. Montana could have invalidated the arbitration clause
in the franchise agreement under general, informed consent principles,
counsel suggested. She asked us to regard $ 27-5-114(4) as but one illustration of a cross-the-board rule: Unexpected provisions in adhesion contracts must be conspicuous. See also Brief for Respondents 21-24. But

688 DOCTOR'S ASSOCIATES, INC. v. CASAROTTO

Opinion of the Court
The Montana Supreme Court misread our Volt decisionand therefore reached a conclusion in this case at odds with

our rulings. Volt involved an arbitration agreement that in-corporated state procedural rules, one of which, on the facts
of that case, called for arbitration to be stayed pending theresolution of a related judicial proceeding. The state rule
examined in Volt determined only the efficient order of pro-ceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration
agreement itself. We held that applying the state rulewould not "undermine the goals and policies of the FAA,"
489 U. S., at 478, because the very purpose of the Act was to"ensur[e] that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced
according to their terms," id., at 479.Applying $ 27-5-114(4) here, in contrast, would not enforce
the arbitration clause in the contract between DAI andCasarotto; instead, Montana's first-page notice requirement
would invalidate the clause. The "goals and policies" of theFAA, this Court's precedent indicates, are antithetical to
threshold limitations placed specifically and solely on arbitra-tion provisions. Section 2 "mandate[s] the enforcement of
arbitration agreements," Southland, 465 U. S., at 10, "saveupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract," 9 U. S. C. $ 2. Section 27-5-114(4) ofMontana's law places arbitration agreements in a class apart
from "any contract," and singularly limits their validity.The State's prescription is thus inconsonant with, and is
therefore preempted by, the federal law.
term. Cf. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle, 202 Mont. 173, 180, 656 P. 2d
820, 824 (1983) (invalidating provision in auto insurance policy that did not
"honor the reasonable expectations" of the insured). Montana's decision
trains on and upholds a particular statute, one setting out a precise,
arbitration-specific limitation. We review that disposition, and no other.
It bears reiteration, however, that a court may not "rely on the uniqueness
of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would enable the court to effect
what . . . the state legislature cannot." Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483,

ORNELAS et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 95-5257. Argued March 26, 1996--Decided May 28, 1996
In denying petitioners' motion to suppress cocaine found in their car,

the District Court ruled that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop
and question petitioners, and probable cause to remove one of the interior panels where a package containing the cocaine was found. The
Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed both determinations, reviewing
each "deferentially," and "for clear error," and finding no clear error in
either instance.

Held: The ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion to stop and probable

cause to make a warrantless search should be reviewed de novo. The
principal components of either inquiry are (1) a determination of the
historical facts leading up to the stop or search, and (2) a decision on
the mixed question of law and fact whether the historical facts, viewed
from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount
to reasonable suspicion or to probable cause. Independent appellate
review of the latter determination is consistent with the position taken
by this Court, see, e. g., Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160; will
prevent unacceptably varied results based on the interpretation of similar facts by different trial judges, see id., at 171; is necessary if appellate
courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify, the pertinent legal rules,
see Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114; and will tend to unify precedent
and to provide police with a defined set of rules which, in most instances,
will make it possible to reach a correct determination beforehand as to
whether an invasion of privacy is justified in the interest of law enforcement, see, e. g., New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458. However, a
reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical
fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn
therefrom by resident judges, who view such facts in light of the
community's distinctive features and events, and by local police, who
view the facts through the lens of their experience and expertise.

Robert G. LeBell argued the cause for petitioners. Withhim on the briefs was Brian W. Gleason.

Cornelia T. L. Pillard argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Days,
Acting Assistant Attorney General Keeney, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and Joel M. Gershowitz.Peter D. Isakoff, by invitation of the Court, 516 U. S. 1008,

argued the cause and filed a brief as amicus curiae in sup-port of the judgment below.*

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Petitioners each pleaded guilty to possession of cocainewith intent to distribute. They reserved their right to appeal the District Court's denial of their motion to suppressthe cocaine found in their car. The District Court had found
reasonable suspicion to stop and question petitioners as theyentered their car, and probable cause to remove one of the
interior panels where a package containing two kilograms ofcocaine was found. The Court of Appeals opined that the
findings of reasonable suspicion to stop, and probable cause
to search, should be reviewed "deferentially," and "for clearerror." We hold that the ultimate questions of reasonable

suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless searchshould be reviewed

de novo.
The facts are not disputed. In the early morning of aDecember day in 1992, Detective Michael Pautz, a 20-year

veteran of the Milwaukee County Sheriff 's Department with2 years specializing in drug enforcement, was conducting drug-interdiction surveillance in downtown Milwaukee.

692 ORNELAS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Pautz noticed a 1981 two-door Oldsmobile with Californialicense plates in a motel parking lot. The car attracted

Pautz's attention for two reasons: because older model, two-door General Motors cars are a favorite with drug couriers
because it is easy to hide things in them; and because California is a "source State" for drugs. Detective Pautz ra-dioed his dispatcher to inquire about the car's registration.

The dispatcher informed Pautz that the owner was eitherMiguel Ledesma Ornelas or Miguel Ornelas Ledesma from
San Jose, California; Pautz was unsure which name the dis-patcher gave. Detective Pautz checked the motel registry
and learned that an Ismael Ornelas accompanied by a second
man had registered at 4 a.m., without reservations.

Pautz called for his partner, Donald Hurrle, a detective
with approximately 25 years of law enforcement experience,
assigned for the past 6 years to the drug enforcement unit.
When Hurrle arrived at the scene, the officers contacted the
local office of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
and asked DEA personnel to run the names Miguel Ledesma
Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas through the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS), a federal
database of known and suspected drug traffickers. Both
names appeared in NADDIS. The NADDIS report identified Miguel Ledesma Ornelas as a heroin dealer from El
Centro, California, and Ismael Ornelas, Jr., as a cocaine
dealer from Tucson, Arizona. The officers then summoned
Deputy Luedke and the department's drug-sniffing dog, Merlin. Upon their arrival, Detective Pautz left for another assignment. Detective Hurrle informed Luedke of what they
knew and together they waited.

Sometime later, petitioners emerged from the motel and
got into the Oldsmobile. Detective Hurrle approached the
car, identified himself as a police officer, and inquired
whether they had any illegal drugs or contraband. Petitioners answered "No." Hurrle then asked for identification and
was given two California driver's licenses bearing the names

Opinion of the Court
Saul Ornelas and Ismael Ornelas. Hurrle asked them if hecould search the car and petitioners consented. The men

appeared calm, but Ismael was shaking somewhat. DeputyLuedke, who over the past nine years had searched approximately 2,000 cars for narcotics, searched the Oldsmobile'sinterior. He noticed that a panel above the right rear
passenger armrest felt somewhat loose and suspected thatthe panel might have been removed and contraband hidden
inside. Luedke would testify later that a screw in the door-jam adjacent to the loose panel was rusty, which to him
meant that the screw had been removed at some time.Luedke dismantled the panel and discovered two kilograms
of cocaine. Petitioners were arrested.Petitioners filed pretrial motions to suppress, alleging that
the police officers violated their Fourth Amendment rightswhen the officers detained them in the parking lot and when
Deputy Luedke searched inside the panel without a war-rant.

1 The Government conceded in the court below that

when the officers approached petitioners in the parking lot,a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave, so the

encounter was an investigatory stop. See 16 F. 3d 714, 716(CA7 1994). An investigatory stop is permissible under the
Fourth Amendment if supported by reasonable suspicion,Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), and a warrantless search of
a car is valid if based on probable cause, California v.
Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 569-570 (1991).

1 Petitioners also alleged that they had not given their consent to search
the interior of the car. The Magistrate Judge rejected this claim, finding
that the record "clearly establishe[d] consent to search the Oldsmobile"
and that "neither [petitioner] placed any restrictions on the areas the officers could search." App. 21. The Magistrate ruled that this consent did
not give the officers authority to search inside the panel, however, because
under Seventh Circuit precedent the police may not dismantle the car body
during an otherwise valid search unless the police have probable cause to
believe the car's panels contain narcotics. See United States v. Garcia,
897 F. 2d 1413, 1419-1420 (1990). We assume correct the Circuit's limitation on the scope of consent only for purposes of this decision.

694 ORNELAS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the MagistrateJudge concluded that the circumstances gave the officers reasonable suspicion, but not probable cause. The Magistratefound, as a finding of fact, that there was no rust on the
screw and hence concluded that Deputy Luedke had an insuf-ficient basis to conclude that drugs would be found within
the panel. The Magistrate nonetheless recommended thatthe District Court deny the suppression motions because he
thought, given the presence of the drug-sniffing dog, thatthe officers would have found the cocaine by lawful means
eventually and therefore the drugs were admissible underthe inevitable discovery doctrine. See

Nix v. Williams, 467U. S. 431 (1984).

The District Court adopted the Magistrate's recommenda-tion with respect to reasonable suspicion, but not its reasoning as to probable cause. The District Court thought thatthe model, age, and source-State origin of the car, and the
fact that two men traveling together checked into a motelat 4 o'clock in the morning without reservations, formed a
drug-courier profile and that this profile together with theNADDIS reports gave rise to reasonable suspicion of drugtrafficking activity; in the court's view, reasonable suspicionbecame probable cause when Deputy Luedke found the loose
panel. Accordingly, the court ruled that the cocaine neednot be excluded.

2

The Court of Appeals reviewed deferentially the DistrictCourt's determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable

cause; it would reverse only upon a finding of "clear error." 3

2 The District Court emphasized twice that it did not reject the Magistrate's recommendation with respect to the inevitable discovery doctrine.
App. 30-31, and n. 2; id., at 43-44. But on appeal the Government did
not defend the seizure on this alternative ground and the Seventh Circuit
considered the argument waived. Id., at 71-72.

3 While the Seventh Circuit uses the term "clear error" to denote the

deferential standard applied when reviewing determinations of reasonable
suspicion or probable cause, we think the preferable term is "abuse of
discretion." See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). "Clear

16 F. 3d, at 719. The court found no clear error in thereasonable-suspicion analysis and affirmed that determination. Ibid. With respect to the probable-cause finding,however, the court remanded the case for a determination
on whether Luedke was credible when testifying about the
loose panel. Id., at 721-722.On remand, the Magistrate Judge expressly found the testimony credible. The District Court accepted the finding,and once again ruled that probable cause supported the
search. The Seventh Circuit held that determination notclearly erroneous. Judgt. order reported at 52 F. 3d 328

516 U. S. 963 (1996).4Articulating precisely what "reasonable suspicion" and

"probable cause" mean is not possible. They are commonsense, nontechnical conceptions that deal with " `the factual
and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.' " Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231 (1983) (quoting Brinegar v.
United States, 338 U. S. 160, 175 (1949)); see United States v.
Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1989). As such, the standards are
"not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal

error" is a term of art derived from Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, and applies when reviewing questions of fact.

4 Compare, e. g., United States v. Puerta, 982 F. 2d 1297, 1300 (CA9

1992) (de novo review); United States v. Ramos, 933 F. 2d 968, 972 (CA11
1991) (same), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 908 (1992); United States v. Patrick,
899 F. 2d 169, 171 (CA2 1990) (same), with United States v. Spears, 965
F. 2d 262, 268-271 (CA7 1992) (clear error).

The United States, in accord with petitioners, contends that a de novo
standard of review should apply to determinations of probable cause and
reasonable suspicion. We therefore invited Peter D. Isakoff to brief and
argue this case as amicus curiae in support of the judgment below. 516

rules." Gates, supra, at 232. We have described reason-able suspicion simply as "a particularized and objective

basis" for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity,
United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417-418 (1981), and
probable cause to search as existing where the known facts
and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reason-able prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a

crime will be found, see Brinegar, supra, at 175-176; Gates,
supra, at 238. We have cautioned that these two legal principles are not "finely-tuned standards," comparable to thestandards of proof beyond a reasonable doubt or of proof by

a preponderance of the evidence. Gates, supra, at 235.
They are instead fluid concepts that take their substantive
content from the particular contexts in which the standards
are being assessed. Gates, supra, at 232; Brinegar, supra,
at 175 ("The standard of proof [for probable cause] is . . .
correlative to what must be proved"); Ker v. California, 374
U. S. 23, 33 (1963) ("This Cour[t] [has a] long-established recognition that standards of reasonableness under the Fourth
Amendment are not susceptible of Procrustean application";
"[e]ach case is to be decided on its own facts and circumstances" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Terry v. Ohio,
392 U. S., at 29 (the limitations imposed by the Fourth
Amendment "will have to be developed in the concrete factual circumstances of individual cases").

The principal components of a determination of reasonable
suspicion or probable cause will be the events which occurred
leading up to the stop or search, and then the decision
whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of
an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to reasonable
suspicion or to probable cause. The first part of the analysis
involves only a determination of historical facts, but the second is a mixed question of law and fact: "[T]he historical
facts are admitted or established, the rule of law is undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the [relevant]
statutory [or constitutional] standard, or to put it another

way, whether the rule of law as applied to the establishedfacts is or is not violated."

Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456
U. S. 273, 289, n. 19 (1982).We think independent appellate review of these ultimate

determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause
is consistent with the position we have taken in pastcases. We have never, when reviewing a probable-cause

or reasonable-suspicion determination ourselves, expresslydeferred to the trial court's determination. See,

e. g.,
Brinegar, supra (rejecting District Court's conclusion thatthe police lacked probable cause);

Alabama v. White, 496
U. S. 325 (1990) (conducting independent review and finding
reasonable suspicion). A policy of sweeping deference
would permit, "[i]n the absence of any significant difference
in the facts," "the Fourth Amendment's incidence [to] tur[n]
on whether different trial judges draw general conclusions
that the facts are sufficient or insufficient to constitute probable cause." Brinegar, supra, at 171. Such varied results
would be inconsistent with the idea of a unitary system of
law. This, if a matter-of-course, would be unacceptable.

In addition, the legal rules for probable cause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only through application.
Independent review is therefore necessary if appellate
courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify, the legal
principles. See Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985)
(where the "relevant legal principle can be given meaning
only through its application to the particular circumstances
of a case, the Court has been reluctant to give the trier of
fact's conclusions presumptive force and, in so doing, strip a
federal appellate court of its primary function as an expositor of law").

Finally, de novo review tends to unify precedent and will
come closer to providing law enforcement officers with a
defined " `set of rules which, in most instances, makes it possible to reach a correct determination beforehand as to
whether an invasion of privacy is justified in the interest of

law enforcement.' " New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458(1981); see also

Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 115
(1995) ("[T]he law declaration aspect of independent reviewpotentially may guide police, unify precedent, and stabilize

the law," and those effects "serve legitimate law enforcement interests").It is true that because the mosaic which is analyzed for

a reasonable-suspicion or probable-cause inquiry is multi-faceted, "one determination will seldom be a useful `precedent' for another," Gates, supra, at 238, n. 11. But there areexceptions. For instance, the circumstances in

Brinegar,
supra, and Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925),
were so alike that we concluded that reversing the Court of
Appeals' decision in Brinegar was necessary to be faithful to
Carroll. Brinegar, supra, at 178 ("Nor . . . can we find in
the present facts any substantial basis for distinguishing this
case from the Carroll case"). We likewise recognized the
similarity of facts in United States v. Sokolow, supra, and
Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 (1983) (in both cases, the
defendant traveled under an assumed name; paid for an airline ticket in cash with a number of small bills; traveled from
Miami, a source city for illicit drugs; and appeared nervous
in the airport). The same was true both in United States v.

Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982), and California v. Acevedo, 500
U. S. 565 (1991), see id., at 572 ("The facts in this case closely
resemble the facts in Ross"); and in United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544 (1980), and Reid v. Georgia, 448 U. S. 438
(1980), see id., at 443 (Powell, J., concurring) ("facts [in Mendenhall] [are] remarkably similar to those in the present
case"). And even where one case may not squarely control
another one, the two decisions when viewed together may
usefully add to the body of law on the subject.

The Court of Appeals, in adopting its deferential standard
of review here, reasoned that de novo review for warrantless
searches would be inconsistent with the " `great deference' "
paid when reviewing a decision to issue a warrant, see Illi517us3$56H 02-05-99 12:45:02 PAGES OPINPGT

699Cite as: 517 U. S. 690 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
nois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983). See United States v.
Spears, 965 F. 2d 262, 269-271 (CA7 1992). We cannot agree.
The Fourth Amendment demonstrates a "strong preferencefor searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,"

Gates, supra,
at 236, and the police are more likely to use the warrant
process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate's probable-cause determination to issue a warrant is less than that for

warrantless searches. Were we to eliminate this distinction,we would eliminate the incentive.

We therefore hold that as a general matter determinationsof reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal. Having said this, we hasten to
point out that a reviewing court should take care both to
review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to
give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.

A trial judge views the facts of a particular case in light
of the distinctive features and events of the community; likewise, a police officer views the facts through the lens of

his police experience and expertise. The background facts
provide a context for the historical facts, and when seen together yield inferences that deserve deference. For example, what may not amount to reasonable suspicion at a motel
located alongside a transcontinental highway at the height
of the summer tourist season may rise to that level in December in Milwaukee. That city is unlikely to have been
an overnight stop selected at the last minute by a traveler
coming from California to points east. The 85-mile width of
Lake Michigan blocks any further eastward progress. And
while the city's salubrious summer climate and seasonal attractions bring many tourists at that time of year, the same
is not true in December. Milwaukee's average daily high
temperature in that month is 31 degrees and its average
daily low is 17 degrees; the percentage of possible sunshine
is only 38 percent. It is a reasonable inference that a Californian stopping in Milwaukee in December is either there

to transact business or to visit family or friends. The back-ground facts, though rarely the subject of explicit findings,

inform the judge's assessment of the historical facts.In a similar vein, our cases have recognized that a police
officer may draw inferences based on his own experience in
deciding whether probable cause exists. See, e. g., United
States v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891, 897 (1975). To a layman the
sort of loose panel below the back seat armrest in the auto-mobile involved in this case may suggest only wear and tear,

but to Officer Luedke, who had searched roughly 2,000 carsfor narcotics, it suggested that drugs may be secreted inside
the panel. An appeals court should give due weight to atrial court's finding that the officer was credible and the
inference was reasonable.

We vacate the judgments and remand the case to the
Court of Appeals to review de novo the District Court's
determinations that the officer had reasonable suspicion and
probable cause in this case.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
The Court today decides that a district court's determinations whether there was probable cause to justify a warrantless search and reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop should be reviewed de novo. We have in the past
reviewed some mixed questions of law and fact on a de novo
basis, and others on a deferential basis, depending upon essentially practical considerations. Because, with respect to
the questions at issue here, the purpose of the determination
and its extremely fact-bound nature will cause de novo review to have relatively little benefit, it is in my view unwise
to require courts of appeals to undertake the searching inquiry that standard requires. I would affirm the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.

As the Court recognizes, determinations of probable cause
and reasonable suspicion involve a two-step process. First,

701Cite as: 517 U. S. 690 (1996)
Scalia, J., dissenting
a court must identify all of the relevant historical factsknown to the officer at the time of the stop or search; and

second, it must decide whether, under a standard of objectivereasonableness, those facts would give rise to a reasonable
suspicion justifying a stop or probable cause to search. See
ante, at 696-697. Because this second step requires appli-cation of an objective legal standard to the facts, it is properly characterized as a mixed question of law and fact. See
ibid.; Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19
(1982).Merely labeling the issues "mixed questions," however,

does not establish that they receive de novo review. While
it is well settled that appellate courts "accep[t] findings of
fact that are not `clearly erroneous' but decid[e] questions of
law de novo," First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514
U. S. 938, 948 (1995), there is no rigid rule with respect to
mixed questions. We have said that "deferential review of
mixed questions of law and fact is warranted when it appears
that the district court is `better positioned' than the appellate court to decide the issue in question or that probing
appellate scrutiny will not contribute to the clarity of legal
doctrine." Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225,
233 (1991) (citing Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985)).

These primary factors that counsel in favor of deferential
review of some mixed questions of law and fact--expertise
of the district court and lack of law-clarifying value in the
appellate decision--are ordinarily present with respect to
determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause.
The factual details bearing upon those determinations are
often numerous and (even when supported by uncontroverted police testimony) subject to credibility determinations. An appellate court never has the benefit of the district court's intimate familiarity with the details of the
case--nor the full benefit of its hearing of the live testimony,
unless the district court makes specific findings on the "totality of the circumstances" bearing upon the stop or search.

Scalia, J., dissenting
As we recognized in Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496
U. S. 384 (1990), a case holding that deferential (abuseof-discretion) review should be applied to a district court's
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 determination that an
attorney did not conduct a reasonable inquiry or entertain a
"substantiated belief " regarding the nonfrivolousness of the
complaint, see id., at 393: A district court, "[f]amiliar with
the issues and litigants . . . is better situated than the court
of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the factdependent legal standard . . . ." Id., at 402.

Moreover, as the Court acknowledges, "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause" are "commonsense, nontechnical
conceptions that deal with ` "the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent
men, not legal technicians, act." ' " Ante, at 695 (quoting
Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231 (1983) (quoting Brinegar
v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 175 (1949))). Where a trial
court makes such commonsense determinations based on the
totality of circumstances, it is ordinarily accorded deference.
What we said in a case concerning the question whether certain payments were a "gift" excludable from income under
the Internal Revenue Code is equally pertinent here.

"Decision of the issue presented in these cases must be
based ultimately on the application of the fact-finding
tribunal's experience with the mainsprings of human
conduct to the totality of the facts of each case. The
nontechnical nature of the . . . standard, the close relationship of it to the data of practical human experience,
and the multiplicity of relevant factual elements, with
their various combinations, creating the necessity of ascribing the proper force to each, confirm us in our conclusion that primary weight in this area must be given
to the conclusions of the trier of fact." Commissioner
v. Duberstein, 363 U. S. 278, 289 (1960).

Scalia, J., dissenting
With respect to the second factor counseling in favor of deferential review, level of law-clarifying value in the appellate
decision: Law clarification requires generalization, and some
issues lend themselves to generalization much more than
others. Thus, in Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 562
(1988), a principal basis for our applying an abuse-ofdiscretion standard to a district court's determination that
the United States' litigating position was "substantially
justified" within the meaning of the Equal Access to Justice
Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d), was that the question was "a multifarious and novel question, little susceptible, for the time
being at least, of useful generalization." 487 U. S., at 562.
Probable-cause and reasonable-suspicion determinations are
similarly resistant to generalization. As the Court recognizes, these are "fluid concepts," " `not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules' "; and "because
the mosaic which is analyzed for a reasonable-suspicion or
probable-cause inquiry is multifaceted, `one determination
will seldom be a useful "precedent" for another.' " Ante, at
695-696, 698 (quoting Illinois v. Gates, supra, at 232, 238,
n. 11). The Court maintains that there will be exceptions
to this--that fact patterns will occasionally repeat themselves, so that a prior de novo appellate decision will provide
useful guidance in a similar case. Ante, at 698. I do not
dispute that, but I do not understand why we should allow
the exception to frame the rule. Here, as in Anderson v.
Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574-575 (1985), "[d]uplication
of the trial judge's efforts in the court of appeals would very
likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources."

The facts of this very case illustrate the futility of attempting to craft useful precedent from the fact-intensive review
demanded by determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion. On remand, in conducting de novo review,
the Seventh Circuit might consider, inter alia, the following

517us3$56K 02-05-99 12:45:02 PAGES OPINPGT
704 ORNELAS v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
factors relevant to its determination whether there wasprobable cause to conduct a warrantless search and reasonable suspicion justifying the investigatory stop: (i) the twoNADDIS tips; (ii) that the car was a 1981 two-door General
Motors product; (iii) that the car was from California, a
source State; (iv) that the car was in Milwaukee; (v) that itwas December; (vi) that one suspect checked into the hotel

at 4 a.m.; (vii) that he did not have reservations; (viii) thathe had one traveling companion; (ix) that one suspect appeared calm but shaking; and (x) that there was a loose panelin the car door. If the Seventh Circuit were to find that this
unique confluence of factors supported probable cause and
reasonable suspicion, the absence of any one of these factors
in the next case would render the precedent inapplicable.

Of course, even when all of the factors are replicated, use
of a de novo standard as opposed to a deferential standard
will provide greater clarity only where the latter would not
suffice to set the trial court's conclusion aside. For where
the appellate court holds, on the basis of deferential review,
that it was reversible error for a district court to find probable cause or reasonable suspicion in light of certain facts,
it advances the clarity of the law just as much as if it had
reversed the district court after conducting plenary review.

In the present case, an additional factor counseling against
de novo review must be mentioned: The prime benefit of
de novo appellate review in criminal cases is, of course, to
prevent a miscarriage of justice that might result from permitting the verdict of guilty to rest upon the legal determinations of a single judge. But the issue in these probablecause and reasonable-suspicion cases is not innocence but
deterrence of unlawful police conduct. That deterrence will
not be at all lessened if the trial judge's determination, right
or wrong, is subjected to only deferential review.

The Court is wrong in its assertion, ante, at 698-699, that
unless there is a dual standard of review--deferential review
of a magistrate's decision to issue a warrant, and de novo

Scalia, J., dissenting
review of a district court's ex post facto approval of a war-rantless search--the incentive to obtain a warrant would be

eliminated. In United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 913(1984), we held that "reliable physical evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant issued by a detachedand neutral magistrate . . . should be admissible in the prosecutor's case in chief." Only a warrant can provide this as-surance that the fruits of even a technically improper search
will be admissible. Law enforcement officers would stillhave ample incentive to proceed by warrant.

Finally, I must observe that the Court does not appear tohave the courage of its conclusions. In an apparent effort
to reduce the unproductive burden today's decision imposesupon appellate courts, or perhaps to salvage some of the trial
court's superior familiarity with the facts that it has castaside, the Court suggests that an appellate court should
give "due weight" to a trial court's finding that an officer'sinference of wrongdoing (i. e., his assessment of probable
cause to search) was reasonable. Ante, at 700. The Courtcannot have it both ways. This finding of "reasonableness"
is precisely what it has told us the appellate court mustreview

de novo; and in de novo review, the "weight due" toa trial court's finding is zero. In the last analysis, therefore, the Court's opinion seems to me not only wrong butcontradictory.

* * *
I would affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit on theground that it correctly applied a deferential standard of

review to the District Court's findings of probable cause andreasonable suspicion.

QUACKENBUSH, CALIFORNIA INSURANCECOMMISSIONER

v. ALLSTATEINSURANCE CO.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-244. Argued February 20, 1996--Decided June 3, 1996
Petitioner California Insurance Commissioner, as trustee over the assets

of the Mission Insurance Company and its affiliates, filed a state court
action against respondent Allstate Insurance Company, seeking, among
other things, contract and tort damages for Allstate's alleged breach of
reinsurance agreements. Allstate removed the action to federal court
on diversity grounds and filed a motion to compel arbitration under the
Federal Arbitration Act. The Commissioner sought remand to state
court, arguing that the District Court should abstain from hearing the
case under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315, because its resolution
might interfere with California's regulation of the Mission insolvency.
Specifically, the Commissioner indicated that the issue whether Allstate
could set off its own contract claims against the Commissioner's recovery was a question of state law currently pending before the state courts
in another Mission insolvency case. Observing that the State's overriding interest in the uniform and orderly regulation of insurance insolvencies and liquidations could be undermined by inconsistent rulings from
the federal and state courts, and determining that the setoff question
should be resolved in state court, the District Court concluded that Burford abstention was appropriate and remanded the case to state court
without ruling on Allstate's arbitration motion. After determining that
appellate review of the District Court's remand order was not barred
by 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d), and that the remand order was appealable under
28 U. S. C. $ 1291 as a final collateral order, the Ninth Circuit vacated
the decision and ordered the case sent to arbitration. Concluding that
Burford abstention is limited to equitable actions, the court held that
abstention was inappropriate in this damages action.

Held:

1. An abstention-based remand order is appealable under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1291. Section 1447(d)--which provides that "[a]n order remanding a
case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on
appeal or otherwise"--interposes no bar to appellate review of the order
at issue. Only remands based on grounds specified in $ 1447(c) are immune from review under $ 1447(d), and the District Court's order in this

Syllabus
case does not fall into either category of remand order described in

$ 1447(c): It is not based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defects
in removal procedure. The remand order here falls within that narrow
class of collateral orders that are immediately appealable under $ 1291.
It puts the litigants in this case effectively out of court, and its effect is
precisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to a state court.
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S.
1, 11, n. 11. The order also conclusively determines an issue that is
separate from the merits, namely, the question whether the federal
court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the interest of comity
and federalism; the rights asserted on appeal from the abstention decision are sufficiently important to warrant an immediate appeal; and the
remand order will not be subsumed in any other appealable order entered by the District Court. See Moses H. Cone, supra. The decision
in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, 352-353,
that "an order remanding a removed action does not represent a final
judgment reviewable by appeal," is disavowed to the extent it would
require this Court to ignore the implications of the later holding in
Moses H. Cone. Pp. 711-715.

2. Federal courts have the power to dismiss or remand cases based
on abstention principles only where the relief sought is equitable or
otherwise discretionary. Because this was a damages action, the District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of the Burford doctrine. Pp. 716-731.

(a) In cases where the relief sought is equitable in nature or otherwise discretionary, federal courts not only have the power to stay the
action based on abstention principles, but can also, in otherwise appropriate circumstances, decline to exercise jurisdiction altogether by
either dismissing the suit or remanding it to state court. See, e. g.,
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293, 297. By
contrast, federal courts may stay actions for damages based on abstention principles, but those principles do not support the outright dismissal or remand of damages actions. See, e. g., Louisiana Power &
Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U. S. 25, 28. Pp. 716-723.

(b) Burford allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if it presents "difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the
case then at bar," or if its adjudication in a federal forum "would be
disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to
a matter of substantial public concern." Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 814. This power to dismiss
represents an extraordinary and narrow exception to a district court's
duty to adjudicate a controversy properly before it. Pp. 723-728.

Syllabus
(c) Applying Burford to this case, the federal interests are pronounced, as Allstate's motion to compel arbitration under the Federal
Arbitration Act implicates a substantial federal concern for the enforcement of arbitration agreements. With regard to the state interests,
the case appears at first blush to present nothing more than a runof-the-mill contract dispute: The Commissioner seeks damages for Allstate's failure to perform its obligations under a reinsurance agreement. Pp. 728-730.

(d) To the extent the Ninth Circuit held only that a federal court
cannot, under Burford, dismiss or remand an action when the relief
sought is not discretionary, its judgment is consistent with this Court's
abstention cases. The Commissioner appears to have conceded that the
relief sought is neither equitable nor otherwise committed to the court's
discretion. However, by limiting Burford abstention to equitable cases,
the court applied a per se rule more rigid than this Court's precedents
require. Since abstention principles are not completely inapplicable in
damages actions, Burford might have supported an order to stay the
federal proceedings pending the outcome of the state court litigation on
the setoff issue. Only the remand order which the Ninth Circuit entered is being reviewed, and, thus, it is not necessary to determine
whether a more limited abstention-based stay order would have been
warranted on the facts of this case. Pp. 730-731.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we consider whether an abstention-based re-mand order is appealable as a final order under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1291, and whether the abstention doctrine first recognizedin

Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315 (1943), can be appliedin a common-law suit for damages.

I
Petitioner, the Insurance Commissioner for the State ofCalifornia, was appointed trustee over the assets of the Mission Insurance Company and its affiliates (Mission compa-nies) in 1987, after those companies were ordered into liquidation by a California court. In an effort to gather theassets of the defunct Mission companies, the Commissioner
filed the instant action against respondent Allstate InsuranceCompany in state court, seeking contract and tort damages
for Allstate's alleged breach of certain reinsurance agree-ments, as well as a general declaration of Allstate's obligations under those agreements.Allstate removed the action to federal court on diversity
grounds and filed a motion to compel arbitration under theFederal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1988 ed. and
Supp. V). The Commissioner sought remand to state court,arguing that the District Court should abstain from hearing
the case under Burford, supra, because its resolution mightinterfere with California's regulation of the Mission insolvency. Specifically, the Commissioner indicated that All-state would be asserting its right to set off its own contract
claims against the Commissioner's recovery under the con-tract, that the viability of these setoff claims was a hotly
disputed question of state law, and that this question wascurrently pending before the state courts in another case
arising out of the Mission insolvency.The District Court observed that "California has an overriding interest in regulating insurance insolvencies and liqui-dations in a uniform and orderly manner," and that in this

case "this important state interest could be underminedby inconsistent rulings from the federal and state courts."

App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. Based on these observations, andits determination that the setoff question should be resolved
in state court, the District Court concluded this case was an
appropriate one for the exercise of Burford abstention. TheDistrict Court did not stay its hand pending the California

courts' resolution of the setoff issue, but instead remandedthe entire case to state court. The District Court entered
this remand order without ruling on Allstate's motion tocompel arbitration.

After determining that appellate review of the District
Court's remand order was not barred by 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d),
see Garamendi v. Allstate Ins. Co., 47 F. 3d 350, 352 (CA9
1995) (citing Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,
423 U. S. 336 (1976)), and that the remand order was appealable under 28 U. S. C. $ 1291 as a final collateral order, see 47
F. 3d, at 353-354 (citing Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital
v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1 (1983)), the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court's
decision and ordered the case sent to arbitration. The
Ninth Circuit concluded that federal courts can abstain from
hearing a case under Burford only when the relief being
sought is equitable in nature, and therefore held that abstention was inappropriate in this case because the Commissioner purported to be seeking only legal relief. 47 F. 3d,
at 354-356; App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a-37a (order denying
petition for rehearing because Commissioner had waived any
argument that this case involved a request for equitable
relief).

The Ninth Circuit's holding that abstention-based remand
orders are appealable conflicts with the decisions of other
Courts of Appeals, see Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's,
London, 6 F. 3d 856, 865 (CA1 1993) (order not appealable);
Corcoran v. Ardra Insurance Co., Ltd., 842 F. 2d 31, 34 (CA2

n. 7 (CA8 1995) (same); but see Minot v. Eckardt-Minot, 13F. 3d 590, 593 (CA2 1994) (order appealable under collateral

order doctrine), as does its determination that Burford ab-stention can only be exercised in cases in which equitable
relief is sought, see Lac D'Amiante du Quebec, Ltee v. American Home Assurance Co., 864 F. 2d 1033, 1045 (CA3 1988)(Burford abstention appropriate in case seeking declaratory

relief); Brandenburg v. Seidel, 859 F. 2d 1179, 1192, n. 17(CA4 1988) (Burford abstention appropriate in action for
damages); Wolfson v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co., 51 F. 3d141, 147 (CA8 1995) (same); but see Fragoso v. Lopez, 991
F. 2d 878, 882 (CA1 1993) (federal court can abstain under
Burford only if it is "sitting in equity"); University ofMaryland v. Peat Marwick Main & Co., 923 F. 2d 265, 272

(CA3 1991) (same); Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives v.Farmer's Cheese Cooperative, 583 F. 2d 104, 111 (CA3 1978)
(same). We granted certiorari to resolve these conflicts,516 U. S. 929 (1995), and now affirm on grounds different
from those provided by the Ninth Circuit.

II
We first consider whether the Court of Appeals had juris-diction to hear Allstate's appeal under 28 U. S. C. $ 1291,

which confers jurisdiction over appeals from "final decisions"of the district courts, and 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d), which provides that "[a]n order remanding a case to the State courtfrom which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or
otherwise."We agree with the Ninth Circuit and the parties that

$ 1447(d) interposes no bar to appellate review of the remandorder at issue in this case. See 47 F. 3d, at 352; Brief
for Petitioner 29-30; Brief for Respondent 13-14, n. 12. Aswe held in

Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,supra, at 345-346, and reiterated this Term in Things

Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U. S. 124, 127 (1995),"$ 1447(d) must be read in pari materia with $ 1447(c), so

712 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
that only remands based on grounds specified in $ 1447(c) areimmune from review under $ 1447(d)." This gloss renders

$ 1447(d) inapplicable here: The District Court's abstention-based remand order does not fall into either category of remand order described in $ 1447(c), as it is not based on lack of
subject matter jurisdiction or defects in removal procedure.Finding no affirmative bar to appellate review of the District Court's remand order, we must determine whether thatreview may be obtained by appeal under $ 1291. The general rule is that "a party is entitled to a single appeal, to bedeferred until final judgment has been entered, in which
claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation
may be ventilated." Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop
Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868 (1994) (citations omitted).
Accordingly, we have held that a decision is ordinarily considered final and appealable under $ 1291 only if it "ends the
litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to
do but execute the judgment." Catlin v. United States, 324
U. S. 229, 233 (1945); see also Digital, supra, at 867 (quoting
this standard). We have also recognized, however, a narrow
class of collateral orders which do not meet this definition of
finality, but which are nevertheless immediately appealable
under $ 1291 because they " `conclusively determine [a] disputed question' " that is " `completely separate from the merits of the action,' " " `effectively unreviewable on appeal from
a final judgment,' " Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472

U. S. 424, 431 (1985) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay,
437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978)), and "too important to be denied
review," Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337
U. S. 541, 546 (1949).

The application of these principles to the appealability of
the remand order before us is controlled by our decision in
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,
supra. The District Court in that case entered an order
under Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), staying a federal diversity suit

Opinion of the Court
pending the completion of a declaratory judgment action thathad been filed in state court. The Court of Appeals held

that this stay order was appealable under $ 1291, and weaffirmed that determination on two independent grounds.

We first concluded that the abstention-based stay order
was appealable as a "final decision" under $ 1291 because itput the litigants " `effectively out of court,' " 460 U. S., at 11,

n. 11 (quoting Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein,370 U. S. 713, 715, n. 2 (1962)

(per curiam)), and because its
effect was "precisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federalsuit to a state court," 460 U. S., at 11, n. 11. These standards do not reflect our oft-repeated definition of finality, see
supra, at 712 (citing Catlin, supra, at 233); see, e. g., Digital,
supra, at 867 (citing the Catlin definition); Lauro Lines s.r.l.
v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495, 497 (1989) (same); Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 521-522 (1988) (same), but in
Moses H. Cone we found their application to be compelled
by precedent, see 460 U. S., at 11, n. 11 ("Idlewild's reasoning
is limited to cases where (under Colorado River, abstention,
or a closely similar doctrine) the object of the stay is to require all or an essential part of the federal suit to be litigated
in a state forum").

As an alternative to this reliance on Idlewild, we also held
that the stay order at issue in Moses H. Cone was appealable
under the collateral order doctrine. 460 U. S., at 11. We
determined that a stay order based on the Colorado River
doctrine "presents an important issue separate from the
merits" because it "amounts to a refusal to adjudicate" the
case in federal court; that such orders could not be reviewed
on appeal from a final judgment in the federal action because
the district court would be bound, as a matter of res judicata,
to honor the state court's judgment; and that unlike other
stay orders, which might readily be reconsidered by the
district court, abstention-based stay orders of this ilk are
"conclusive" because they are the practical equivalent of an
order dismissing the case. 460 U. S., at 12.

714 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
The District Court's order remanding on grounds of Burford abstention is in all relevant respects indistinguishable
from the stay order we found to be appealable in Moses H.
Cone. No less than an order staying a federal court action
pending adjudication of the dispute in state court, it puts
the litigants in this case " `effectively out of court,' " Moses
H. Cone, supra, at 11, n. 11 (quoting Idlewild Bon Voyage
Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, supra, at 715, n. 2), and its effect is"precisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to a state

court," 460 U. S., at 11, n. 11. Indeed, the remand order isclearly more "final" than a stay order in this sense. When
a district court remands a case to a state court, the district
court disassociates itself from the case entirely, retaining
nothing of the matter on the federal court's docket.

The District Court's order is also indistinguishable from
the stay order we considered in Moses H. Cone in that it
conclusively determines an issue that is separate from the
merits, namely, the question whether the federal court
should decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the interest of
comity and federalism. See infra, at 716-717, 727-728. In
addition, the rights asserted on appeal from the District
Court's abstention decision are, in our view, sufficiently important to warrant an immediate appeal. See infra, at 716,
723-728 (describing interests weighed in decision to abstain
under Burford); cf. Digital, 511 U. S., at 878 (review under
collateral order doctrine limited to those issues " `too important to be denied review' ") (quoting Cohen, supra, at 546).
And, like the stay order we found appealable in Moses H.
Cone, the District Court's remand order in this case will not
be subsumed in any other appealable order entered by the
District Court.

We have previously stated that "an order remanding a removed action does not represent a final judgment reviewable
by appeal." Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer,
423 U. S., at 352-353. Petitioner asks that we adhere to that
statement and hold that appellate review of the District

Opinion of the Court
Court's remand order can only be obtained through a petitionfor writ of mandamus. To the extent

Thermtron would
require us to ignore the implications of our later holdingin

Moses H. Cone, however, we disavow it. Thermtron's
determination that remand orders are not reviewable "final
judgments" doubtless was necessary to the resolution of thatcase, see 423 U. S., at 352 (posing the question whether

mandamus was the appropriate vehicle), but our principalconcern in

Thermtron was the interpretation of the bar to
appellate review embodied in 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d), see supra,at 711-712, and our statement concerning the appropriate

procedural vehicle for reviewing a district court's remand
order was peripheral to that concern. Moreover, the parties
in Thermtron did not brief the question, our opinion does
not refer to Catlin or its definition of "final decisions," and
our opinion nowhere addresses whether any class of remand
order might be appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Indeed, the only support Thermtron cites for the
proposition that remand orders are reviewable only by mandamus, not by appeal, is Railroad Co. v. Wiswall, 23 Wall.
507 (1875), the superannuated reasoning of which is of little
vitality today, compare id., at 508 (deeming a "writ of error
to review what has been done" an inappropriate vehicle for
reviewing a court of appeals' "refusal to hear and decide"),
with Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 10-11, n. 11 (holding that
a stay order is appealable because it amounts to a refusal to
hear and decide a case).

Admittedly, remand orders like the one entered in this
case do not meet the traditional definition of finality--they
do not "en[d] the litigation on the merits and leav[e] nothing
for the court to do but execute the judgment," Catlin, 324
U. S., at 233. But because the District Court's remand order
is functionally indistinguishable from the stay order we
found appealable in Moses H. Cone, see supra, at 714, we
conclude that it is appealable, and turn to the merits of the
Ninth Circuit's decision respecting Burford abstention.

Opinion of the Court

III

A

We have often acknowledged that federal courts have a
strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon
them by Congress. See, e. g., Colorado River, 424 U. S., at
821 ("[F]ederal courts have a `virtually unflagging obligation
. . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them' "); England v.
Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 415
(1964) (" `When a federal court is properly appealed to in a
case over which it has by law jurisdiction, it is its duty to
take such jurisdiction' ") (quoting Willcox v. Consolidated
Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 40 (1909)); Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.
264, 404 (1821) (federal courts "have no more right to decline
the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that
which is not"). This duty is not, however, absolute. See
Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson S. S., Ltd., 285 U. S. 413,
422 (1932) ("[T]he proposition that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it, is not universally true"). Indeed,
we have held that federal courts may decline to exercise
their jurisdiction, in otherwise " `exceptional circumstances,' " where denying a federal forum would clearly
serve an important countervailing interest, Colorado River,
supra, at 813 (quoting County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U. S. 185, 189 (1959)), for example, where abstention is warranted by considerations of "proper constitutional adjudication," "regard for federal-state relations," or
"wise judicial administration," Colorado River, supra, at 817
(internal quotation marks omitted).

We have thus held that federal courts have the power to
refrain from hearing cases that would interfere with a pending state criminal proceeding, see Younger v. Harris, 401
U. S. 37 (1971), or with certain types of state civil proceedings, see Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592 (1975);
Juidice v. Vail, 430 U. S. 327 (1977); cases in which the resolution of a federal constitutional question might be obviated

717Cite as: 517 U. S. 706 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
if the state courts were given the opportunity to interpretambiguous state law, see Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941); cases raising issues "intimatelyinvolved with [the States'] sovereign prerogative," the
proper adjudication of which might be impaired by unsettledquestions of state law, see

Louisiana Power & Light Co. v.City of Thibodaux, 360 U. S. 25, 28 (1959); id., at 31 (Stewart,

J., concurring); cases whose resolution by a federal courtmight unnecessarily interfere with a state system for the
collection of taxes, see Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.Huffman, 319 U. S. 293 (1943); and cases which are duplicative of a pending state proceeding, see Colorado River Water
Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976);Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U. S. 176 (1935).

Our longstanding application of these doctrines reflects"the common-law background against which the statutes
conferring jurisdiction were enacted," New Orleans PublicService, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S.
350, 359 (1989) (NOPSI) (citing Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Dis-cretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 570-577 (1985)). And, as
the Ninth Circuit correctly indicated, 47 F. 3d, at 354, it haslong been established that a federal court has the authority
to decline to exercise its jurisdiction when it "is asked toemploy its historic powers as a court of equity,"

Fair Assess-ment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100,

120 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring). This tradition informsour understanding of the jurisdiction Congress has conferred
upon the federal courts, and explains the development ofour abstention doctrines. In

Pullman, for example, weexplained the principle underlying our abstention doctrines

as follows:

". . . The history of equity jurisdiction is the historyof regard for public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of the injunction. . . . Few publicinterests have a higher claim upon the discretion of a
federal chancellor than the avoidance of needless friction

517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT
718 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
with state policies, whether the policy relates to the en-forcement of the criminal law, or the administration of a

specialized scheme for liquidating embarrassed businessenterprises, or the final authority of a state court to
interpret doubtful regulatory laws of the state. Thesecases reflect a doctrine of abstention appropriate to our
federal system, whereby the federal courts, `exercisinga wise discretion,' restrain their authority because of
`scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of thestate governments' and for the smooth working of the
federal judiciary. This use of equitable powers is acontribution of the courts in furthering the harmonious
relation between state and federal authority withoutthe need of rigorous congressional restriction of those
powers." 312 U. S., at 500-501 (citations omitted).
Though we have thus located the power to abstain in thehistoric discretion exercised by federal courts "sitting in

equity," we have not treated abstention as a "technical ruleof equity procedure."

Thibodaux, supra, at 28. Rather, wehave recognized that the authority of a federal court to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction extends to all cases inwhich the court has discretion to grant or deny relief. See
NOPSI, supra, at 359 (mandate of federal jurisdiction "doesnot eliminate . . . the federal courts' discretion in determining whether to grant certain types of relief "). Accordingly,we have not limited the application of the abstention doctrines to suits for injunctive relief, but have also requiredfederal courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction over certain
classes of declaratory judgments, see, e. g., Huffman, 319U. S., at 297 (federal court must abstain from hearing declaratory judgment action challenging constitutionality of astate tax); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66, 69-70, 72-73
(1971) (extending Younger abstention to declaratory judg-ment actions), the granting of which is generally committed
to the courts' discretion, see Wilton v. Seven Falls Co.,515 U. S. 277, 282 (1995) (federal courts have "discretion in

Opinion of the Court
determining whether and when to entertain an action underthe Declaratory Judgment Act, even when the suit otherwise

satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites").Nevertheless, we have not previously addressed whether
the principles underlying our abstention cases would support
the remand or dismissal of a common-law action for damages.Cf.

Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 202, and n. 6 (1988)
(reserving the question whether Younger requires absten-tion in an action for damages);

Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504
U. S. 689 (1992) (discussing, without applying, Burford ab-stention in damages action). To be sure, we held in

Fair
Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, supra,
that a federal court should not entertain a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983
suit for damages based on the enforcement of a state tax
scheme, see 454 U. S., at 115, but we have subsequently indicated that Fair Assessment was a case about the scope of
the $ 1983 cause of action, see National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U. S. 582, 589-590
(1995), not the abstention doctrines. To the extent Fair Assessment does apply abstention principles, its holding is very
limited. The damages action in that case was based on the
unconstitutional application of a state tax law, and the award
of damages turned first on a declaration that the state tax
was in fact unconstitutional. We therefore drew an analogy
to Huffman and other cases in which we had approved the
application of abstention principles in declaratory judgment
actions, and held that the federal court should decline to hear
the action because "[t]he recovery of damages under the Civil
Rights Act first requires a `declaration' or determination of
the unconstitutionality of a state tax scheme that would halt
its operation." Fair Assessment, supra, at 115.

Otherwise, we have applied abstention principles to actions "at law" only to permit a federal court to enter a stay
order that postpones adjudication of the dispute, not to
dismiss the federal suit altogether. See, e. g., Thibodaux,
supra, at 28-30 (approving stay order); Fornaris v. Ridge

U. S. 134, 135-136 (1962) (per curiam) ("Wise judicial admin-istration in this case counsels that decision of the federal

Clay v. Sun Ins.
Office Ltd., 363 U. S. 207, 212 (1960) (approving "postpone-ment of decision" in damages suit).

Our decisions in Thibodaux and County of Allegheny v.
Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U. S. 185 (1959), illustrate the distinction we have drawn between abstention-based remand
orders or dismissals and abstention-based decisions merely
to stay adjudication of a federal suit. In Thibodaux, a city
in Louisiana brought an eminent domain proceeding in state
court, seeking to condemn for public use certain property
owned by a Florida corporation. After the corporation removed the action to federal court on diversity grounds, the
Federal District Court decided on its own motion to stay the
case, pending a state court's determination whether the city
could exercise the power of eminent domain under state law.
The case did not arise within the "equity" jurisdiction of the
federal courts, 360 U. S., at 28, because the suit sought compensation for a taking, and the District Court lacked discretion to deny relief on the corporation's claim. Nonetheless,
the issues in the suit were "intimately involved with [the
State's] sovereign prerogative." Ibid. We concluded that
"[t]he considerations that prevailed in conventional equity
suits for avoiding the hazards of serious disruption by federal courts of state government or needless friction between
state and federal authorities are similarly appropriate in a
state eminent domain proceeding brought in, or removed to,
a federal court." Ibid. And based on that conclusion, we
affirmed the District Court's order staying the case.

721Cite as: 517 U. S. 706 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
County of Allegheny was decided the same day as Thibodaux, and like Thibodaux it involved review of a District
Court order abstaining from the exercise of diversity juris-diction over a state law eminent domain action. Unlike in

Thibodaux, however, the District Court in County of Allegheny had not merely stayed adjudication of the federal ac-tion pending the resolution of an issue in state court, but

rather had dismissed the federal action altogether. Basedin large measure on this distinction, we reversed the District
Court's order. See 360 U. S., at 190; Thibodaux, 360 U. S.,at 31 (Stewart, J., concurring) ("In

Mashuda, the Court holds
that it was error for the District Court to dismiss the complaint" (emphasis added)).

We were careful to note in Thibodaux that the District
Court had only stayed the federal suit pending adjudication
of the dispute in state court. Unlike the outright dismissal
or remand of a federal suit, we held, an order merely staying
the action "does not constitute abnegation of judicial duty.
On the contrary, it is a wise and productive discharge of it.
There is only postponement of decision for its best fruition."
Id., at 29. We have thus held that in cases where the relief
being sought is equitable in nature or otherwise discretionary, federal courts not only have the power to stay the action
based on abstention principles, but can also, in otherwise appropriate circumstances, decline to exercise jurisdiction altogether by either dismissing the suit or remanding it to state
court. By contrast, while we have held that federal courts
may stay actions for damages based on abstention principles,
we have not held that those principles support the outright
dismissal or remand of damages actions.

One final line of cases bears mentioning. Though we deal
here with our abstention doctrines, we have recognized that
federal courts have discretion to dismiss damages actions, in
certain narrow circumstances, under the common-law doctrine of forum non conveniens. The seminal case recognizing this authority is Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501

517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT
722 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
(1947), in which we considered whether a Federal DistrictCourt sitting in diversity in New York could dismiss a tort

action for damages on the grounds that Virginia provided amore appropriate locale for adjudicating the dispute.

Id., at
503. We conceded that the application of this doctrine
should be "rare," id., at 509, but also held that the exerciseof

forum non conveniens is not limited to actions in equity:

"This Court[,] in recognizing and approving it by name
has never indicated that it was rejecting application ofthe doctrine to law actions which had been an integral

and necessary part of [the] evolution of the doctrine.
Wherever it is applied in courts in other jurisdictions,its application does not depend on whether the action is

at law or in equity." Id., at 505, n. 4 (citations omitted).
The dispute in Gulf Oil was over venue, not jurisdiction,
and the expectation was that after dismissal of the suit inNew York the parties would refile in federal court, not the

state courts of Virginia. This transfer of venue function ofthe

forum non conveniens doctrine has been superseded by
statute, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a); Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno,454 U. S. 235, 253 (1981), and to the extent we have continued

to recognize that federal courts have the power to dismissdamages actions under the common-law

forum non conveniens doctrine, we have done so only in "cases where the
alternative forum is abroad." American Dredging Co. v.
Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 449, n. 2 (1994); see, e. g., Piper, supra,
at 265-269 (dismissal of wrongful death action).The fact that we have applied the

forum non conveniens
doctrine in this manner does not change our analysis in this
case, where we deal with the scope of the Burford abstention
doctrine. To be sure, the abstention doctrines and the doctrine of forum non conveniens proceed from a similar premise: In rare circumstances, federal courts can relinquish their
jurisdiction in favor of another forum. But our abstention
doctrine is of a distinct historical pedigree, and the tradi517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT

723Cite as: 517 U. S. 706 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
tional considerations behind dismissal for forum non con-veniens differ markedly from those informing the decision to

abstain. Compare American Dredging, supra, at 448-449(describing "multifarious factors," including both public and
private interests, which might allow a district court to dis-miss a case under doctrine of

forum non conveniens), withBurford, 319 U. S., at 332-333 (describing "federal-state conflict" that requires a federal court to yield jurisdiction infavor of a state forum). Federal courts abstain out of deference to the paramount interests of another sovereign, andthe concern is with principles of comity and federalism.
See, e. g., ibid.; Younger, 401 U. S., at 44-45. Dismissal for
forum non conveniens, by contrast, has historically reflecteda far broader range of considerations, see Piper, supra, at

241, 257-262 (describing the interests which bear on forumnon conveniens decision); Gulf Oil, supra, at 508-509
(same), most notably the convenience to the parties and thepractical difficulties that can attend the adjudication of a
dispute in a certain locality, see Piper, supra, at 257-259(evidentiary problems, unavailability of witnesses, difficulty
of coordinating multiple suits); Gulf Oil, supra, at 511(availability of witnesses, need to interplead Virginia corporation, location of evidence).

B
With these background principles in mind, we consider thecontours of the Burford doctrine. The principal issue presented in Burford was the "reasonableness" of an order is-sued by the Texas Railroad Commission, which granted "a
permit to drill four oil wells on a small plot of land in theEast Texas oil field." 319 U. S., at 317. Due to the potentially overlapping claims of the many parties who might havean interest in a common pool of oil and the need for uniform
regulation of the oil industry, Texas endowed the RailroadCommission with exclusive regulatory authority in the area.
Texas also placed the authority to review the Commission's

517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT
724 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
orders in a single set of state courts, "[t]o prevent the confusion of multiple review," id., at 326, and to permit an experienced cadre of state judges to obtain "specialized knowledge"
in the field, id., at 327. Though Texas had thus demonstrated its interest in maintaining uniform review of the
Commission's orders, the federal courts had, in the years
preceding Burford, become increasingly involved in reviewing the reasonableness of the Commission's orders, both
under a constitutional standard imposed under the Due Process Clause, see, e. g., Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Rowan &
Nichols Oil Co., 310 U. S. 573, 577 (1940), and under state
law, which established a similar standard, see Burford, 319
U. S., at 317, 326.

Viewing the case as "a simple proceeding in equity to
enjoin the enforcement of the Commissioner's order," id., at
317, we framed the question presented in terms of the power
of a federal court of equity to abstain from exercising its
jurisdiction:

"Although a federal equity court does have jurisdiction of a particular proceeding, it may, in its sound discretion, whether its jurisdiction is invoked on the ground
of diversity of citizenship or otherwise, `refuse to enforce
or protect legal rights, the exercise of which may be
prejudicial to the public interest,' for it `is in the public
interest that federal courts of equity should exercise
their discretionary power with proper regard for the
rightful independence of state governments in carrying
out their domestic policy.' While many other questions
are argued, we find it necessary to decide only one: Assuming that the federal district court had jurisdiction,
should it, as a matter of sound equitable discretion, have
declined to exercise that jurisdiction here?" Id., at 317-
318 (footnote omitted) (quoting United States ex rel.
Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U. S. 352, 360 (1933), and Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U. S., at 185).

725Cite as: 517 U. S. 706 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Having thus posed the question in terms of the DistrictCourt's discretion, as a court sitting "in equity," to decline

jurisdiction, we approved the District Court's dismissal ofthe complaint on a number of grounds that were unique to
that case. We noted, for instance, the difficulty of the regulatory issues presented, stating that the "order under consid-eration is part of the general regulatory system devised for

the conservation of oil and gas in Texas, an aspect of `asthorny a problem as has challenged the ingenuity and wisdom of legislatures.' " 319 U. S., at 318 (quoting Rowan,
supra, at 579). We also stressed the demonstrated need for
uniform regulation in the area, 319 U. S., at 318-319, citing
the unified procedures Texas had established to "prevent the
confusion of multiple review," id., at 325-326, and the important state interests this uniform system of review was designed to serve, id., at 319-320. Most importantly, we also
described the detrimental impact of ongoing federal court
review of the Commission's orders, which review had already
led to contradictory adjudications by the state and federal
courts. Id., at 327-328, 331-332.

We ultimately concluded in Burford that dismissal was appropriate because the availability of an alternative, federal
forum threatened to frustrate the purpose of the complex
administrative system that Texas had established. See id.,
at 332 ("The whole cycle of federal-state conflict cannot be
permitted to begin again"). We have since provided more
generalized descriptions of the Burford doctrine, see, e. g.,
County of Allegheny, 360 U. S., at 189 ("abstention on
grounds of comity with the States where the exercise of jurisdiction by the federal court would disrupt a state administrative process"); Colorado River, 424 U. S., at 814-816
(abstention where "exercise of federal review of the question
in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of state
efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter
of substantial public concern"), but with the exception of
cases that rest only loosely on the Burford rationale, e. g.,

726 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U. S.25 (1959), we have revisited the decision only infrequently in

the intervening 50 years. See NOPSI, 491 U. S. 350 (1989).In

NOPSI, our most recent exposition of the Burford doctrine, we again located the power to dismiss based on abstention principles in the discretionary power of a federal courtsitting in equity, and we again illustrated the narrow range

of circumstances in which Burford can justify the dismissalof a federal action. The issue in

NOPSI was pre-emption.
A New Orleans utility that had been saddled by a decisionof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with

part of the cost of building and operating a nuclear reactor
sought approval of a rate increase from the Council of the
City of New Orleans. The council denied the rate increase
on the grounds that "a public hearing was necessary to explore `the legality and prudency' [sic]" of the expenses allocated to the utility under the FERC decision, 491 U. S., at
355, and the utility brought suit in federal court, seeking an
injunction against enforcement of the council's order and a
declaration that the utility was entitled to a rate increase.
The utility claimed that "federal law required the Council to
allow it to recover, through an increase in retail rates, its
FERC-allocated share of the [cost of the reactor]." Ibid.
The federal pre-emption question was the only issue raised
in the case; there were no state law claims.

In reversing the District Court's decision to dismiss under
Burford, we recognized "the federal courts' discretion in determining whether to grant certain types of relief," 491 U. S.,
at 359, and we indicated, as we had previously in Alabama
Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., 341 U. S. 341, 350-351
(1951), that Burford permits "a federal court sitting in equity," 491 U. S., at 361, to dismiss a case only in extraordinary
circumstances. We thus indicated that Burford allows a
federal court to dismiss a case only if it presents " `difficult
questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in

the case then at bar,' " or if its adjudication in a federal forum" `would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent

policy with respect to a matter of substantial public con-cern.' " 491 U. S., at 361 (quoting

Colorado River, supra,
at 814).

We ultimately held that Burford did not provide propergrounds for an abstention-based dismissal in

NOPSI because
the "case [did] not involve a state-law claim, nor even anassertion that the federal claims [were] `in any way entangled in a skein of state law that must be untangled beforethe federal case can proceed,' " 491 U. S., at 361 (quoting
McNeese v. Board of Ed. for Community Unit School Dist.
187, 373 U. S. 668, 674 (1963)), and because there was no serious threat of conflict between the adjudication of the federal
claim presented in the case and the State's interest in ensur-ing uniformity in ratemaking decisions:

"While Burford is concerned with protecting complex
state administrative processes from undue federal influence, it does not require abstention whenever thereexists such a process, or even in all cases where there is

a `potential for conflict' with state regulatory law or pol-icy. Here, NOPSI's primary claim is that the Council is
prohibited by federal law from refusing to provide reim-bursement for FERC-allocated wholesale costs. Unlike
a claim that a state agency has misapplied its lawful au-thority or has failed to take into consideration or properly weigh relevant state-law factors, federal adjudication of this sort of pre-emption claim would not disruptthe State's attempt to ensure uniformity in the treatment of an `essentially local problem.' " 491 U. S., at
362 (quoting Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm'n, supra, at
347) (citations omitted).

These cases do not provide a formulaic test for determining when dismissal under Burford is appropriate, but they
do demonstrate that the power to dismiss under the Burford

doctrine, as with other abstention doctrines, see supra, at716-723 (describing the traditional application of the abstention doctrines), derives from the discretion historically en-joyed by courts of equity. They further demonstrate that
exercise of this discretion must reflect "principles of federal-ism and comity."

Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 32 (1993).Ultimately, what is at stake is a federal court's decision,

based on a careful consideration of the federal interests inretaining jurisdiction over the dispute and the competing
concern for the "independence of state action," Burford, 319U. S., at 334, that the State's interests are paramount and
that a dispute would best be adjudicated in a state forum.See

NOPSI, supra, at 363 (question under Burford iswhether adjudication in federal court would "unduly intrude

into the processes of state government or undermine theState's ability to maintain desired uniformity"). This equitable decision balances the strong federal interest in havingcertain classes of cases, and certain federal rights, adjudicated in federal court, against the State's interests in main-taining "uniformity in the treatment of an `essentially local
problem,' " 491 U. S., at 362 (quoting Alabama Pub. Serv.
Comm'n, supra, at 347), and retaining local control over "dif-ficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of

substantial public import," Colorado River, 424 U. S., at 814.This balance only rarely favors abstention, and the power to
dismiss recognized in Burford represents an " `extraordinaryand narrow exception to the duty of the District Court to
adjudicate a controversy properly before it.' " Colorado
River, supra, at 813 (quoting County of Allegheny, 360 U. S.,at 188).

C
We turn, finally, to the application of Burford in this case.As in

NOPSI, see 491 U. S., at 363, the federal interests inthis case are pronounced, as Allstate's motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) implicatesa substantial federal concern for the enforcement of arbitra517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT

tion agreements. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler
Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 631 (1985) (FAA reflects "emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral disputeresolution"); cf.

Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25-26 (in deciding whether to defer to state court adjudication under the
Colorado River doctrine, "the presence of federal-law issuesmust always be a major consideration weighing against surrender"). With regard to the state interests, however, thecase appears at first blush to present nothing more than a
run-of-the-mill contract dispute. The Commissioner seeksdamages from Allstate for Allstate's failure to perform its
obligations under a reinsurance agreement. What differentiates this case from other diversity actions seeking damages
for breach of contract, if anything, is the impact federal adjudication of the dispute might have on the ongoing liquidation
proceedings in state court: The Commissioner claims that
any recovery by Allstate on its setoff claims would amount
to an illegal "preference" under state law. This question appears now to have been conclusively answered by the California Supreme Court, see Prudential Reinsurance Co. v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles Cty., 3 Cal. 4th 1118, 842 P. 2d
48 (1992) (permitting reinsurers to assert setoff claims in
suits filed by the Commissioner in the Mission insolvency),
although at the time the District Court ruled this question
was still hotly contested.

The Ninth Circuit concluded that the District Court's remand order was inappropriate because "Burford abstention
does not apply to suits seeking solely legal relief." 47 F. 3d,
at 354. Addressing our abstention cases, the Ninth Circuit
held that the federal courts' power to abstain in certain cases
is "locat[ed] . . . in the unique powers of equitable courts,"
and that it derives from equity courts' " `discretionary power
to grant or withhold relief.' " 47 F. 3d, at 355 (quoting Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., 341 U. S., at
350-351). The Ninth Circuit's reversal of the District
Court's abstention-based remand order in this case therefore

517us3$57J 02-19-99 11:05:49 PAGES OPINPGT
730 QUACKENBUSH v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
reflects the application of a per se rule: "[T]he power of fed-eral courts to abstain from exercising their jurisdiction,

at least in Burford abstention cases, is founded upon a dis-cretion they possess only in equitable cases." 47 F. 3d, at
355-356.

To the extent the Ninth Circuit held only that a federalcourt cannot, under

Burford, dismiss or remand an action
when the relief sought is not discretionary, its judgment isconsistent with our abstention cases. We have explained

the power to dismiss or remand a case under the abstentiondoctrines in terms of the discretion federal courts have traditionally exercised in deciding whether to provide equitable
or discretionary relief, see supra, at 717-719, 721-722, and
the Commissioner appears to have conceded that the relief
being sought in this case is neither equitable nor otherwise
committed to the discretion of the court. See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 35a-37a (order denying petition for rehearing). In
those cases in which we have applied traditional abstention
principles to damages actions, we have only permitted a federal court to "withhold action until the state proceedings
have concluded," Growe, 507 U. S., at 32; that is, we have
permitted federal courts applying abstention principles in
damages actions to enter a stay, but we have not permitted
them to dismiss the action altogether, see supra, at 719-721.

The per se rule described by the Ninth Circuit is, however,
more rigid than our precedents require. We have not
strictly limited abstention to "equitable cases," 47 F. 3d, at
356, but rather have extended the doctrine to all cases in
which a federal court is asked to provide some form of discretionary relief. See Huffman, 319 U. S., at 297; Samuels, 401
U. S., at 69-70, 72-73; supra, at 718-719. Moreover, as demonstrated by our decision in Thibodaux, see supra, at 719-
721, we have not held that abstention principles are completely inapplicable in damages actions. Burford might
support a federal court's decision to postpone adjudication of
a damages action pending the resolution by the state courts

of a disputed question of state law. For example, given thesituation the District Court faced in this case, a stay order

might have been appropriate: The setoff issue was being de-cided by the state courts at the time the District Court
ruled, see Prudential Reinsurance Co., supra, and in the
interest of avoiding inconsistent adjudications on that point,the District Court might have been justified in entering a

stay to await the outcome of the state court litigation.Like the Ninth Circuit, we review only the remand order
which was entered, and find it unnecessary to determinewhether a more limited abstention-based stay order would
have been warranted on the facts of this case. We have nooccasion to resolve what additional authority to abstain
might be provided under our decision in Fair Assessment,
see supra, at 719. Nor do we find it necessary to inquire
fully as to whether this case presents the sort of "exceptional
circumstance" in which Burford abstention or other grounds
for yielding federal jurisdiction might be appropriate.
Under our precedents, federal courts have the power to dismiss or remand cases based on abstention principles only
where the relief being sought is equitable or otherwise
discretionary. Because this was a damages action, we conclude that the District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of the Burford doctrine. The judgment
is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court. I write separately only to
respond to Justice Kennedy's concurrence.

Justice Kennedy, while joining the opinion of the Court,
says that he would "not rule out . . . the possibility that a
federal court might dismiss a suit for damages in a case
where a serious affront to the interests of federalism could
be averted in no other way," post, at 733. I would not have
joined today's opinion if I believed it left such discretionary

dismissal available. Such action is foreclosed, I think, by
the Court's holding, clearly summarized in the concluding
sentences of the opinion: "Under our precedents, federal
courts have the power to dismiss or remand cases based on
abstention principles only where the relief being sought is
equitable or otherwise discretionary. Because this was a
damages action, we conclude that the District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of the Burford
doctrine." Ante, at 731.

Justice Kennedy's projected horrible of a "serious affront to the interests of federalism" cannot possibly materialize under the Court's holding. There is no "serious affront
to the interests of federalism" when Congress lawfully decides to pre-empt state action--which is what our cases hold
(and today's opinion affirms) Congress does whenever it instructs federal courts to assert jurisdiction over matters as
to which relief is not discretionary.

If the Court today felt empowered to decide for itself when
congressionally decreed jurisdiction constitutes a "serious
affront" and when it does not, the opinion would have read
much differently. Most pertinently, it would not have found
it unnecessary "to inquire fully as to whether this case presents the sort of `exceptional circumstance' in which Burford
abstention or other grounds for yielding federal jurisdiction might be appropriate." Ibid. There were certainly
grounds for such an inquiry if we thought it relevant. The
"[then] unsettled but since resolved question of California
law" to which Justice Kennedy refers, post, at 733, was
only part of the basis for the District Court's decision to remand to state court; the court also pointed more generally
to what it thought was the State's "overriding interest in
regulating insurance insolvencies and liquidations in a uniform and orderly manner," App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. As
the Court's opinion says, it is not necessary to inquire fully
into that matter because this was a damages action.

Kennedy, J., concurring
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
When this suit first was filed, it raised an unsettled butsince resolved question of California law concerning the

ability of companies in Allstate's position to set off claimsheld against Mission. The principal reason for the District
Court's decision to dismiss the case was the threat posed tothe state proceedings by different state and federal rulings
on the question. The court's concern was reasonable.States, as a matter of tradition and express federal consent,
have an important interest in maintaining precise and de-tailed regulatory schemes for the insurance industry. See,
e. g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, as amended,15 U. S. C. $ 1011

et seq. The fact that a state court rather
than an agency was chosen to implement California's scheme
provided more reason, not less, for the federal court to stayits hand.

At the same time, however, we have not considered a casein which dismissal of a suit for damages by extension of the
doctrine of Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315 (1943), washeld to be authorized and necessary. As the Court explains,
no doubt the preferred course in such circumstances is toresolve any serious potential for federal intrusion by staying
the suit while retaining jurisdiction. We ought not rule out,
though, the possibility that a federal court might dismiss asuit for damages in a case where a serious affront to the

interests of federalism could be averted in no other way.We need not reach that question here.

Abstention doctrines are a significant contribution to thetheory of federalism and to the preservation of the federal
system in practice. They allow federal courts to give ap-propriate and necessary recognition to the role and authority
of the States. The duty to take these considerations into
account must inform the exercise of federal jurisdiction.Principles of equity thus are not the sole foundation for

abstention rules; obligations of comity, and respect for the

appropriate balance between state and federal interests, arean important part of the justification and authority for abstention as well. See, e. g., id., at 334 ("[A] sound respectfor the independence of state action requires the federal equity court to stay its hand"); Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37,44 (1971) (rooting abstention in "a proper respect for state
functions" and "sensitivity to the legitimate interests of bothState and National Governments");

Colorado River WaterConservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817 (1976)

(abstention doctrines are based on "considerations of properconstitutional adjudication and regard for federal-state relations"). See also Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 551-552 (1985). The traditional role
of discretion in the exercise of equity jurisdiction makesabstention easiest to justify in cases where equitable relief
is sought, but abstention, including dismissal, is a possibilitythat may yet be addressed in a suit for damages, if fundamental concerns of federalism require us to face the issue.With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.

SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

certiorari to the supreme court of california

No. 95-860. Argued April 24, 1996--Decided June 3, 1996
Petitioner, a resident of California, held credit cards issued by respondent,

a national bank located in South Dakota. She filed suit in state court,
alleging that late-payment fees charged by respondent, although legal
under South Dakota law, violated California law. Respondent moved
for judgment on the pleadings, contending that petitioner's state-law
claims were pre-empted by a provision of the National Bank Act of 1864
that permits a national bank to charge its loan customers "interest at
the rate allowed by the laws of the State . . . where the bank is located,"
12 U. S. C. $ 85, see Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of
Omaha Service Corp., 439 U. S. 299. The California Superior Court,
accepting respondent's argument that credit card late-payment fees constitute "interest" for purposes of $ 85, granted respondent's motion.
The State Court of Appeal and State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: The Comptroller of the Currency has reasonably interpreted the

term "interest" in $ 85 to include late-payment fees, see 12 CFR

$ 7.4001(a), and petitioner has failed to establish that the Court should
not accord its customary deference to the Comptroller's interpretation
of an ambiguous provision of the National Bank Act. Pp. 739-747.

(a) Where a provision of the National Bank Act is ambiguous, the
Court, pursuant to Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845, defers to reasonable judgments
of the Comptroller, the official charged with administering the Act.
NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S.
251, 256-257. Petitioner's argument that deference is not owing to the
recently adopted 12 CFR $ 7.4001(a) is unpersuasive. The validity of
the Comptroller's interpretation is not affected by the fact that the regulation was issued more than 100 years after $ 85 was enacted or that it
was litigation, including this very suit, which disclosed the need for the
regulation. And the distinction that the regulation makes between
those charges designated as interest and those not so classified is not
arbitrary or capricious. See Chevron, supra, at 844. Petitioner errs in
contending that an agency interpretation that contradicts a prior agency
position is necessarily invalid; in any event, she fails to show that a
change of official agency position has occurred here. Finally, the issue
here, the meaning of $ 85, does not bring into play the pre-emption considerations that petitioner raises. Pp. 739-744.

(b) The Comptroller's interpretation of the statutory term "interest"
is reasonable. There is no indication that, at the time of the passage
of the National Bank Act, common usage of the word "interest" or
the phrase "at the rate allowed" required that interest charges be expressed as functions of time and amount owing. Nor is there support
for petitioner's contention that the late fees are "penalties" rather than
"interest." See Citizens' Nat. Bank of Kansas City v. Donnell, 195

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864, Rev. Stat.$ 5197, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 85, provides that a national

bank may charge its loan customers "interest at the rate al-lowed by the laws of the State . . . where the bank is located."
In Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of OmahaService Corp., 439 U. S. 299 (1978), we held that this provision authorizes a national bank to charge out-of-state credit-card customers an interest rate allowed by the bank's home
State, even when that rate is higher than what is permittedby the States in which the cardholders reside. The question
in this case is whether $ 85 also authorizes a national bankto charge late-payment fees that are lawful in the bank's
home State but prohibited in the States where the cardhold-ers reside--in other words, whether the statutory term "interest" encompasses late-payment fees.

738 SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

Opinion of the Court
ent, a national bank located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.The Classic Card agreement provided that respondent would

charge petitioner a late fee of $15 for each monthly period inwhich she failed to make her minimum monthly payment
within 25 days of the due date. Under the Preferred Cardagreement, respondent would impose a late fee of $6 if the
minimum monthly payment was not received within 15 daysof its due date; and an additional charge of $15 or 0.65% of
the outstanding balance on the Preferred Card, whicheverwas greater, if the minimum payment was not received by
the next minimum monthly payment due date. Petitioner
was charged late fees on both cards.

These late fees are permitted by South Dakota law, seeS. D. Codified Laws $$ 54-3-1, 54-3-1.1 (1990 and Supp.

1995). Petitioner, however, is of the view that exacting such"unconscionable" late charges from California residents violates California law, and in 1992 brought a class actionagainst respondent on behalf of herself and other California
holders of respondent's credit cards, asserting various statu-tory and common-law claims.

1 Respondent moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending that petitioner's claimswere pre-empted by $ 85. The Superior Court of Los

Angeles County initially denied respondent's motion, but theCalifornia Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, issued
a writ of mandate directing the Superior Court to eithergrant the motion or show cause why it should not be required
to do so. The Superior Court chose the former course, and
the Court of Appeal affirmed its dismissal of the complaint,26 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 562 (1994). The Supreme Court of California granted review and affirmed, two

II
In light of the two dissents from the opinion of the Su-preme Court of California, see 11 Cal. 4th, at 165, 177, 900

P. 2d, at 708, 716 (Arabian, J., dissenting, and George, J., dis-senting), and in light of the opinion of the Supreme Court of
New Jersey creating the conflict that has prompted us totake this case,

2 it would be difficult indeed to contend that

the word "interest" in the National Bank Act is unambiguouswith regard to the point at issue here. It is our practice to

defer to the reasonable judgments of agencies with regardto the meaning of ambiguous terms in statutes that they are
charged with administering. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984). As we observed only last Term, that practice

extends to the judgments of the Comptroller of the Currencywith regard to the meaning of the banking laws. "The
Comptroller of the Currency," we said, "is charged with theenforcement of banking laws to an extent that warrants the
invocation of [the rule of deference] with respect to his de-liberative conclusions as to the meaning of these laws."

Opinion of the Court
lation dealing with the subject before us, see 60 Fed. Reg.11924, 11940, and on February 9, 1996, which was after the

California Supreme Court's decision, he adopted the follow-ing provision:

"The term `interest' as used in 12 U. S. C. $ 85 includesany payment compensating a creditor or prospective
creditor for an extension of credit, making available of aline of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a
condition upon which credit was extended. It includes,among other things, the following fees connected with
credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates,
late fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees, overlimit fees,annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees.

It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiumsand commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing
repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, feesfor document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports." 61 Fed. Reg. 4869 (to
be codified in 12 CFR $ 7.4001(a)).

Petitioner proposes several reasons why the ordinary ruleof deference should not apply to this regulation. First, petitioner points to the fact that this regulation was issued morethan 100 years after the enactment of $ 85, and seemingly as
a result of this and similar litigation in which the Comptroller has participated as amicus curiae on the side of thebanks. The 100-year delay makes no difference. To be

sure, agency interpretations that are of long standing comebefore us with a certain credential of reasonableness, since
it is rare that error would long persist. But neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the statute is a condition of
validity. We accord deference to agencies under Chevron,
not because of a presumption that they drafted the provisions in question, or were present at the hearings, or spoke
to the principal sponsors; but rather because of a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant

741Cite as: 517 U. S. 735 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambi-guity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency,

and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possesswhatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows. See
Chevron, supra, at 843-844. Nor does it matter that the
regulation was prompted by litigation, including this verysuit. Of course we deny deference "to agency litigating

positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations, rul-ings, or administrative practice,"

Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.
Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212 (1988). The deliberateness ofsuch positions, if not indeed their authoritativeness, is suspect. But we have before us here a full-dress regulation,
issued by the Comptroller himself and adopted pursuant to
the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative
Procedure Act designed to assure due deliberation, see 5
U. S. C. $ 553; Thompson v. Clark, 741 F. 2d 401, 409 (CADC
1984). That it was litigation which disclosed the need for
the regulation is irrelevant.

Second, petitioner contends that the Comptroller's regulation is not deserving of our deference because "there is no
rational basis for distinguishing the various charges [it] has
denominated interest . . . from those charges it has denominated `non-interest.' " Reply Brief for Petitioner 14. We
disagree. As an analytical matter, it seems to us perfectly
possible to draw a line, as the regulation does, between (1)
"payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for
an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or
any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon
which credit was extended," and (2) all other payments. To
be sure, in the broadest sense all payments connected in any
way with the loan--including reimbursement of the lender's
costs in processing the application, insuring the loan, and
appraising the collateral--can be regarded as "compensating
[the] creditor for [the] extension of credit." But it seems to
us quite possible and rational to distinguish, as the regulation does, between those charges that are specifically as517us3$58k 02-05-99 13:36:48 PAGES OPINPGT
742 SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

Opinion of the Court
signed to such expenses and those that are assessed for sim-ply making the loan, or for the borrower's default. In its

logic, at least, the line is not "arbitrary [or] capricious," andthereby disentitled to deference under

Chevron, see 467
U. S., at 844. Whether it is "arbitrary [or] capricious" as an
interpretation of what the statute means--or perhaps even(what

Chevron also excludes from deference) "manifestly
contrary to the statute"--we will discuss in the next Part ofthis opinion.

Finally, petitioner argues that the regulation is not enti-tled to deference because it is inconsistent with positions
taken by the Comptroller in the past. Of course the mere
fact that an agency interpretation contradicts a prior agency
position is not fatal. Sudden and unexplained change, see,
e. g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State
Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 46-57 (1983),
or change that does not take account of legitimate reliance
on prior interpretation, see, e. g., United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., 411 U. S. 655, 670-675
(1973); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 295 (1974),
may be "arbitrary, capricious [or] an abuse of discretion," 5
U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). But if these pitfalls are avoided, change
is not invalidating, since the whole point of Chevron is to
leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute
with the implementing agency.

In any case, we do not think that anything which can accurately be described as a change of official agency position has
occurred here. The agency's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking asserted that the new regulation "reflect[s] current
law and [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)]
interpretive letters," 60 Fed. Reg. 11929 (1995), and the
Statement of Basis and Purpose accompanying the final
adoption stated that "[t]he final ruling is consistent with
OCC interpretive letters in this area . . . and reflects the
position the OCC has taken in amicus curiae briefs in litigation pending in many state and Federal courts," 61 Fed. Reg.

Opinion of the Court
4859 (1996) (citing OCC interpretive letters). Petitionerpoints only to (1) a June 1964 letter from the Comptroller

to the President's Committee on Consumer Interests, whichstates that "[c]harges for late payments, credit life insurance,
recording fees, documentary stamp are illustrations of
charges which are made by some banks which would notproperly be characterized as interest," see App. to Brief for

Petitioner 5a; and (2) a 1988 opinion letter from the DeputyChief Counsel of the OCC stating "it is my position that
[under $ 85] the laws of the states where the banks are lo-cated . . . determine whether or not the banks can impose
the foregoing fees and charges [including late fees] on Iowa
residents," OCC Interpretive Letter No. 452, reprinted in
1988-1989 Transfer Binder, CCH Fed. Banking L. Rep.
|| 85,676, p. 78,064 (1988). We doubt whether either of these
statements was sufficient in and of itself to establish a binding agency policy--the former, because it was too informal,
and the latter because it only purported to represent the
position of the Deputy Chief Counsel in response to an inquiry concerning particular banks. Nor can it even be argued that the two statements reflect a prior agency policy,
since, in addition to contradicting the regulation before us
here, they also contradict one another--the former asserting
that "interest" is a nationally uniform concept, and the latter
that it is to be determined by reference to state law. What
these statements show, if anything, is that there was good
reason for the Comptroller to promulgate the new regulation, in order to eliminate uncertainty and confusion.

In addition to offering these reasons why 12 CFR

$ 7.4001(a) in particular is not entitled to deference, petitioner contends that no Comptroller interpretation of $ 85 is
entitled to deference, because $ 85 is a provision that preempts state law. She argues that the "presumption against
. . . pre-emption" announced in Cipollone v. Liggett Group,
Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 518 (1992), in effect trumps Chevron, and
requires a court to make its own interpretation of $ 85 that

517us3$58k 02-05-99 13:36:48 PAGES OPINPGT
744 SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

Opinion of the Court
will avoid (to the extent possible) pre-emption of state law.This argument confuses the question of the substantive (as

opposed to pre-emptive) meaning of a statute with the ques-tion of

whether a statute is pre-emptive. We may assume
(without deciding) that the latter question must always be
decided de novo by the courts. That is not the question atissue here; there is no doubt that $ 85 pre-empts state law.

In Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha
Service Corp., 439 U. S. 299 (1978), we dismissed petitioners'
argument that the "exportation" of interest rates from thebank's home State would "significantly impair the ability of

States to enact effective usury laws" with the observationthat "[t]his impairment . . . has always been implicit in the
structure of the National Bank Act . . . . [T]he protection
of state usury laws is an issue of legislative policy, and any
plea to alter $ 85 to further that end is better addressed to
the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment of this Court."
Id., at 318-319. What is at issue here is simply the meaning
of a provision that does not (like the provision in Cipollone)
deal with pre-emption, and hence does not bring into play
the considerations petitioner raises.3

III
Since we have concluded that the Comptroller's regulation
deserves deference, the question before us is not whether
it represents the best interpretation of the statute, but

3 In a four-line footnote on the last page of her reply brief, and unpursued in oral argument, petitioner raised the point that deferring to the
regulation in this case involving antecedent transactions would make the
regulation retroactive, in violation of Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208-209 (1988). Reply Brief for Petitioner 20, n. 17.
There might be substance to this point if the regulation replaced a prior
agency interpretation--which, as we have discussed, it did not. Where,
however, a court is addressing transactions that occurred at a time when
there was no clear agency guidance, it would be absurd to ignore the
agency's current authoritative pronouncement of what the statute means.

745Cite as: 517 U. S. 735 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
whether it represents a reasonable one. The answer is obvi-ously yes.

Petitioner argues that the late fees charged by respondentdo not constitute "interest" because they "do not vary based
on the payment owed or the time period of delay." Brief for
Petitioner 32-33. We do not think that such a limitationmust be read into the statutory term. Most legal dictionaries of the era of the National Bank Act did not place such alimitation upon "interest." See,

e. g., 1 J. Bouvier, A Law
Dictionary 652 (6th ed. 1856) ("The compensation which ispaid by the borrower to the lender or by the debtor to the

creditor for . . . use [of money]"); 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 90 (2d ed. 1860); 11 American and English
Encyclopedia of Law 379 (J. Merrill ed. 1890). But see J.
Wharton, Law Lexicon or Dictionary of Jurisprudence 391
(2d Am. ed. 1860). The definition of "interest" that we ourselves set out in Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall. 177, 185 (1873),
decided shortly after the enactment of the National Bank
Act, likewise contained no indication that it was limited to
charges expressed as a function of time or of amount owing:
"Interest is the compensation allowed by law, or fixed by the
parties, for the use or forbearance of money or as damages
for its detention." See also Hollowell v. Southern Building & Loan Assn., 120 N. C. 286, 26 S. E. 781 (1897) ("[A]ny
charges made against [the borrower] in excess of the lawful
rate of interest, whether called `fines,' `charges,' `dues,' or
`interest,' are in fact interest, and usurious").

Petitioner suggests another source for the asserted requirement that the charges be time- and rate-based: What is
authorized by $ 85, she notes, is the charging of interest "at
the rate allowed" by the laws of the bank's home State.
This requires, in her view, that the interest charges be expressed as functions of time and amount owing. It would
be surprising to find such a requirement in the Act, if only
because it would be so pointless. Any flat charge may, of
course, readily be converted to a percentage charge--which

517us3$58k 02-05-99 13:36:48 PAGES OPINPGT
746 SMILEY v. CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N. A.

Opinion of the Court
was indeed the basis for 19th-century decisions holding thatflat charges violated state usury laws establishing maximum

"rates." See, e. g., Craig v. Pleiss, 26 Pa. 271, 272-273(1856);

Hollowell, supra, at 286, 26 S. E., at 781. And there
is no apparent reason why home-state-approved percentage
charges should be permissible but home-state-approved flatcharges unlawful. In any event, common usage at the time

of the National Bank Act prevents the conclusion that theComptroller's refusal to give the word "rate" the narrow
meaning petitioner demands is unreasonable. The 1849 edi-tion of Webster's gives as one of the definitions of "rate" the
"[p]rice or amount stated or fixed on any thing." N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language 910. To
illustrate this sense of the word, it provides the following
examples: "A king may purchase territory at too dear a rate.
The rate of interest is prescribed by law." Ibid. Cf. 2 Bouvier, supra, at 421 (defining "rate of exchange" as "the price
at which a bill drawn in one country upon another, may be
sold in the former").

Finally, petitioner contends that the late fees cannot be
"interest" because they are "penalties." To support that dichotomy, she points to our opinion in Meilink v. Unemployment Reserves Comm'n of Cal., 314 U. S. 564, 570 (1942).
But Meilink involved a provision of the Bankruptcy Act that
disallowed debts owing to governmental entities "as a penalty," except for "the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained
by the act . . . out of which the penalty . . . arose, with . . .
such interest as may have accrued thereon according to law."
Id., at 566. Obviously, this provision uses "interest" to
mean only that interest which is exacted as commercial compensation, and not that interest which is exacted as a penalty. A word often takes on a more narrow connotation
when it is expressly opposed to another word: "car," for
example, has a broader meaning by itself than it does in a
passage speaking of "cars and taxis." In $ 85, the term "interest" is not used in contradistinction to "penalty," and

747Cite as: 517 U. S. 735 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
there is no reason why it cannot include interest charges im-posed for that purpose. More relevant than Meilink is our

opinion in Citizens' Nat. Bank of Kansas City v. Donnell,195 U. S. 369 (1904), which did involve $ 85 (or, more precisely, its predecessor, Rev. Stat. $ 5197). There, a bank ar-gued that a 12% charge on overdrafts did not violate a state
law setting an 8% ceiling on interest rates because, inter
alia, the overdraft charge "was a penalty because of a failureto pay a debt when due." Id., at 373-374. We dismissed

the argument out of hand: "The suggestions as to the twelveper cent charge on overdrafts do not seem to us to need
answer." Id., at 374. * * *

Petitioner devotes much of her brief to the questionwhether the meaning of "interest" in $ 85 can constitutionally
be left to be defined by the law of the bank's home State--aquestion that is not implicated by the Comptroller's regulation. Because the regulation is entitled to deference, andbecause the Comptroller's interpretation of $ 85 is not an
unreasonable one, the decision of the Supreme Court of Cal-ifornia must be affirmed.

It is so ordered.

LOVING v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe armed forces

No. 94-1966. Argued January 9, 1996--Decided June 3, 1996
A general court-martial found petitioner Loving, an Army private, guilty

of both premeditated murder and felony murder under Article 118 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. $$ 918(1), (4).
Finding three aggravating factors--(1) that the premeditated murder
was committed during a robbery, Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM)
1004(c)(7)(B); (2) that Loving acted as the triggerman in the felony murder, RCM 1004(c)(8); and (3) that Loving, having been found guilty of
the premeditated murder, had committed a second murder, also proved
at his single trial, RCM 1004(c)(7)(J)--the court-martial sentenced Loving to death. The commander who convened the court-martial approved the findings and sentence. The United States Army Court of
Military Review and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces affirmed, rejecting Loving's attack on the promulgation by Executive Order of the aggravating factors in RCM 1004. He contends that
the Eighth Amendment and the separation-of-powers doctrine require
that Congress, not the President, make the fundamental policy determination respecting the factors that warrant the death penalty.

Held:

1. On the assumption that Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and
subsequent cases apply to this crime and sentence, the Constitution
requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges. Under the
Eighth Amendment, the military capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must
reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the accused compared to others found guilty of murder, see, e. g., Lowenfield
v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244. That narrowing is not achieved in the
statute. Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the
four types of murder therein specified, premeditated and felony murder,

$$ 918(1), (4), whereas intentional murder without premeditation and
murder resulting from wanton and dangerous conduct are not punishable by death, $$ 918(2), (3). Moreover, Article 118(4) by its terms permits the death penalty for felony murder even if the accused had no
intent to kill and did not do the killing himself. Because the Eighth
Amendment does not permit death to be imposed in those circumstances, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801, additional aggravating

749Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)
Syllabus
factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to Article 118's
constitutional validity, see, e. g., Lowenfield, supra, at 244. Pp. 755-756.

2. The President's prescription of the challenged aggravating factors
did not violate the separation-of-powers principle. Pp. 756-774.

(a) The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine, a strand of
this Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence, is that the lawmaking
function belongs to Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 1, and may not be
conveyed to another branch or entity, Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692.
This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress can make a
rule of prospective force. Although it may not delegate the power to
make the law, which necessarily involves discretion as to what the law
shall be, Congress may delegate to others the authority or discretion to
execute the law under and in pursuance of its terms. Id., at 693-694.
Pp. 756-759.

(b) The Court rejects Loving's argument that Congress lacks
power to delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors in capital murder cases. An analysis of English constitutional history and of the historical necessities and events that instructed
the Framers demonstrates that U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 14--which
empowers Congress "[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces"--does not grant an exclusive, nondelegable power to determine military punishments, but gives Congress
such flexibility to exercise or share power as the times might demand.
And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander in Chief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion and
authority. Thus, in the circumstances presented here, Congress may
delegate authority to the President to define the aggravating factors
that permit imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations providing the narrowing of the death-eligible class that the Eighth Amendment requires. Pp. 759-769.

(c) Also rejected is Loving's contention that, even if Congress can
delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors,
Congress did not do so by implicit or explicit action in this instance. In
fact, Congress exercised that power of delegation in 1950, when it
enacted Articles 18, 56, and 36(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $$ 818 (A
court-martial "may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the UCMJ], including
the penalty of death when specifically authorized"), 856 ("The punishment which a court-martial may direct . . . may not exceed such limits
as the President may prescribe for that offense"), and 836(a) (which empowers the President to make procedural rules for courts-martial, and
was identified by Congress in 1985 as a source of Presidential authority

750 LOVING v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
to provide capital aggravating factors). Together, these Articles give
clear authority to the President to promulgate RCM 1004. Pp. 769-771.

(d) Loving's final assertion--that even if Articles 18, 56, and 36 can
be construed as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle to guide
the President's discretion--is also rejected. Had the delegations here
called for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the
President's traditional authority, this argument might have more
weight. However, because the President's duties as Commander in
Chief require him to take responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, including the courts-martial, the delegated duty to
prescribe aggravating factors for capital cases is interlinked with duties
already assigned to him by the Constitution's express terms. The same
limitations on delegation do not apply where the entity exercising the
delegated authority possesses independent authority over the subject
matter. See, e. g., United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557.
Pp. 771-774.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The case before us concerns the authority of the President,in our system of separated powers, to prescribe aggravating

factors that permit a court-martial to impose the death pen-alty upon a member of the Armed Forces convicted of
murder. I

On December 12, 1988, petitioner Dwight Loving, an Armyprivate stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, murdered two taxicab
drivers from the nearby town of Killeen. He attempted tomurder a third, but the driver disarmed him and escaped.
Civilian and Army authorities arrested Loving the next af-ternoon. He confessed.

After a trial, an eight-member general court-martial foundLoving guilty of, among other offenses, premeditated murder
and felony murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code ofMilitary Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. $$ 918(1), (4). In the
sentencing phase of the trial, the court-martial found threeaggravating factors: (1) that the premeditated murder of the
second driver was committed during the course of a robbery,Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM) 1004(c)(7)(B); (2) that Loving
acted as the triggerman in the felony murder of the firstdriver, RCM 1004(c)(8); and (3) that Loving, having been
found guilty of the premeditated murder, had committeda second murder, also proved at the single trial, RCM
1004(c)(7)(J). The court-martial sentenced Loving to death.The commander who convened the court-martial approved
the findings and sentence. Cf. 10 U. S. C. $ 860. The UnitedStates Army Court of Military Review and the United

Opinion of the Court
252 (CMA), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 952 (1991), to reject Lov-ing's claims that the President lacked authority to promulgate the aggravating factors that enabled the court-martialto sentence him to death. We granted certiorari. 515 U. S.
1191 (1995). II

Although American courts-martial from their inceptionhave had the power to decree capital punishment, they have
not long had the authority to try and to sentence membersof the Armed Forces for capital murder committed in the
United States in peacetime. In the early days of the Repub-lic the powers of courts-martial were fixed in the Articles of
War. Congress enacted the first Articles in 1789 by adopt-ing in full the Articles promulgated in 1775 (and revised in
1776) by the Continental Congress. Act of Sept. 29, 1789,ch. 25, $ 4, 1 Stat. 96. (Congress reenacted the Articles in
1790 "as far as the same may be applicable to the constitutionof the United States," Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 10, $ 13, 1
Stat. 121.) The Articles adopted by the First Congressplaced significant restrictions on court-martial jurisdiction
over capital offenses. Although the death penalty was au-thorized for 14 military offenses, American Articles of War
of 1776, reprinted in W. Winthrop, Military Law and Prece-dents 961 (reprint 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop); Comment, Rocks and Shoals in a Sea of Otherwise Deep Commit-ment: General Court-Martial Size and Voting Requirements,
35 Nav. L. Rev. 153, 156-158 (1986), the Articles followedthe British example of ensuring the supremacy of civil court
jurisdiction over ordinary capital crimes that were punish-able by the law of the land and were not special military
offenses. 1776 Articles, $ 10, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop964 (requiring commanders, upon application, to exert utmost effort to turn offender over to civil authorities). Cf.British Articles of War of 1765, $ 11, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 937 (same). That provision was deemed protectionenough for soldiers, and in 1806 Congress debated and re517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
jected a proposal to remove the death penalty from court-martial jurisdiction. Wiener, Courts-Martial and the Bill of

Rights: The Original Practice I, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 20-21(1958).

Over the next two centuries, Congress expanded court-martial jurisdiction. In 1863, concerned that civil courts
could not function in all places during hostilities, Congressgranted courts-martial jurisdiction of common-law capital
crimes and the authority to impose the death penalty inwartime. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, $ 30, 12 Stat. 736, Rev. Stat.

$ 1342, Art. 58 (1875); Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509,514 (1879). In 1916, Congress granted to the military courts
a general jurisdiction over common-law felonies committedby service members, except for murder and rape committed
within the continental United States during peacetime.Articles of War of 1916, ch. 418, $ 3, Arts. 92-93, 39 Stat. 664.
Persons accused of the latter two crimes were to be turnedover to the civilian authorities. Art. 74, 39 Stat. 662. In
1950, with the passage of the UCMJ, Congress lifted eventhis restriction. Article 118 of the UCMJ describes four
types of murder subject to court-martial jurisdiction, two ofwhich are punishable by death:

"Any person subject to this chapter who, withoutjustification or excuse, unlawfully kills a human being,
when he--"(1) has a premeditated design to kill;

"(2) intends to kill or inflict great bodily harm;"(3) is engaged in an act which is inherently dangerous to another and evinces a wanton disregard of humanlife; or

"(4) is engaged in the perpetration or attempted per-petration of burglary, sodomy, rape, robbery, or aggravated arson;
"is guilty of murder, and shall suffer such punishmentas a court-martial may direct, except that if found guilty

under clause (1) or (4), he shall suffer death or im517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

prisonment for life as a court-martial may direct." 10
U. S. C. $ 918.

So matters stood until 1983, when the CMA confronted
a challenge to the constitutionality of the military capital
punishment scheme in light of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.
238 (1972), and our ensuing death penalty jurisprudence.
Although it held valid most of the death penalty procedures
followed in courts-martial, the court found one fundamental
defect: the failure of either the UCMJ or the RCM to require
that court-martial members "specifically identify the aggravating factors upon which they have relied in choosing to
impose the death penalty." United States v. Matthews, 16
M. J. 354, 379. The court reversed Matthews' death sentence, but ruled that either Congress or the President could
remedy the defect and that the new procedures could be
applied retroactively. Id., at 380-382.

The President responded to Matthews in 1984 with an Executive Order promulgating RCM 1004. In conformity with
10 U. S. C. $ 852(a)(1), the Rule, as amended, requires a unanimous finding that the accused was guilty of a capital offense
before a death sentence may be imposed, RCM 1004(a)(2).
The Rule also requires unanimous findings (1) that at least
one aggravating factor is present and (2) that any extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighed
by any admissible aggravating circumstances, 1004(b).
RCM 1004(c) enumerates 11 categories of aggravating factors sufficient for imposition of the death penalty. The Rule
also provides that the accused is to have "broad latitude to
present evidence in extenuation and mitigation," 1004(b)(3),
and is entitled to have the members of the court-martial instructed to consider all such evidence before deciding upon
a death sentence, 1004(b)(6).

This is the scheme Loving attacks as unconstitutional.
He contends that the Eighth Amendment and the doctrine
of separation of powers require that Congress, and not the

Opinion of the Court
President, make the fundamental policy determination re-specting the factors that warrant the death penalty.

III
A preliminary question in this case is whether the Consti-tution requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges. The Government does not contest the application ofour death penalty jurisprudence to courts-martial, at least
in the context of a conviction under Article 118 for murdercommitted in peacetime within the United States, and we
shall assume that Furman and the case law resulting fromit are applicable to the crime and sentence in question. Cf.
Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958) (analyzing court-martialpunishments under the Eighth Amendment). The Eighth
Amendment requires, among other things, that "a capitalsentencing scheme must `genuinely narrow the class of
persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonablyjustify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the
defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.' "Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988) (quoting Zant
v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)). Some schemes ac-complish that narrowing by requiring that the sentencer find
at least one aggravating circumstance. 484 U. S., at 244.The narrowing may also be achieved, however, in the definition of the capital offense, in which circumstance the require-ment that the sentencer "find the existence of an aggravating
circumstance in addition is no part of the constitutionallyrequired narrowing process."

Id., at 246.Although the Government suggests the contrary, Brief

for United States 11, n. 6, we agree with Loving, on the as-sumption that

Furman applies to this case, that aggravatingfactors are necessary to the constitutional validity of the

military capital punishment scheme as now enacted. Article118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the four
types of murder specified: premeditated and felony murderare punishable by death, 10 U. S. C. $$ 918(1), (4), whereas

517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT
756 LOVING v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
intentional murder without premeditation and murder re-sulting from wanton and dangerous conduct are not,

$$ 918(2), (3). The statute's selection of the two types ofmurder for the death penalty, however, does not narrow the
death-eligible class in a way consistent with our cases.Article 118(4) by its terms permits death to be imposed for
felony murder even if the accused had no intent to kill andeven if he did not do the killing himself. The Eighth
Amendment does not permit the death penalty to be imposedin those circumstances.

Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,801 (1982). As a result, additional aggravating factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to save Article118. We turn to the question whether it violated the principle of separation of powers for the President to prescribe theaggravating factors required by the Eighth Amendment.

Even before the birth of this country, separation of powerswas known to be a defense against tyranny. Montesquieu,

The Spirit of the Laws 151-152 (T. Nugent transl. 1949);1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *146-*147, *269-*270.
Though faithful to the precept that freedom is imperiled ifthe whole of legislative, executive, and judicial power is in
the same hands, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Madi-son) (J. Cooke ed. 1961), the Framers understood that a "hermetic sealing off of the three branches of Government fromone another would preclude the establishment of a Nation
capable of governing itself effectively," Buckley v. Valeo, 424U. S. 1, 120-121 (1976)

(per curiam).

"While the Constitution diffuses power the better tosecure liberty, it also contemplates that practice will

integrate the dispersed powers into a workable gov-ernment. It enjoins upon its branches separateness but
interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity." Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).

Although separation of powers " `d[oes] not mean thatthese [three] departments ought to have no partial agency

in, or no controul over the acts of each other,' " Mistrettav.

United States, 488 U. S. 361, 380-381 (1989) (quoting The
Federalist No. 47, supra, at 325-326 (emphasis deleted)), it
remains a basic principle of our constitutional scheme thatone branch of the Government may not intrude upon the

central prerogatives of another. See Plaut v. Spendthrift
Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 225-226 (1995) (Congress may not
revise judicial determinations by retroactive legislation re-opening judgments);

Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726
(1986) (Congress may not remove executive officers except
by impeachment); INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 954-955
(1983) (Congress may not enact laws without bicameral passage and presentment of the bill to the President); United
States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 147 (1872) (Congress may not
deprive court of jurisdiction based on the outcome of a case
or undo a Presidential pardon). Even when a branch does
not arrogate power to itself, moreover, the separation-ofpowers doctrine requires that a branch not impair another
in the performance of its constitutional duties. Mistretta v.
United States, supra, at 397-408 (examining whether statute
requiring participation of Article III judges in the United
States Sentencing Commission threatened the integrity of
the Judicial Branch); Nixon v. Administrator of General
Services, 433 U. S. 425, 445 (1977) (examining whether law
requiring agency control of Presidential papers disrupted the
functioning of the Executive).

Deterrence of arbitrary or tyrannical rule is not the sole
reason for dispersing the federal power among three
branches, however. By allocating specific powers and responsibilities to a branch fitted to the task, the Framers
created a National Government that is both effective and
accountable. Article I's precise rules of representation,
member qualifications, bicameralism, and voting procedure
make Congress the branch most capable of responsive and

Opinion of the Court
deliberative lawmaking. See Chadha, supra, at 951. Illsuited to that task are the Presidency, designed for the

prompt and faithful execution of the laws and its own legiti-mate powers, and the Judiciary, a branch with tenure and
authority independent of direct electoral control. The clearassignment of power to a branch, furthermore, allows the
citizen to know who may be called to answer for making, ornot making, those delicate and necessary decisions essential
to governance.Another strand of our separation-of-powers jurisprudence,
the delegation doctrine, has developed to prevent Congressfrom forsaking its duties. Loving invokes this doctrine to
question the authority of the President to promulgate RCM1004. The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine
is that the lawmaking function belongs to Congress, U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 1, and may not be conveyed to another
branch or entity. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892).This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress
can make a rule of prospective force. To burden Congresswith all federal rulemaking would divert that branch from
more pressing issues, and defeat the Framers' design ofa workable National Government. Thomas Jefferson observed: "Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in agreat assembly as the details of execution." 5 Works of
Thomas Jefferson 319 (P. Ford ed. 1904) (letter to E. Car-rington, Aug. 4, 1787). See also

A. L. A. Schechter Poultry
Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 529-530 (1935) (recog-nizing "the necessity of adapting legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the nationallegislature cannot deal directly"). This Court established
long ago that Congress must be permitted to delegate toothers at least some authority that it could exercise
itself. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42 (1825).

" `The true distinction . . . is between the delegationof power to make the law, which necessarily involves a

discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring author517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

ity or discretion as to its execution, to be exercisedunder and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be

done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.' "Field, supra, at 693-694, quoting Cincinnati, W. & Z.

R. Co. v. Commissioners of Clinton County, 1 Ohio St.77, 88-89 (1852).

Loving contends that the military death penalty schemeof Article 118 and RCM 1004 does not observe the limits
of the delegation doctrine. He presses his constitutionalchallenge on three fronts. First, he argues that Congress
cannot delegate to the President the authority to prescribeaggravating factors in capital murder cases. Second, he
contends that, even if it can, Congress did not delegate theauthority by implicit or explicit action. Third, Loving believes that even if certain statutory provisions can be con-strued as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle to
guide the President's discretion. Were Loving's premises tobe accepted, the President would lack authority to prescribe
aggravating factors in RCM 1004, and the death sentenceimposed upon him would be unconstitutional.

A
Loving's first argument is that Congress lacks power toallow the President to prescribe aggravating factors in military capital cases because any delegation would be inconsist-ent with the Framers' decision to vest in Congress the power
"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of theland and naval Forces." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 14. At
least in the context of capital punishment for peacetimecrimes, which implicates the Eighth Amendment, this power
must be deemed exclusive, Loving contends. In his view,not only is the determination of aggravating factors a quintessential policy judgment for the Legislature, but the historyof military capital punishment in England and America refutes a contrary interpretation. He asserts that his offensewas not tried in a military court throughout most of English

760 LOVING v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
and American history. It is this historical exclusion ofcommon-law capital crimes from military jurisdiction, he

urges, that must inform our understanding of whetherClause 14 reserves to Congress the power to prescribe what
conduct warrants a death sentence, even if it permits Congress to authorize courts-martial to try such crimes. SeeBrief for Petitioner 42-43; Brief for United States NavyMarine Corps Appellate Defense Division as Amicus Curiae7-12, 19-26. Mindful of the historical dangers of autocratic
military justice and of the limits Parliament set on the peace-time jurisdiction of courts-martial over capital crimes in the
first Mutiny Act, 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5 (1689), and having
experienced the military excesses of the Crown in colonial
America, the Framers harbored a deep distrust of executive
military power and military tribunals. See Reid v. Covert,
354 U. S. 1, 23-24 (1957) (plurality); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S.
228, 232 (1959). It follows, Loving says, that the Framers
intended that Congress alone should possess the power to
decide what aggravating factors justify sentencing a member
of the Armed Forces to death.

We have undertaken before, in resolving other issues, the
difficult task of interpreting Clause 14 by drawing upon English constitutional history. See, e. g., Reid, supra, at 23-30;
O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258, 268-272 (1969) (determining that courts-martial only had jurisdiction of serviceconnected crimes); Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 435,
442-446 (1987) (overruling O'Callahan and taking issue with
its historical analysis). Doing so here, we find that, although there is a grain of truth in Loving's historical arguments, the struggle of Parliament to control military tribunals and the lessons the Framers drew from it are more
complex than he suggests. The history does not require us
to read Clause 14 as granting to Congress an exclusive, nondelegable power to determine military punishments. If anything, it appears that England found security in divided authority, with Parliament at times ceding to the Crown the

Opinion of the Court
task of fixing military punishments. From the English ex-perience the Framers understood the necessity of balancing

efficient military discipline, popular control of a standingarmy, and the rights of soldiers; they perceived the risks
inherent in assigning the task to one part of the Government
to the exclusion of another; and they knew the resultingparliamentary practice of delegation. The Framers' choice

in Clause 14 was to give Congress the same flexibility toexercise or share power as times might demand.

In England after the Norman Conquest, military justicewas a matter of royal prerogative. The rudiments of law in
English military justice can first be seen in the written orders issued by the King for various expeditions. Winthrop
17-18. For example, in 1190 Richard I issued an ordinance
outlining six offenses to which the crusaders would be subject, including two punishable by death: "Whoever shall slay
a man on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man and
thrown into the sea. If he shall slay him on land he shall be
bound to the dead man and buried in the earth." Ordinance
of Richard I--A. D. 1190, reprinted in id., at 903. The first
comprehensive articles of war were those declared by Richard II at Durham in 1385 and Henry V at Mantes in 1419,
which decreed capital offenses that not only served military
discipline but also protected foreign noncombatants from the
ravages of war. T. Meron, Henry's Wars and Shakespeare's
Laws: Perspectives on the Law of War in the Later Middle
Ages 91-93 (1993). Articles of War, sometimes issued by
military commanders acting under royal commission in the
ensuing centuries, Winthrop 19, were not fixed codes, at least
through the 17th century; rather, "each war, each expedition,
had its own edict," which lost force after the cessation of
hostilities and the disbanding of the army that had been
formed. J. Pipon & J. Collier, Manual of Military Law 14
(3d rev. ed. 1863).

Thus, royal ordinances governed the conduct of war, but
the common law did not countenance the enforcement of mili517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tary law in times of peace "when the king's courts [were]open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws

of the land." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *413. Seealso M. Hale, History of the Common Law of England 25-27
(C. Gray ed. 1971) (describing efforts of Parliament and the
common-law courts to limit the jurisdiction of the militaryCourts of the Constable and the Marshal).

"The Common Law made no distinction between the
crimes of soldiers and those of civilians in time of peace.All subjects were tried alike by the same civil courts, so

`if a life-guardsman deserted, he could only be sued for
breach of contract, and if he struck his officer he wasonly liable to an indictment or action of battery.' "

Reid, supra, at 24, n. 44 (quoting 2 J. Campbell, Lives ofthe Chief Justices of England 91 (1849)).

See also 1 T. Macaulay, History of England 272 (n. d.) (herein-after Macaulay).

The triumph of civil jurisdiction was not absolute, how-ever. The political disorders of the 17th century ushered in
periods of harsh military justice, with soldiers and at times
civilian rebels punished, even put to death, under the summary decrees of courts-martial. See C. Clode, Administration of Justice Under Military and Martial Law 20-42 (1872)
(hereinafter Clode). Cf. Petition of Right of 1627, 3 Car. I,
ch. 1 (protesting court-martial abuses). Military justice was
brought under the rule of parliamentary law in 1689, when
William and Mary accepted the Bill of Rights requiring Parliament's consent to the raising and keeping of armies. In
the Mutiny Act of 1689, Parliament declared the general
principle that "noe Man may be forejudged of Life or Limbe
or subjected to any kinde of punishment by Martiall Law or
in any other manner then by the Judgement of his Peeres
and according to the knowne and Established Laws of this
Realme," but decreed that "Soldiers who shall Mutiny or

stirr up Sedition or shall desert Their Majestyes Service bebrought to a more Exemplary and speedy Punishment than

the usuall Forms of Law will allow," and "shall suffer Deathor such other Punishment as by a Court-Martiall shall be
Inflicted." 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5.In one sense, as Loving wants to suggest, the Mutiny Act
was a sparing exercise of parliamentary authority, since onlythe most serious domestic offenses of soldiers were made
capital, and the militia was exempted. See Solorio, supra,at 442. He misunderstands the Mutiny Act of 1689, however, in arguing that it bespeaks a special solicitude for therights of soldiers and a desire of Parliament to exclude Executive power over military capital punishment.The Mutiny Act, as its name suggests, came on the heels of
the mutiny of Scottish troops loyal to James II. 3 Macaulay45-49. The mutiny occurred at a watershed time. Menaced by great continental powers, England had come to agrudging recognition that a standing army, long decried as
an instrument of despotism, had to be maintained on its soil.The mutiny cast in high relief the dangers to the polity of a
standing army turned bad. Macaulay describes the senti-ment of the time:

"There must then be regular soldiers; and, if there wereto be regular soldiers, it must be indispensable, both to
their efficiency, and to the security of every other class,that they should be kept under a strict discipline. An
ill disciplined army . . . [is] formidable only to the country which it is paid to defend. A strong line of demarca-tion must therefore be drawn between the soldiers and

the rest of the community. For the sake of public freedom, they must, in the midst of freedom, be placed undera despotic rule. They must be subject to a sharper

penal code, and to a more stringent code of procedure,than are administered by the ordinary tribunals."

Opinion of the Court
The Mutiny Act, then, was no measure of leniency for sol-diers. With its passage, "the Army of William III. was governed under a severer Code than that made by his predeces-sors under the Prerogative authority of the Crown. The
Mutiny Act, without displacing the Articles of War and those
Military Tribunals under which the Army had hitherto beengoverned, gave statutory sanction to the infliction of Capital

Punishments for offences rather Political than Military, andwhich had rarely been so punished under Prerogative authority." Clode 9-10. See also Duke & Vogel, The Consti-tution and the Standing Army: Another Problem of CourtMartial Jurisdiction, 13 Vand. L. Rev. 435, 443, and n. 40
(1960) (noting that the Articles of War of 1662 and 1686
prohibited the infliction in peacetime of punishment costing

life or limb). Indeed, it was the Crown that later tempered
the excesses of courts-martial wielding the power of capital
punishment. It did so by stipulating in the Articles of
War (which remained a matter of royal prerogative) that all
capital sentences be sent to it for revision or approval.
Clode 9-10.

Popular suspicion of the standing army persisted, 5 Macaulay 253-273, 393, and Parliament authorized the Mutiny Acts
only for periods of six months and then a year, 3 id., at 51-53.
But renewed they were time and again, and Parliament
would alter the power of courts-martial to impose the death
penalty for peacetime offenses throughout the next century.
It withdrew the power altogether in 1713, 12 Anne, ch. 13,

$ 1, only to regret the absence of the penalty during the rebellion of 1715, Clode 49. The third of the Mutiny Acts of
1715 subjected the soldier to capital punishment for a wide
array of peacetime offenses related to political disorder and
troop discipline. Id., at 50. And, for a short time in the
18th century, Parliament allowed the Crown to invest
courts-martial with a general criminal jurisdiction over soldiers even at home, placing no substantive limit on the penalties that could be imposed; until 1718, that jurisdiction was

superior to civil courts. Id., at 52-53. The propriety ofthat general jurisdiction within the kingdom was questioned,

and the jurisdiction was withdrawn in 1749. Id., at 53.Nevertheless, even as it continued to adjust the scope of
military jurisdiction at home, Parliament entrusted broad
powers to the Crown to define and punish military crimesabroad. In 1713, it gave statutory sanction to the Crown's

longstanding practice of issuing Articles of War without lim-iting the kind of punishments that might be imposed; and, in
the same Act, it delegated the power to "erect and constituteCourts Martial with Power to try hear and determine any
Crime or Offence by such Articles of War and inflict Penalties by Sentence or Judgement of the same in any of Her
Majesties Dominions beyond the Seas or elsewhere beyond
the Seas (except in the Kingdom of Ireland) . . . as might
have been done by Her Majesties Authority beyond the Seas
in Time of War." 12 Anne, ch. 13, $ 43; Winthrop 20. Cf.
Duke & Vogel, supra, at 444 (noting that Parliament in 1803
gave statutory authority to the Crown to promulgate Articles of War applicable to troops stationed in England as well).
See Solorio, 483 U. S., at 442 (discussing a provision in the
British Articles of War of 1774 providing court-martial jurisdiction of civilian offenses by soldiers).

As Loving contends, and as we have explained elsewhere,
the Framers well knew this history, and had encountered
firsthand the abuses of military law in the colonies. See
Reid, 354 U. S., at 27-28. As many were themselves veterans of the Revolutionary War, however, they also knew the
imperatives of military discipline. What they distrusted
were not courts-martial per se, but military justice dispensed
by a commander unchecked by the civil power in proceedings
so summary as to be lawless. The latter was the evil that
caused Blackstone to declare that "martial law"--by which
he, not observing the modern distinction between military
and martial law, meant decrees of courts-martial disciplining
soldiers in wartime--"is built upon no settled principles, but

Opinion of the Court
is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, [and] is, as Sir MatthewHale observes, in truth and reality no law, but something

indulged rather than allowed as a law." 1 Blackstone's Com-mentaries *413. See also Hale, History of the Common Law
of England, at 26-27; Clode 21 (military law in early 17thcentury England amounted to "the arbitrary right to punishor destroy, without legal trial, any assumed delinquent").

The partial security Englishmen won against such abuse in1689 was to give Parliament, preeminent guardian of the
British constitution, primacy in matters of military law.This fact does not suggest, however, that a legislature's
power must be exclusive. It was for Parliament, as it did in
the various Mutiny Acts, to designate as the times required
what peacetime offenses by soldiers deserved the punishment of death; and it was for Parliament, as it did in 1713,
to delegate the authority to define wartime offenses and devise their punishments, including death. The Crown received the delegated power and the concomitant responsibility for its prudent exercise. The lesson from the English
constitutional experience was that Parliament must have the
primary power to regulate the Armed Forces and to determine the punishments that could be imposed upon soldiers
by courts-martial. That was not inconsistent, however, with
the further power to divide authority between it and the
Crown as conditions might warrant.

Far from attempting to replicate the English system, of
course, the Framers separated the powers of the Federal
Government into three branches to avoid dangers they
thought latent or inevitable in the parliamentary structure.
The historical necessities and events of the English constitutional experience, though, were familiar to them and inform
our understanding of the purpose and meaning of constitutional provisions. As we have observed before, with this
experience to consult they elected not to "freeze courtmartial usage at a particular time" for all ages following,
Solorio, supra, at 446, nor did they deprive Congress of the

Opinion of the Court
services of the Executive in establishing rules for the gover-nance of the military, including rules for capital punishment.

In the words of Alexander Hamilton, the power to regulatethe Armed Forces, like other powers related to the common
defense, was given to Congress

"without limitation: Because it is impossible to foresee
or define the extent and variety of national exigencies,or the corresponding extent & variety of the means

which may be necessary to satisfy them. The circum-stances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite,
and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely
be imposed on the power to which the care of it is com-mitted. This power ought to be co-extensive with all

the possible combinations of such circumstances; andought to be under the direction of the same councils,
which are appointed to preside over the commondefence." The Federalist No. 23, at 147 (emphasis
deleted).
The later-added Bill of Rights limited this power to some
degree, cf. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plural-ity opinion);

Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300 (1983),
but did not alter the allocation to Congress of the "primaryresponsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights of

servicemen against the needs of the military," Solorio, 483
U. S., at 447-448.Under Clause 14, Congress, like Parliament, exercises a

power of precedence over, not exclusion of, Executive au-thority. Cf.

United States v. Eliason, 16 Pet. 291, 301 (1842)
("The power of the executive to establish rules and regulations for the government of the army, is undoubted"). This
power is no less plenary than other Article I powers, Solorio,
supra, at 441, and we discern no reasons why Congress
should have less capacity to make measured and appropriate
delegations of this power than of any other, see Skinner v.
Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U. S. 212, 220-221 (1989)

Opinion of the Court
(Congress may delegate authority under the taxing power);cf.

Lichter v. United States, 334 U. S. 742, 778 (1948) (general
rule is that "[a] constitutional power implies a power of dele-gation of authority under it sufficient to effect its purposes")

(emphasis deleted). Indeed, it would be contrary to precedent and tradition for us to impose a special limitation onthis particular Article I power, for we give Congress the

highest deference in ordering military affairs. Rostker v.
Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981). And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander inChief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion and

authority. We decline to import into Clause 14 a restrictive
nondelegation principle that the Framers left out.

There is no absolute rule, furthermore, against Congress'
delegation of authority to define criminal punishments. We
have upheld delegations whereby the Executive or an independent agency defines by regulation what conduct will be
criminal, so long as Congress makes the violation of regulations a criminal offense and fixes the punishment, and the
regulations "confin[e] themselves within the field covered by
the statute." United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, 518
(1911). See also Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160 (1991).
The exercise of a delegated authority to define crimes may
be sufficient in certain circumstances to supply the notice to
defendants the Constitution requires. See M. Kraus &
Bros., Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 614, 622 (1946). In the
circumstances presented here, so too may Congress delegate
authority to the President to define the aggravating factors
that permit imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations providing the narrowing of the death-eligible class
that the Eighth Amendment requires.

In 1950, Congress confronted the problem of what criminal
jurisdiction would be appropriate for Armed Forces of colossal size, stationed on bases that in many instances were small
societies unto themselves. Congress, confident in the procedural protections of the UCMJ, gave to courts-martial juris517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
diction of the crime of murder. Cf. Solorio, supra, at 450-451 (Congress may extend court-martial jurisdiction to any

criminal offense committed by a service member during hisperiod of service). It further declared the law that service
members who commit premeditated and felony murder maybe sentenced to death by a court-martial. There is nothing
in the constitutional scheme or our traditions to prohibitCongress from delegating the prudent and proper implementation of the capital murder statute to the President actingas Commander in Chief.

B
Having held that Congress has the power of delegation,we further hold that it exercised the power in Articles 18 and

56 of the UCMJ. Article 56 specifies that "[t]he punishmentwhich a court-martial may direct for an offense may not
exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for thatoffense." 10 U. S. C. $ 856. Article 18 states that a courtmartial "may, under such limitations as the President mayprescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the
UCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically au-thorized by" the Code. $ 818. As the Court of Military Appeals pointed out in Curtis, for some decades the Presidenthas used his authority under these Articles to increase the
penalties for certain noncapital offenses if aggravatingcircumstances are present. For example, by regulation,
deserters who are apprehended are punished more severelythan those who surrender; drunken drivers suffer a harsher
fate if they cause an accident resulting in the death of a vic-tim; and the punishment of thieves is graded by the value of
the stolen goods. See Curtis, 32 M. J., at 261. The Presi-dent has thus provided more precision in sentencing than is
provided by the statute, while remaining within statutorybounds. This past practice suggests that Articles 18 and 56
support as well an authority in the President to restrict thedeath sentence to murders in which certain aggravating
circumstances have been established.

770 LOVING v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
There is yet a third provision of the UCMJ indicative ofcongressional intent to delegate this authority to the President. Article 36 of the UCMJ, which gives the Presidentthe power to make procedural rules for courts-martial,
provides:

"Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including
modes of proof, for [courts martial] . . . may be pre-scribed by the President by regulations which shall, so

far as he considers practicable, apply the principles oflaw and the rules of evidence generally recognized in
the trial of criminal cases in the United States district
courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistentwith this chapter." 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a).

Although the language of Article 36 seems further afield
from capital aggravating factors than that of Article 18 or
56, it is the provision that a later Congress identified as thesource of Presidential authority to prescribe these factors.

In 1985, Congress enacted Article 106a of the UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 906a, which authorized the death penalty for espionage. The Article requires a finding of an aggravating fac-tor if the accused is to be sentenced to death; it enumerates
three such factors, but allows death to be decreed on "[a]nyother factor that may be prescribed by the President by
regulations under section 836 of this title (article 36)."

$ 906a(c)(4). Article 106a itself, then, is premised on thePresident's having authority under Article 36 to prescribe

capital aggravating factors, and " `[s]ubsequent legislationdeclaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great
weight in statutory construction.' " Consumer Product
Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118,
n. 13 (1980) (quoting Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395
U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969)). Whether or not Article 36 would
stand on its own as the source of the delegated power, we
hold that Articles 18, 36, and 56 together give clear authority
to the President for the promulgation of RCM 1004.

771Cite as: 517 U. S. 748 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Loving points out that the three Articles were enacted aspart of the UCMJ in 1950, well before the need for eliminating absolute discretion in capital sentencing was establishedin Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), and the cases
that followed. (Slight amendments to the Articles havebeen made since but are not relevant here.) In 1950, he argues, Congress could not have understood that it was givingthe President the authority to bring an otherwise invalid
capital murder statute in line with Eighth Amendment stric-tures. Perhaps so, but

Furman did not somehow undo theprior delegation. What would have been an act of leniency

by the President prior to Furman may have become a con-stitutional necessity thereafter, see

supra, at 755-756, butthe fact remains the power to prescribe aggravating circumstances has resided with the President since 1950.

C
It does not suffice to say that Congress announced its willto delegate certain authority. Congress as a general rule

must also "lay down by legislative act an intelligible princi-ple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed
to conform." J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States,276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928);

Touby, 500 U. S., at 165. Theintelligible-principle rule seeks to enforce the understanding

that Congress may not delegate the power to make laws andso may delegate no more than the authority to make policies
and rules that implement its statutes. Field, 143 U. S., at693-694. Though in 1935 we struck down two delegations
for lack of an intelligible principle, A. L. A. Schecter Poultry
Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), and Panama
Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we have sinceupheld, without exception, delegations under standards

phrased in sweeping terms. See, e. g., National Broadcast-ing Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 216-217, 225-226
(1943) (upholding delegation to the Federal CommunicationsCommission to regulate radio broadcasting according to

Opinion of the Court
"public interest, convenience, or necessity"). Had the dele-gations here called for the exercise of judgment or discretion

that lies beyond the traditional authority of the President,Loving's last argument that Congress failed to provide guiding principles to the President might have more weight. We
find no fault, however, with the delegation in this case.In

United States v. Curtis, the Court of Military Appeals
discerned a principle limiting the President's discretion todefine aggravating factors for capital crimes in Article 36:

namely, the directive that regulations the President pre-scribes must "apply the principles of law . . . generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent
with this chapter," 10 U. S. C. $ 836(a). We think, however,
that the question to be asked is not whether there was any
explicit principle telling the President how to select aggravating factors, but whether any such guidance was needed,
given the nature of the delegation and the officer who is to
exercise the delegated authority. First, the delegation is set
within boundaries the President may not exceed. Second,
the delegation here was to the President in his role as Commander in Chief. Perhaps more explicit guidance as to how
to select aggravating factors would be necessary if delegation were made to a newly created entity without independent authority in the area. Cf. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 374-
379 (upholding delegation to the United States Sentencing
Commission because of detailed congressional directives
channeling agency discretion). The President's duties as
Commander in Chief, however, require him to take responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, including the courts-martial. The delegated duty, then, is interlinked with duties already assigned to the President by
express terms of the Constitution, and the same limitations
on delegation do not apply "where the entity exercising the
delegated authority itself possesses independent authority
over the subject matter," United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
544, 556-557 (1975). See also United States v. CurtissWright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319-322 (1936). Cf.
Swaim v. United States, 165 U. S. 553, 557-558 (1897) (Presi-dent has inherent authority to convene courts-martial).

Like the Court of Military Appeals, Curtis, 32 M. J., at 263,
n. 9, we need not decide whether the President would haveinherent power as Commander in Chief to prescribe aggravating factors in capital cases. Once delegated that powerby Congress, the President, acting in his constitutional office
of Commander in Chief, had undoubted competency toprescribe those factors without further guidance. "The
military constitutes a specialized community governed by
a separate discipline from that of the civilian," Orloff v.
Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953), and the President can
be entrusted to determine what limitations and conditions
on punishments are best suited to preserve that special
discipline.

It is hard to deem lawless a delegation giving the President broad discretion to prescribe rules on this subject.
From the early days of the Republic, the President has had
congressional authorization to intervene in cases where
courts-martial decreed death. American Articles of War of
1806, Art. 65, reprinted in Winthrop 976, 982. It would be
contradictory to say that Congress cannot further empower
him to limit by prospective regulation the circumstances in
which courts-martial can impose a death sentence. Specific
authority to make rules for the limitation of capital punishment contributes more toward principled and uniform military sentencing regimes than does case-by-case intervention,
and it provides greater opportunity for congressional oversight and revision.

Separation-of-powers principles are vindicated, not disserved, by measured cooperation between the two political
branches of the Government, each contributing to a lawful
objective through its own processes. The delegation to the
President as Commander in Chief of the authority to pre517US3$59L 02-07-99 19:16:27 PAGES OPINPGT

scribe aggravating factors was in all respects consistent withthese precepts, and the promulgation of RCM 1004 was well

within the delegated authority. Loving's sentence was law-ful, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

As Justice Scalia correctly points out, petitioner has notchallenged the power of the tribunal to try him for a capital

offense. Post, at 775. It is important to add to this obser-vation that petitioner's first victim was a member of the
Armed Forces on active duty and that the second was a re-tired serviceman who gave petitioner a ride from the barracks on the same night as the first killing. Brief for United
States 5. On these facts, this does not appear to be a case
in which petitioner could appropriately have raised the question whether the holding in Solorio v. United States, 483
U. S. 435 (1987), should be extended to reach the imposition
of the death penalty for an offense that did not have the
"service connection" required prior to the change in the law
effected in that case. Id., at 451 (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment).

The question whether a "service connection" requirement
should obtain in capital cases is an open one both because
Solorio was not a capital case, and because Solorio's review
of the historical materials would seem to undermine any contention that a military tribunal's power to try capital offenses must be as broad as its power to try noncapital ones.
See id., at 442-446. Moreover, the question is a substantial
one because, when the punishment may be death, there are
particular reasons to ensure that the men and women of the
Armed Forces do not by reason of serving their country
receive less protection than the Constitution provides for
civilians.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
As a consequence of my conclusion that the "serviceconnection" requirement has been satisfied here, I join not

only the Court's analysis of the delegation issue, but also itsdisposition of the case. By joining in the Court's opinion,
however, I do not thereby accept the proposition that our
decision in Solorio must be understood to apply to cap-ital offenses. Nor do I understand the Court's decision to

do so. That question, as I have explained, remains to bedecided.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join the Court's opinion, except that with respect to Part
IV thereof I join only subparts B and C.The discussion of English history that features so prominently in the Court's discussion of Congress's power to grant
the authority at issue to the President is in my view irrelevant. To be sure, there is ample precedent in our cases for
looking to the history of English courts-martial--but not
where the question is of the sort before us today. We have
surveyed that history for the purpose of establishing the permissible scope of the jurisdiction of military tribunals over
certain classes of defendants and offenses, see, e. g., Solorio
v. United States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228, 232 (1959); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1,
23-27 (1957) (plurality); see also Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S.
733, 745 (1974). This case does not present such a question.
Petitioner does not assert that tradition establishes his offense to be, in its nature, beyond the jurisdiction of military
courts, or that courts-martial are historically incapable of adjudicating capital offenses. His arguments are altogether
different: that Congress cannot authorize the President to
establish "aggravating factors" designed to carry out the
narrowing function that (we assume) is necessary for imposition of a capital sentence; and that, even if Congress can
give the President authority to perform this function, such

776 LOVING v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Scalia, J.
authorization has not been effected by the statutes uponwhich the Government relies.

I do not see how consideration of those arguments profitsfrom analysis of the historical sharing of power between Parliament and the English throne. William and Mary's acceptance of the Bill of Rights, and Parliament's enactment of theMutiny Act of 1689, see

ante, at 762-765, are presumably
significant occurrences for students of the unwritten Englishconstitution. Our written Constitution does not require us

to trace out that history; it provides, in straightforward fash-ion, that "The Congress shall have Power . . . To make Rules
for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
Forces," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 14, and as the Court
notes, see ante, at 767-768, it does not set forth any special
limitation on Congress's assigning to the President the task
of implementing the laws enacted pursuant to that power.
And it would be extraordinary simply to infer such a special
limitation upon tasks given to the President as Commander
in Chief, where his inherent powers are clearly extensive.

In drafting the Constitution, the Framers were not seeking to replicate in America the government of England; indeed, they set their plan of government out in writing in
part to make clear the ways in which it was different from
the one it replaced. The Court acknowledges this, see ante,
at 766, but nonetheless goes on to treat the form of English
government as relevant to determining the limitations upon
Clause 14's grant of power to Congress. I would leave this
historical discussion aside. While it is true, as the Court
demonstrates, that the scheme of assigned responsibility
here conforms to English practices, that is so not because
Clause 14 requires such conformity, but simply because what
seemed like a good arrangement to Parliament has seemed
like a good arrangement to Congress as well.

I have one point of definition or conceptualization, which
applies to those portions of the opinion that I have joined.
While it has become the practice in our opinions to refer to

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
"unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority" versus"lawful delegations of legislative authority," in fact the latter

category does not exist. Legislative power is nondelegable.Congress can no more "delegate" some of its Article I power
to the Executive than it could "delegate" some to one of itscommittees. What Congress does is to

assign responsibil-ities to the Executive; and when the Executive undertakes

those assigned responsibilities it acts, not as the "delegate"of Congress, but as the agent of the People. At some point
the responsibilities assigned can become so extensive and sounconstrained that Congress has in effect delegated its legislative power; but until that point of excess is reached thereexists, not a "lawful" delegation, but no delegation at all.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
It is not clear to me that the extensive rules we have de-veloped under the Eighth Amendment for the prosecution of

civilian capital cases, including the requirement of proof ofaggravating factors, necessarily apply to capital prosecutions
in the military, cf. Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300-302(1983), and this Court has never so held, see

Schick v. Reed,419 U. S. 256, 260 (1974).* I am therefore not certain that

this case even raises a delegation question, for if Loving canconstitutionally be sentenced to death without proof of aggravating factors, he surely cannot claim that the Presidentviolated the Constitution by promulgating aggravating factors that afforded more protection than that to which Lovingis constitutionally entitled.

Like the majority, I conclude that the Government prevailseven if we assume, without deciding, that aggravating factors are required in this context. There is abundant author*Although the applicability of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972),
and its progeny to the military is an open question, the United States
surprisingly makes no argument that the military is exempt from the byzantine rules that we have imposed upon the States in their administration
of the death penalty.

ity for according Congress and the President sufficient de-ference in the regulation of military affairs to uphold the

delegation here, and I see no need to resort to our nonmili-tary separation-of-powers and "delegation doctrine" cases in
reaching this conclusion. I write separately to explain that
by concurring in the judgment in this case, I take no positionwith respect to Congress' power to delegate authority or otherwise alter the traditional separation of powers outside themilitary context.

In light of Congress' express constitutional authorityto regulate the Armed Forces, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,
cl. 14, and the unique nature of the military's mission, we
have afforded an unparalleled degree of deference to congressional action governing the military. See Rostker v.
Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981). "[I]t is the primary
business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight
wars should the occasion arise," United States ex rel. Toth v.
Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 17 (1955), and this Court has recognized the limits on its own competence in advancing this core
national interest, see Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10
(1973). Mindful of the factors that "differentiate military
society from civilian society," we have concluded that the
Constitution permits Congress "to legislate both with
greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules by which the former shall be governed than it
is when prescribing rules for the latter." Parker v. Levy,
417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974). This heightened deference extends not only to congressional action but also to executive
action by the President, who by virtue of his constitutional
role as Commander in Chief, see U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2,
cl. 1, possesses shared authority over military discipline.
See Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 510 (1975) ("The
responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces
shall attend to th[e] business [of fighting or preparing to fight
wars] rests with Congress and with the President") (citations
omitted). See also Brown v. Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 360 (1980)

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
("Both Congress and this Court have found that the specialcharacter of the military requires civilian authorities to accord military commanders some flexibility in dealing withmatters that affect internal discipline and morale. In construing a statute that touches on such matters, therefore,
courts must be careful not to `circumscribe the authority ofmilitary commanders to an extent never intended by Congress' ") (citations omitted). Under these and many simi-lar cases reviewing legislative and executive control of the
military, the sentencing scheme at issue in this case, andthe manner in which it was created, are constitutionally
unassailable.

On a separate point, I agree with Justice Scalia that
the majority's extended analysis of the division of authority
between the English Parliament and the Crown with regard
to regulation of the military, see ante, at 759-766, has no
relevance to this case. It is true that we frequently consult
English history and common law in attempting to determine
the content of constitutional provisions, but the majority fails
to cite a single separation-of-powers case in which we have
relied on the structure of the English Government in attempting to understand the governmental structure erected
by the Framers of the Constitution. Nor does the majority
cite any historical evidence, whether from the constitutional
debates, the Federalist Papers, or some other source, that
demonstrates that the Framers sought to embrace, or at
least actively considered, the English system of shared
power over the military. If the majority pointed to some
basis for conducting the inquiry that it does, I might be willing to accept its analysis. Instead, the majority repeatedly
substitutes ipse dixit for historical evidence. See, e. g.,
ante, at 761 ("From the English experience the Framers . . .
knew the . . . parliamentary practice of delegation" and "[t]he
Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress the same
flexibility to exercise or share power"); ante, at 765 ("the
Framers well knew this history"); ante, at 766 ("The histori517US3$59N 02-07-99 19:16:28 PAGES OPINPGT

understanding of the purpose and meaning of constitutionalprovisions"). I have no doubt that the Framers were well
versed in English history. But it is too simplistic for pur-poses of constitutional analysis to draw conclusions about the
allocation of constitutional authority among the branches ofthe United States Government from mere speculation about
the Framers' familiarity with English military history andthe significance that they attached to it.

781OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Syllabus

AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v. NATIONALLABOR RELATIONS BOARD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 95-668. Argued April 22, 1996--Decided June 3, 1996
The day after petitioner Auciello Iron Works's outstanding contract offer

was accepted by its employees' collective-bargaining representative
(Union), Auciello disavowed the agreement because of its good-faith
doubt, based on knowledge acquired before the offer's acceptance, that
a majority of its employees supported the Union. The National Labor
Relations Board ruled, inter alia, that Auciello's withdrawal from it was
an unfair labor practice in violation of the National Labor Relations Act
and ordered that the agreement be reduced to a formal written instrument. The First Circuit enforced the order as reasonable.

Held: The Board reasonably concluded that an employer commits an unfair labor practice when it disavows a collective-bargaining agreement
because of a good-faith doubt about a union's majority status at the time
the contract was made, when the doubt arises from facts known to the
employer before the union accepted its contract offer. Pp. 785-792.

(a) In its efforts to achieve the Act's object of industrial peace and
stability fostered by collective-bargaining relationships, see, e. g., Fall
River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U. S. 27, 38, the Board
has held that a union is entitled to, inter alia, a conclusive presumption
of majority status during a collective-bargaining agreement's term, up
to three years, see, e. g., NLRB v. Burns Int'l Security Services, Inc.,
406 U. S. 272, 290, n. 12. Upon the contract's expiration, the employer
may rebut the presumption of majority status by showing that it has a
good-faith doubt, founded on a sufficient objective basis, of the union's
majority support. NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S.
775, 778. Auciello's assertion that an employer may raise the latter
defense even after a contract period has apparently begun to run upon
a union's acceptance of an outstanding offer is rejected. Pp. 785-787.

(b) The same need for repose that first prompted the Board to adopt
the rule presuming a union's majority status during its collectivebargaining agreement's term also led the Board in this case to rule out
an exception for the benefit of an employer with doubts arising from
facts antedating the contract. The Board's judgment in the matter is
entitled to prevail. Auciello's argument for case-by-case determinations of the appropriate time for asserting a good-faith doubt in place of

782 AUCIELLO IRON WORKS, INC. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
the Board's bright-line rule cutting off the opportunity at the moment
of apparent contract formation fails to point up anything unreasonable
in the Board's position. Its approach generally allows companies an
adequate chance to act on their preacceptance doubts before contract
formation, and Auciello's view would encourage bad-faith bargaining by
employers. The Board could reasonably conclude that giving employers flexibility in raising their good-faith doubts would not be worth
skewing bargaining relationships by such one-sided leverage, and the
fact that any collective-bargaining agreement might be vulnerable to
such a postformation challenge would hardly serve the Act's goal of
achieving industrial peace by promoting stable collective-bargaining
relationships. Moreover, rejection of the Board's position is not compelled by the statutory right of employees to bargain collectively
through representatives of their own choosing and to refrain from doing
so. The Board is entitled to suspicion when faced with an employer's
benevolence as its workers' champion against their certified union, and
there is nothing unreasonable in giving a short leash to an employer as
vindicator of its employees' organizational freedom. Pp. 787-790.

(c) Garment Workers v. NLRB, 366 U. S. 731, 738-739, does not compel reversal; its rule concerning recognition agreements is not inconsistent with this decision. The Board reasonably found an employer's precontractual, good-faith doubt inadequate to support an exception to the
conclusive presumption arising at the moment a collective-bargaining
contract offer has been accepted. Pp. 791-792.

doubt about a union's majority status at the time the con-tract was made, when the doubt arises from facts known to

period in question. After a union election in 1977, theNLRB certified Shopmen's Local No. 501, a/w International
Association of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental IronWorkers, AFL-CIO (Union), as the collective-bargaining
representative of Auciello's employees. Over the followingyears, the company and the Union were able to negotiate a
series of collective-bargaining agreements, one of which ex-pired on September 25, 1988. Negotiations for a new one
were unsuccessful throughout September and October 1988,however, and when Auciello and the Union had not made a
new contract by October 14, 1988, the employees went onstrike. Negotiations continued, nonetheless, and, on November 17, 1988, Auciello presented the Union with a com-plete contract proposal. On November 18, 1988, the picketing stopped, and nine days later, on a Sunday evening, theUnion telegraphed its acceptance of the outstanding offer.
The very next day, however, Auciello told the Union that itdoubted that a majority of the bargaining unit's employees
supported the Union, and for that reason disavowed thecollective-bargaining agreement and denied it had any duty
to continue negotiating. Auciello traced its doubt to knowl-edge acquired before the Union accepted the contract offer,
including the facts that 9 employees had crossed the picket

line, that 13 employees had given it signed forms indicatingtheir resignation from the Union, and that 16 had expressed

dissatisfaction with the Union.In January 1989, the Board's General Counsel issued an
administrative complaint charging Auciello with violation of$$ 8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA.

1 An Administrative Law

Judge found that a contract existed between the parties andthat Auciello's withdrawal from it violated the Act. 303

N. L. R. B. 562 (1991). The Board affirmed the Adminis-trative Law Judge's decision

2; it treated Auciello's claim of

1 Section 8(a) of the NLRA provides:
"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--
"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of
the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;. . . . .

"(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his
employees, subject to the provisions of section 159(a) of this title." 29
U. S. C. $ 158(a).

Section 7 of the Act provides:
"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or
assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives
of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the
purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and
shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except
to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring
membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158(a)(3) of this title." 29 U. S. C. $ 157.

2 The Board has developed a number of criteria to assess whether a

collective-bargaining contract has been formed, see, e. g., Appalachian
Shale Products Co., 121 N. L. R. B. 1160 (1958), which may not always
coincide with those that would govern in the general area of contract law,
see Ben Franklin Nat. Bank, 278 N. L. R. B. 986, 993-994 (1986). We
accept for purposes of deciding this case the Board's conclusion that a
contract was formed here within the meaning of the Act. Our review of
this case is thus limited to the narrow question whether an employer may
withdraw from a collective-bargaining contract once formed when it possessed enough evidence to assert a good-faith doubt about the union's majority status at the time of formation.

Auciello has suggested that the contract itself was invalid ab initio
because the Union in fact lacked majority support at the time of accept517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT

good-faith doubt as irrelevant and ordered Auciello to reducethe collective-bargaining agreement to a formal written instrument. Ibid. But when the Board applied to the Courtof Appeals for the First Circuit for enforcement of its order,
the Court of Appeals declined on the ground that the Boardhad not adequately explained its refusal to consider Auciello's defense of good-faith doubt about the Union's majoritystatus. 980 F. 2d 804 (1992). On remand, the Board issued
a supplemental opinion to justify its position, 317 N. L. R. B.364 (1995), and the Court of Appeals thereafter enforced the
order as resting on a "policy choice [both] . . . reasonable and. . . quite persuasive." 60 F. 3d 24, 27 (1995). We granted
certiorari, 516 U. S. 1086 (1996), and now affirm.

A

The object of the National Labor Relations Act is indus-trial peace and stability, fostered by collective-bargaining

agreements providing for the orderly resolution of labordisputes between workers and employees. See 29 U. S. C.

$ 141(b); Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482U. S. 27, 38 (1987) (Fall River Dyeing). To such ends, the
Board has adopted various presumptions about the existenceof majority support for a union within a bargaining unit, the

ance. Because the substantiation required to make this showing is
greater than that required to assert a good-faith doubt, see NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 788, n. 8 (1990), the Board has
not taken a position on whether such a claim could excuse an employer's
decision to repudiate an otherwise valid contract and disavow its duty to
bargain with the union. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 7. Auciello concedes
that it failed to advance this claim in its answer to the General Counsel's
complaint, Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 28, the Board never considered this question,
and Auciello sought certiorari review only of the question whether an employer is bound by a union's acceptance in this context when "the Employer had a reasonable basis for a good faith doubt." Pet. for Cert. i.
Accordingly, we conclude that this question is not properly before us and
decline to address it.

precondition for service as its exclusive representative. Cf.id., at 37-39. The first two are conclusive presumptions. A

union "usually is entitled to a conclusive presumption of ma-jority status for one year following" Board certification as
such a representative. Id., at 37. A union is likewise enti-tled under Board precedent to a conclusive

3 presumption of

majority status during the term of any collective-bargainingagreement, up to three years. See

NLRB v. Burns Int'lSecurity Services, Inc., 406 U. S. 272, 290, n. 12 (1972); see

generally R. Gorman, Basic Text on Labor Law: Unionizationand Collective Bargaining $ 9, pp. 54-59 (1976). "These presumptions are based not so much on an absolute certaintythat the union's majority status will not erode," Fall River
Dyeing, 482 U. S., at 38, as on the need to achieve "stabilityin collective-bargaining relationships."

Ibid. (internal quo-tation marks omitted). They address our fickle nature by

"enabl[ing] a union to concentrate on obtaining and fairlyadministering a collective-bargaining agreement" without
worrying about the immediate risk of decertification and by"remov[ing] any temptation on the part of the employer to
avoid good-faith bargaining" in an effort to undermine unionsupport.

Ibid.There is a third presumption, though not a conclusive one.

At the end of the certification year or upon expiration of thecollective-bargaining agreement, the presumption of majority status becomes a rebuttable one. See NLRB v. CurtinMatheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 778 (1990); see n. 6,
infra. Then, an employer may overcome the presumption(when, for example, defending against an unfair labor practice charge) "by showing that, at the time of [its] refusal tobargain, either (1) the union did not

in fact enjoy majority

3 This presumption may be overcome only in unusual circumstances, see,

support, or (2) the employer had a `good-faith' doubt, foundedon a sufficient objective basis, of the union's majority support." Curtin Matheson, supra, at 778 (emphasis in origi-nal).

4 Auciello asks this Court to hold that it may raise the

latter defense even after a collective-bargaining contract pe-riod has apparently begun to run upon a union's acceptance

of an employer's outstanding offer.

B
The same need for repose that first prompted the Boardto adopt the rule presuming the union's majority status during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement also ledthe Board to rule out an exception for the benefit of an employer with doubts arising from facts antedating the con-tract. The Board said that such an exception would allow
an employer to control the timing of its assertion of good-faith doubt and thus to " `sit' on that doubt and . . . raise it
after the offer is accepted." 317 N. L. R. B., at 370. TheBoard thought that the risks associated with giving employers such "unilatera[l] control [over] a vital part of thecollective-bargaining process,"

ibid., would undermine thestability of the collective-bargaining relationship,

id., at 374,and thus outweigh any benefit that might in theory follow

from vindicating a doubt that ultimately proved to be sound.The Board's judgment in the matter is entitled to prevail.
To affirm its rule of decision in this case, indeed, there is noneed to invoke the full measure of the "considerable defer4 Auciello maintains that Curtin Matheson requires reversal here since
it appears that the employer in that case asserted its good-faith doubt

19-21. But the case is not authority on the issue of timing. The question
presented was whether the Board "in evaluating an employer's claim that
it had a reasonable basis for doubting a union's majority support, must
presume that striker replacements oppose the union." Curtin Matheson,
494 U. S., at 777 (emphasis in original). We did not discuss or consider
whether the timing of the employer's assertion should affect the outcome
of that case, and the decision does not answer that question.

ence" that the Board is due, NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., supra, at 786, by virtue of its charge to develop
national labor policy, Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, 437 U. S.483, 500-501 (1978), through interstitial rulemaking that is

"rational and consistent with the Act," Curtin Matheson,
supra, at 787.It might be tempting to think that Auciello's doubt was

expressed so soon after the apparent contract formation thatlittle would be lost by vindicating that doubt and wiping the
contractual slate clean, if in fact the company can make aconvincing case for the doubt it claims. On this view, the
loss of repose would be slight. But if doubts about the
union's majority status would justify repudiating a contract
one day after its ostensible formation, why should the same
doubt not serve as well a year into the contract's term? Auciello implicitly agrees on the need to provide some cutoff,
but argues that the limit should be expressed as a "reasonable time" to repudiate the contract. Brief for Petitioner
26-32. That is, it seeks case-by-case determinations of the
appropriate time for asserting a good-faith doubt in place of
the Board's bright-line rule cutting off the opportunity at the
moment of apparent contract formation. Auciello's desire is
natural, but its argument fails to point up anything unreasonable in the Board's position.

The Board's approach generally allows companies an adequate chance to act on their preacceptance doubts before
contract formation, just as Auciello could have acted effectively under the Board's rule in this case. Auciello knew
that the picket line had been crossed and that a number of
its employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the Union
at least nine days before the contract's acceptance, and all of
the resignation forms Auciello received were dated at least
five days before the acceptance date. During the week preceding the apparent formation of the contract, Auciello had
at least three alternatives to doing nothing. It could have
withdrawn the outstanding offer and then, like its employ517us3$60M 02-05-99 13:46:34 PAGES OPINPGT

ees, petitioned for a representation election. See 29 U. S. C.$ 159(c)(1)(A)(ii) (employee petitions); $ 159(c)(1)(B) (employer

petitions); NLRB v. Financial Institution Employees, 475U. S. 192, 198 (1986).

5 "[I]f the Board determines, after investigation and hearing, that a question of representationexists, it directs an election by secret ballot and certifies the

result." Ibid. Following withdrawal, it could also have re-fused to bargain further on the basis of its good-faith doubt,
leaving it to the Union to charge an unfair labor practice,against which it could defend on the basis of the doubt. Cf.
Curtin Matheson, 494 U. S., at 778. And, of course, it couldhave withdrawn its offer to allow it time to investigate while
it continued to fulfill its duty to bargain in good faith withthe Union. The company thus had generous opportunities
to avoid the presumption before the moment of acceptance.There may, to be sure, be cases where the opportunity requires prompt action,6 but labor negotiators are not the leastnimble, and the Board could reasonably have thought the
price of making more time for the sluggish was too high,since it would encourage bad-faith bargaining. As Auciello
would have it, any employer with genuine doubt about aunion's hold on its employees would be invited to go right on
bargaining, with the prospect of locking in a favorable con-tract that it could, if it wished, then challenge. Here, for
example, if Auciello had acted before the Union's telegramby withdrawing its offer and declining further negotiation
based on its doubt (or petitioning for decertification), flameswould have been fanned, and if it ultimately had been obliged

5 We assume, without deciding, that the withdrawal of an offer under
these circumstances could not serve as a basis for the filing of an unfair
labor practice complaint, which might trigger the "blocking charge" rule
that the NLRB concedes would be implicated by an employer's unlawful
withdrawal of recognition. See Brief for Respondent 31, n. 10.

6 We note that in the unusual circumstance in which evidence leading

the employer to harbor such a doubt arises at the same time the union
accepts the offer, the Board has agreed to examine such occurrences on a
case-by-case basis. 317 N. L. R. B. 364, 374-375 (1995).

Opinion of the Court
to bargain further, a favorable agreement would have been
more difficult to obtain. But by saving its challenge until
after a contract had apparently been formed, it could not end
up with a worse agreement than the one it had. The Board
could reasonably say that giving employers some flexibility
in raising their scruples would not be worth skewing bargaining relationships by such one-sided leverage, and the fact
that any collective-bargaining agreement might be vulnerable to such a postformation challenge would hardly serve the
Act's goal of achieving industrial peace by promoting stable
collective-bargaining relationships. Cf. Fall River Dyeing,
482 U. S., at 38-39; Franks Bros. Co. v. NLRB, 321 U. S. 702,
705 (1944).

Nor do we find anything compelling in Auciello's contention that its employees' statutory right "to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing" and to
refrain from doing so, 29 U. S. C. $ 157, compels us to reject
the Board's position. Although we take seriously the Act's
command to respect "the free choice of employees" as well
as to "promot[e] stability in collective-bargaining relationships," Fall River Dyeing, supra, at 38 (internal quotation
marks omitted), we have rejected the position that employers may refuse to bargain whenever presented with evidence
that their employees no longer support their certified union.
"To allow employers to rely on employees' rights in refusing
to bargain with the formally designated union is not conducive to [industrial peace], it is inimical to it." Brooks v.
NLRB, 348 U. S. 96, 103 (1954). The Board is accordingly
entitled to suspicion when faced with an employer's benevolence as its workers' champion against their certified union,
which is subject to a decertification petition from the workers if they want to file one. There is nothing unreasonable
in giving a short leash to the employer as vindicator of its
employees' organizational freedom.

Opinion of the Court

C
Merits aside, Auciello also claims that the precedent of
Garment Workers v. NLRB, 366 U. S. 731 (1961), compels
reversal, but it does not. In Garment Workers, we held that
a bona fide but mistaken belief in a union's majority status
cannot support an employer's agreement purporting to recognize a union newly organized but as yet uncertified. We
upheld the Board's rule out of concern that an employer and
a union could make a deal giving the union " `a marked advantage over any other [union] in securing the adherence of
employees,' " id., at 738 (quoting NLRB v. Pennsylvania
Greyhound Lines, Inc., 303 U. S. 261, 267 (1938)), thereby
distorting the process by which employees elect the bargaining agent of their choice. 366 U. S., at 738-739. Here, in
contrast, the Union continued to enjoy a rebuttable presumption of majority support, and the bargaining unit employees
had ample opportunity to initiate decertification of the Union
but apparently chose not to do so. With entire consistency,
the Board may deny employers the power gained from recognizing a union, even when it flows from a good-faith but mistaken belief in a newly organized union's majority status, and
at the same time deny them the power to disturb collectivebargaining agreements based on a doubt (without more) that
its employees' bargaining agent has retained majority status.
Good-faith belief can neither force a union's precipitate recognition nor destroy a recognized union's contracting authority after the fact by intentional delay. There is, indeed, a
symmetry in the two positions.

RICHARDS et al. v. JEFFERSON COUNTY,ALABAMA,

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of alabama

No. 95-386. Argued March 26, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Petitioners, who are privately employed in Jefferson County, filed a statecourt class action claiming that the county's occupation tax violates the
Federal and Alabama Constitutions. In granting the county partial
summary judgment, the trial court found that petitioners' state claims
were barred by a prior adjudication of the tax in an action brought by
Birmingham's acting finance director and the city itself, consolidated
with a suit by three county taxpayers, see Bedingfield v. Jefferson
County, 527 So. 2d 1270, but that petitioners' federal claims had not been
decided in that case. The county and respondent intervenor argued on
appeal that the federal claims were also barred. The State Supreme
Court agreed, concluding that res judicata applied because petitioners
were adequately represented in the Bedingfield action.

Held: Because petitioners received neither notice of, nor sufficient representation in, the Bedingfield litigation, that adjudication, as a matter of
federal due process, may not bind them and thus cannot bar them from
challenging an allegedly unconstitutional deprivation of their property.
Pp. 797-805.

(a) The traditional rule that an extreme application of state-law res
judicata principles may be inconsistent with the Federal Constitution,
see Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Newport, 247 U. S. 464, 476, reflects
the general consensus that one is not bound by a judgment in litigation
to which he is not a party. Of course, there is an exception from these
principles when there is "privity" between a party to the second case
and a party who is bound by an earlier judgment. Pp. 797-799.

(b) Because the Bedingfield parties gave petitioners no notice that a
suit was pending which would conclusively resolve their legal rights,
that proceeding would have a binding effect on them, as absent parties,
only if it were so devised and applied as to ensure that those present
were of the same class as those absent and that the litigation was so
conducted as to ensure the full and fair consideration of the common
issue. Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 43. Because the Bedingfield action plainly does not fit this description, there is no reason to suppose
that the court therein took care to protect petitioners' interests in the
manner suggested in Hansberry or that the Bedingfield plaintiffs understood their suit to be on behalf of absent taxpayers. Those plaintiffs

did not provide representation sufficient to make up for the fact that
petitioners neither participated in, nor had the opportunity to participate in, the earlier action. Pp. 799-802.

(c) This Court may assume that if petitioners had relied on their taxpayer status to complain about an alleged misuse of public funds or
about other public action having only an indirect impact on their interests, the State would have enjoyed wide latitude in limiting their opportunity to make their case. However, because petitioners present a federal constitutional challenge to the State's attempt to levy personal
funds, the Court is not persuaded that the nature of their actions permits it to deviate from the traditional rule that an extreme application
of state-law res judicata principles violates the Federal Constitution.

Ordinance 1120, which had been adopted in 1987. That ac-tion was dismissed as barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28

U. S. C. $ 1341.1 They then commenced this action in theCircuit Court of Jefferson County.

Petitioners represent a class of all nonfederal employeessubject to the county's tax.

2 Petitioners alleged that the

tax, which contains a lengthy list of exemptions, violates theDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth

Amendment and similar provisions of the Alabama Constitu-tion. Because $10 million of the annual proceeds from the
county tax have been pledged to the Birmingham-Jefferson
Civic Center for a period of 20 years, the court permittedthe center to intervene and support Jefferson County's defense of its tax.

The county moved for summary judgment on the groundthat petitioners' claims were barred by a prior adjudication

of the tax in an earlier action brought by the acting directorof finance for the city of Birmingham and the city itself.
That earlier action had been consolidated for trial with aseparate suit brought by three county taxpayers, and the
Supreme Court of Alabama upheld the tax in the result-ing appeal. See

Bedingfield v. Jefferson County, 527 So. 2d
1270 (1988). After examining the course of this prior litigation, the trial court granted the county's motion for summaryjudgment as to the state constitutional claims, but refused

to do so as to the federal claims because they had not beendecided by either the trial court or the Alabama Supreme
Court in Bedingfield.On appeal, the county argued that the federal claims as
well as the state claims were barred by the adjudication in

796 RICHARDS v. JEFFERSON COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
Bedingfield. The Alabama Supreme Court agreed. The
majority opinion noted that in Alabama, as in most States, a
prior judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction precludes the relitigation of a claim if there
is a "substantial identity of the parties" and if the "same
cause of action" is presented in both suits. 662 So. 2d 1127,
1128 (1995). Moreover, the court explained, the prior judgment is generally " `res judicata not only as to all matters
litigated and decided by it, but as to all relevant issues which
could have been but were not raised and litigated in the
suit.' " Ibid. (quoting Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U. S. 726,
735 (1946)).

The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that even though
the opinion in Bedingfield did not mention any federal issue,
the judgment in that case met these requirements. The
court gave three reasons for this conclusion: (1) The complaints in the earlier case had alleged that the county tax
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment and an equal protection issue had been argued
in the appellate briefs, 662 So. 2d, at 1129; (2) the taxpayers
in Bedingfield adequately represented petitioners because
their respective interests were "essentially identical," 662
So. 2d, at 1130; and (3) in pledging tax revenues and issuing
bonds in 1989, the county and the intervenor "could have
relied on Bedingfield as authoritatively establishing that the
county occupational tax was not unconstitutional for the
reasons asserted by the Bedingfield plaintiffs," 662 So. 2d,
at 1130.

Justice Maddox dissented. He agreed with the trial judge
that no federal constitutional claim had been adjudicated in
Bedingfield. 662 So. 2d, at 1130-1131. Moreover, he concluded that the mere fact that the theory advanced by the
petitioners in this case could have been asserted in Bedingfield constituted an insufficient reason for barring this action.

Opinion of the Court
We now conclude that the State Supreme Court's holdingthat petitioners are bound by the adjudication in Bedingfield

deprived them of the due process of law guaranteed by theFourteenth Amendment.

II
State courts are generally free to develop their own rulesfor protecting against the relitigation of common issues

or the piecemeal resolution of disputes. Postal Telegraph
Cable Co. v. Newport, 247 U. S. 464, 475 (1918). We havelong held, however, that extreme applications of the doctrine

of res judicata may be inconsistent with a federal right thatis "fundamental in character."

Id., at 476.4

3 After granting the petition to consider both the equal protection challenge to the tax scheme, and the due process challenge to the Alabama
Supreme Court's conclusion that their claims were barred by the doctrine
of res judicata, we entered an order dismissing the writ to the extent that
it included the equal protection question and directing the parties to address at oral argument only the question whether the application of res
judicata afforded petitioners due process. 516 U. S. 983 (1996). Because
petitioners raised their due process challenge to the application of res judicata in their application for rehearing to the Alabama Supreme Court, that
federal issue has been preserved for our review. See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 85-87, n. 9 (1980).

party to be affected, or some other with whom he is in privity, has litigated

Opinion of the Court
The limits on a state court's power to develop estoppelrules reflect the general consensus " `in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in perso-nam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party
or to which he has not been made a party by service of proc-ess.'

Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 40 (1940). . . . This ruleis part of our `deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.' 18 C. Wright,A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure

$ 4449, p. 417 (1981)." Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755, 761-762 (1989). As a consequence, "[a] judgment or decree
among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them,but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those
proceedings." Id., at 762; Blonder-Tongue Laboratories,
Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 329(1971).

Of course, these principles do not always require one tohave been a party to a judgment in order to be bound by it.
Most notably, there is an exception when it can be said thatthere is "privity" between a party to the second case and a
party who is bound by an earlier judgment. For example, ajudgment that is binding on a guardian or trustee may also
bind the ward or the beneficiaries of a trust. Moreover, al-though there are clearly constitutional limits on the "privity"
exception, the term "privity" is now used to describe variousrelationships between litigants that would not have come
within the traditional definition of that term. See generallyRestatement (Second) of Judgments, ch. 4 (1980) (Parties and
Other Persons Affected by Judgments).In addition, as we explained in

Wilks:

"We have recognized an exception to the general rulewhen, in certain limited circumstances, a person, although not a party, has his interests adequately repre-sented by someone with the same interests who is a
party. See Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 41-42 (1940)

(same); Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 154-155
(1979) (control of litigation on behalf of one of the parties
in the litigation). Additionally, where a special remedial scheme exists expressly foreclosing successive litigation by nonlitigants, as for example in bankruptcy or
probate, legal proceedings may terminate pre-existing
rights if the scheme is otherwise consistent with due
process. See NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U. S.

478 (1988) (nonclaim statute terminating unsubmitted
claims against the estate)." 490 U. S., at 762, n. 2.

Here, the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that res judicata applied because petitioners were adequately represented in the Bedingfield action. 662 So. 2d, at 1130. We
now consider the propriety of that determination.

III
We begin by noting that the parties to the Bedingfield
case failed to provide petitioners with any notice that a suit
was pending which would conclusively resolve their legal
rights. That failure is troubling because, as we explained in
Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306
(1950), the right to be heard ensured by the guarantee of due
process "has little reality or worth unless one is informed
that the matter is pending and can choose for himself
whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest." Id., at
314; Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 812
(1985); Schroeder v. City of New York, 371 U. S. 208, 212-213
(1962). Nevertheless, respondents ask us to excuse the lack
of notice on the ground that petitioners, as the Alabama

800 RICHARDS v. JEFFERSON COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
Supreme Court concluded, were adequately represented in
Bedingfield.5

Our answer is informed by our decision in Hansberry v.
Lee, 311 U. S., at 40-41. There, certain property owners
brought suit to enforce a restrictive covenant that purportedto forbid the sale or lease of any property within a defined

area to "any person of the colored race." Id., at 37-38. By
its terms the covenant was not effective unless signed by theowners of 95 per cent of frontage in the area. At trial, the

defendants proved that the signers of the covenant ownedonly about 54 percent of the frontage. Nevertheless, the
trial court held that the covenant was enforceable becausethe issue had been resolved in a prior suit in which the parties had stipulated that the owners of 95 percent had signed.
Id., at 38 (referring to Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519(1934)).

Despite the fact that the stipulation was untrue, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the second action was barred
by res judicata. See Lee v. Hansberry, 372 Ill. 369, 24
N. E. 2d 37 (1939). Because the plaintiff in the earlier case
had alleged that she was proceeding "on behalf of herself and
on behalf of all other property owners in the district," id., at
372, 24 N. E. 2d, at 39, the Illinois Supreme Court concluded
that all members of that "class," including the defendants
challenging the stipulation in the present action, were bound
by the decree. We reversed.

We recognized the "familiar doctrine . . . that members of
a class not present as parties to the litigation may be bound
by the judgment where they are in fact adequately repre5 Of course, mere notice may not suffice to preserve one's right to be
heard in a case such as the one before us. The general rule is that "[t]he
law does not impose upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the
burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger."
Chase Nat. Bank v. Norwalk, 291 U. S. 431, 441 (1934); but cf. PennCentral Merger and N & W Inclusion Cases, 389 U. S. 486, 505, n. 4 (1968)
(noting that absent parties were invited to intervene by the court).

Opinion of the Court
sented by parties who are present, or . . . the relation-ship between the parties present and those who are absent

is such as legally to entitle the former to stand in judgmentfor the latter."

Hansberry, 311 U. S., at 42-43. We concluded, however, that because the interests of those class
members who had been a party to the prior litigation werein conflict with the absent members who were the defendants

in the subsequent action, the doctrine of representation ofabsent parties in a class suit could not support the decree.

Even assuming that our opinion in Hansberry may be readto leave open the possibility that in some class suits adequate
representation might cure a lack of notice, but cf., id., at 40;
Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S., at 319,
it may not be read to permit the application of res judicata
here. Our opinion explained that a prior proceeding, to
have binding effect on absent parties, would at least have to
be "so devised and applied as to insure that those present
are of the same class as those absent and that the litigation
is so conducted as to insure the full and fair consideration of
the common issue." 311 U. S., at 43; cf. Phillips Petroleum
Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S., at 811-812. It is plain that the Bedingfield action, like the prior proceeding in Hansberry itself,
does not fit such a description.

The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the "taxpayers in the Bedingfield action adequately represented the interests of the taxpayers here," 662 So. 2d, at 1130 (emphasis
added), but the three county taxpayers who were parties in
Bedingfield did not sue on behalf of a class; their pleadings
did not purport to assert any claim against or on behalf of
any nonparties; and the judgment they received did not purport to bind any county taxpayers who were nonparties.
That the acting director of finance for the city of Birmingham
also sued in his capacity as both an individual taxpayer and
a public official does not change the analysis. Even if we
were to assume, as the Alabama Supreme Court did not, that

517us3$61I 02-05-99 16:37:01 PAGES OPINPGT
802 RICHARDS v. JEFFERSON COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
by suing in his official capacity, the finance director intendedto represent the pecuniary interests of all city taxpayers, and

not simply the corporate interests of the city itself, he didnot purport to represent the pecuniary interests of county
taxpayers like petitioners.6As a result, there is no reason to suppose that the Bedingfield court took care to protect the interests of petitionersin the manner suggested in

Hansberry. Nor is there anyreason to suppose that the individual taxpayers in Bedingfield understood their suit to be on behalf of absent countytaxpayers. Thus, to contend that the plaintiffs in Bedingfield somehow represented petitioners, let alone representedthem in a constitutionally adequate manner, would be "to
attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that theyhad assumed to exercise."

Hansberry, 311 U. S., at 46.Because petitioners and the Bedingfield litigants are best

described as mere "strangers" to one another, Martin v.Wilks, 490 U. S., at 762, we are unable to conclude that the
Bedingfield plaintiffs provided representation sufficient tomake up for the fact that petitioners neither participated in,
see Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 154 (1979), norhad the opportunity to participate in, the

Bedingfield action.Accordingly, due process prevents the former from being

bound by the latter's judgment.

Respondents contend that, even if petitioners did not re-ceive the kind of opportunity to make their case in court that

due process would ordinarily ensure, the character of their

Opinion of the Court
action renders the usual constitutional protections inapplica-ble. They contend that invalidation of the occupation tax

would have disastrous consequences on the county, which hasmade substantial commitments of tax revenues based on its
understanding that Bedingfield determined the constitutionality of the tax. Respondents argue that in cases raising apublic issue of this kind, the people may properly be regarded as the real party in interest and thus that petitionersreceived all the process they were due in the

Bedingfield
action.Our answer requires us to distinguish between two types

of actions brought by taxpayers. In one category are cases
in which the taxpayer is using that status to entitle him to
complain about an alleged misuse of public funds, see, e. g.,
Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 486-489 (1923), or
about other public action that has only an indirect impact on
his interests, e. g., Stromberg v. Board of Ed. of Bratenahl,
64 Ohio St. 2d 98, 413 N. E. 2d 1184 (1980), Tallassee v. State
ex rel. Brunson, 206 Ala. 169, 89 So. 514 (1921). As to this
category of cases, we may assume that the States have wide
latitude to establish procedures not only to limit the number
of judicial proceedings that may be entertained but also to
determine whether to accord a taxpayer any standing at all.

Because the guarantee of due process is not a mere form,
however, there obviously exists another category of taxpayer
cases in which the State may not deprive individual litigants
of their own day in court. By virtue of presenting a federal
constitutional challenge to a State's attempt to levy personal
funds, petitioners clearly bring an action of this latter type.
Cf. ibid. (distinguishing between "public" and "private" actions). Indeed, we have previously struck down as a violation of due process a state court's decision denying an
individual taxpayer any practicable opportunity to contest
a tax on federal constitutional grounds. See BrinkerhoffFaris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673 (1930). There,
we explained:

517us3$61I 02-05-99 16:37:01 PAGES OPINPGT
804 RICHARDS v. JEFFERSON COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
"We are not now concerned with the rights of the plain-tiff on the merits, although it may be observed that the

plaintiff 's claim is one arising under the Federal Consti-tution and, consequently, one on which the opinion of the
state court is not final . . . . Our present concern issolely with the question whether the plaintiff has been
accorded due process in the primary sense,--whether ithas had an opportunity to present its case and be heard
in its support. . . . [W]hile it is for the state courts todetermine the adjective as well as the substantive law
of the State, they must, in so doing, accord the partiesdue process of law. Whether acting through its judiciary or through its legislature, a State may not deprivea person of all existing remedies for the enforcement of
a right, which the State has no power to destroy, unlessthere is, or was, afforded to him some real opportunity
to protect it." Id., at 681-682.
In any event, the Alabama Supreme Court did not holdhere that petitioners' suit was of a kind that, under state law,

could be brought only on behalf of the public at large. Cf.
Corprew v. Tallapoosa County, 241 Ala. 492, 3 So. 2d 53(1941) (discussing state statutory quo warranto proceedings).

To conclude that the suit may nevertheless be barred by theprior action in

Bedingfield would thus be to deprive petition-ers of their "chose in action," which we have held to be a

protected property interest in its own right. See Logan v.Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 429-430 (1982); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S., at 812 (relying onMullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306

(1950)); Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S., at 37. Thus, we are notpersuaded that the nature of petitioners' action permits us
to deviate from the traditional rule that an extreme applica-tion of state-law res judicata principles violates the Federal
Constitution.Of course, we are aware that governmental and private
entities have substantial interests in the prompt and deter517us3$61I 02-05-99 16:37:01 PAGES OPINPGT

minative resolution of challenges to important legislation.We do not agree with the Alabama Supreme Court, however, that, given the amount of money at stake, respondentswere entitled to rely on the assumption that the Bedingfield
action "authoritatively establish[ed]" the constitutionality ofthe tax. 662 So. 2d, at 1130. A state court's freedom to
rely on prior precedent in rejecting a litigant's claims doesnot afford it similar freedom to bind a litigant to a prior
judgment to which he was not a party. That general ruleclearly applies when a taxpayer seeks a hearing to prevent
the State from subjecting him to a levy in violation of theFederal Constitution.

V
Because petitioners received neither notice of, nor suffi-cient representation in, the

Bedingfield litigation, that adju-dication, as a matter of federal due process, may not bind

them and thus cannot bar them from challenging an allegedlyunconstitutional deprivation of their property. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is reversed,and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

WHREN et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 95-5841. Argued April 17, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Plainclothes policemen patrolling a "high drug area" in an unmarked vehicle observed a truck driven by petitioner Brown waiting at a stop sign
at an intersection for an unusually long time; the truck then turned
suddenly, without signaling, and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed.
The officers stopped the vehicle, assertedly to warn the driver about
traffic violations, and upon approaching the truck observed plastic bags
of crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's hands. Petitioners were arrested. Prior to trial on federal drug charges, they moved for suppression of the evidence, arguing that the stop had not been justified by
either a reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe petitioners
were engaged in illegal drug-dealing activity, and that the officers'
traffic-violation ground for approaching the truck was pretextual. The
motion to suppress was denied, petitioners were convicted, and the
Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws does not violate the Fourth
Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if a reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective. Pp. 809-819.

(a) Detention of a motorist is reasonable where probable cause exists
to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. See, e. g., Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 659. Petitioners claim that, because the police
may be tempted to use commonly occurring traffic violations as means
of investigating violations of other laws, the Fourth Amendment test
for traffic stops should be whether a reasonable officer would have
stopped the car for the purpose of enforcing the traffic violation at issue.
However, this Court's cases foreclose the argument that ulterior motives
can invalidate police conduct justified on the basis of probable cause.
See, e. g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 221, n. 1, 236. Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth
Amendment analysis. Pp. 809-813.

(b) Although framed as an empirical question--whether the officer's
conduct deviated materially from standard police practices--petitioners'
proposed test is plainly designed to combat the perceived danger of
pretextual stops. It is thus inconsistent with this Court's cases, which

807Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)

make clear that the Fourth Amendment's concern with "reasonableness"
allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances, whatever
the subjective intent. See, e. g., Robinson, supra, at 236. Nor can the
Fourth Amendment's protections be thought to vary from place to place
and from time to time, which would be the consequence of assessing
the reasonableness of police conduct in light of local law enforcement
practices. Pp. 813-816.

(c) Also rejected is petitioners' argument that the balancing of interests inherent in Fourth Amendment inquiries does not support enforcement of minor traffic laws by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles,
since that practice only minimally advances the government's interest
in traffic safety while subjecting motorists to inconvenience, confusion,
and anxiety. Where probable cause exists, this Court has found it necessary to engage in balancing only in cases involving searches or seizures conducted in a manner unusually harmful to the individual. See,
e. g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1. The making of a traffic stop
out of uniform does not remotely qualify as such an extreme practice.
Pp. 816-819.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we decide whether the temporary detentionof a motorist who the police have probable cause to believe

has committed a civil traffic violation is inconsistent with theFourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer would have been motivatedto stop the car by a desire to enforce the traffic laws.

I
On the evening of June 10, 1993, plainclothes vice-squadofficers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department were patrolling a "high drug area" of the city inan unmarked car. Their suspicions were aroused when they
passed a dark Pathfinder truck with temporary license platesand youthful occupants waiting at a stop sign, the driver
looking down into the lap of the passenger at his right. Thetruck remained stopped at the intersection for what seemed
an unusually long time--more than 20 seconds. When thepolice car executed a U-turn in order to head back toward
the truck, the Pathfinder turned suddenly to its right, with-out signaling, and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed. The
policemen followed, and in a short while overtook the Path-finder when it stopped behind other traffic at a red light.
They pulled up alongside, and Officer Ephraim Soto steppedout and approached the driver's door, identifying himself as
a police officer and directing the driver, petitioner Brown, toput the vehicle in park. When Soto drew up to the driver's

Opinion of the Court
window, he immediately observed two large plastic bags ofwhat appeared to be crack cocaine in petitioner Whren's

hands. Petitioners were arrested, and quantities of severaltypes of illegal drugs were retrieved from the vehicle.

Petitioners were charged in a four-count indictment withviolating various federal drug laws, including 21 U. S. C.

$$ 844(a) and 860(a). At a pretrial suppression hearing, theychallenged the legality of the stop and the resulting seizure
of the drugs. They argued that the stop had not been justi-fied by probable cause to believe, or even reasonable suspicion, that petitioners were engaged in illegal drug-dealingactivity; and that Officer Soto's asserted ground for approaching the vehicle--to give the driver a warning concern-ing traffic violations--was pretextual. The District Court
denied the suppression motion, concluding that "the facts ofthe stop were not controverted," and "[t]here was nothing
to really demonstrate that the actions of the officers werecontrary to a normal traffic stop." App. 5.

Petitioners were convicted of the counts at issue here.The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding with
respect to the suppression issue that, "regardless of whethera police officer subjectively believes that the occupants of an
automobile may be engaging in some other illegal behavior,a traffic stop is permissible as long as a reasonable officer in
the same circumstances could have stopped the car for thesuspected traffic violation." 53 F. 3d 371, 374-375 (CADC
1995). We granted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1036 (1996).

II
The Fourth Amendment guarantees "[t]he right of the peo-ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

against unreasonable searches and seizures." Temporary
detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile bythe police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited

purpose, constitutes a "seizure" of "persons" within the

517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
meaning of this provision. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440
U. S. 648, 653 (1979); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428
U. S. 543, 556 (1976); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422
U. S. 873, 878 (1975). An automobile stop is thus subject to
the constitutional imperative that it not be "unreasonable"
under the circumstances. As a general matter, the decision
to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have
probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.
See Prouse, supra, at 659; Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434
U. S. 106, 109 (1977) (per curiam).

Petitioners accept that Officer Soto had probable cause to
believe that various provisions of the District of Columbia
traffic code had been violated. See 18 D. C. Mun. Regs.

$$ 2213.4 (1995) ("An operator shall . . . give full time and
attention to the operation of the vehicle"); 2204.3 ("No person
shall turn any vehicle . . . without giving an appropriate signal"); 2200.3 ("No person shall drive a vehicle . . . at a speed
greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions"). They argue, however, that "in the unique context
of civil traffic regulations" probable cause is not enough.
Since, they contend, the use of automobiles is so heavily and
minutely regulated that total compliance with traffic and
safety rules is nearly impossible, a police officer will almost
invariably be able to catch any given motorist in a technical
violation. This creates the temptation to use traffic stops
as a means of investigating other law violations, as to which
no probable cause or even articulable suspicion exists. Petitioners, who are both black, further contend that police officers might decide which motorists to stop based on decidedly
impermissible factors, such as the race of the car's occupants.
To avoid this danger, they say, the Fourth Amendment test
for traffic stops should be, not the normal one (applied by
the Court of Appeals) of whether probable cause existed to
justify the stop; but rather, whether a police officer, acting
reasonably, would have made the stop for the reason given.

Petitioners contend that the standard they propose is consistent with our past cases' disapproval of police attempts touse valid bases of action against citizens as pretexts for pursuing other investigatory agendas. We are reminded thatin

inventory search[1] must not be a ruse for a general rummag-ing in order to discover incriminating evidence"; that in

Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U. S. 367, 372 (1987), in approving aninventory search, we apparently thought it significant that

there had been "no showing that the police, who were following standardized procedures, acted in bad faith or for the
sole purpose of investigation"; and that in New York v.
Burger, 482 U. S. 691, 716-717, n. 27 (1987), we observed, in
upholding the constitutionality of a warrantless administrative inspection,2 that the search did not appear to be "a `pretext' for obtaining evidence of . . . violation of . . . penal
laws." But only an undiscerning reader would regard these
cases as endorsing the principle that ulterior motives can
invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of
probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred.
In each case we were addressing the validity of a search
conducted in the absence of probable cause. Our quoted
statements simply explain that the exemption from the need
for probable cause (and warrant), which is accorded to
searches made for the purpose of inventory or administrative

1 An inventory search is the search of property lawfully seized and detained, in order to ensure that it is harmless, to secure valuable items
(such as might be kept in a towed car), and to protect against false claims
of loss or damage. See South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 369
(1976).

2 An administrative inspection is the inspection of business premises

conducted by authorities responsible for enforcing a pervasive regulatory
scheme--for example, unannounced inspection of a mine for compliance
with health and safety standards. See Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594,
599-605 (1981).

regulation, is not accorded to searches that are not madefor those purposes. See

Bertine, supra, at 371-372; Burger,
supra, at 702-703.Petitioners also rely upon

Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S.
1 (1980) (per curiam), a case which, like this one, involved a
traffic stop as the prelude to a plain-view sighting and arreston charges wholly unrelated to the basis for the stop. Petitioners point to our statement that "[t]here was no evidencewhatsoever that the officer's presence to issue a traffic citation was a pretext to confirm any other previous suspicionabout the occupants" of the car.

Id., at 4, n. 4. That dictum
at most demonstrates that the Court in Bannister found no
need to inquire into the question now under discussion; not
that it was certain of the answer. And it may demonstrate
even less than that: If by "pretext" the Court meant that the
officer really had not seen the car speeding, the statement
would mean only that there was no reason to doubt probable
cause for the traffic stop.

It would, moreover, be anomalous, to say the least, to treat
a statement in a footnote in the per curiam Bannister opinion as indicating a reversal of our prior law. Petitioners'
difficulty is not simply a lack of affirmative support for their
position. Not only have we never held, outside the context
of inventory search or administrative inspection (discussed
above), that an officer's motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment; but we have
repeatedly held and asserted the contrary. In United States
v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S. 579, 584, n. 3 (1983), we
held that an otherwise valid warrantless boarding of a vessel
by customs officials was not rendered invalid "because the
customs officers were accompanied by a Louisiana state policeman, and were following an informant's tip that a vessel
in the ship channel was thought to be carrying marihuana."
We flatly dismissed the idea that an ulterior motive might
serve to strip the agents of their legal justification. In
United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), we held that

813Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
a traffic-violation arrest (of the sort here) would not be ren-dered invalid by the fact that it was "a mere pretext for a

narcotics search," id., at 221, n. 1; and that a lawful post-arrest search of the person would not be rendered invalid
by the fact that it was not motivated by the officer-safetyconcern that justifies such searches, see

id., at 236. Seealso Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U. S. 260, 266 (1973). And

in Scott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978), in reject-ing the contention that wiretap evidence was subject to exclusion because the agents conducting the tap had failed tomake any effort to comply with the statutory requirement
that unauthorized acquisitions be minimized, we said that"[s]ubjective intent alone . . . does not make otherwise lawful
conduct illegal or unconstitutional." We described Robinson as having established that "the fact that the officer doesnot have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the

reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer'saction does not invalidate the action taken as long as the
circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action." 436U. S., at 136, 138.

We think these cases foreclose any argument that theconstitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the
actual motivations of the individual officers involved. We ofcourse agree with petitioners that the Constitution prohibits
selective enforcement of the law based on considerationssuch as race. But the constitutional basis for objecting to
intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the EqualProtection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective
intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause FourthAmendment analysis.

B
Recognizing that we have been unwilling to entertainFourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers, petitioners disavow any intentionto make the individual officer's subjective good faith the
touchstone of "reasonableness." They insist that the stand517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT
814 WHREN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ard they have put forward--whether the officer's conductdeviated materially from usual police practices, so that a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would not havemade the stop for the reasons given--is an "objective" one.

But although framed in empirical terms, this approach is
plainly and indisputably driven by subjective considerations.Its whole purpose is to prevent the police from doing under

the guise of enforcing the traffic code what they would liketo do for different reasons. Petitioners' proposed standard
may not use the word "pretext," but it is designed to combatnothing other than the perceived "danger" of the pretextual
stop, albeit only indirectly and over the run of cases. Instead of asking whether the individual officer had the proper
state of mind, the petitioners would have us ask, in effect,
whether (based on general police practices) it is plausible to
believe that the officer had the proper state of mind.

Why one would frame a test designed to combat pretext
in such fashion that the court cannot take into account actual
and admitted pretext is a curiosity that can only be explained
by the fact that our cases have foreclosed the more sensible
option. If those cases were based only upon the evidentiary
difficulty of establishing subjective intent, petitioners' attempt to root out subjective vices through objective means
might make sense. But they were not based only upon
that, or indeed even principally upon that. Their principal
basis--which applies equally to attempts to reach subjective
intent through ostensibly objective means--is simply that
the Fourth Amendment's concern with "reasonableness"
allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances,
whatever the subjective intent. See, e. g., Robinson, supra,
at 236 ("Since it is the fact of custodial arrest which gives
rise to the authority to search, it is of no moment that [the
officer] did not indicate any subjective fear of the [arrestee]
or that he did not himself suspect that [the arrestee] was
armed") (footnotes omitted); Gustafson, supra, at 266 (same).
But even if our concern had been only an evidentiary one,

517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT

815Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
petitioners' proposal would by no means assuage it. Indeed,it seems to us somewhat easier to figure out the intent of an

individual officer than to plumb the collective consciousnessof law enforcement in order to determine whether a "reasonable officer" would have been moved to act upon the traffic
violation. While police manuals and standard proceduresmay sometimes provide objective assistance, ordinarily one

would be reduced to speculating about the hypothetical re-action of a hypothetical constable--an exercise that might be
called virtual subjectivity.Moreover, police enforcement practices, even if they could
be practicably assessed by a judge, vary from place to place
and from time to time. We cannot accept that the search
and seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment are so
variable, cf. Gustafson, supra, at 265; United States v. Caceres, 440 U. S. 741, 755-756 (1979), and can be made to turn
upon such trivialities. The difficulty is illustrated by petitioners' arguments in this case. Their claim that a reasonable officer would not have made this stop is based largely
on District of Columbia police regulations which permit
plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles to enforce traffic
laws "only in the case of a violation that is so grave as to pose
an immediate threat to the safety of others." Metropolitan
Police Department, Washington, D. C., General Order 303.1,
pt. 1, Objectives and Policies (A)(2)(4) (Apr. 30, 1992), reprinted as Addendum to Brief for Petitioners. This basis
of invalidation would not apply in jurisdictions that had a
different practice. And it would not have applied even in
the District of Columbia, if Officer Soto had been wearing a
uniform or patrolling in a marked police cruiser.

Petitioners argue that our cases support insistence upon
police adherence to standard practices as an objective means
of rooting out pretext. They cite no holding to that effect,
and dicta in only two cases. In Abel v. United States, 362
U. S. 217 (1960), the petitioner had been arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), on the basis of

517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT
816 WHREN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
an administrative warrant that, he claimed, had been issuedon pretextual grounds in order to enable the Federal Bureau

of Investigation (FBI) to search his room after his arrest.We regarded this as an allegation of "serious misconduct,"
but rejected Abel's claims on the ground that "[a] finding ofbad faith is . . . not open to us on th[e] record" in light of the
findings below, including the finding that " `the proceedingstaken by the [INS] differed in no respect from what would
have been done in the case of an individual concerning whom[there was no pending FBI investigation],' "

id., at 226-227.But it is a long leap from the proposition that following regular procedures is some evidence of lack of pretext to theproposition that failure to follow regular procedures

proves(or is an operational substitute for) pretext. Abel, moreover, did not involve the assertion that pretext could invali-date a search or seizure for which there was probable
cause--and even what it said about pretext in other contextsis plainly inconsistent with the views we later stated in Robinson, Gustafson, Scott, and Villamonte-Marquez. In theother case claimed to contain supportive dicta,

United Statesv. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), in approving a search incident to an arrest for driving without a license, we noted thatthe arrest was "not a departure from established police department practice." Id., at 221, n. 1. That was followed,however, by the statement that "[w]e leave for another day
questions which would arise on facts different from these."
Ibid. This is not even a dictum that purports to provide ananswer, but merely one that leaves the question open.

III
In what would appear to be an elaboration on the "reason-able officer" test, petitioners argue that the balancing inherent in any Fourth Amendment inquiry requires us to weighthe governmental and individual interests implicated in a
traffic stop such as we have here. That balancing, petition-ers claim, does not support investigation of minor traffic in517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT

817Cite as: 517 U. S. 806 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
fractions by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles; suchinvestigation only minimally advances the government's interest in traffic safety, and may indeed retard it by producingmotorist confusion and alarm--a view said to be supported
by the Metropolitan Police Department's own regulations
generally prohibiting this practice. And as for the FourthAmendment interests of the individuals concerned, petitioners point out that our cases acknowledge that even ordinarytraffic stops entail "a possibly unsettling show of authority";
that they at best "interfere with freedom of movement, areinconvenient, and consume time" and at worst "may create
substantial anxiety," Prouse, 440 U. S., at 657. That anxiety
is likely to be even more pronounced when the stop is conducted by plainclothes officers in unmarked cars.

It is of course true that in principle every Fourth Amendment case, since it turns upon a "reasonableness" determination, involves a balancing of all relevant factors. With rare
exceptions not applicable here, however, the result of that
balancing is not in doubt where the search or seizure is based
upon probable cause. That is why petitioners must rely
upon cases like Prouse to provide examples of actual "balancing" analysis. There, the police action in question was a
random traffic stop for the purpose of checking a motorist's
license and vehicle registration, a practice that--like the
practices at issue in the inventory search and administrative
inspection cases upon which petitioners rely in making their
"pretext" claim--involves police intrusion without the probable cause that is its traditional justification. Our opinion
in Prouse expressly distinguished the case from a stop based
on precisely what is at issue here: "probable cause to believe
that a driver is violating any one of the multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations." Id., at 661. It
noted approvingly that "[t]he foremost method of enforcing
traffic and vehicle safety regulations . . . is acting upon observed violations," id., at 659, which afford the " `quantum
of individualized suspicion' " necessary to ensure that police

517us3$62K 12-19-97 14:35:32 PAGES OPINPGT
818 WHREN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
discretion is sufficiently constrained, id., at 654-655 (quoting
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S., at 560). What
is true of Prouse is also true of other cases that engaged indetailed "balancing" to decide the constitutionality of automobile stops, such as Martinez-Fuerte, which upheld checkpoint stops, see 428 U. S., at 556-562, and Brignoni-Ponce,which disallowed so-called "roving patrol" stops, see 422

U. S., at 882-884: The detailed "balancing" analysis wasnecessary because they involved seizures without probable
cause.Where probable cause has existed, the only cases in which
we have found it necessary actually to perform the "balancing" analysis involved searches or seizures conducted in an
extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to an individual's
privacy or even physical interests--such as, for example, seizure by means of deadly force, see Tennessee v. Garner, 471
U. S. 1 (1985), unannounced entry into a home, see Wilson v.
Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), entry into a home without a
warrant, see Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740 (1984), or
physical penetration of the body, see Winston v. Lee, 470
U. S. 753 (1985). The making of a traffic stop out of uniform
does not remotely qualify as such an extreme practice, and
so is governed by the usual rule that probable cause to believe the law has been broken "outbalances" private interest
in avoiding police contact.

Petitioners urge as an extraordinary factor in this case
that the "multitude of applicable traffic and equipment regulations" is so large and so difficult to obey perfectly that virtually everyone is guilty of violation, permitting the police
to single out almost whomever they wish for a stop. But
we are aware of no principle that would allow us to decide
at what point a code of law becomes so expansive and so
commonly violated that infraction itself can no longer be the
ordinary measure of the lawfulness of enforcement. And
even if we could identify such exorbitant codes, we do not
know by what standard (or what right) we would decide, as

Opinion of the Court
petitioners would have us do, which particular provisions aresufficiently important to merit enforcement.

For the run-of-the-mine case, which this surely is, we thinkthere is no realistic alternative to the traditional commonlaw rule that probable cause justifies a search and seizure.

* * *
Here the District Court found that the officers had proba-ble cause to believe that petitioners had violated the traffic

code. That rendered the stop reasonable under the FourthAmendment, the evidence thereby discovered admissible,
and the upholding of the convictions by the Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit correct. The judgment

DEGEN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-173. Argued April 22, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Petitioner Degen is outside the United States and cannot be extradited to

face federal drug charges. When he filed an answer in a related civil
action, contesting the Government's attempt to forfeit properties allegedly purchased with proceeds from his drug dealings, the District Court
struck his claims and entered summary judgment against him, holding
that he was not entitled to be heard in the forfeiture action because he
remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution. The
court's final order vested title to the properties in the United States,
and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: A district court may not strike a claimant's filings in a forfeiture

suit and grant summary judgment against him for failing to appear in a
related criminal prosecution. Pp. 822-829.

(a) The Government contends that the District Court's inherent powers authorized it to strike Degen's claims under what has been labeled
the "fugitive disentitlement doctrine." Principles of deference counsel
restraint in resorting to the courts' inherent authority to protect their
proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their traditional
responsibilities, see, e. g., Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 44,
and require its use to be a reasonable response to the problems and
needs provoking it, Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234,
244. Pp. 822-824.

(b) No necessity justifies disentitlement here. Since the court's jurisdiction over the property is secure despite Degen's absence, there is no
risk of delay or frustration in determining the merits of the Government's forfeiture claims or in enforcing the resulting judgment. The
court has alternatives, other than the harsh sanction of disentitlement,
to keep Degen from using liberal civil discovery rules to gain an improper advantage in the criminal prosecution, where discovery is more
limited. Disentitlement also is too arbitrary a means of redressing
the indignity visited upon the court by Degen's absence from the criminal proceedings and deterring flight from criminal prosecution by
Degen and others. A court's dignity derives from the respect accorded
its judgments. That respect is eroded, not enhanced, by excessive

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we consider whether a United States DistrictCourt may strike the filings of a claimant in a forfeiture suit

and grant summary judgment against him for failing to ap-pear in a related criminal prosecution. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held this to be a proper exerciseof the District Court's inherent authority. We reverse.

A federal grand jury in Nevada indicted Brian Degen fordistributing marijuana, laundering money, and related
crimes. On the same day in 1989 that it unsealed the indict-ment, the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada also unsealed a civil forfeiture complaint. The Gov-ernment sought to forfeit properties in California, Nevada,
and Hawaii, allegedly worth $5.5 million and purchased withproceeds of Degen's drug sales or used to facilitate the sales.
84 Stat. 1276, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(6)-(a)(7). Anaffidavit by an agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency accompanied the complaint and recounted instances of Degen'salleged drug smuggling during the previous 20 years.

Alan B. Morrison and Allison M. Zieve; and for Ghaith R. Pharaon by
Richard F. Lawler.

822 DEGEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Degen is a citizen of the United States and of Switzerland,
his father having been born there. Degen moved to Switzerland with his family in 1988. He has not returned to face
the criminal charges against him, and we are advised that
Switzerland's extradition treaty with the United States does
not oblige either country to turn its nationals over to the
other. While remaining outside this country, however,
Degen did file an answer in the civil action to contest the
forfeiture. Among other things, he contended the Government's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, 46
Stat. 758, as amended, 19 U. S. C. $ 1621, and based on an
unlawful retroactive application of the forfeiture laws.

The District Court in the forfeiture case did not consider
any of these arguments. Instead it granted the Government's motion to strike Degen's claims and entered summary
judgment against him. The court held Degen was not entitled to be heard in the civil forfeiture action because he
remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution. United States v. Real Property Located at Incline
Village, 755 F. Supp. 308 (1990). After another two years
consumed by procedural matters (for the most part involving
attempts by Degen's wife to contest the forfeiture), the District Court entered a final order vesting title to the properties in the United States. The Court of Appeals for

the Ninth Circuit affirmed. United States v. Real Property Located at Incline Village, 47 F. 3d 1511 (1995). We
granted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1070 (1996).

In an ordinary case a citizen has a right to a hearing to
contest the forfeiture of his property, a right secured by the
Due Process Clause, United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 48-62 (1993); Fuentes v. Shevin,
407 U. S. 67, 80 (1972); McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall.
259, 266-267 (1871), and implemented by federal rule, Rule
C(6) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and
Maritime Claims. Nonetheless, the Government argues, the

823Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
District Court's inherent powers authorized it to strike
Degen's claims under what some courts have labeled the "fugitive disentitlement doctrine." We have sustained, to be
sure, the authority of an appellate court to dismiss an appeal
or writ in a criminal matter when the party seeking relief
becomes a fugitive. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507
U. S. 234, 239 (1993); Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97
(1876). The question before us is whether the doctrine
should be extended to allow a court in a civil forfeiture suit
to enter judgment against a claimant because he is a fugitive
from, or otherwise is resisting, a related criminal prosecution. The Courts of Appeals to consider the question have
come to different conclusions (compare the decision here and
in United States v. Eng, 951 F. 2d 461 (CA2 1991), with
United States v. $40,877.59 in United States Currency, 32
F. 3d 1151 (CA7 1994), and United States v. $83,320 in United
States Currency, 682 F. 2d 573 (CA6 1982)), precipitating our
grant of certiorari in this case.

Courts invested with the judicial power of the United
States have certain inherent authority to protect their proceedings and judgments in the course of discharging their
traditional responsibilities. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501
U. S. 32, 43-46 (1991); Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626,
630-631 (1962); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34
(1812). The extent of these powers must be delimited with
care, for there is a danger of overreaching when one branch
of the Government, without benefit of cooperation or correction from the others, undertakes to define its own authority.
Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U. S. 752, 764 (1980).
In many instances the inherent powers of the courts may be
controlled or overridden by statute or rule. Carlisle v.
United States, ante, at 426; Bank of Nova Scotia v. United
States, 487 U. S. 250, 254 (1988). Principles of deference
counsel restraint in resorting to inherent power, Chambers v.
NASCO, supra, at 44, and require its use to be a reasonable

824 DEGEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
response to the problems and needs that provoke it, OrtegaRodriguez v. United States, supra, at 244; Thomas v. Arn,
474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985).In accord with these principles, we have held federal

courts do have authority to dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the mat-ter is pending. Several reasons have been given for the

rule. First, so long as the party cannot be found, the judg-ment on review may be impossible to enforce. This was the
rationale of the first case to acknowledge the doctrine, Smithv.

United States, supra, at 97: "It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal case in error, unless the
convicted party, suing out the writ, is where he can be made
to respond to any judgment we may render." See also Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Eisler v. United
States, 338 U. S. 189 (1949). Second, we have said an appellant's escape "disentitles" him "to call upon the resources of
the Court for determination of his claims." Molinaro v.
New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970) (per curiam). The
cases cited so far involved the dismissal of fugitives' petitions
in this Court. In reviewing similar practices in state courts
for conformity with the Due Process Clause, we have noted
further reasons for them: Disentitlement "discourages the
felony of escape and encourages voluntary surrenders," and
"promotes the efficient, dignified operation" of the courts.
Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534, 537 (1975) (per curiam)
(using those reasons to justify refusing to reinstate an appeal
even once an escaped appellant is recaptured). See also
Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897).

Against this backdrop came our decision four Terms ago in
Ortega-Rodriguez. The defendant had escaped from federal
custody after conviction but before sentencing. He was sentenced in absentia, but later was recaptured and resentenced; he then filed an appeal, which was dismissed on the
authority of Smith v. United States, supra, and the other
disentitlement cases just described. We reversed, holding

825Cite as: 517 U. S. 820 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
those precedents did not justify dismissal of an appeal by afugitive recaptured before the appeal was filed. We noted

the judgment of the Court of Appeals would be enforceableagainst the appellant, and that his earlier absence, when no
appeal was pending, did not threaten the dignity of the court
imposing the sanction. Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States,507 U. S., at 244-246. We did not rule out the possibility of

appellate disentitlement where necessary to prevent actualprejudice to the Government from a fugitive's extended absence, id., at 249, but we concluded the sanction of disentitle-ment was unjustified as a sanction applicable to all cases
where an escape once had occurred, id., at 249-251. We conduct a similar examination of the disentitlement imposed
here, and find it likewise unjustified.

There is no risk in this case of delay or frustration in determining the merits of the Government's forfeiture claims
or in enforcing the resulting judgment. The Government
has shown probable cause to forfeit the property, and Degen
must refute the showing or suffer its loss. Since the court's
jurisdiction over the property is secure despite Degen's
absence, there is no danger the court in the forfeiture suit
will waste its time rendering a judgment unenforceable in
practice.

The Government is on stronger ground in suggesting the
criminal prosecution against Degen might be compromised
by his participation in the forfeiture case. The problem
stems from the differences between the discovery privileges
available to Degen in each case. See Afro-Lecon, Inc. v.
United States, 820 F. 2d 1198, 1203-1204 (CA Fed. 1987);
Campbell v. Eastland, 307 F. 2d 478, 487 (CA5 1962). A
criminal defendant is entitled to rather limited discovery,
with no general right to obtain the statements of the Government's witnesses before they have testified. Fed. Rules
Crim. Proc. 16(a)(2), 26.2. In a civil case, by contrast, a
party is entitled as a general matter to discovery of any information sought if it appears "reasonably calculated to lead

Opinion of the Court
to the discovery of admissible evidence." Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 26(b)(1). The Government contends Degen might use
the rules of civil discovery in the forfeiture suit to gain an
improper advantage in the criminal matter, prying into the
prosecution's case in a manner not otherwise permitted.

These problems are not uncommon when criminal and civil
forfeiture suits are pending at the same time, but they are
made acute by Degen's absence. If he were in federal custody, the risk of compromising the criminal case could be
avoided by staying the civil suit until the prosecution is over.
21 U. S. C. $ 881(i). Cf. United States v. Kordel, 397 U. S. 1,
9 (1970). Degen rendered this solution impractical by frustrating the prosecution of the criminal case against him.
The criminal trial cannot begin until he returns, Crosby v.
United States, 506 U. S. 255 (1993); if the civil matter were
subordinated to the criminal, the forfeiture could be held in
abeyance for an indefinite time. This delay would be prejudicial to the Government, for if its forfeiture claims are good,
its right to the properties is immediate. We nonetheless are
satisfied the District Court has the means to resolve these
dilemmas without resorting to a rule forbidding all participation by the absent claimant.

First, the District Court has its usual authority to manage
discovery in a civil suit, including the power to enter protective orders limiting discovery as the interests of justice require. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(c). Decisions in the Courts
of Appeals have sustained protective orders to prevent parties from using civil discovery to evade restrictions on discovery in criminal cases. See, e. g., In re Ramu Corp., 903
F. 2d 312, 316-317, 320-321 (CA5 1990); United States v.
Stewart, 872 F. 2d 957, 962-963 (CA10 1989); Campbell v.
Eastland, supra, at 487. See also Capital Engineering &
Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Weinberger, 695 F. Supp. 36, 41-42 (DC 1988);
Founding Church of Scientology v. Kelley, 77 F. R. D. 378,
380-381 (DC 1977).

Opinion of the Court
Second, the court can exercise its discretion to manage thecivil litigation to avoid interference with the criminal case.

If, for instance, the Government were unable to rebut De-gen's arguments except by revealing confidential details of
the criminal investigation, the court could consider controlling or limiting the form of proof, or in an extreme case eventhe theories it permits the absent party to pursue, to prevent

him from exploiting the asymmetries he creates by partici-pating in one suit but not the other.

Third, of course, Degen's absence entitles him to no advan-tage. If his unwillingness to appear in person results in
noncompliance with a legitimate order of the court respecting pleading, discovery, the presentation of evidence, or
other matters, he will be exposed to the same sanctions as
any other uncooperative party. A federal court has at its
disposal an array of means to enforce its orders, including
dismissal in an appropriate case. Again, its powers include
those furnished by federal rule, see, e. g., Fed. Rules Civ.
Proc. 37, 41(b); National Hockey League v. Metropolitan
Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639 (1976) (per curiam); Societe
Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales, S. A. v. Rogers, 357 U. S. 197, 212 (1958); cf.
United States v. Pole No. 3172, 852 F. 2d 636, 641-642 (CA1
1988), and by inherent authority, see, e. g., Chambers v.
NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S., at 44-45; Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370
U. S., at 630-633; Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., 57 F. 3d 1406,
1416-1417 (CA5 1995); Zebrowski v. Hanna, 973 F. 2d 1001,
1006 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.).

The details of these steps are committed to the discretion
of the District Court; it would be premature to consider now
the precise measures the court should adopt as the case proceeds. The existence of these alternative means of protecting the Government's interests, however, shows the lack of
necessity for the harsh sanction of absolute disentitlement.
Consideration of some of Degen's defenses, such as the statute of limitations, appears to require little discovery. If

517us3$63L 02-05-99 16:44:37 PAGES OPINPGT
828 DEGEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
they have merit, the Government should not prevail; if theyare groundless, the Government's interests will not be compromised by their consideration.We have yet to consider two other purposes said to be
advanced by disentitlement: The need to redress the indignity visited upon the District Court by Degen's absence fromthe criminal proceeding, and the need to deter flight from

criminal prosecution by Degen and others. Both interestsare substantial, but disentitlement is too blunt an instrument
for advancing them. Without resolving whether Degen is afugitive in all the senses of the word debated by the parties,
we acknowledge disquiet at the spectacle of a criminal defendant reposing in Switzerland, beyond the reach of our
criminal courts, while at the same time mailing papers to the
court in a related civil action and expecting them to be honored. Cf. United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675, 681-682,
n. 2 (1985). A court-made rule striking Degen's claims and
entering summary judgment against him as a sanction, however, would be an arbitrary response to the conduct it is supposed to redress or discourage.

The right of a citizen to defend his property against attack
in a court is corollary to the plaintiff 's right to sue there.
McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall., at 267. For this reason
we have held it unconstitutional to use disentitlement similar
to this as punishment for rebellion against the United States,
ibid., or, in at least one instance, for contempt of court,
Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U. S. 409, 413-414 (1897). We need not,
and do not, intimate a view on whether enforcement of a
disentitlement rule under proper authority would violate due
process, cf. Blackmer v. United States, 284 U. S. 421 (1932).
It remains the case, however, that the sanction of disentitlement is most severe and so could disserve the dignitary purposes for which it is invoked. The dignity of a court derives
from the respect accorded its judgments. That respect is
eroded, not enhanced, by too free a recourse to rules foreclosing consideration of claims on the merits.

Opinion of the Court
There would be a measure of rough justice in sayingDegen must take the bitter with the sweet, and participate

in the District Court either for all purposes or none. Butthe justice would be too rough. A court's inherent power is
limited by the necessity giving rise to its exercise. Therewas no necessity to justify the rule of disentitlement in this
case; to strike Degen's filings and grant judgment againsthim would be an excessive response to the concerns here
advanced.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

EXXON CO., U. S. A., et al. v. SOFEC, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-129. Argued March 19, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Petitioner Exxon's oil tanker, the Exxon Houston, ran aground and was

lost several hours after its "breakout" from a mooring facility owned and
operated, or manufactured, by the various respondents. Exxon filed a
complaint in admiralty against respondents, alleging, inter alia, negligence and breach of warranty. In granting respondents' motion to bifurcate the trial, the District Court limited the first phase thereof to the
question whether the postbreakout conduct of the Houston's captain,
Captain Coyne, was the superseding and sole proximate cause of the
loss of the ship, leaving the issue of causation of the breakout itself for
the second phase. After a bench trial, the court found that Captain
Coyne's (and by imputation, Exxon's) extraordinary negligence was
indeed the superseding and sole proximate cause of the Houston's
grounding, and entered final judgment against Exxon. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Among other things, it rejected Exxon's legal argument
that the doctrines of proximate causation and superseding cause are no
longer applicable in admiralty in light of United States v. Reliable
Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397, in which this Court abandoned the "divided
damages" rule previously applied in admiralty and adopted the comparative fault principle for allocating damages among responsible parties;
held that the District Court's causation findings were well supported by
the record and not clearly erroneous; ruled that the lower court did not
err in rendering judgment against Exxon on its breach of warranty
claims; and concluded that, under the circumstances, the bifurcation of
the trial was not an abuse of discretion.

Held: A plaintiff in admiralty that is the superseding, and thus the sole

proximate, cause of its own injury cannot recover part of its damages
from tortfeasors or contracting partners whose blameworthy actions or
breaches were causes in fact of the plaintiff's injury. Pp. 836-842.

(a) The Court rejects Exxon's primary argument that the proximate
causation requirement, and the related superseding cause doctrine, are
not or should not be applicable in admiralty. The Court finds unpersuasive Exxon's assertion that the lower courts' refusal to allocate any
share of damages to parties whose fault was a cause in fact of its injury
conflicts with Reliable Transfer. The proximate causation requirement
was not before the Court in that case, and the Court did not suggest

831Cite as: 517 U. S. 830 (1996)
Syllabus
that it was inapplicable in admiralty. There is nothing internally inconsistent in a system that apportions damages based upon comparative
fault only among tortfeasors whose actions were proximate causes of an
injury. Nor is there any repugnancy between the superseding cause
doctrine, which is one facet of the proximate causation requirement,
and a comparative fault method of allocating damages. Exxon may be
correct that common-law proximate cause concepts are complex and
sometimes confusing, but those concepts are generally thought to be a
necessary limitation on liability. In ruling upon whether a defendant's
blameworthy act was sufficiently related to the resulting harm to warrant imposing liability for that harm on the defendant, admiralty courts
may draw guidance from, inter alia, the extensive body of state law
applying proximate causation requirements and from treatises and other
scholarly sources. Pp. 836-839.

(b) Exxon's argument that the District Court erred in rendering
judgment against it on its breach of warranty claims fares no better.
Exxon errs in relying upon Italia Societa per Azioni di Navigazione v.
Oregon Stevedoring Co., 376 U. S. 315, which does not purport to deal
with the proximate causation limitation for damages on such claims and
is not relevant here. Where the injured party is the sole proximate
cause of the damage complained of, that party cannot recover in contract
from a party whose breach of warranty is found to be a mere cause in
fact of the damage. Although the principles of legal causation sometimes receive labels in contract analysis different from the "proximate
causation" label most frequently employed in tort analysis, these principles nevertheless also restrict liability in contract. The finding that
Captain Coyne's extraordinary negligence was the sole proximate cause
of Exxon's injury suffices to cut off respondents' liability for that injury
on a contractual breach of warranty theory as well. Pp. 839-840.

(c) Also rejected is Exxon's argument that the lower courts' findings
that Captain Coyne's extraordinary negligence was the sole proximate
cause of Exxon's injury were in error. Although Exxon identifies some
tension in the courts' various findings, it has not made the sort of "obvious and exceptional showing of error," Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde
Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275, that would justify this Court's
reversal of the lower courts' ultimate conclusion. Pp. 840-841.

(d) Exxon's argument that bifurcation of the trial was error is not
within the questions upon which this Court granted certiorari. To the
extent that the argument reprises the issue whether the fault of all
parties must be considered together in order that they may be compared
under Reliable Transfer, it is rejected. To the extent that Exxon
argues that the District Court abused its discretion in dividing the

In United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397(1975), we abandoned the "divided damages" rule previously

pipeline through two floating hoses, pursuant to a contractbetween Exxon and respondent PRII, when a heavy storm

broke the chafe chain linking the vessel to the SPM. As thevessel drifted, the oil hoses broke away from the SPM. The
parting of the second hose at approximately 1728 nauticaltime was designated below as the "breakout." The hoses
were bolted to the ship, and a portion of the second hoseremained attached to the ship. So long as the hose was
attached to and trailing from the ship, it threatened to foulthe ship's propeller, and consequently the ship's ability to
maneuver was restricted.During the 2 hours and 41 minutes following the breakout,
the captain of the Houston, Captain Coyne, took the shipthrough a series of maneuvers described in some detail in
the District Court's findings of fact. The District Courtfound that by 1803, a small assist vessel, the Nene, was able
to get control of the end of the hose so that it was no longera threat to the Houston. See 54 F. 3d 570, 572 (CA9 1995).
Between 1803 and 1830, Captain Coyne maneuvered the
Houston out to sea and away from shallow water. The Dis-trict Court, and on appeal, a panel of the Court of Appeals

for the Ninth Circuit, found that by 1830, the Houston hadsuccessfully avoided the peril resulting from the breakout.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 65; 54 F. 3d, at 578-579. The ship had"reached a safe position," App. to Pet. for Cert. 64, and was
"heading out to sea and in no further danger of stranding,"
id., at 65; 54 F. 3d, at 578.Many of Captain Coyne's actions after 1830 were negligent, according to the courts below. Most significant washis failure to have someone plot the ship's position between
1830 and 2004, a period during which the crews of the Hous-ton and the Nene were working to disconnect the hose from
the Houston. Without knowing his position, Captain Coyne
respondents are several affiliated corporations: Pacific Resources, Inc.;
Hawaiian Independent Refinery, Inc.; PRI Marine, Inc.; and PRI International, Inc. (PRII).

Opinion of the Court
was unable to make effective use of a navigational chart to
check for hazards. The courts found that this failure to plot
fixes of the ship's position was grossly and extraordinarily
negligent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61; 54 F. 3d, at 578. The
District Court found that "Captain Coyne's decisions were
made calmly, deliberately and without the pressure of an imminent peril." App. to Pet. for Cert. 60. His failure to plot
fixes after 1830 "was entirely independent of the fact of
breakout; he voluntarily decided not to plot fixes in a situation where he was able to plot fixes." Id., at 64.

At 1956, Captain Coyne initiated a final turn toward the
shore. Because he had not plotted the ship's position, Captain Coyne was unaware of its position until he ordered another crew member to plot the fix at 2004. Upon seeing the
fix on the chart, the captain apparently realized that the ship
was headed for a reef. Captain Coyne's ensuing efforts to
avoid the reef came too late, and moments later the ship ran
aground, resulting in its constructive total loss. The District Court found that Captain Coyne's decision to make this
final turn "was not foreseeable." Id., at 65.

Exxon filed a complaint in admiralty against the HIRI respondents and respondent Sofec for, inter alia, the loss of its
ship and cargo. The complaint contained claims for breach
of warranty, strict products liability, and negligence. HIRI
filed a complaint against several third-party respondents,
who had manufactured and supplied the chafe chain that held
the tanker to the SPM.

Before trial, respondents suggested that Captain Coyne's
conduct was the superseding and sole proximate cause of the
loss of the ship, and they moved to bifurcate the trial. Respondents and the third-party respondents disputed among
themselves the cause of the breakout, and they apparently
sought bifurcation of the trial to avoid lengthy proceedings
to resolve those factual disputes prior to a determination
whether Captain Coyne's conduct was the superseding cause

Opinion of the Court
of Exxon's injury. The District Court granted the motion,
limiting the first phase of the trial to the issue of proximate
causation with respect to actions taken after the breakout,
and leaving the issue of causation of the breakout itself for
the second phase.

Following a 3-week bench trial in admiralty, the District
Court found that Captain Coyne's (and by imputation, Exxon's) extraordinary negligence was the superseding and sole
proximate cause of the Houston's grounding. Id., at 63.
The court entered final judgment against Exxon with respect to the loss of the Houston, and Exxon appealed.

The Ninth Circuit held that the District Court's findings
"that Captain Coyne had ample time, as well as opportunity
and available manpower, to take precautions which would
have eliminated the risk of grounding, and that his failure to
do so amounted to extraordinary negligence, superseding
any negligence of the defendants with regard to the breakout
or provision of safe berth after the breakout," were "well
supported by the record," and not clearly erroneous. 54
F. 3d, at 579. The court rejected Exxon's contention that
the captain's actions were foreseeable reactions to the breakout; rather, it noted, Captain Coyne himself had explained
that he did not plot fixes "because he felt it was unnecessary
to do so." Id., at 578.

Relying upon Circuit precedent, the court rejected Exxon's legal argument that the doctrines of proximate causation and superseding cause were no longer applicable in admiralty in light of this Court's decision in Reliable Transfer.
"[A]n intervening force supersedes prior negligence" and
thus breaks the chain of proximate causation required to impose liability on the original actor, the court held, "where the
subsequent actor's negligence was `extraordinary' (defined as
`neither normal nor reasonably foreseeable')." 54 F. 3d, at
574. The court also rejected Exxon's argument that the
District Court erred in rendering judgment against Exxon

on its breach of warranty claims. "Where, as here, the district court finds the injured party to be the superseding or
sole proximate cause of the damage complained of, it cannot
recover from a party whose actions or omissions are deemed

trial was not an abuse of discretion. We granted certiorari.

II

Exxon makes four arguments for the reversal of the judgment below: (1) that the superseding cause doctrine does not
or should not apply in admiralty; (2) that respondents'
breaches of warranty were causes in fact of the loss of the
Houston and hence respondents should be liable for that loss;
(3) that the lower courts' finding that Captain Coyne's extraordinary negligence was the sole proximate cause of the
loss of the Houston was in error; and (4) that the District
Court abused its discretion and deprived Exxon of due process in bifurcating the issue of proximate causation from the
other issues.

A

Exxon's primary argument is that the proximate causation
requirement, and the related superseding cause doctrine, are
not or should not be applicable in admiralty. In particular,
Exxon asserts that the lower courts' refusal to allocate any
share of damages to parties whose fault was a cause in fact
of Exxon's injury conflicts with our decision in Reliable
Transfer.

We disagree. In Reliable Transfer, we discarded a longstanding rule that property damages in admiralty cases are
to be divided equally between those liable for injury, "whatever the relative degree of their fault may have been," 421
U. S., at 397, and adopted the comparative fault principle in

Opinion of the Court
its stead.2 The proximate causation requirement was notbefore us in Reliable Transfer, and we did not suggest that

the requirement was inapplicable in admiralty. (Nor, forthat matter, did we consider whether the injury had been
proximately caused by the defendant in that case.)There is nothing internally inconsistent in a system that
apportions damages based upon comparative fault onlyamong tortfeasors whose actions were proximate causes of
an injury. Nor is there any repugnancy between the super-seding cause doctrine, which is one facet of the proximate
causation requirement, and a comparative fault method ofallocating damages. As Professor Schoenbaum has said:

"The doctrine of superseding cause is . . . appliedwhere the defendant's negligence in fact substantially
contributed to the plaintiff 's injury, but the injury wasactually brought about by a later cause of independent
origin that was not foreseeable. It is properly appliedin admiralty cases.

". . . [T]he superseding cause doctrine can be recon-ciled with comparative negligence. Superseding cause
operates to cut off the liability of an admittedly negli-gent defendant, and there is properly no apportionment
of comparative fault where there is an absence of proxi2 Some commentators have suggested that there may be a distinction
between a system allocating damages on the basis of comparative culpability, and a system allocating damages on the basis of both comparative
culpability and the degree to which fault proximately or foreseeably contributed to an injury. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts 474 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Keeton); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law $ 5-4, p. 167 (2d ed.

Comparative Fault, 22 J. Mar. L. & Com. 445, 476-483 (1991). We continue to use the term "comparative fault" employed in Reliable Transfer,
but we do not mean thereby to take a position on which of these systems
is the appropriate one, assuming that there is in fact a distinction between them.

continue to recognize and apply the superseding cause doc-trine. Brief for HIRI Respondents 28, and n. 31;

id., at App.
A (listing state-court decisions). Exxon does not take issuewith this assertion and concedes that it is not aware of any

state decision that holds otherwise. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.Exxon also argues that we should in any event eschew in
the admiralty context the "confusing maze of common-law
proximate cause concepts"; a system in which damages areallocated based upon the degree of comparative fault of any

party whose act was a cause in fact of injury is "fairer andsimpler," it says. Reply Brief for Petitioners 2. It is true
that commentators have often lamented the degree of dis-agreement regarding the principles of proximate causation
and confusion in the doctrine's application, see, e. g., Keeton263, but it is also true that proximate causation principles
are generally thought to be a necessary limitation on liability, see, e. g., id., at 264, 293, 294, 312. Indeed, the systemExxon apparently proposes either would let proximate causation principles, with all of their complexity, creep back inas one factor in the "comparative fault" analysis itself, see
n. 2, supra, or would produce extreme results. "In a philo-sophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of humanevents, and beyond." Keeton 264. Nevertheless,

"the careless actor will [not] always be held for all damages for which the forces that he risked were a cause in
fact. Somewhere a point will be reached when courts
will agree that the link has become too tenuous--that
what is claimed to be consequence is only fortuity.

In ruling upon whether a defendant's blameworthy act wassufficiently related to the resulting harm to warrant imposing liability for that harm on the defendant, courts sitting inadmiralty may draw guidance from, inter alia, the extensive
body of state law applying proximate causation requirementsand from treatises and other scholarly sources. See Keeton

B
Exxon's argument that the District Court erred in render-ing judgment against Exxon on its breach of warranty claims

fares no better. Exxon implicitly argues that because therespondents breached various contractual warranties, they
were "best situated" to prevent the loss of the Houston; andExxon invokes a passage from

Italia Societa per Azioni diNavigazione v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., 376 U. S. 315 (1964).

In Italia Societa, we held that a stevedore breaches its im-plied warranty of workmanlike service to a shipowner when
the stevedore nonnegligently supplies defective equipmentthat injures one of its employees during stevedoring operations. That case does not purport to deal with the proxi-mate causation limitation for damages on a warranty claim
and is not relevant to the question presented here.We agree with the Ninth Circuit that where the injured
party is the sole proximate cause of the damage complainedof, that party cannot recover in contract from a party whose
breach of warranty is found to be a mere cause in fact of thedamage. Although the principles of legal causation some517US3$64N 02-07-99 19:29:18 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
times receive labels in contract analysis different from the
"proximate causation" label most frequently employed in tort
analysis, these principles nevertheless exist to restrict liability in contract as well. Indeed, the requirement of foreseeability may be more stringent in the context of contract liability than it is in the context of tort liability. See East
River S. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S.
858, 874-875 (1986); Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 351
and Comment a, pp. 135-136 (1979); 11 W. Jaeger, Williston

(1990) (Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Ex. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145
(1854), "impose[s] a more severe limitation on the recovery
of damages for breach of contract than that applicable to actions in tort or for breach of warranty, in which substantial
or proximate cause is the test"). The finding that Captain
Coyne's extraordinary negligence was the sole proximate
cause of Exxon's injury suffices to cut off respondents' liability for that injury on a contractual breach of warranty theory
as well.

C

The legal question that we took this case to address is
whether a plaintiff in admiralty that is the superseding and
thus the sole proximate cause of its own injury can recover
part of its damages from tortfeasors or contracting partners
whose blameworthy actions or breaches were causes in fact
of the plaintiff 's injury. As we have held above, the answer
is that it may not. Apparently anticipating that this legal
issue would not likely be resolved in its favor, Exxon devotes
a large portion of its briefs to arguing that the findings by
the lower courts that Captain Coyne's extraordinary negligence was the sole proximate cause of Exxon's injury were
in error. The issues of proximate causation and superseding
cause involve application of law to fact, which is left to the

factfinder, subject to limited review. See, e. g., Milwau-kee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469, 473-476 (1877);

Keeton 320-321; 5 Corbin, supra, $ 998, at 22-23. "A courtof law, such as this Court is, rather than a court for correction of errors in fact finding, cannot undertake to review con-current findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of
a very obvious and exceptional showing of error." Graver
Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275(1949); see also Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656,

665 (1987); Reliable Transfer, 421 U. S., at 401, n. 2. Al-though Exxon identifies some tension in the various findings
made by the courts below,3 we nevertheless conclude thatExxon has not made an "obvious and exceptional showing of
error" that would justify our reversal of the courts' ultimateconclusion, reached after a 3-week trial and review of a
lengthy and complex record. Without necessarily ratifying
the application of proximate causation principles by thecourts below to the particular facts here, we decline to reconsider their conclusion. D

Finally, Exxon argues that the District Court erred in bifurcating the trial. This issue is not within the questions

3 Exxon argues that the courts' findings--that by 1803, the Nene had
gained control of the end of the hose so that it was no longer a threat to
the Houston, and that by 1830, the Houston had successfully avoided the
peril resulting from alleged breaches of duty on respondents' part, had
"reached a safe position," and was "heading out to sea and in no further
danger of stranding"--are inconsistent with the apparently uncontested
finding that the hose, which was suspended from the ship's crane during
efforts to disconnect the hose from the ship, caused the crane to topple at
1944, injuring a crewman. We note in this regard that the District Court
expressly found that the captain's failure to plot fixes after 1830 "was
entirely independent of the fact of breakout" and that "he voluntarily decided not to plot fixes in a situation where he was able to plot fixes," App.
to Pet. for Cert. 64; the Court of Appeals also relied upon the fact that
Captain Coyne himself had explained that he did not plot fixes "because
he felt it was unnecessary to do so," 54 F. 3d 570, 578 (CA9 1995).

upon which we granted certiorari. See Pet. for Cert. i. Tothe extent that Exxon argues that the issue involved here--

whether one cause of injury is a superseding cause--cannever be bifurcated from other issues, we reject that contention. Again, Exxon relies upon Reliable Transfer in assert-ing that the fault of all parties must be considered together
in order that they may be compared. As explained above,that argument is wrong: A party whose fault did not proximately cause the injury is not liable at all. To the extentthat Exxon argues that the District Court abused its discretion in dividing the trial in the particular way that it didhere, we decline to address that argument.

The judgment is affirmed. It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMACHINES CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 95-591. Argued March 18, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Pursuant to $ 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code, respondent International

Business Machines Corporation (IBM) paid a tax on insurance premiums
remitted to foreign insurers to cover shipments of goods to its foreign
subsidiaries. When its refund claims were denied, IBM filed suit in the
Court of Federal Claims, contending that $ 4371's application to policies
insuring export shipments violated the Export Clause, which states that
"[n]o Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State."
The court agreed, rejecting the Government's argument that Thames &
Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, 237 U. S. 19--in which this
Court held that a federal stamp tax on policies insuring marine risks
could not, under the Export Clause, be constitutionally applied to policies covering export shipments--had been superseded by subsequent
decisions interpreting the Import-Export Clause, which states in relevant part, "No State shall . . . lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or
Exports." The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Export Clause prohibits assessment of nondiscriminatory

federal taxes on goods in export transit. Pp. 846-863.

(a) While this Court has strictly enforced the Export Clause's prohibition against federal taxation of goods in export transit and certain
closely related services and activities, see, e. g., Thames & Mersey,
supra, it has not exempted pre-export goods and services from ordinary
tax burdens or exempted from federal taxation various services and
activities only tangentially related to the export process, see, e. g.,
Cornell v. Coyne, 192 U. S. 418. Conceding that the tax assessed here
violates the Export Clause under Thames & Mersey, the Government
asks that the case be overruled because its underlying theory has been
rejected in the context of the Commerce and Import-Export Clauses
and those Clauses have historically been interpreted in harmony with
the Export Clause. Pp. 846-850.

(b) When this Court expressly disavowed its early view that the dormant Commerce Clause required a strict ban on state taxation of interstate commerce, Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,
288-289, it resolved a long struggle over the meaning of the nontextual
negative command of that Clause. The Export Clause, on the other

517US3$65Z 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

MACHINES CORP.

Syllabus

hand, expressly prohibits Congress from laying any tax or duty on exports. These textual disparities strongly suggest that shifts in the
Court's view of the dormant Commerce Clause's scope cannot govern
Export Clause interpretation. Cf. Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of
Equalization, 329 U. S. 69, 75-76. Pp. 850-853.

(c) While one may question Thames & Mersey's finding that a tax on
policies insuring exports is functionally the same as a tax on exportation
itself, the Government apparently has chosen not to do so here. Under
the principles that animate the policy of stare decisis, the Court declines
to overrule Thames & Mersey's longstanding precedent, which has
caused no uncertainty in commercial export transactions, on a theory
not argued by the parties. Pp. 854-856.

(d) This Court's recent Import-Export Clause cases do not require
that Thames & Mersey be overruled. Meaningful textual differences
that should not be overlooked exist between the Export Clause and the
Import-Export Clause. In finding the assessments in Michelin Tire
Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, and Department of Revenue of Wash. v.
Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734, valid, the Court
recognized that the Import-Export Clause's absolute ban on "Imposts
or Duties" is not a ban on every tax. Because impost and duty are thus
narrower terms than tax, a particular state assessment might be beyond
the Import-Export Clause's reach, while an identical federal assessment
might be subject to the Export Clause. The word "Tax" has a common,
and usually expansive, meaning that should not be ignored. The
Clauses were also intended to serve different goals. The Government's
policy argument--that the Framers intended the Export Clause to narrowly alleviate the fear of northern repression through taxation of
southern exports by prohibiting only discriminatory taxes--cannot be
squared with the Clause's broad language. The better reading is that
the Framers sought to alleviate their concerns by completely denying
to Congress the power to tax exports at all. See Fairbank v. United
States, 181 U. S. 283. Pp. 857-861.

(e) Even assuming that Michelin and Washington Stevedoring govern the Export Clause inquiry here, those holdings do not interpret the
Import-Export Clause to permit assessment of nondiscriminatory taxes
on imports and exports in transit. Pp. 861-862.

59 F. 3d 1234, affirmed.

James R. Atwood argued the cause for respondent. Withhim on the brief was

Andrew W. Singer.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
We resolve in this case whether the Export Clause of theConstitution permits the imposition of a generally applicable,

nondiscriminatory federal tax on goods in export transit.We hold that it does not.

I
Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a taxon insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers that are not

subject to the federal income tax.1 26 U. S. C. $ 4371 (1982ed.). International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
ships products that it manufactures in the United States tonumerous foreign subsidiaries and insures those shipments
against loss. When the foreign subsidiary makes the ship-ping arrangements, the subsidiary often places the insurance
with a foreign carrier. When it does, both IBM and the sub-sidiary are listed as beneficiaries in the policy.

IBM filed federal excise tax returns for the years 1975through 1984, but reported no liability under $ 4371. The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited IBM and deter-mined that the premiums paid to foreign insurers were
taxable under $ 4371 and that IBM--as a named beneficiaryof the insurance policies--was liable for the tax. The IRS
assessed a tax against IBM for each of those years.IBM paid the assessments and filed refund claims, which
the IRS denied. IBM then commenced suit in the Court of

1 The tax does not apply if a policy issued by a foreign insurer is "signed
or countersigned by an officer or agent of the insurer in a State, or in the
District of Columbia, within which such insurer is authorized to do business." 26 U. S. C. $ 4373(1) (1982 ed.).

MACHINES CORP.

Opinion of the Court

Federal Claims, contending that application of $ 4371 topolicies insuring its export shipments violated the Export

Clause. The focus of the suit was this Court's decision inThames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, 237 U. S.
19 (1915), in which we held that a federal stamp tax onpolicies insuring marine risks could not, under the Export
Clause, be constitutionally applied to policies covering ex-port shipments. The United States argued that the analysis
of Thames & Mersey is no longer valid, having been super-seded by subsequent decisions interpreting the ImportExport Clause--specifically, Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,423 U. S. 276 (1976), and

Department of Revenue of Wash. v.
Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978).The Court of Federal Claims noted that this Court has never

overruled Thames & Mersey and ruled that application of$ 4371 to policies insuring goods in export transit violates
the Export Clause. 31 Fed. Cl. 500 (1994). The Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 59 F. 3d 1234
(1995). We agreed to hear this case to decide whether weshould overrule

Thames & Mersey. 516 U. S. 1021 (1995).

II
The Export Clause states simply and directly: "No Tax orDuty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State."

U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5. We have had few occasions tointerpret the language of the Export Clause, but our cases
have broadly exempted from federal taxation not only exportgoods, but also services and activities closely related to the
export process. At the same time, we have attempted tolimit the term "Articles exported" to permit federal taxation
of pre-export goods and services.Our early cases upheld federal assessments on the manufacture of particular products ultimately intended for exportby finding that pre-export products are not "Articles exported." See Pace v. Burgess, 92 U. S. 372 (1876); Turpin v.Burgess, 117 U. S. 504 (1886); Cornell v. Coyne, 192 U. S. 418

Opinion of the Court
(1904). Pace and Turpin both involved a federal excise taxon tobacco products. In

Pace, though tobacco intended for
export was exempted from the tax, the exemption itself wassubject to a per-package stamp charge of 25 cents. When a

tobacco manufacturer challenged the stamp charge, we upheld the charge on the basis that the stamps were designedto prevent fraud in the export exemption from the excise tax

and did not, therefore, represent a tax on exports. 92 U. S.,at 375. When Congress later repealed the 25-cent charge
for the exemption stamp in a statute that referred to thestamp as an "export tax," another manufacturer sued to recover the money it had paid for the exemption stamps. See
Turpin, supra. Without disturbing the prior ruling in Pace
that the stamp charge was not a tax on exports, 117 U. S., at
505, we explained that the prohibition of the Export Clause
"has reference to the imposition of duties on goods by reason
or because of their exportation or intended exportation, or
whilst they are being exported," id., at 507. We said that
the plaintiffs would have had no Export Clause claim even if
there had been no exemption from the excise because the
goods were not in the course of exportation and might never
be exported. Ibid. Turpin broadly suggested that the
Export Clause prohibits both taxes levied on goods in
the course of exportation and taxes directed specifically at
exports.

In Cornell, the Court addressed whether the Export
Clause prohibited application of a federal excise tax on filled
cheese manufactured under contract for export. Looking to
the analysis set out in Turpin, we rejected the contention
that the Export Clause bars application of a nondiscriminatory tax imposed before the product entered the course of
exportation. "The true construction of the constitutional
provision is that no burden by way of tax or duty can be
cast upon the exportation of articles, and does not mean that
articles exported are relieved from the prior ordinary burdens of taxation which rest upon all property similarly situ517US3$65N 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

MACHINES CORP.

Opinion of the Court

ated." Cornell, supra, at 427. Pace, Turpin, and Cornellmade clear that nondiscriminatory pre-exportation assessments do not violate the Export Clause, even if the goodsare eventually exported.

At the same time we were defining a domain within which
nondiscriminatory taxes could permissibly be imposed ongoods intended for export, we were also making clear that

the Export Clause strictly prohibits any tax or duty, discrim-inatory or not, that falls on exports during the course of exportation. See Fairbank v. United States, 181 U. S. 283(1901);

United States v. Hvoslef, 237 U. S. 1 (1915); Thames &
Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, supra. In Fairbank, for example, we addressed a federal stamp tax on bills
of lading for export shipments imposed by the War Revenue
Act of 1898. The Court found that the tax was facially dis-criminatory, 181 U. S., at 290, and, though not directly imposed on the goods being exported, the tax was nevertheless"in effect a duty on the article transported,"

id., at 294.
Consequently, the tax fell directly into the category of forbid-den taxes on exports defined in

Turpin. In striking down
the tax, we said:

"The requirement of the Constitution is that exports
should be free from any governmental burden. Thelanguage is `no tax or duty.' Whether such provision is

or is not wise is a question of policy with which thecourts have nothing to do. We know historically that it
was one of the compromises which entered into and
made possible the adoption of the Constitution. It is arestriction on the power of Congress . . . ." 181 U. S.,

at 290.
Hvoslef and Thames & Mersey differed from Fairbank in
that the taxes imposed in those cases--on ship charters and
marine insurance, respectively--did not facially discriminate
against exports. The Court nonetheless prohibited the
application of those generally applicable, nondiscriminatory

849Cite as: 517 U. S. 843 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
taxes to the transactions at issue because each tax was, ineffect, a tax on exports. The type of charter contract at

issue in Hvoslef was "in contemplation of law a mere con-tract of affreightment," 237 U. S., at 16, and we found that
the tax, as applied to charters for exportation, "was in substance a tax on the exportation; and a tax on the exportationis a tax on the exports,"

id., at 17. Likewise, in Thames &
Mersey, we found that "proper insurance during the voyageis one of the necessities of exportation" and that "the taxation of policies insuring cargoes during their transit to for-eign ports is as much a burden on exporting as if it were
laid on the charter parties, the bills of lading, or the goods
themselves." 237 U. S., at 27.

Shortly after Hvoslef and Thames & Mersey, the Court
rejected an attempt to shield from taxation the net income
of a company engaged in the export business. William E.
Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165 (1918). In accordance with
the analysis set out in Turpin, we found both that the tax
was nondiscriminatory and that "[i]t is not laid on articles in
course of exportation or on anything which inherently or by
the usages of commerce is embraced in exportation or any of
its processes." 247 U. S., at 174.

Only a few years later the Court struck down the application of a tax on the export sale of certain baseball equipment.
See A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66 (1923).
Although the tax was clearly nondiscriminatory, we explained that the goods being taxed had entered the course of
exportation when they were delivered to the export carrier.
Id., at 70. Because the taxable event, the transfer of title,
occurred at the same moment the goods entered the course
of exportation, we held that the tax could not constitutionally be applied to the export sale. Id., at 69-70.

The Court has strictly enforced the Export Clause's prohibition against federal taxation of goods in export transit, and
we have extended that protection to certain services and activities closely related to the export process. We have not,

850 UNITED STATES v. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

MACHINES CORP.

Opinion of the Court

however, exempted pre-export goods and services from ordi-nary tax burdens; nor have we exempted from federal taxation various services and activities only tangentially relatedto the export process.

III
The Government concedes, as it did below, that this caseis largely indistinguishable from

Thames & Mersey and that,if
Thames & Mersey is still good law, the tax assessedagainst IBM under $ 4371 violates the Export Clause. See

Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; 59 F. 3d, at 1237. The parties apparentlyagree that there is no legally significant distinction between
the insurance policies at issue in this case and those at issuein Thames & Mersey, and, accordingly, the Government asks
that we overrule Thames & Mersey.The Government asserts that the Export Clause permits
the imposition of generally applicable, nondiscriminatorytaxes, even on goods in export transit. The Government
urges that we have historically interpreted the Commerce,Import-Export, and Export Clauses in harmony and that we
have rejected the theory underlying Thames & Mersey inthe context of the Commerce and Import-Export Clauses.
Accordingly, the Government contends that our ExportClause jurisprudence, symbolized by Thames & Mersey, has
become an anachronism in need of modernization. The Gov-ernment asks us to reinterpret the Export Clause to permit
the imposition of generally applicable, nondiscriminatorytaxes as we have under the Commerce Clause and, it argues,
under the Import-Export Clause.

A
The Government contends that our dormant CommerceClause jurisprudence has shifted dramatically and that our

traditional understanding of the Export Clause, which isbased partly on an outmoded view of the Commerce Clause,
can no longer be justified. It is true that some of our earlyExport Clause cases relied on an interpretation of the

517US3$65N 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

851Cite as: 517 U. S. 843 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Commerce Clause that we have since rejected. In Fair-bank, 181 U. S., at 298-300, for example, we analogized to

Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing Dist., 120 U. S. 489, 497(1887), in which we held that "[i]nterstate commerce cannot
be taxed at all [by the States], even though the same amountof tax should be laid on domestic commerce, or that which is
carried on solely within the state." Referring to the cate-gorical ban on taxation of interstate commerce declared in
Robbins, we likened the scope of the Commerce Clause's banon state taxation of interstate commerce to the Export
Clause's ban on federal taxation of exports. Fairbank,
supra, at 300; see also Hvoslef, 237 U. S., at 15 ("The court[in

Fairbank] found an analogy in the construction which hadbeen given to the commerce clause in protecting interstate

commerce from state legislation imposing direct burdens").After Thames & Mersey, the Commerce Clause construction
espoused in Robbins fell out of favor, see Western Live Stockv. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938) ("It was not
the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engagedin interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business"),and we expressly disavowed that view in

Complete AutoTransit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 288-289 (1977).

Our rejection in Complete Auto of much of our earlydormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence did not, however,
signal a similar rejection of our Export Clause cases. Ourdecades-long struggle over the meaning of the nontextual
negative command of the dormant Commerce Clause doesnot lead to the conclusion that our interpretation of the textual command of the Export Clause is equally fluid. At onetime, the Court may have thought that the dormant Commerce Clause required a strict ban on state taxation of inter-state commerce, but the text did not require that view.

2

2 The Commerce Clause is an express grant of power to Congress to
"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States." U. S. Const., Art. I,

$ 8, cl. 3. It does not expressly prohibit the States from doing anything,

517US3$65N 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT
852 UNITED STATES v. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

MACHINES CORP.

Opinion of the Court

The text of the Export Clause, on the other hand, expresslyprohibits Congress from laying any tax or duty on exports.

These textual disparities strongly suggest that shifts in theCourt's view of the scope of the dormant Commerce Clause
should not, and indeed cannot, govern our interpretation of
the Export Clause. Cf. Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of
Equalization, 329 U. S. 69, 75-76 (1946) (distinguishing accommodations made under the Commerce Clause from theexpress textual prohibition of the Import-Export Clause).

B
The Government's primary assertion is that modificationsin our Import-Export Clause jurisprudence require parallel

modifications in the Export Clause context. More specifi-cally, the Government argues that our decisions in

Michelin
Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276 (1976), and Department of
Revenue of Wash. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos.,
435 U. S. 734 (1978), establish that States may impose generally applicable, nondiscriminatory taxes even if those taxes
fall on imports or exports. The Export Clause, the Government contends, is no more restrictive.

The Import-Export Clause, which is textually similar to
the Export Clause, says in relevant part, "No State shall . . .
lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports." U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 2. Though minor textual differences
exist and the Clauses are directed at different sovereigns,
historically both have been treated as broad bans on taxation
of exports, and in several cases the Court has interpreted
the provisions of the two Clauses in tandem. For instance,
in the Court's first decision interpreting the Import-Export
Clause, Chief Justice Marshall said:

though we have long recognized negative implications of the Clause that
prevent certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate.
See Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 330-331 (1996); Quill Corp.
v. North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 309 (1992).

Opinion of the Court
"The States are forbidden to lay a duty on exports, andthe United States are forbidden to lay a tax or duty on

articles exported from any State. There is some diver-sity in language, but none is perceivable in the act which
is prohibited." Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419,445 (1827).

See also Kosydar v. National Cash Register Co., 417 U. S.62, 67, n. 5 (1974); Hvoslef, supra, at 13-14; Cornell, 192 U. S.,
at 427-428; Turpin, 117 U. S., at 506-507. The Governmentargues that our longstanding parallel interpretations of the
two Clauses require judgment in its favor. We disagree.In

Michelin, we addressed whether a State could imposea nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported

goods that were no longer in import transit. Michelin,which imported tires from Canada and France and stored
them in a warehouse, argued that Georgia could not constitu-tionally assess ad valorem property taxes against its imported tires. We explained that "[t]he Framers of the Con-stitution . . . sought to alleviate three main concerns": (i)
ensuring that the Federal Government speaks with one voicewhen regulating foreign commerce; (ii) preserving import
revenues as a major source of federal revenue; and (iii) pre-venting disharmony likely to be caused if seaboard States
taxed goods coming through their ports. Michelin, supra,at 285-286. The Court found that nondiscriminatory ad valorem taxes violate none of these policies. A century ear-lier, however, the Court had ruled that, under the "original
package doctrine," a State could not impose such a tax untilthe goods had lost their character as imports and had been
incorporated into the mass of property in the State. Low v.
Austin, 13 Wall. 29, 34 (1872). The Michelin Court over-ruled Low and held that the nondiscriminatory property tax

levied on Michelin's inventory of imported tires did not vio-late the Import-Export Clause because it was not an impost
or duty on imports. 423 U. S., at 301. See also Limbach v.Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U. S. 353 (1984) (reaffirming that

Opinion of the Court

Michelin expressly overruled the original package doctrinealtogether and not merely Low on its facts).

Two years later, in Washington Stevedoring, we upheldagainst an Import-Export Clause challenge a nondiscriminatory state tax assessed against the compensation receivedby stevedoring companies for services performed within the
State. The Court found that Washington's stevedoring taxdid not violate the policies underlying the Import-Export
Clause. Unlike the property tax at issue in Michelin, theactivity taxed by Washington occurred while imports and
exports were in transit. That fact was not dispositive, how-ever, because the tax did not fall on the goods themselves:

"The levy reaches only the business of loading and un-loading ships or, in other words, the business of transporting cargo within the State of Washington. Despitethe existence of the first distinction, the presence of the
second leads to the conclusion that the Washington taxis not a prohibited `Impost or Duty' when it violates
none of the policies [that animate the Import-ExportClause]." Washington Stevedoring, supra, at 755.

Relying on Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951),which upheld a tax on the gross receipts of a railroad that
operated a marine terminal and transported imports and ex-ports, we ruled in Washington Stevedoring that taxation of
transportation services, whether by railroad on the docks orby stevedores loading and unloading ships, did not relate to
the value of the goods and could not be considered impostsor duties on the goods themselves. 435 U. S., at 757.

A tax on policies insuring exports is not, precisely speak-ing, the same as a tax on exports, but

Thames & Merseyheld that they were functionally the same under the Export

Clause. We noted in Washington Stevedoring that one mayquestion the finding in Thames & Mersey that the tax was

essentially a tax upon the exportation itself. 435 U. S., at756, n. 21. We expressed concern that "[t]he basis for distinguishing Thames & Mersey is less clear" than for Fairbankor

Richfield Oil, because the marine insurance policies in
Thames & Mersey arguably "had a value apart from the
value of the goods." 435 U. S., at 756, n. 21. Nevertheless,the Government apparently has chosen not to challenge that

aspect of Thames & Mersey in this case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5,8-9, 40. When questioned on that implicit concession at oral
argument, the Government admitted that it "chose not to"argue that $ 4371 does not impose a tax on the goods themselves. Id., at 9. It would be inappropriate for us to reex-amine in this case, without the benefit of the parties' briefing,
whether the policies on which $ 4371 is assessed are so
closely connected to the goods that the tax is, in essence, atax on exports.

doesn't reveal the sort of statistical information Justice
Breyer was suggesting might be relevant" to determine
"whether this is sufficiently indirect that it's not a tax on

3 The Court has never held that the Export Clause prohibits only direct
taxation of goods in export transit. In Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat.
419 (1827), Chief Justice Marshall expressed in dicta his skepticism that a
federal occupational tax on exporters could pass scrutiny under the Export Clause. Id., at 445 ("[W]ould government be permitted to shield
itself from the just censure to which this attempt to evade the prohibitions
of the constitution would expose it, by saying that this was a tax on the
person, not on the article, and that the legislature had a right to tax occupations?"). In Fairbank, Hvoslef, and Thames & Mersey, we struck down
taxes that were not assessed directly on goods in export transit, but which
the Court found to be so closely related as to be effectively a tax on the
goods themselves. We have never repudiated that principle, but neither
have we ever carefully defined how we decide whether a particular federal
tax is sufficiently related to the goods or their value to violate the Export
Clause. To the extent the issue was raised in the petition for certiorari,
the Government failed to address the issue in its brief on the merits and
therefore has abandoned it. See Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States,
511 U. S. 513, 527 (1994); Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, 754, n. 7

exports, . . . because the Government has conceded through-out that they are not disputing that this tax, if discriminatory, is in violation of the Constitution").Stare decisis is a "principle of policy," Helvering v.
Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940), and not "an inexorablecommand,"

Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991).Applying that policy, we frequently have declined to overrule cases in appropriate circumstances because stare decisis"promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial deci-sions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity
of the judicial process." Id., at 827. "[E]ven in constitu-tional cases, the doctrine carries such persuasive force that
we have always required a departure from precedent tobe supported by some `special justification.' "

Id., at 842(
Souter, J., concurring) (quoting Arizona v. Rumsey, 467U. S. 203, 212 (1984)).

Though from time to time we have overruled governingdecisions that are "unworkable or are badly reasoned,"
Payne, supra, at 827; see Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649,665 (1944), we have rarely done so on grounds not advanced
by the parties. Thames & Mersey has been controllingprecedent for over 80 years, and the Government does not,
indeed could not, argue that the rule established there is"unworkable." Despite the dissent's speculative protestations to the contrary, post, at 871-872, there is simply noevidence that

Thames & Mersey has caused or will causeuncertainty in commercial export transactions. The principles that animate our policy of stare decisis caution againstoverruling a longstanding precedent on a theory not argued
by the parties, and we decline to do so in this case.4

4 The dissent suggests that "the Court assumes the statute to be invalid
rather than deciding it to be so." Post, at 864. We make no such assumptions. Rather, we begin with a longstanding decision that, by all accounts, controls this case. Even the Government agrees that Congress
enacted a law whose application in this case directly contravenes our hold517US3$65N 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

What the Government does argue is that our Import-Export Clause cases require us to overrule

Thames &Mersey.
5 We have good reason to hesitate before adopting

the analysis of our recent Import-Export Clause cases intoour Export Clause jurisprudence. Though we have frequently interpreted the Clauses together, see supra, at 852-854, our more recent Import-Export Clause cases, on which
the Government relies, caution that meaningful textual dif-ferences exist and should not be overlooked. The Export
Clause prohibits Congress from laying any "Tax or Duty" onexports, while the Import-Export Clause prevents the
States from laying any "Imposts or Duties" on imports orexports. In both

Michelin and Washington Stevedoring, weleft open the possibility that a particular state assessment

might not properly be called an impost or duty, and thuswould be beyond the reach of the Import-Export Clause,
while an identical federal assessment might properly becalled a tax and would be subject to the Export Clause.
Though we found in Michelin that a nondiscriminatory stateproperty tax does not transgress the policy dictates of the
Import-Export Clause, we also recognized that the Import-Export Clause is "not written in terms of a broad prohibition
of every `tax,' " and that impost and duty are narrower termsthan tax. 423 U. S., at 290-293. In Washington Stevedoring, we likewise rejected the assertion that the Import-Export Clause absolutely prohibits all taxation of imports
and exports. 435 U. S., at 759. We said that "the term `Im-post or Duty' is not self-defining and does not necessarily
encompass all taxes" and that the respondents' argument to

ing in Thames & Mersey. We sit not to condemn $ 4371, but rather to
determine whether it is to be saved by overruling binding precedent.

5 The dissent suggests that we make a "serious mistake" in deciding

whether a nondiscriminatory tax on goods violates the Export Clause,
post, at 881. We do not agree that it is a mistake to address the arguments actually advanced by the parties.

Opinion of the Court

the contrary ignored "the central holding of Michelin thatthe absolute ban is only of `Imposts or Duties' and not of all

taxes." Ibid.The distinction between imposts or duties and taxes is
especially pertinent in light of the peculiar definitional analy-sis we chose in

Michelin. Finding substantial ambiguity inthe phrase "Imposts or Duties," we "decline[d] to presume

it was intended to embrace taxation that does not createthe evils the Clause was specifically intended to eliminate."
423 U. S., at 293-294. We entirely bypassed the etymologi-cal inquiry into the proper meaning of the terms "impost"
and "duty," and instead created a regime in which those
terms are conclusions to be drawn from an examination intowhether a particular assessment "was the type of exaction

that was regarded as objectionable by the Framers of theConstitution."

Id., at 286. We are not prepared to say that
the word "Tax" is "sufficiently ambiguous," id., at 293, thatwe may ignore its common, and usually expansive,

6 meaning

in favor of an Export Clause decisional rule in which a taxis not a "Tax" unless it discriminates against exports. Consequently, Michelin and Washington Stevedoring, whichheld that the assessments in question were not "Imposts or
Duties" at all, do not logically validate the assessment atissue in this case, which, by all accounts, remains a "Tax."

It is not intuitively obvious that Michelin's three-prongedanalysis of the Framers' concerns is really just another way
of stating a nondiscrimination principle. But even if it were,
the Government cannot reasonably rely on Michelin to gov-ern the Export Clause because

Michelin drew its analysis
around the phrase "Imposts or Duties" and expressly ex6 Though Michelin discusses "taxes" in terms of "every exaction," 423
U. S., at 290, it also suggests that at the time of the founding "probably
only capitation, land, and general property exactions were known by the
term `tax' rather than the term `duty,' " id., at 291. In any event, the
Michelin Court understood that the terms used in the Export Clause were
broader than those used in the Import-Export Clause.

Opinion of the Court
cluded the broader term "Tax" that appears in the ExportClause.

Michelin marked a more permissive approach to
state taxation under the Import-Export Clause only by dis-tinguishing the presumptively stricter language of the Export Clause. We agree with the Government that Michelin
informs our decision in this case, but not in a way that sup-ports the Government's position. It is simply no longer true

that the Court perceives no substantive difference betweenthe two Clauses.

We are similarly hesitant to adopt the Import-ExportClause's policy-based analysis without some indication that
the Export Clause was intended to alleviate the same "evils"
to which the Import-Export Clause was directed. Unlike
the Import-Export Clause, which was intended to protect
federal supremacy in international commerce, to preserve
federal revenue from import duties and imposts, and to prevent coastal States with ports from taking unfair advantage
of inland States, see Michelin, supra, at 285-286, the Export
Clause serves none of those goals. Indeed, textually, the
Export Clause does quite the opposite. It specifically prohibits Congress from regulating international commerce
through export taxes, disallows any attempt to raise federal
revenue from exports, and has no direct effect on the way
the States treat imports and exports.

As a purely historical matter, the Export Clause was originally proposed by delegates to the Federal Convention from
the Southern States, who feared that the Northern States
would control Congress and would use taxes and duties on
exports to raise a disproportionate share of federal revenues
from the South. See 2 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 95, 305-308, 359-363 (rev. ed.
1966). The Government argues that this "narrow historical
purpose" justifies a narrow interpretation of the text and
that application of $ 4371 to policies insuring exports does
not conflict with the policies embodied in the Clause. Brief
for United States 32-34. While the original impetus may

Opinion of the Court

have had a narrow focus, the remedial provision that ulti-mately became the Export Clause does not, and there is substantial evidence from the Debates that proponents of theClause fully intended the breadth of scope that is evident in
the language. See, e. g., 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal
Convention, supra, at 220 (Mr. King: "In two great pointsthe hands of the Legislature were absolutely tied. The importation of slaves could not be prohibited--exports couldnot be taxed");

id., at 305 ("Mr. Mason urged the necessity
of connecting with the power of levying taxes . . . that notax should be laid on exports");

id., at 360 (Mr. Elseworth
[sic]: "There are solid reasons agst. Congs taxing exports");
ibid. ("Mr. Butler was strenuously opposed to a power over
exports"); id., at 361 (Mr. Sherman: "It is best to prohibit the
National legislature in all cases"); id., at 362 ("Mr. Gerry wasstrenuously opposed to the power over exports").

The Government argued for a different narrow interpreta-tion of the Export Clause in

Fairbank. See 181 U. S., at
292-293. Arguing that the Debates expressed a primary interest in diffusing sectional conflicts, the Government urged
the Fairbank Court to interpret the Export Clause to permit
taxation of "the act of exportation or the document evidencing the receipt of goods for export, for these exist with substantial uniformity throughout the country." Id., at 292.
We rejected that argument:

"If mere discrimination between the States was all that
was contemplated, it would seem to follow that an ad
valorem tax upon all exports would not be obnoxious
to this constitutional prohibition. But surely under this
limitation Congress can impose an export tax neither on
one article of export, nor on all articles of export."
Ibid.

As in Fairbank, we think the text of the constitutional provision provides a better decisional guide than that offered by

Opinion of the Court
the Government. The Government's policy argument--thatthe Framers intended the Export Clause to narrowly alleviate the fear of northern repression through taxation ofsouthern exports by prohibiting only discriminatory taxes--
cannot be squared with the broad language of the Clause.The better reading, that adopted by our earlier cases, is that
the Framers sought to alleviate their concerns by completelydenying to Congress the power to tax exports at all.

3
Even assuming that Michelin and Washington Stevedoring govern our Export Clause inquiry in this case, the Gov-ernment's argument falls short of its goal. Our holdings in

Michelin and Washington Stevedoring do not reach the factsof this case and, more importantly, do not interpret the
Import-Export Clause to permit assessment of nondiscrimi-natory taxes on imports and exports in transit.

Michelininvolved a tax on goods, but the goods were no longer in

transit. The tax in Washington Stevedoring burdened im-ports and exports while they were still in transit, but it did
not fall directly on the goods themselves. This case, as itcomes to us, is a hybrid in which the tax both burdens exports during transit and--as the Government concedes andour earlier cases held--is essentially a tax on the goods
themselves. The Government argues that Michelin and
Washington Stevedoring by analogy permit Congress to im-pose generally applicable, nondiscriminatory taxes that fall

directly on exports in transit. Brief for United States 32(Michelin and Washington Stevedoring "demonstrate that,
when a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax is atissue, the mere fact that the tax applies also to goods that
are in the export or import process does not provide a constitutional immunity from taxation"). If this contention is tosucceed, the Government at the very least must show that

our Import-Export Clause jurisprudence now permits a

MACHINES CORP.

Opinion of the Court

State to impose a nondiscriminatory tax directly on goods inimport or export transit. We think the Government has

failed to make that showing.The Court has never upheld a state tax assessed directly
on goods in import or export transit. In Michelin, we suggested that the Import-Export Clause would invalidate ap-plication of a nondiscriminatory property tax to goods still

in import or export transit. 423 U. S., at 290 (compliancewith the Import-Export Clause may be secured "by prohibiting the assessment of even nondiscriminatory property taxeson [import or export] goods which are merely in transit
through the State when the tax is assessed"). See also
Virginia Indonesia Co. v. Harris County Appraisal Dist.,
910 S. W. 2d 905, 915 (Tex. 1995) (invalidating application
of a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax to goods in
export transit).

We also declined to endorse the Government's theory in
Washington Stevedoring. After reciting that the Court in
Canton R. Co. had distinguished Thames & Mersey, Fairbank, and Richfield Oil, we pointed out that in those cases
"the State [or Federal Government] had taxed either the
goods or activity so connected with the goods that the levy
amounted to a tax on the goods themselves." Washington
Stevedoring, 435 U. S., at 756, n. 21. We expressly declined
to "reach the question of the applicability of the Michelin
approach when a State directly taxes imports or exports in
transit," id., at 757, n. 23, because, although the goods in that
case were in transit, the tax fell on "a service distinct from
the goods and their value," id., at 757. Thus, contrary to the
Government's contention, this Court's Import-Export Clause
cases have not upheld the validity of generally applicable,
nondiscriminatory taxes that fall on imports or exports in
transit. We think those cases leave us free to follow the
express textual command of the Export Clause to prohibit
the application of any tax "laid on Articles exported from
any State."

We conclude that the Export Clause does not permitassessment of nondiscriminatory federal taxes on goods in

export transit. Reexamination of the question whether aparticular assessment on an activity or service is so closely
connected to the goods as to amount to a tax on the goodsthemselves must await another day. We decline to overrule

The Court today holds a federal statute unconstitutionalwithout giving heed to the simplest reason for sustaining it.

sentence of the opinion, the Court says, "We resolve in thiscase whether the Export Clause of the Constitution permits

federal tax on goods in export transit," ante, at 845. In soreformulating the question, the Court makes the assumption

that $ 4371's insurance tax is a tax on export goods, therebyadopting the premise of Thames & Mersey that I had
thought we were to address. In the end the Court assumesthe statute to be invalid rather than deciding it to be so. I
find no precedent for setting aside an Act of Congress inthis peremptory way. Worse yet, the Court's assumption is
wrong; because $ 4371 taxes a service distinct from the goodsand is not a proxy for taxing the goods, it does not fall within
the prohibition of the Export Clause. The Court thuscarves out an undeserved exemption from $ 4371 for exporters, adding significant complexity to its administration.Moreover, in a case in which the Export Clause should not
even apply, the Court tackles the great problem of reconcil-ing our Export Clause jurisprudence with modern decisions
interpreting the Commerce and Import-Export Clauses,U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 2, and Art. I, $ 10, cl. 2. This
is unwise and unnecessary. I would limit the inquiry to areconsideration of

Thames & Mersey, and uphold the statuteas applied to respondent. With respect, I dissent.

I
We consider a rather simple federal tax. Section 4371 ofthe Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax of "4 cents on each

dollar, or fractional part thereof, of the premium paid on thepolicy of casualty insurance or the indemnity bond, if issued
to or for, or in the name of, an insured . . . ." 26 U. S. C.$ 4371(1) (1982 ed.). The term "insured" is defined to include any "domestic corporation or partnership, or an indi-vidual resident of the United States, against, or with respect
to, hazards, risks, losses, or liabilities wholly or partly withinthe United States . . . ." $ 4372(d)(1). The statute does not
discriminate against exports. Indeed, it does not even men-tion them. The tax must be paid not only by domestic traders but also by any insured, even an individual, who is cov517US3$65L 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

ered in whole or in part for domestic casualty risks. Thepurpose of the tax is to "eliminate an unwarranted competitive advantage now favoring foreign insurers," H. R. Rep.No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 61 (1942), who do not pay
federal income tax. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $ 4373(1) (1982 ed.) (exempting from $ 4371 any policy issued by a foreign insurerthat is "signed or countersigned by an officer or agent of the

insurer in a State, or in the District of Columbia, withinwhich such insurer is authorized to do business" and is therefore subject to the income tax).Resolution of the case requires us to determine whether
the Export Clause has any bearing on taxes on services like
insurance provided to exporters, where the service itself is
not exported. The plain text of the Clause casts much doubt
on the proposition. It states: "No Tax or Duty shall be laid
on Articles exported from any State," U. S. Const., Art. I,

$ 9, cl. 5. The majority avoids this necessary question by
asserting that the Government failed to argue the point and
so abandoned it. Ante, at 855, and n. 3. True, the Government defends $ 4371 on the ground that it does not discriminate between exports and other forms of trade, but this is
not a concession that there is no distinction between a tax
on insurance premiums and a tax on goods. In fact, the Government makes repeated references to the distinction in its
briefs, albeit in the context of discussing the nondiscriminatory character of $ 4371. See, e. g., Brief for United States
12-13 (The tax "does not apply specifically to export transactions; to the contrary, it applies only to insurance risks that
are either `wholly' or `partly' domestic"); id., at 15 ("The tax
imposed by Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code is not
specifically directed to nor directly `laid on Articles exported'
(U. S. Const. Art. I, $ 9, Cl. 5). Instead, it applies to insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers for many forms of
insurance, including any casualty risk that is `wholly or
partly within the United States' (26 U. S. C. $ 4372(d)(1))");
id., at 34 ("Even as applied to casualty insurance, the tax

unquestionably has only an incidental and remote relation-ship to exports and the export process . . .").

At oral argument, the Assistant to the Solicitor Generalacknowledged that he had not made a separate argument
based on the distinction between export goods and services
related to the exporting process. He explained that thenondiscrimination theory had greater utility, sparing courts

the nettlesome inquiry into what is an export. Tr. of OralArg. 9. When asked why the Government was avoiding the
simpler and clearer argument that $ 4371 was just a tax onforeign insurers to offset the tax burdens borne by domestic
insurers, he responded, "We do not mean to avoid that argument. That's part of our argument of why this is a tax of
general application." Id., at 12. Later in oral argument,
he stated that "it's problematic to describe a tax on insurance as a tax on the good," and cited that problem as a reason
for calling into question our decision in Thames & Mersey.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. When asked if his position had foreclosed us from deciding the case on that basis, he responded:
"I don't believe you're foreclosed . . . by our concession from
addressing that issue as you see fit." Ibid. We have relied
on statements more equivocal than this to reconsider and
overrule a bad precedent even when the parties in their
briefs had argued that the precedent should be upheld. See
Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill.
Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 319-320 (1971).

The Court's faulty characterization of the Government's
argument leads it down some odd byways. For example, in
Part III-B-3, the Court rejects the Government's attempt
to rely upon Department of Revenue of Wash. v. Association
of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978), where we
held that a state tax of general applicability imposed upon a
stevedoring firm did not violate the Import-Export Clause
even though it may have added to the cost of importing and
exporting. The Court points out that the tax in Washington
Stevedoring did not fall directly on the goods, ante, at 861,

and that we reserved the question whether States could taxgoods in import or export transit,

ante, at 862 (citing 435
U. S., at 757, n. 23). So, in the Court's view, Washington
Stevedoring does not support the Government's argument
that "Congress [may] impose generally applicable, nondiscriminatory taxes that fall directly on exports in transit,"
ante, at 861. The Government never argues that $ 4371 imposes a tax on goods in transit, however. See, e. g., Brief forUnited States 15 (the tax imposed by $ 4371 "does not fall

specifically on articles of export or export transactions"). Ifthe Government can be faulted, it is for urging us to uphold

$ 4371 on a broad theory (a tax that does not discriminate
against exports is valid) rather than the narrow theory subsumed within it (this particular tax does not fall on export
goods at all). Nothing in the Government's argument prevents us from deciding the case on the narrower ground.

Even were we to suppose that the Government did not
argue the goods and services distinction, the prudential rule
against deciding a case on an unargued theory is in any event
not absolute. See Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73,
77 (1990); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 77-78 (1938)
(overturning Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), as unconstitutional); see also 304 U. S., at 82 (Butler, J.) (pointing out that
no constitutional question was argued or briefed either in
this Court or the court below). Cf. Evans v. United States,
504 U. S. 255, 269 (1992) (addressing a theory not argued by
the parties but advanced by Justice Thomas in dissent);
United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 246 (1992) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment). This rule has less force when the
issue before us is whether it is constitutional to apply the
statute where Congress intended it to apply. The predicate
question of whether the Export Clause prohibits taxes on
distinct services like insurance is "essential to the analysis"
of the question presented, Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S.

resolution of the constitutionality" of the statute, Vance v.

statement of any question presented will be deemed tocomprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein").

To give Congress the respect it is owed, we must decide
whether the statute is in fact unconstitutional as applied, notmake the borderline call that the Government's litigation position bars us from reaching a question which, as the Courtseems to agree, is presented by the case. In interpreting
statutes, for example, we have long observed "[t]he elemen-tary rule . . . that every reasonable construction must be
resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutional-ity."

Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895). See
also United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &
Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909) ("[W]here a statute issusceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and

doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other ofwhich such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the
latter"); Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64,118 (1804).

"This approach not only reflects the prudential concernthat constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted,
but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, isbound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution.
The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Con-gress intended to infringe constitutionally protected
liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it."

We have not considered ourselves foreclosed from adopting
saving constructions the parties failed to suggest. See, e. g.,

Defendant-in-Error 3-12, in Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, O. T.1923, No. 369. We cannot here avoid a constitutional question by statutory construction, but we should take all meas-ures to avoid declaring that Congress "usurp[ed] power constitutionally forbidden it," DeBartolo, supra, at 575. The
majority cites no case in which we have declared a federalstatute unconstitutional by disregarding an unargued theory

that would save the statute, and I am not aware of any. Weshould at least consider a construction of the Export Clause
that would render it inapplicable to the statute, rather thanassuming the issue away and reaching the unnecessary judgment that a coordinate branch violated the Constitution.

There may be instances, even in constitutional cases, when
we should eschew alternative theories for sustaining a statute. For example, we might do so if the theories depend
upon different provisions of law or require factual development and legal analysis far afield from that done by the parties or the courts below. That is not this case. The question whether the Export Clause applies to taxes on distinct
export-related services requires most of the same inquiries
the majority undertakes: construing the text of the Export
Clause, considering its history and purpose, and reviewing
our precedents. It also requires explicit reexamination of
the reasoning of Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United
States, 237 U. S. 19 (1915), which the Government has asked
us to overrule, in particular the idea that a tax on insurance
premiums is a tax on the goods. The last is the only step
the Court refuses to take.

There is not, as the Court intimates, ante, at 855, a need
for statistical development of the relative incidence of this
tax on exporters, unless the Court (as appears unlikely) is
interested in the statistics from 1942 to determine if the statute was a pretext when it was enacted. The current incidence of the tax on exporters, whatever it is, will reflect
market conditions in light of the operation of this tax over
more than 50 years, including the strength of foreign insur517US3$65L 02-07-99 19:38:29 PAGES OPINPGT

ers in certain lines exporters purchase, cf. R. Holtom, Under-writing Principles & Practices 451 (3d ed. 1987) (ocean marine insurance dominated by foreign companies). There isno law prohibiting persons from being insured under policies
of foreign insurers issued abroad, and nothing in the statute
exempts nonexporters from its operation. The Court has allthe information it needs to decide this case on the proper

basis, and it should not rest its decision that $ 4371 is uncon-stitutional upon a dubious assumption that a general tax on
insurance premiums is a tax on export goods.In

Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U. S. 611 (1948),
the Government had conceded certain matters of statutory
construction which, we felt, undermined its entire position.
Id., at 624. We refused to accept those concessions, and,
giving the statute its proper interpretation, ruled in the
Government's favor. Id., at 625. It mystifies me that in a
constitutional case, where our decision is not subject to congressional revision, the Court here accepts the Government's
purported concession of the meaning of the Export Clause
without any independent examination of the question, and
then invokes the Clause to strike down a statute. See
Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U. S. 465, 471, n. 3 (1979) ("[E]ven
an explicit concession" by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
that it was subject to the requirements of the Fourth
Amendment would not "relieve this Court of the performance of the judicial function of deciding the issue") (internal
quotation marks omitted).

Quite apart from the unnecessary judgment that an Act
of Congress is unconstitutional as applied, today's decision
adds significant complexity to the administration of $ 4371.
Under the thumb of the Court's holding that all premiums
paid to insure export goods are exempt from $ 4371, but also
under the statutory mandate to collect the tax in all other
instances, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) henceforth
finds itself faced with an array of new problems unexplained
and unmentioned by the Court. Insurance is one of the

Kennedy, J., dissenting
most complex of businesses, with a multitude of coverageand policy options in different product lines, all generated

and still evolving in pursuit of the profitable and efficientunderwriting of risks. Not every case will fit the simple
model here: a policy written for a single shipment; coverage
beginning only with a common carrier picking up the goodsfrom the warehouse or manufacturing plant; simple ascertainment of point of entry into the export stream. Stip-ulation of Facts |||| 13, 16, App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a, 39a;
cf. A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66, 68-69(1923) (delivery to common carrier signals commencement
of export).

Commercial inland marine transit insurance, the form of
casualty insurance which covers domestic transportation of
goods, "is usually written on an open basis, under which all
shipments of the kind of merchandise described in the policy
are covered." Holtom, supra, at 435. It would appear,
from today's decision, that if a company has an open policy
from a foreign insurer covering the domestic leg of the journey for all shipments, the IRS must untangle what portion
of the insurance covered goods that had commenced the process of exportation, and then prorate the tax. So too would
proration (or some other accommodation) appear necessary
if the policy is taken out on a single shipment but part of the
shipment is delivered within the country and part abroad.

In addition, the Court's decision draws the IRS into the
factual morass of determining when exportation has begun.
That will often be less clear than it is here. For example, a
company may have its own trucks carry goods to a freight
forwarder or port, or a hiatus in the journey might be extensive enough to remove the goods from the export stream,
see Joy Oil Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 337 U. S. 286, 288-289
(1949); since "not every preliminary movement of goods toward eventual exportation" triggers the constitutional immunity, Kosydar v. National Cash Register Co., 417 U. S. 62,
69, n. 6 (1974), the determination of the commencement of

exportation is another layer of complexity added to the ad-ministration of $ 4371. Finally, the IRS now must determine which of the many, ever evolving types of insurance fallwithin the broad prohibition of Thames & Mersey against
any tax that burdens the exporting process. See 237 U. S.,at 27. Truckers, for example, often take insurance out to
cover liability for the loss or damage to merchandise thatthey are carrying. Holtom,

supra, at 435. The cost of thatinsurance, which may be specific to an export shipment and

related to the value of the goods, is likely passed through insome measure to the exporter and therefore "falls upon the
exporting process," Thames & Mersey, 237 U. S., at 27.Questions will also arise whether it violates the Export
Clause to tax insurance taken out by an export freight-forwarder to cover a warehouse storing goods in transit, or
to tax ocean marine protection and indemnity insurancetaken out by a vessel owner to protect against damage to
export cargo, cf. Holtom, supra, at 452, if part of the riskcovered is domestic.

The severity of these administrative burdens will dependin part upon the penetration of the domestic market by foreign insurers in certain lines. We can anticipate increasedburdens with the 4% price cut in foreign insurance for exporters that results from today's decision. The Court iswrong to frustrate the will of Congress by giving exporters
an undeserved exemption from $ 4371 and by adding needlesscomplexity to the administration of the statute, all upon the
incorrect, unexamined assumption that the tax is on ex-ported goods.

II
Turning to the question that I take to be dispositive, Iwould hold that the Export Clause does not apply to $ 4371.

The text and history of the Clause, and its interpretation bythe Fifth Congress, suggest that taxes on insurance do not
fall within its prohibitions. Because $ 4371 taxes a servicedistinct from the actual export of the goods, and does not

function as a proxy for taxing their value, I would uphold itsapplication to International Business Machines Corporation

(IBM).In my view, the Framers understood the Export Clause to
prohibit what its text says: any federal tax "laid on Articles
exported," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5, not taxes on serviceslike insurance that may have indirect effect on the cost of

exporting. There was a history of nations' imposing oner-ous taxes on exported goods, even in England until the rise
of mercantilist trade policy resulted in the repeal of mostexport taxes by the end of the 17th century, see W. Kennedy,
English Taxation 1640-1799, p. 35 (1913). And specific taxeson exported goods were the only taxes mentioned in the
debate at the Constitutional Convention over the Export
Clause. For example, Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania,opposing the Clause, favored taxing exports as an alternative to direct taxes on individuals.

"He considered the taxing of exports to be in many cases
highly politic. Virginia has found her account in taxingTobacco. All Countries having peculiar articles tax the

exportation of them; as France her wines and brandies.A tax here on lumber, would fall on the W. Indies &
punish their restrictions on our trade. The same is trueof live-stock and in some degree of flour. In case of
a dearth in the West Indies, we may extort what weplease. Taxes on exports are a necessary source of revenue. For a long time the people of America will not
have money to pay direct taxes. Seize and sell theireffects and you push them into Revolts." 2 M. Farrand,

ed. 1966).

on tobacco; Mr. Clymer: discussing middle States' apprehensions of taxes on products like wheat flour and provisions
that, unlike tobacco and rice, were sold in competitive markets). Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut even contended that
he opposed export taxes in part because "there are indeed
but a few articles that could be taxed at all; as Tobo. rice &
indigo, and a tax on these alone would be partial & unjust."
Id., at 360.

In interpreting constitutional restrictions on the taxing
power, we must recall that the want of this power in the
National Government was one of the great weaknesses of
the Articles of Confederation. With its expenses outpacing
revenues from requisitions from the States, the central Government had emptied its vaults by 1782 and soon defaulted
on its substantial debt. R. Paul, Taxation in the United
States 4-5 (1954). As the Convention records indicate, depriving the Federal Government of the power to tax even
export goods was a contentious issue, given the concern that
it would cut off a needed source of revenue as well as disable
Congress from using export taxes as an instrument of policy.

prohibition on taxing exports be replaced with a provision

requiring a two-thirds vote of each House failed by the voteof only one State. 2 Farrand,

supra, at 363. There is no
cause for extending the Export Clause beyond the bargainstruck at the Convention and embodied in its text.

There is other compelling historical evidence weighing
against Thames & Mersey's view of the Export Clause as aprohibition extending even to taxes on services that have the

indirect effect of raising exportation costs. In 1797 theFifth Congress passed "An Act laying Duties on stamped
Vellum, Parchment and Paper." Among its provisions wasa stamp duty upon

"any policy of insurance or instrument in nature thereof,whereby any ships, vessels or goods going from one district to another in the United States, or from the UnitedStates to any foreign port or place, shall be insured, to
wit, if going from one district to another in the UnitedStates, twenty-five cents; if going from the United
States to any foreign port or place, when the sum for
which insurance is made shall not exceed five hundreddollars, twenty-five cents; and when the sum insured

shall exceed five hundred dollars, one dollar . . . ." Actof July 6, 1797, ch. 11, $ 1, 1 Stat. 527.

The duties survived until the unpopular Federalist tax system, which was felt to bear too heavily upon those least able
to pay, was abolished soon after Jefferson took office. SeePaul,

supra, at 6.
We have always been reluctant to say a statute of thisearly origin offends the Constitution, absent clear inconsistency. See Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 56 (1900) (imposition of legacy taxes in the same 1797 statute casts doubt
on claim that Congress lacks such power); see Ludecke v.
Watkins, 335 U. S. 160, 171 (1948) ("The [Alien Enemy Act
of 1798] is almost as old as the Constitution, and it would
savor of doctrinaire audacity now to find the statute offensive to some emanation of the Bill of Rights"). The 1797

Kennedy, J., dissenting

statute should dispel any doubt on the issue. Taxes on insurance do not offend the Export Clause. It is not likely,
moreover, that the Act was passed to circumvent the Export
Clause. The early Congresses were scrupulous in honoring
the Export Clause by making specific exemptions for exports
in laws imposing general taxes on goods. See, e. g., Act of
Mar. 3, 1791, ch. 15, $ 51, 1 Stat. 199, 210-211 (tax on distilled
spirits); Act of June 5, 1794, ch. 51, $ 14, 1 Stat. 384, 387 (tax
on snuff and refined sugar). Their refusal to grant exporters similar exemptions from insurance taxes indicates that
those taxes were not viewed as equivalent to taxes on goods.

In Fairbank v. United States, 181 U. S. 283 (1901), the
Court struck down an 1898 statute imposing a stamp tax on
an export bill of lading despite a similar tax in the 1797 statute. The decision in Fairbank was 5-4, with a strong dissent from the first Justice Harlan urging deference to the
implicit exposition of the Export Clause by the Fifth Congress. The Court, though, reserved the contemporaneousexposition rule for " `doubtful cases,' " id., at 311, and had no
doubt that the "discriminating and excessive tax" imposed
on export bills of lading in the 1898 Act (10 times that
imposed on internal bills of lading, id., at 290) was
unconstitutional.

There is no need to reconsider Fairbank, nor to distinguish
it by sole reliance upon the interpretation offered in Washington Stevedoring, which observed that the stamp duty at
issue in Fairbank "effectively taxed the goods because the

bills represented the goods," 435 U. S., at 756, n. 21. The
tax here, unlike the stamp duty in Fairbank, does not discriminate against exports; it taxes a service distinct from the
act of exporting; and it has the clear regulatory purpose of
eliminating a perceived competitive advantage of foreign
insurers. Viewed in this light, the conclusion of the Fifth
Congress that the Export Clause did not bar any tax on
export insurance should have great weight in assessing the

Kennedy, J., dissenting
constitutionality of $ 4371, and Fairbank is not to the
contrary.

Turning once more to Thames & Mersey, I note the 1797
statute was neither briefed to the Court there nor discussed
in its opinion. The Court, furthermore, did not examine the
text or history of the Export Clause, relying instead on the
broad theory of the Clause espoused in the companion case,
United States v. Hvoslef, 237 U. S. 1 (1915): namely, that it
meant the "process of exporting . . . should not be obstructed or hindered by any burden of taxation," id., at 13
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). See
Thames & Mersey, 237 U. S., at 25. (Hvoslef 's holding that
a nondiscriminatory tax on charter parties was unconstitutional as applied to export shipments, by the way, is also
called into question by the 1797 Act, which imposed a similar tax.)

Besides failing to consider the evidence just cited, the
Thames & Mersey Court relied in part on the theory that
insurance is not commerce and so, by implication, the regulatory aspect of the tax could not be justified as an exercise of
Congress' Commerce Clause power. See Thames & Mersey,
supra, at 25, citing Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168 (1869). As
a result, the Court reasoned, an insurance policy was simply
a personal contract and a document which, by custom, was a
necessary part of every export transaction. 237 U. S., at 25-
26. A tax on the premiums of such a policy, which fell upon
the exporting process and increased its costs, was thought
to be the equivalent to a tax laid on charter parties, bills of
lading, or the goods themselves. Id., at 27. We abandoned
long ago the notion that insurance is not commerce and so
beyond the power of Congress to regulate. See United
States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U. S. 533,
543-545 (1944). Congress enacted $ 4371 to regulate competition within the insurance field, and its authority to do so
ought not to be impaired by a strained reading of the Export

Clause or reliance on the outmoded reasoning of Thames &
Mersey.

We have discarded, in Import-Export Clause cases, theidea afoot in

Hvoslef and Thames & Mersey that a tax on
services necessary to the export process is equivalent to a
tax on goods. In Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511(1951), the Court upheld a state gross-receipts tax on a steam

railroad, even as applied to the railroad's handling of exportsand imports from its marine terminal in the port of Baltimore. The tax was "not on the goods but on the handling ofthem at the port," we said, and "when the tax is on activities
connected with the export or import the range of immunity
cannot be so wide." Id., at 514-515. Following Canton,
the Court in Washington Stevedoring decided that taxes on
services may be permissible even if levied upon an activity,
such as stevedoring, which occurs while imports and exports
are in transit. We remarked: "The transportation services
in both settings are necessary to the import-export process.
Taxation in neither setting relates to the value of the goods,
and therefore in neither can it be considered taxation upon
the goods themselves." 435 U. S., at 757. The distinctions
drawn between services and goods in those cases did not
depend on the differences between the text of the Export
and Import-Export Clauses, and should be observed here.

The Court's effort to justify its decision on the grounds of
stare decisis, ante, at 856, is unconvincing. Stare decisis
does not protect a constitutional decision where the reasoning is as poor as it is in Thames & Mersey, see Smith v.
Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944), nor when the precedent,
even if not yet proved unworkable, is at odds with more recent cases, see Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 345 -

346 (1996). It is, moreover, just a matter of time before
Thames & Mersey proves itself unworkable; prior to today, it
had not been given the chance to work its mischief on $ 4371.

As we move to a more service-intensive and exportoriented economy, and as policymakers and experts debate

the wisdom of shifting from income to excise taxes, seeLugar, The National Sales Tax: Avoiding the Zero-Sum

Scenario, 48 Tax Executive 26 (1996); Bartlett, ReplacingFederal Taxes with a Sales Tax, 68 Tax Notes 997 (1995),
we should not use shaky precedent to deprive Congress of
important regulatory and revenue-raising options. As re-spondent conceded at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, the

reasoning of Thames & Mersey invites claims by exportservice providers for exemptions from any number of federal
excise taxes, for example, a challenge to the diesel-fuel tax,26 U. S. C. $ 4041, by truckers carrying export shipments.
The Export Clause cannot bear this reading.

The protections of the Export Clause must extend, perhaps, somewhat beyond specific taxes on goods, for "[i]f it
meant no more than that, the obstructions to exportation
which it was the purpose to prevent could readily be set
up by legislation nominally conforming to the constitutional
restriction but in effect overriding it." Hvoslef, supra, at
13. As a result, the Court has found certain taxes to be
proxies for taxes on the goods. See Washington Stevedoring, supra, at 756, n. 21 (discussing sales tax struck down in
Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 329 U. S. 69
(1946), and the tax on a bill of lading struck down in Fairbank v. United States, 181 U. S. 283 (1901)). In Washington
Stevedoring, we expressed some doubt that the tax on insurance in Thames & Mersey fell in this forbidden category, but,
to avoid overruling the case, "note[d] that the value of goods
bears a much closer relation to the value of insurance policies
on them than to the value of loading and unloading ships."
435 U. S., at 756, n. 21.

The insurance premiums taxed here, like those taxed in
Thames & Mersey, bear some relation to the value of the
goods, but this does not make them a proxy for a tax on the
goods. Premiums, i. e., the price of insurance, depend on
risk of loss, and value of the goods is only one component
factor of risk. So much is made clear by Stipulation 16 in

this case. Before the premiums for a shipment of IBMgoods of a certain value could be fixed, a premium rate had

to be determined. The rate was a function of the risk fac-tors specific to a particular shipment: "the place of origin and
destination of the goods, the type of goods involved and how
they were packaged, the time and distance of the trip, theroute and mode(s) of transportation, and the amount of material handling expected during the trip." Premiums werethen determined by multiplying the value of the goods by
the shipment-specific premium rate. Stipulation of Facts|| 16, App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. Cf. Holtom, Underwriting
Principles & Practices, at 453-457 (discussing various factors
taken into account in underwriting ocean marine insurance,
such as nationality of the crew, vessel management, seaworthiness of the vessel, suitability of the vessel for specific
cargo, packaging, season of travel, perishability, pilferage
risks at ports of call, and risks of damage from accompanying
cargo). The premium charged to insure a million dollars of
goods for the short overland journey from IBM's computer
factory in Richfield, Minnesota, to a customer in Quebec
would be trifling in comparison to the premium charged to
insure transport of goods of equivalent value from its factory
in San Jose, California, across the continent east to New
York and then by sea to Russia. Cf. Stipulation of Facts,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-37a; Brief for Respondent 3, n. 2.
Given the stipulated, undeniable premise that premiums are
graded by risk of loss, they are not a predictable proxy for
a Congress intent upon taxing export value. Premiums are
a rough proxy, however, for the income of foreign insurers,
which is why a Congress intent on eliminating the income
tax advantages of those insurers would structure $ 4371 as
it did.

Section 4371's requirement that the insurance cover
domestic risks in whole or in part is further evidence that
Congress did not intend it to operate as a proxy for taxing
exports. A statute that exempts all exporters who use a

domestic insurer for the inland leg of a shipment is not aneffective instrument for taxing export goods.

I would uphold $ 4371 as applied to IBM because the stat-ute imposes a tax on a distinct export-related service and is
not a proxy for a tax on the exports themselves. The Court,in my view, makes a serious mistake in assuming the opposite and reaching the question whether a nondiscriminatorytax on goods violates the Export Clause. I would reverse
the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

LOCKHEED CORP. et al. v. SPINK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-809. Argued April 22, 1996--Decided June 10, 1996
Because respondent Spink was 61 when petitioner Lockheed Corporation

reemployed him in 1979, he was excluded from participation in Lockheed's retirement plan (Plan), as was then permitted by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Section 9203(a)(1)
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA) repealed
ERISA's age-based exclusion provision, and $$ 9201 and 9202 amended
ERISA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967
(ADEA), respectively, to prohibit age-based benefit accrual rules. To
comply with OBRA, Lockheed made Spink and other previously excluded employees Plan members, but made clear that they would not
receive credit for their pre-1988 service years. Lockheed subsequently
added to the Plan two programs offering increased pension benefits to
employees who would retire early in exchange for their waiver of any
employment claims against Lockheed. Not wishing to waive any
ADEA or ERISA claims, Spink declined to participate and retired without earning the extra benefits. He then filed suit, alleging among other
things that Lockheed and petitioner board of directors members violated ERISA by amending the Plan to create the retirement programs,
that petitioner Retirement Committee members violated ERISA by
implementing the amended Plan, and that the OBRA amendments to
ERISA and the ADEA required that Spink's pre-1988 service years be
counted toward his benefits. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed in
relevant part. In finding the Plan amendments unlawful under ERISA

$ 406(a)(1)(D)--which prohibits a fiduciary from causing a plan to engage
in a transaction that transfers plan assets to, or involves the use of plan
assets for the benefit of, a party in interest--the court decided that
there was no need to address Lockheed's status as a fiduciary. It also
found that Lockheed's refusal to credit Spink with his pre-1988 service
years violated the OBRA amendments, which the court decided applied retroactively.

Held:

1. ERISA $ 406 does not prevent an employer from conditioning the
receipt of early retirement benefits upon plan participants' waiver of
employment claims. Pp. 887-895.

Syllabus
(a) Unless a plaintiff shows that a fiduciary caused the plan to engage in the allegedly unlawful transaction, there can be no $ 406(a)(1)
violation warranting relief. Cf. Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U. S. 349,
353. Thus, the Court of Appeals erred by not asking whether fiduciary status existed in this case before finding a $ 406(a)(1)(D) violation.
Pp. 888-889.

(b) Lockheed and the board of directors, as plan sponsors, were
not acting as fiduciaries when they amended the Plan. Given ERISA's
definition of fiduciary and the applicability of the duties attending that
status, the rule that this Court announced with respect to the amendment of welfare benefit plans in Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen,
514 U. S. 73, applies equally to the amendment of pension plans. Thus,
when employers or other plan sponsors adopt, modify, or terminate pension plans, they do not act as fiduciaries, id., at 78, but are analogous to
settlors of a trust. Pp. 889-891.

(c) It is not necessary to decide whether the Retirement Committee
members acted as fiduciaries, because their payment of benefits pursuant to the terms of an otherwise lawful plan was not a "transaction"
prohibited by $ 406(a)(1)(D). That section does not in direct terms include an employer's payment of benefits. And the "transactions" prohibited by other provisions of $ 406(a) generally involve uses of plan
assets that are potentially harmful to the plan. The payment of benefits conditioned on performance by plan participants cannot reasonably
be said to share that characteristic. Pp. 892-895.

2. OBRA $$ 9201 and 9202(a) do not apply retroactively to require
Lockheed to use pre-1988 service years in calculating Spink's benefits.
Congress expressly provided, in OBRA $ 9204(a)(1), that the amendments to ERISA and the ADEA would be effective with respect to plan
years beginning on or after January 1, 1988. Since the amendments'
temporal effect is manifest on the statute's face, "there is no need to
resort to judicial default rules," Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511
U. S. 244, 280, and inquiry is at an end. Pp. 896-897.

In this case, we decide whether the payment of benefitspursuant to an early retirement program conditioned on the

Opinion of the Court
for one of Lockheed's competitors. In 1979, Lockheed per-suaded Spink to return. Spink was 61 years old when he

resumed employment with Lockheed. At that time, theterms of the Lockheed Retirement Plan for Certain Salaried
Individuals (Plan), a defined benefit plan, excluded from participation employees who were over the age of 60 whenhired. This was expressly permitted by ERISA. See 29

U. S. C. $ 1052(a)(2)(B) (1982 ed.).Congress subsequently passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA), Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat.1874. Section 9203(a)(1) of OBRA, 100 Stat. 1979, repealed
the age-based exclusion provision of ERISA, and the statute
now flatly mandates that "[n]o pension plan may exclude
from participation (on the basis of age) employees who have
attained a specified age." 29 U. S. C. $ 1052(a)(2). Sections
9201 and 9202 of OBRA, 100 Stat. 1973-1978, amended
ERISA and the ADEA to prohibit age-based cessations of
benefit accruals and age-based reductions in benefit accrual
rates. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1054(b)(1)(H)(i), 623(i)(1).

In an effort to comply with these new laws, Lockheed
ceased its prior practice of age-based exclusion from the
Plan, effective December 25, 1988. As of that date, all employees, including Spink, who had previously been ineligible
to participate in the Plan due to their age at the time of
hiring became members of the Plan. Lockheed made clear,
however, that it would not credit those employees for years
of service rendered before they became members.

When later faced with the need to streamline its operations, Lockheed amended the Plan to provide financial incentives for certain employees to retire early. Lockheed established two programs, both of which offered increased pension
benefits to employees who would retire early, payable out
of the Plan's surplus assets. Both programs required as a
condition of the receipt of benefits that participants release
any employment-related claims they might have against
Lockheed. Though Spink was eligible for one of the pro517US3$66N 02-07-99 19:44:48 PAGES OPINPGT
886 LOCKHEED CORP. v. SPINK

Opinion of the Court
grams, he declined to participate because he did not wish towaive any ADEA or ERISA claims. He then retired, without earning any extra benefits for doing so.Spink brought this suit, in his individual capacity and on
behalf of others similarly situated, against Lockheed and several of its directors and officers. Among other things, thecomplaint alleged that Lockheed and the members of the

board of directors violated ERISA's duty of care and prohib-ited transaction provisions, 29 U. S. C. $$ 1104(a), 1106(a), by
amending the Plan to create the retirement programs. Re-latedly, the complaint alleged that the members of Lockheed's Retirement Committee, who implemented the Plan as
amended by the board, violated those same parts of ERISA.
The complaint also asserted that the OBRA amendments to
ERISA and the ADEA required Lockheed to count Spink's
pre-1988 service years toward his accrued pension benefits.
For these alleged ERISA violations, Spink sought monetary,
declaratory, and injunctive relief pursuant to $$ 502(a)(2) and
(3) of ERISA's civil enforcement provisions, 29 U. S. C.

$$ 1132(a)(2), (3). Lockheed moved to dismiss the complaint
for failure to state a claim, and the District Court granted
the motion.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in
relevant part. 60 F. 3d 616 (1995). The Court of Appeals
held that the amendments to the Plan were unlawful under
ERISA $ 406(a)(1)(D), 29 U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(D), which prohibits a fiduciary from causing a plan to engage in a transaction that transfers plan assets to a party in interest or
involves the use of plan assets for the benefit of a party in
interest. The court reasoned that because the amendments
offered increased benefits in exchange for a release of employment claims, they constituted a use of Plan assets to
"purchase" a significant benefit for Lockheed. 60 F. 3d, at
624. Though the court found a violation of $ 406(a)(1)(D), it
decided that there was no need to address Lockheed's status
as a fiduciary. Id., at 623, n. 5. In addition, the Court of

887Cite as: 517 U. S. 882 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Appeals agreed with Spink that Lockheed had violated theOBRA amendments by refusing to include Spink's service

years prior to 1988 in determining his benefits. In so hold-ing, the court found that the OBRA amendments apply retroactively. See id., at 620, n. 1. We issued a writ of certio-rari, 516 U. S. 1087 (1996), and now reverse.

II
Nothing in ERISA requires employers to establish em-ployee benefits plans. Nor does ERISA mandate what kind

of benefits employers must provide if they choose to havesuch a plan.

Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 91(1983); Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504,

511 (1981). ERISA does, however, seek to ensure that em-ployees will not be left emptyhanded once employers have
guaranteed them certain benefits. As we said in Nachman
Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S.359 (1980), when Congress enacted ERISA it "wanted to . . .

mak[e] sure that if a worker has been promised a definedpension benefit upon retirement--and if he has fulfilled
whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit--he actually will receive it." Id., at 375. Accordingly,
ERISA tries to "make as certain as possible that pensionfund assets [will] be adequate" to meet expected benefits
payments. Ibid.To increase the chances that employers will be able to
honor their benefits commitments--that is, to guard againstthe possibility of bankrupt pension funds--Congress incorporated several key measures into ERISA. Section 302 ofERISA sets minimum annual funding levels for all covered
plans, see 29 U. S. C. $$ 1082(a), 1082(b), and creates tax liensin favor of such plans when those funding levels are not met,
see $ 1082(f). Sections 404 and 409 of ERISA impose re-spectively a duty of care with respect to the management of
existing trust funds, along with liability for breach of thatduty, upon plan fiduciaries. See $$ 1104(a), 1109(a). Fi517US3$66N 02-07-99 19:44:48 PAGES OPINPGT
888 LOCKHEED CORP. v. SPINK

Opinion of the Court
nally, $ 406 of ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from involving theplan and its assets in certain kinds of business deals. See

$ 1106. It is this last feature of ERISA that is at issuetoday.

Congress enacted $ 406 "to bar categorically a transactionthat [is] likely to injure the pension plan."

Commissioner v.Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 160 (1993).

That section mandates, in relevant part, that "[a] fiduciarywith respect to a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a
transaction, if he knows or should know that such transactionconstitutes a direct or indirect . . . transfer to, or use by or
for the benefit of a party in interest, of any assets of theplan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(D).

1 The question here is

whether this provision of ERISA prevents an employer fromconditioning the receipt of early retirement benefits upon the

participants' waiver of employment claims. For the follow-ing reasons, we hold that it does not.

III
Section 406(a)(1) regulates the conduct of plan fiduciaries,placing certain transactions outside the scope of their lawful

authority. When a fiduciary violates the rules set forth in$ 406(a)(1), $ 409 of ERISA renders him personally liable for
any losses incurred by the plan, any ill-gotten profits, andother equitable and remedial relief deemed appropriate by
the court. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a). But in order to sustainan alleged transgression of $ 406(a), a plaintiff must show
that a fiduciary caused the plan to engage in the allegedlyunlawful transaction.

2 Unless a plaintiff can make that

1 Section 408 enumerates specific exceptions to the prohibitions in $ 406.
See 29 U. S. C. $ 1108(b). Lockheed does not argue that any of these
exceptions pertain to this case.

2 ERISA $ 3(21)(A) provides: "[A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a

plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii)
he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or

Opinion of the Court
showing, there can be no violation of $ 406(a)(1) to warrantrelief under the enforcement provisions. Cf. Peacock v.

Thomas, 516 U. S. 349, 353 (1996) ("Section 502(a)(3) `doesnot, after all, authorize "appropriate equitable relief " at
large, but only "appropriate equitable relief " for the purposeof "redress[ing any] violations or . . . enforc[ing] any provisions" of ERISA' ") (quoting Mertens v. Hewitt Associates,508 U. S. 248, 253 (1993)). The Court of Appeals erred by
not asking whether fiduciary status existed in this case be-fore it found a violation of $ 406(a)(1)(D).

3

A
We first address the allegation in Spink's complaint thatLockheed and the board of directors breached their fiduciary

indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or
has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such
plan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(21)(A).

3 Instead of pursuing this inquiry, the Court of Appeals found that Lockheed was a "party in interest" under $ 3(14)(C), and asserted that "a party
in interest who benefitted from an impermissible transaction can be held
liable under ERISA." 60 F. 3d 616, 623 (CA9 1995). For that same proposition, several Courts of Appeals have relied on statements in Mertens
v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248 (1993), that "ERISA contains various
provisions that can be read as imposing obligations upon nonfiduciaries,"
id., at 253-254; see also id., at 254, n. 4 (citing $ 406(a)), and that "[p]rofessional service providers . . . must disgorge assets and profits obtained
through participation as parties-in-interest in transactions prohibited by

$ 406," id., at 262. See, e. g., Reich v. Stangl, 73 F. 3d 1027, 1031-1032
(CA10 1996), cert. pending, No. 95-1631; Landwehr v. DuPree, 72 F. 3d
726, 733-734 (CA9 1995); Reich v. Compton, 57 F. 3d 270, 285 (CA3 1995).
Insofar as they apply to $ 406(a), these statements in Mertens (which were
in any event dicta, since $ 406(a) was not at issue) suggest liability for
parties in interest only when a violation of $ 406(a) has been established--
which, as we have discussed, requires a showing that a fiduciary caused
the plan to engage in the transaction in question. The Court of Appeals
thus was not necessarily wrong in saying that "a party in interest who
benefitted from an impermissible transaction can be held liable under
ERISA" (emphasis added); but the only transactions rendered impermissible by $ 406(a) are transactions caused by fiduciaries.

Opinion of the Court
duties when they adopted the amendments establishing the
early retirement programs. Plan sponsors who alter the
terms of a plan do not fall into the category of fiduciaries.
As we said with respect to the amendment of welfare benefit
plans in Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73
(1995), "[e]mployers or other plan sponsors are generally free
under ERISA, for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify,
or terminate welfare plans." Id., at 78 (citing Adams v.
Avondale Industries, Inc., 905 F. 2d 943, 947 (CA6 1990)).
When employers undertake those actions, they do not act as
fiduciaries, 514 U. S., at 78, but are analogous to the settlors
of a trust, see Johnson v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 19 F. 3d
1184, 1188 (CA7 1994).

This rule is rooted in the text of ERISA's definition of
fiduciary. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(21)(A) (quoted n. 2, supra).
As the Second Circuit has observed, "only when fulfilling certain defined functions, including the exercise of discretionary
authority or control over plan management or administration," does a person become a fiduciary under $ 3(21)(A).
Siskind v. Sperry Retirement Program, Unisys, 47 F. 3d 498,
505 (1995). "[B]ecause [the] defined functions [in the definition of fiduciary] do not include plan design, an employer may
decide to amend an employee benefit plan without being subject to fiduciary review." Ibid. We recently recognized
this very point, noting that "it may be true that amending
or terminating a plan . . . cannot be an act of plan `management' or `administration.' " Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S.
489, 505 (1996). As noted above, we in fact said as much in
Curtiss-Wright, see 514 U. S., at 78, at least with respect to
welfare benefit plans.

We see no reason why the rule of Curtiss-Wright should
not be extended to pension benefit plans. Indeed, there are
compelling reasons to apply the same rule to cases involving both kinds of plans, as most Courts of Appeals have

517US3$66N 02-07-99 19:44:49 PAGES OPINPGT

891Cite as: 517 U. S. 882 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
done.4 The definition of fiduciary makes no distinction between persons exercising authority over welfare benefit
plans and those exercising authority over pension plans. It
speaks simply of a "fiduciary with respect to a plan," 29
U. S. C. $ 1002(21)(A), and of "management" and "administration" of "such plan," ibid. And ERISA defines a "plan"
as being either a welfare or pension plan, or both. See

$ 1002(3). Likewise, the fiduciary duty provisions of ERISA
are phrased in general terms and apply with equal force to
welfare and pension plans. See, e. g., $ 1104(a) (specifying
duties of a "fiduciary . . . with respect to a plan"). See also
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S., at 91 (ERISA "sets
various uniform standards, including rules concerning . . .
fiduciary responsibility, for both pension and welfare plans").
Given ERISA's definition of fiduciary and the applicability of
the duties that attend that status, we think that the rules
regarding fiduciary capacity--including the settlor-fiduciary
distinction--should apply to pension and welfare plans alike.

Lockheed acted not as a fiduciary but as a settlor when
it amended the terms of the Plan to include the retirement
programs. Thus, $ 406(a)'s requirement of fiduciary status is
not met. While other portions of ERISA govern plan
amendments, see, e. g., 29 U. S. C. $ 1054(g) (amendment generally may not decrease accrued benefits); $ 1085b (if adoption of an amendment results in underfunding of a defined
benefit plan, the sponsor must post security for the amount
of the deficiency), the act of amending a pension plan does
not trigger ERISA's fiduciary provisions.

505 (CA2 1995); Averhart v. US WEST Management Pension Plan, 46

892 LOCKHEED CORP. v. SPINK

Opinion of the Court

B
Spink also alleged that the members of Lockheed's Retire-ment Committee who implemented the amended Plan violated $ 406(a)(1)(D). As with the question whether Lock-heed and the board members can be held liable under
ERISA's fiduciary rules, the Court of Appeals erred in hold-ing that the Retirement Committee members violated the
prohibited transaction section of ERISA without making therequisite finding of fiduciary status. It is not necessary for
us to decide the question whether the Retirement Commit-tee members acted as fiduciaries when they paid out benefits
according to the terms of the amended Plan, however, be-cause we do not think that they engaged in any conduct prohibited by $ 406(a)(1)(D).The "transaction" in which fiduciaries may not cause a
plan to engage is one that "constitutes a direct or indirect. . . transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of a party
in interest, of any assets of the plan." 29 U. S. C.$ 1106(a)(1)(D). Spink reads $ 406(a)(1)(D) to apply in cases
where the benefit received by the party in interest--in thiscase, the employer--is not merely a "natural inciden[t] of the
administration of pension plans." Brief for Respondent 10.Lockheed, on the other hand, maintains that a plan administrator's payment of benefits to plan participants and benefi-ciaries pursuant to the terms of an otherwise lawful plan

5 is

wholly outside the scope of $ 406(a)(1)(D). See Reply Brieffor Petitioners 10. We agree with Lockheed.

Section 406(a)(1)(D) does not in direct terms include thepayment of benefits by a plan administrator. And the surrounding provisions suggest that the payment of benefits is

5 As Lockheed notes, see Brief for Petitioners 13; Reply Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 4, there is no claim in this case that the amendments resulted
in any violation of the participation, funding, or vesting requirements of
ERISA. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1051-1061 (participation and vesting); $$ 1081-
1086 (funding).

Opinion of the Court
in fact not a "transaction" in the sense that Congress used
that term in $ 406(a). Section 406(a) prohibits fiduciaries
from engaging the plan in the "sale," "exchange," or "leasing" of property, 29 U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(A); the "lending of
money" or "extension of credit," $ 1106(a)(1)(B); the "furnishing of goods, services, or facilities," $ 1106(a)(1)(C); and the
"acquisition . . . of any employer security or employer real
property," $ 1106(a)(1)(E), with a party in interest. See also

$ 1108(b) (listing similar types of "transactions"). These are
commercial bargains that present a special risk of plan underfunding because they are struck with plan insiders, presumably not at arm's length. See Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S., at 160. What the
"transactions" identified in $ 406(a) thus have in common is
that they generally involve uses of plan assets that are potentially harmful to the plan. Cf. id., at 160-161 (reasoning
that a transfer of unencumbered property to the plan by the
employer for the purpose of applying it toward the employer's funding obligation fell within $ 406(a)(1)'s companion tax
provision, 26 U. S. C. $ 4975, because it could "jeopardize the
ability of the plan to pay promised benefits"). The payment
of benefits conditioned on performance by plan participants
cannot reasonably be said to share that characteristic.

According to Spink and the Court of Appeals, however,
Lockheed's early retirement programs were prohibited
transactions within the meaning of $ 406(a)(1)(D) because the
required release of employment-related claims by participants created a "significant benefit" for Lockheed. 60 F. 3d,
at 624. Spink concedes, however, that among the "incidental" and thus legitimate benefits that a plan sponsor may
receive from the operation of a pension plan are attracting
and retaining employees, paying deferred compensation, settling or avoiding strikes, providing increased compensation
without increasing wages, increasing employee turnover, and
reducing the likelihood of lawsuits by encouraging employees

Opinion of the Court
who would otherwise have been laid off to depart voluntarily.Brief for Respondent 11.

We do not see how obtaining waivers of employment-related claims can meaningfully be distinguished from these
admittedly permissible objectives. Each involves, at bot-tom, a

quid pro quo between the plan sponsor and the partic-ipant: that is, the employer promises to pay increased benefits in exchange for the performance of some condition by theemployee. By Spink's admission, the employer can ask the
employee to continue to work for the employer, to cross apicket line, or to retire early. The execution of a release of
claims against the employer is functionally no different; likethese other conditions, it is an act that the employee performs for the employer in return for benefits. Certainly,there is no basis in $ 406(a)(1)(D) for distinguishing a valid
from an invalid quid pro quo. Section 406(a)(1)(D) simplydoes not address what an employer can and cannot ask an
employee to do in return for benefits. See generally Alessiv.

Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S., at 511 (ERISA"leaves th[e] question" of the content of benefits "to the

private parties creating the plan. . . . [T]he private par-ties, not the Government, control the level of benefits").

6

Furthermore, if an employer can avoid litigation that mightresult from laying off an employee by enticing him to retire early, as Spink concedes, it stands to reason that theemployer can also protect itself from suits arising out of

6 Indeed, federal law expressly approves the use of early retirement
incentives conditioned upon the release of claims. The Older Workers
Benefit Protection Act, Pub. L. 101-433, 104 Stat. 983 (1990), establishes
requirements for the enforceability of employee waivers of ADEA claims
made in exchange for early retirement benefits. See 29 U. S. C. $ 626(f).
Of course, the enforceability of a particular waiver under this and other
applicable laws, including state law, is a separate issue from the question
whether such an arrangement violates ERISA's prohibited transaction
rules. But absent clearer indication than what we have in $ 406(a)(1)(D),
we would be reluctant to infer that ERISA bars conduct affirmatively
sanctioned by other federal statutes.

Opinion of the Court
that retirement by asking the employee to release anyemployment-related claims he may have.

In short, whatever the precise boundaries of the prohi-bition in $ 406(a)(1)(D), there is one use of plan assets that

it cannot logically encompass: a quid pro quo between theemployer and plan participants in which the plan pays out
benefits to the participants pursuant to its terms. When

$ 406(a)(1)(D) is read in the context of the other prohibitedtransaction provisions, it becomes clear that the payment of

benefits in exchange for the performance of some conditionby the employee is not a "transaction" within the meaning
of $ 406(a)(1). A standard that allows some benefits agree-ments but not others, as Spink suggests, lacks a basis in

$ 406(a)(1)(D); it also would provide little guidance to lower
courts and those who must comply with ERISA. We thushold that the payment of benefits pursuant to an amended

plan, regardless of what the plan requires of the employee in
return for those benefits, does not constitute a prohibited
transaction.8

7 Spink's amicus the United States suggests that $ 406(a)(1)(D) is not
violated so long as the employer provides benefits as compensation for the
employee's labor, not for other things such as a release of claims. See
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15-16. But the Government
contradicts its own rule with the examples it gives of lawful plans. For
instance, the Government recognizes that "[a]n employer may provide increased pension benefits as an incentive for early retirement." Id., at 20.
While retirement benefits themselves may be defined as deferred wages,
an increase in retirement benefits as part of an early retirement plan does
not compensate the employee so much for services rendered as for the
distinct act of leaving the company sooner than planned. The standard
offered by the Government is thus of little help in identifying transactions
prohibited by $ 406(a)(1)(D).

8 If the benefits payment were merely a sham transaction, meant to disguise an otherwise unlawful transfer of assets to a party in interest, or
involved a kickback scheme, that might present a different question from
the one before us. Spink does not suggest that Lockheed's payment was
a cover for an illegal scheme, only that payment of the benefits conditioned
on the release was itself violative of $ 406(a)(1)(D).

Opinion of the Court

IV
Finally, we address whether $$ 9201 and 9202(a) of OBRA,
which amended respectively the ADEA and ERISA to prohibit age-based benefit accrual rules, apply retroactively.9
Two Terms ago, we set forth the proper approach for determining the retroactive effect of a statute in Landgraf v. USI
Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994). We stated that "[w]hen
a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events
in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach."
Id., at 280. Thus, we must determine whether Congress has
plainly delineated the temporal scope of the OBRA amendments to ERISA and the ADEA.

Section 9204(a)(1) of OBRA, 100 Stat. 1979, expressly provides that "[t]he amendments made by sections 9201 and
9202 shall apply only with respect to plan years beginning
on or after January 1, 1988, and only to employees who have
1 hour of service in any plan year to which such amendments
apply." 29 U. S. C. $ 623 note. This language compels the
conclusion that the amendments are prospective. For plan
years that began on or after January 1, 1988, age-based accrual rules are unlawful under the amendments; further, only
employees who have one hour of service in such a plan year
are entitled to the protection of the amendments. But for
plan years prior to the effective date, employers cannot be
held liable for using age-based accrual rules. Where, as
here, the temporal effect of a statute is manifest on its face,
"there is no need to resort to judicial default rules," Land9 Section 9203(a)(1) of OBRA, amending ERISA to prevent the exclusion
of employees of a certain age from plan participation, applies "only with
respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, and only with
respect to service performed on or after such date." OBRA $ 9204(b),
100 Stat. 1980. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Lockheed fully
complied with that amendment by admitting Spink as a member of the
Plan as of December 25, 1988, the first day of Lockheed's 1988 plan year.

Opinion of the Court
graf v. USI Film Products, supra, at 280, and inquiry is atan end.

Notwithstanding the clarity of $ 9204(a)(1), the Court ofAppeals believed that the text of $$ 9201 and 9202(a) require
retroactive application of the benefit accrual rules. To denyan employee credit for service years during which he was
excluded from the plan based on age, even though that exclu-sion was lawful at the time, the Court of Appeals reasoned,
is to reduce the rate of benefits accrual for that employee.1060 F. 3d, at 620. When Congress includes a provision that
specifically addresses the temporal effect of a statute, thatprovision trumps any general inferences that might be
drawn from the substantive provisions of the statute. Seegenerally

Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S.374, 384 (1992); Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products

Corp., 353 U. S. 222, 228-229 (1957). Even if it were properto disregard the express time limitations in $ 9204(a)(1) in
favor of more general language, $$ 9201 and 9202(a) cannotbear the weight of the Court of Appeals' construction. A
reduction in total benefits due is not the same thing as areduction in the rate of benefit accrual; the former is the
final outcome of the calculation, whereas the latter is one ofthe factors in the equation.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion. It is so ordered.

10 See 29 U. S. C. $ 1054(b)(1)(H)(i) (OBRA $ 9202(a)) (defined benefit plan
violates ERISA's benefit accrual requirements "if, under the plan, an
employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit
accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age"); $ 623(i)(1)(A)
(OBRA $ 9201) (prohibiting employers from establishing or maintaining
a defined benefit plan that "requires or permits . . . the cessation of an
employee's benefit accrual, or the reduction of the rate of an employee's

SHAW et al. v. HUNT, GOVERNOR OF NORTHCAROLINA,

et al.

appeal from the district court for the easterndistrict of north carolina

No. 94-923. Argued December 5, 1995--Decided June 13, 1996*
Earlier in this suit, in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, this Court held that

appellants, whose complaint alleged that North Carolina had deliberately segregated voters by race when it created two bizarre-looking
majority-black congressional districts, Districts 1 and 12, had stated a
claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The Court remanded for further consideration by the
District Court, which held that, although the North Carolina redistricting plan did classify voters by race, the classification survived
strict scrutiny, and therefore was constitutional, because it was narrowly tailored to further the State's compelling interests in complying
with $$ 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Held:

1. Only the two appellants who live in District 12 have standing to
continue this lawsuit, and only with respect to that district. The remaining appellants, who do not reside in either of the challenged districts and have not provided specific evidence that they personally were
assigned to their voting districts on the basis of race, lack standing.
See United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737. P. 904.

2. The North Carolina plan violates the Equal Protection Clause because the State's reapportionment scheme is not narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling state interest. Pp. 904-918.

(a) Strict scrutiny applies when race is the "predominant" consideration in drawing district lines such that "the legislature subordinates race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations."
Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916. The District Court's finding
that the North Carolina General Assembly "deliberately drew" District 12 so that it would have an effective voting majority of black
citizens, when read in the light of the evidence as to the district's shape
and demographics and the legislature's objective, comports with the
Miller standard. In order to justify its redistricting plan, therefore,
the State must show not only that the plan was in pursuit of a compel*Together with No. 94-924, Pope et al. v. Hunt, Governor of North
Carolina, et al., also on appeal from the same court.

Syllabus
ling state interest, but also that it was narrowly tailored to achieve
that interest. Id., at 920. Pp. 904-908.

(b) None of the three separate "compelling interests" to which
appellees point suffices to sustain District 12. First, the District Court
found that the State's claimed interest in eradicating the effects of past
discrimination did not actually precipitate the use of race in the redistricting plan, and the record does not establish that that finding was
clearly erroneous. Second, the asserted interest in complying with $ 5
of the Voting Rights Act did not justify redistricting here, since creating
an additional majority-black district, as urged by the Justice Department before it granted preclearance, was not required under a correct
reading of $ 5. See Miller, 515 U. S., at 921. This Court again rejects
the Department's expansive reading of $ 5 and of its own authority
thereunder as requiring States to maximize the number of majorityminority districts wherever possible. See, e. g., id., at 925. Third, District 12, as drawn, is not a remedy narrowly tailored to the State's professed interest in avoiding liability under $ 2 of the Act, which, inter
alia, prohibits dilution of the voting strength of members of a minority
group. District 12 could not remedy any potential $ 2 violation, since
the minority group must be shown to be "geographically compact" to
establish $ 2 liability, see, e. g., Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50,
and it cannot reasonably be suggested that District 12 contains a "geographically compact" population of any race. Appellees are singularly
unpersuasive when they argue that a majority-minority district may
be drawn anywhere if there is a strong basis in evidence for concluding
that a $ 2 violation exists somewhere in the State. A district so drawn
could not avoid $ 2 liability, which targets vote-dilution injury to individuals in a particular area, not to the minority as a group. Just as in
Miller, this Court does not here reach the question whether compliance
with the Act, on its own, can be a compelling state interest under the
proper circumstances. Pp. 908-918.

Opinion of the Court
voters by race, but that the classification survived strictscrutiny and therefore did not offend the Constitution. We

now hold that the North Carolina plan does violate the EqualProtection Clause because the State's reapportionment
scheme is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state
interest.The facts are set out in detail in our prior opinion, and

we shall only summarize them here. After the 1990 census,North Carolina's congressional delegation increased from 11
to 12 members. The State General Assembly adopted areapportionment plan, Chapter 601, that included one
majority-black district, District 1, located in the northeastern region of the State. 1991 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 601.
The legislature then submitted the plan to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance under $ 5 of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42
U. S. C. $ 1973c (1988 ed.). The Assistant Attorney General
for Civil Rights, acting on the Attorney General's behalf, objected to the proposed plan because it failed "to give effect
to black and Native American voting strength" in "the
south-central to southeastern part of the state" and opined
that the State's reasons for not creating a second majorityminority district appeared "to be pretextual." App. 151-
153. Duly chastened, the legislature revised its districting
scheme to include a second majority-black district. 1991
N. C. Extra Sess. Laws, ch. 7. The new plan, Chapter 7,
located the minority district, District 12, in the north-central
or Piedmont region, not in the south-central or southeastern
region identified in the Justice Department's objection letter.
The Attorney General nonetheless precleared the revised
plan.

By anyone's measure, the boundary lines of Districts 1 and
12 are unconventional. A map portrays the districts' deviance far better than words, see the Appendix to the opinion
of the Court in Shaw I, supra, but our prior opinion describes them as follows:

miles long and, for much of its length, no wider than the[Interstate]-85 corridor. It winds in snakelike fashion

neighborhoods.' " Shaw I, supra, at 635-636 (citationomitted).

Five North Carolinians commenced the present action in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District ofNorth Carolina against various state officials.

1 Following

our reversal of the District Court's dismissal of their com-plaint in

Shaw I, the District Court allowed a number of
individuals to intervene, 11 on behalf of the plaintiffs and 22for the defendants. After a 6-day trial, the District Court

unanimously found "that the Plan's lines were deliberatelydrawn to produce one or more districts of a certain racial
composition." 861 F. Supp. 408, 417, 473-474 (1994). A majority of the court held that the plan was constitutional,nonetheless, because it was narrowly tailored to further

the State's compelling interests in complying with $$ 2 and 5of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973, 1973c. 861

904 SHAW v. HUNT

Opinion of the Court
As a preliminary matter, appellees challenge appellants'standing to continue this lawsuit. In

United States v. Hays,
515 U. S. 737 (1995), we recognized that a plaintiff whoresides in a district which is the subject of a racialgerrymander claim has standing to challenge the legislation
which created that district, but that a plaintiff from outside
that district lacks standing absent specific evidence that he
personally has been subjected to a racial classification. Two
appellants, Ruth Shaw and Melvin Shimm, live in District 12
and thus have standing to challenge that part of Chapter 7
which defines District 12. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.
900, 909 (1995). The remaining appellants do not reside in
District 1, however, and they have not provided specific
evidence that they personally were assigned to their voting
districts on the basis of race. Therefore, we conclude that
only Shaw and Shimm have standing and only with respect
to District 12.2

We explained in Miller v. Johnson that a racially gerrymandered districting scheme, like all laws that classify citizens on the basis of race, is constitutionally suspect. Id., at
904-905; see also Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 657; Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200 (1995). This is true
whether or not the reason for the racial classification is be2 Justice Stevens would dismiss the complaint for a lack of standing.
Post, at 921-923. Here, as in other places in his dissent, Justice Stevens' disagreement is more with the Court's prior decisions in Shaw I,
509 U. S. 630 (1993), United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737 (1995), and Miller
v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), than with this decision. Justice Stevens challenged the Court's standing analysis and its finding of cognizable
injury in both Hays, supra, at 751 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment),
and Miller, supra, at 929-931 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and both Justice
White and Justice Souter advanced many of the same arguments in
Shaw I. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 659-674 (White, J., dissenting); id., at
680-687, and n. 9 (Souter, J., dissenting). Their position has been repeatedly rejected by the Court. See id., at 644-652; Miller, supra, at
909; and Hays, supra, at 744-745.

Opinion of the Court
nign or the purpose remedial. Shaw I, supra, at 642-643,
653; Adarand, supra, at 228-229. Applying traditional
equal protection principles in the voting-rights context is "a
most delicate task," Miller, supra, at 905, however, because
a legislature may be conscious of the voters' races without
using race as a basis for assigning voters to districts. Shaw
I, supra, at 645-646; Miller, 515 U. S., at 916. The constitutional wrong occurs when race becomes the "dominant and
controlling" consideration. Id., at 911, 915-916.

The plaintiff bears the burden of proving the race-based
motive and may do so either through "circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics" or through
"more direct evidence going to legislative purpose." Id., at
916. After a detailed account of the process that led to enactment of the challenged plan, the District Court found that
the General Assembly of North Carolina "deliberately drew"
District 12 so that it would have an effective voting majority
of black citizens. 861 F. Supp., at 473.

Appellees urge upon us their view that this finding is
not phrased in the same language that we used in our opinion
in Miller v. Johnson, supra, where we said that a plaintiff
must show "that race was the predominant factor motivating
the legislature's decision to place a significant number of
voters within or without a particular district." Id., at 916.

The District Court, of course, did not have the benefit of
our opinion in Miller at the time it wrote its opinion. While
it would have been preferable for the court to have analyzed
the case in terms of the standard laid down in Miller, that
was not possible. This circumstance has no consequence
here because we think that the District Court's findings, read
in the light of the evidence that it had before it, comport
with the Miller standard.

First, the District Court had evidence of the district's
shape and demographics. The court observed "the obvious
fact" that the district's shape is "highly irregular and geo517US3$67h 02-07-99 19:56:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
graphically non-compact by any objective standard that canbe conceived." 861 F. Supp., at 469. In fact, the serpentine

district has been dubbed the least geographically compactdistrict in the Nation. App. 332.

The District Court also had direct evidence of the legislature's objective. The State's submission for preclearanceexpressly acknowledged that Chapter 7's "

overriding purpose was to comply with the dictates of the Attorney Gener-al's December 18, 1991 letter and to create two congressional

districts with effective black voting majorities." App. 162(emphasis added). This admission was confirmed by Gerry
Cohen, the plan's principal draftsman, who testified that creating two majority-black districts was the "principal reason"
for Districts 1 and 12. Id., at 675; Tr. 514. Indeed, appellees in their first appearance before the District Court
"formally concede[d] that the state legislature deliberately
created the two districts in a way to assure black-voter
majorities," Shaw v. Barr, 808 F. Supp. 461, 470 (EDNC
1992), and that concession again was credited by the District
Court on remand, 861 F. Supp., at 473-474. See also Shaw
I, supra, at 666 (White, J., dissenting) ("The State has made
no mystery of its intent, which was to respond to the Attorney General's objections by improving the minority group's
prospects of electing a candidate of its choice" (citation omitted)). Here, as in Miller, "we fail to see how the District
Court could have reached any conclusion other than that race
was the predominant factor in drawing [the challenged district]." Miller, supra, at 918.

In his dissent, Justice Stevens argues that strict scrutiny does not apply where a State "respects" or "compl[ies] with traditional districting principles." Post, at 931-
932 ("[R]ace-based districting which respects traditional
districting principles does not give rise to constitutional suspicion"), post, at 932 ("Miller demonstrates that although
States may avoid strict scrutiny by complying with traditional districting principles . . . "). That, however, is not the

Justice Stevens articulates the correct standard inhis dissent, post, at 930, but he fails to properly apply it.)

The Miller standard is quite different from the one that Justice Stevens advances, as an examination of the dissent'sreasoning demonstrates. The dissent explains that "two

race-neutral, traditional districting criteria" were at work indetermining the shape and placement of District 12, and
from this suggests that strict scrutiny should not apply.Post, at 936-939. We do not quarrel with the dissent's
claims that, in shaping District 12, the State effectuated itsinterest in creating one rural and one urban district, and that
partisan politicking was actively at work in the districtingprocess. That the legislature addressed these interests does
not in any way refute the fact that race was the legislature'spredominant consideration. Race was the criterion that, in
the State's view, could not be compromised; respecting com-munities of interest and protecting Democratic incumbents
came into play only after the race-based decision had beenmade.

Racial classifications are antithetical to the FourteenthAmendment, whose "central purpose" was "to eliminate
racial discrimination emanating from official sources in theStates." McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192 (1964);

3 Justice Stevens in dissent incorrectly reads Miller as demonstrating
that "although States may avoid strict scrutiny by complying with traditional districting principles, they may not do so by proffering pretextual,
race-neutral explanations." Post, at 932. Miller plainly states that although "compliance with `traditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions' may well suffice
to refute a claim of racial gerrymandering," a State cannot make such a
refutation where "those factors were subordinated to racial objectives."

Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 491 (1989) (opin-ion of

O'Connor, J.) ("[T]he Framers of the FourteenthAmendment . . . desired to place clear limits on the States'

use of race as a criterion for legislative action, and to havethe federal courts enforce those limitations"). While appreciating that a racial classification causes "fundamentalinjury" to the "individual rights of a person," Goodman v.
Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 661 (1987), we have rec-ognized that, under certain circumstances, drawing racial
distinctions is permissible where a governmental body ispursuing a "compelling state interest." A State, however,
is constrained in how it may pursue that end: "[T]he meanschosen to accomplish the State's asserted purpose must be
specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that pur-pose."

Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280(1986) (opinion of Powell, J.). North Carolina, therefore,

must show not only that its redistricting plan was in pursuitof a compelling state interest, but also that "its districting
legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve [that] compelling
interest." Miller, 515 U. S., at 920.Appellees point to three separate compelling interests to

sustain District 12: to eradicate the effects of past and pres-ent discrimination; to comply with $ 5 of the Voting Rights
Act; and to comply with $ 2 of that Act. We address eachin turn.

4 Justice Stevens in dissent discerns three reasons that he believes
"may have motivated" the legislators to favor the creation of the two minority districts and that he believes together amount to a compelling state
interest. Post, at 941. As we explain below, a racial classification cannot
withstand strict scrutiny based upon speculation about what "may have
motivated" the legislature. To be a compelling interest, the State must
show that the alleged objective was the legislature's "actual purpose"
for the discriminatory classification, see Mississippi Univ. for Women v.
Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 730, and n. 16 (1982), and the legislature must have
had a strong basis in evidence to support that justification before it implements the classification. See infra, at 910. Even if the proper factual
basis existed, we believe that the three reasons Justice Stevens prof517US3$67h 02-07-99 19:56:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
A State's interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial discrimination may in the proper case justify a
government's use of racial distinctions. Croson, 488 U. S.,
at 498-506. For that interest to rise to the level of a compelling state interest, it must satisfy two conditions. First,
the discrimination must be " `identified discrimination.' "
Id., at 499, 500, 505, 507, 509. "While the States and their
subdivisions may take remedial action when they possess
evidence" of past or present discrimination, "they must identify that discrimination, public or private, with some specificity before they may use race-conscious relief." Id., at 504.
A generalized assertion of past discrimination in a particular
industry or region is not adequate because it "provides no
guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise
scope of the injury it seeks to remedy." Id., at 498 (opinion
of O'Connor, J.). Accordingly, an effort to alleviate the

fers, separately or combined, would not amount to a compelling interest.
First, the dissent seems to acknowledge that its initial reason--the "sorry
history of race relations in North Carolina," post, at 941--did not itself
drive the decision to create the minority districts, presumably for the reasons we discuss infra, at 910. The dissent contends next that an "acceptable reason for creating a second majority-minority district" was the
"State's interest in avoiding the litigation that would have been necessary
to overcome the Attorney General's objection" under $ 5. Post, at 942.
If this were true, however, Miller v. Johnson would have been wrongly
decided because there the Court rejected the contention that complying
with the Justice Department's preclearance objection could be a compelling interest. Miller, supra, at 921-922. It necessarily follows that
avoiding the litigation required to overcome the Department's objection
could not be a compelling interest. The dissent's final reason--"the interest in avoiding the expense and unpleasantness of [$ 2] litigation" "regardless of the possible outcome of [that] litigation," post, at 943--sweeps too
broadly. We assume, arguendo, that a State may have a compelling interest in complying with the properly interpreted Voting Rights Act. Infra,
at 915. But a State must also have a "strong basis in evidence," see Shaw
I, 509 U. S., at 656 (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 500
(1989)), for believing that it is violating the Act. It has no such interest in
avoiding meritless lawsuits.

Opinion of the Court
effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest.Wygant, supra, at 274-275, 276, 288.

5 Second, the institution that makes the racial distinction must have had a"strong basis in evidence" to conclude that remedial action

was necessary, "before it embarks on an affirmative-actionprogram," 476 U. S., at 277 (plurality opinion) (emphasis
added).In this suit, the District Court found that an interest in
ameliorating past discrimination did not actually precipitatethe use of race in the redistricting plan. While some legislators invoked the State's history of discrimination as anargument for creating a second majority-black district, the
court found that these members did not have enough votingpower to have caused the creation of the second district on
that basis alone. 861 F. Supp., at 471.Appellees, to support their claim that the plan was drawn
to remedy past discrimination, rely on passages from tworeports prepared for this litigation by a historian and a social
scientist. Brief for Appellees Gingles et al. 40-44, citingH. Watson, Race and Politics in North Carolina, 1865-1994,
App. 610-624 (excerpts), and J. Kousser, After 120 Years:Redistricting and Racial Discrimination in North Carolina,
id., at 602-609 (excerpts). Obviously these reports, bothdated March 1994, were not before the General Assembly
when it enacted Chapter 7. And there is little to suggestthat the legislature considered the historical events and
social-science data that the reports recount, beyond what in-dividual members may have recalled from personal experience. We certainly cannot say on the basis of these reportsthat the District Court's findings on this point were clearly
erroneous.

5 For examples of this limitation in application see Wygant, 476 U. S.,
at 274-276 (where a plurality of the Court concluded that remedying
societal discrimination and promoting role models for students was not
a compelling interest); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 498-506.

Opinion of the Court
Appellees devote most of their efforts to arguing that
the race-based redistricting was constitutionally justified
by the State's duty to comply with the Voting Rights Act.
The District Court agreed and held that compliance with $$ 2
and 5 of the Act could be, and in this suit was, a compelling
state interest. 861 F. Supp., at 437. In Miller, we expressly left open the question whether under the proper
circumstances compliance with the Voting Rights Act, on
its own, could be a compelling interest. Miller, 515 U. S., at
921 ("[w]hether or not in some cases compliance with the
Voting Rights Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling
interest independent of any interest in remedying past
discrimination . . ."). Here once again we do not reach that
question because we find that creating an additional
majority-black district was not required under a correct
reading of $ 5 and that District 12, as drawn, is not a remedy
narrowly tailored to the State's professed interest in avoiding $ 2 liability.

With respect to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, we believe
our decision in Miller forecloses the argument, adopted by
the District Court, that failure to engage in the race-based
districting would have violated that section. In Miller, we
considered an equal protection challenge to Georgia's Eleventh Congressional District. As appellees do here, Georgia
contended that its redistricting plan was necessary to meet
the Justice Department's preclearance demands. The Justice Department had interposed an objection to a prior plan
that created only two majority-minority districts. We held
that the challenged congressional plan was not required by
a correct reading of $ 5 and therefore compliance with that
law could not justify race-based districting. Id., at 921
("[C]ompliance with federal antidiscrimination laws cannot
justify race-based districting where the challenged district
was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional reading
and application of those laws").

912 SHAW v. HUNT

Opinion of the Court
We believe the same conclusion must be drawn here.North Carolina's first plan, Chapter 601, indisputably was

ameliorative, having created the first majority-black districtin recent history. Thus, that plan, " `even if [it] fall[s] short
of what might be accomplished in terms of increasing minority representation,' " " `cannot violate $ 5 unless the newapportionment itself so discriminates on the basis of race or

color as to violate the Constitution.' " Id., at 924, quotingDays, Section 5 and the Role of the Justice Department, in
B. Grofman & C. Davidson, Controversies in Minority Voting56 (1992), and

Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976).
As in Miller, the United States relies on the purpose
prong of $ 5 to explain the Department's preclearance objections, alleging that North Carolina, for pretextual reasons,
did not create a second majority-minority district. Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 24. We again find the Government's position "insupportable." Miller, supra, at 924.
The General Assembly, in its submission filed with Chapter
601, explained why it did not create a second minority district; among its goals were "to keep precincts whole, to avoid
dividing counties into more than two districts, and to give
black voters a fair amount of influence by creating at least
one district that was majority black in voter registration and
by creating a substantial number of other districts in which
black voters would exercise a significant influence over the
choice of congressmen." App. 142. The submission also explained in detail the disadvantages of other proposed plans.
See, e. g., id., at 139, 140, 143 (Balmer Congress 6.2 Plan's
"[s]econd `minority' district did not have effective minority
voting majority" because it "depended on the cohesion of
black and Native American voters, and no such pattern was
evident" and "this plan dramatically decreased black influence" in four other districts). A memorandum, sent to the
Department of Justice on behalf of the legislators in charge
of the redistricting process, provided still further reasons for
the State's decision not to draw two minority districts as

Opinion of the Court
urged by various interested parties. App. 94-138; 861F. Supp., at 480-481, n. 9 (Voorhees, C. J., dissenting). We

have recognized that a "State's policy of adhering to otherdistricting principles instead of creating as many majorityminority districts as possible does not support an inferencethat the plan `so discriminates on the basis of race or color
as to violate the Constitution,' and thus cannot provide anybasis under $ 5 for the Justice Department's objection."
Miller, supra, at 924 (citations omitted).It appears that the Justice Department was pursuing in
North Carolina the same policy of maximizing the numberof majority-black districts that it pursued in Georgia. See
Miller, supra, at 924-925, and n. The two States under-went the preclearance processes during the same time period
and the objection letters they received from the Civil RightsDivision were substantially alike. App. in Miller v. Johnson, O. T. 1994, No. 94-631, pp. 99-107. A North Carolinalegislator recalled being told by the Assistant Attorney General that "you have twenty-two percent black people in thisState, you must have as close to twenty-two percent black
Congressmen, or black Congressional Districts in thisState." App. 201. See also Deposition of Senator Dennis
Winner, id., at 698. We explained in Miller that thismaximization policy is not properly grounded in $ 5 and the
Department's authority thereunder. 515 U. S., at 925 ("Inutilizing $ 5 to require States to create majority-minority
districts wherever possible, the Department of Justice ex-panded its authority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we have upheld"). We again reject theDepartment's expansive interpretation of $ 5. Id., at 926-
927. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1017 (1994)("Failure to maximize cannot be the measure of $ 2").

914 SHAW v. HUNT

Opinion of the Court
With respect to $ 2, appellees contend, and the DistrictCourt found, that failure to enact a plan with a second

majority-black district would have left the State vulnerableto a lawsuit under this section. Our precedent establishes
that a plaintiff may allege a $ 2 violation in a single-memberdistrict if the manipulation of districting lines fragments
politically cohesive minority voters among several districtsor packs them into one district or a small number of districts,
and thereby dilutes the voting strength of members of theminority population.

Id., at 1007. To prevail on such aclaim, a plaintiff must prove that the minority group "is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a ma-jority in a single-member district"; that the minority group
"is politically cohesive"; and that "the white majority votessufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the
minority's preferred candidate." Thornburg v. Gingles, 478U. S. 30, 50-51 (1986);

Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993)(recognizing that the three Gingles preconditions would

apply to a $ 2 challenge to a single-member district). Acourt must also consider all other relevant circumstances and
must ultimately find based on the totality of those circum-stances that members of a protected class "have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate inthe political process and to elect representatives of their
choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). See De Grandy, supra, at1010-1012.

United States as Amicus Curiae 25; 861 F. Supp. 408, 474 (1994) (case
below). The "reassessment" was the legislature's determination that
it may be susceptible to a $ 2 challenge. Id., at 464-465. Even if the
General Assembly properly reached that conclusion, we doubt that a showing of discriminatory effect under $ 2, alone, could support a claim of discriminatory purpose under $ 5. Even if discriminatory purpose could be
shown, the means of avoiding such a violation could be race neutral, and
so we also doubt that the prospect of violating the purpose prong of $ 5
could justify a race-based redistricting plan such as the one implemented
by North Carolina.

915Cite as: 517 U. S. 899 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
We assume, arguendo, for the purpose of resolving this
suit, that compliance with $ 2 could be a compelling interest,
and we likewise assume, arguendo, that the General Assembly believed a second majority-minority district was needed
in order not to violate $ 2, and that the legislature at the
time it acted had a strong basis in evidence to support that
conclusion. We hold that even with the benefit of these
assumptions, the North Carolina plan does not survive strict
scrutiny because the remedy--the creation of District 12--
is not narrowly tailored to the asserted end.

Although we have not always provided precise guidance
on how closely the means (the racial classification) must
serve the end (the justification or compelling interest), we
have always expected that the legislative action would substantially address, if not achieve, the avowed purpose. See
Miller, supra, at 922 ("[T]he judiciary retains an independent obligation . . . to ensure that the State's actions are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest"); Wygant,
476 U. S., at 280 (opinion of Powell, J.) ("[T]he means chosen
to accomplish the State's asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose") id.,
at 278, n. 5 (opinion of Powell, J.) (race-based state action
must be remedial); Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 655 ("A reapportionment plan would not be narrowly tailored to the goal of
avoiding retrogression if the State went beyond what was
reasonably necessary to avoid retrogression"). Cf. Missouri
v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 88 (1995) (With regard to the remedial authority of a federal court: " `The remedy must . . . be
related to "the condition alleged to offend the Constitution
. . . ." ' " and must be " `remedial in nature, that is, it must
be designed as nearly as possible "to restore the victims of
discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct" ' ") (quoting Milliken v.
Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 280-281 (1977), in turn quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 738, 746 (1974)). Where, as

916 SHAW v. HUNT

Opinion of the Court
here, we assume avoidance of $ 2 liability to be a compellingstate interest, we think that the racial classification would

have to realize that goal; the legislative action must, at aminimum, remedy the anticipated violation or achieve compliance to be narrowly tailored.7District 12 could not remedy any potential $ 2 violation.
As discussed above, a plaintiff must show that the minoritygroup is "geographically compact" to establish $ 2 liability.
No one looking at District 12 could reasonably suggest thatthe district contains a "geographically compact" population
of any race. See 861 F. Supp., at 469. Therefore wherethat district sits, "there neither has been a wrong nor can
be a remedy." Growe, supra, at 41 (footnote omitted).8Appellees do not defend District 12 by arguing that the
district is geographically compact, however. Rather theycontend, and a majority of the District Court agreed, 861
F. Supp., at 454-455, n. 50, that once a legislature has astrong basis in evidence for concluding that a $ 2 violation
exists in the State, it may draw a majority-minority districtanywhere, even if the district is in no way coincident with

7 We do not suggest that where the governmental interest is eradicating
the effects of past discrimination the race-based action necessarily would
have to achieve fully its task to be narrowly tailored.

8 Justice Stevens in dissent argues that it does not matter that District 12 could not possibly remedy a $ 2 violation because he believes the
State's plan would avoid $ 2 liability. Post, at 946-947. As support, Justice Stevens relies on our decision in Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S.
997 (1994), which he reads to say that "a plaintiff cannot make out a prima
facie case of vote dilution under $ 2 unless he can demonstrate that his
proposed plan contains more majority-minority districts than the State's."
Post, at 946 (citing De Grandy, supra, at 1008). The dissent's reading

is flawed by its omission. In De Grandy, we presumed that the minority districts drawn in the State's plan were lawfully drawn and, indeed,
we expressly stated that a vote-dilution claim under $ 2 "requires the
possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice." De Grandy, supra, at 1008 (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
the compact Gingles district, as long as racially polarizedvoting exists where the district is ultimately drawn. Tr. of

Oral Arg. 50-51, 54-56.We find this position singularly unpersuasive. We do not
see how a district so drawn would avoid $ 2 liability. If a$ 2 violation is proved for a particular area, it flows from
the fact that individuals in this area "have less opportunitythan other members of the electorate to participate in the
political process and to elect representatives of their choice."42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). The vote-dilution injuries suffered by
these persons are not remedied by creating a safe majority-black district somewhere else in the State. For example,
if a geographically compact, cohesive minority populationlives in south-central to southeastern North Carolina, as the
Justice Department's objection letter suggested, District 12that spans the Piedmont Crescent would not address that $ 2
violation. The black voters of the south-central to south-eastern region would still be suffering precisely the same
injury that they suffered before District 12 was drawn.District 12 would not address the professed interest of
relieving the vote dilution, much less be narrowly tailored
to accomplish the goal.Arguing, as appellees do and the District Court did, that

the State may draw the district anywhere derives from amisconception of the vote-dilution claim. To accept that
the district may be placed anywhere implies that the claim,and hence the coordinate right to an undiluted vote (to cast
a ballot equal among voters), belongs to the minority as a
group and not to its individual members. It does not. See$ 1973 ("the right of any citizen").

9 This does not mean that a $ 2 plaintiff has the right to be placed in a
majority-minority district once a violation of the statute is shown. States
retain broad discretion in drawing districts to comply with the mandate
of $ 2. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 156-157 (1993); Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 32-37 (1993).

918 SHAW v. HUNT

Stevens, J., dissenting
The United States submits that District 12 does, in fact,incorporate a "substantial portio[n]" of the concentration of

minority voters that would have given rise to a $ 2 claim.Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 27. Specifically,
the Government claims that "District 12 . . . contains the
heavy concentration of African Americans in MecklenburgCounty, the same urban component included in the second

minority opportunity district in some of the alternativeplans."

Ibid. The portion of District 12 that lies in Mecklenburg County covers not more than 20% of the district.See Exhibit 301 of Plaintiff-Intervenors, Map A, Map 9B.

We do not think that this degree of incorporation could meanthat District 12 substantially addresses the $ 2 violation.
We hold, therefore, that District 12 is not narrowly tailored
to the State's asserted interest in complying with $ 2 of the
Voting Rights Act.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District
Court is

Reversed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join as to Parts II-V, dissenting.

As I have explained on prior occasions, I am convinced
that the Court's aggressive supervision of state action designed to accommodate the political concerns of historically
disadvantaged minority groups is seriously misguided. A
majority's attempt to enable the minority to participate more
effectively in the process of democratic government should
not be viewed with the same hostility that is appropriate for
oppressive and exclusionary abuses of political power. See,
e. g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 243-
249 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Miller v. Johnson, 515

of Chicago, 466 F. 2d 830, 852 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dis-senting). But even if we accept the Court's refusal to recognize any distinction between two vastly different kinds ofsituations, we should affirm the judgment of the District
Court in this case.As the Court analyzes the case, it raises three distinct
questions: (1) Should North Carolina's decision to create twocongressional districts in which a majority of the voters are
African-American be subject to strict constitutional scru-tiny?; (2) If so, did North Carolina have a compelling interest
in creating such districts?; and (3) If so, was the creation ofthose districts "narrowly tailored" to further the asserted
compelling interest? The Court inadequately explains itsanswer to the first question, and it avoids answering the
second because it concludes that its answer to the third dis-poses of the case. In my estimation, the Court's disposition
of all three questions is most unsatisfactory.After commenting on the majority's treatment of the
threshold jurisdictional issue, I shall discuss separately thethree questions outlined above. In doing so, I do not mean
to imply that I endorse the majority's effort to apply in rigidfashion the strict scrutiny analysis developed for cases of
a far different type. I mean only to show that, even onits own terms, the majority's analysis fails to convince.

I
I have explained previously why I believe that the Courthas failed to supply a coherent theory of standing to justify

its emerging and misguided race-based districting juris-prudence. See

Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 929-931(
Stevens, J., dissenting); United States v. Hays, 515 U. S.737, 750-751 (1995) (

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).The Court's analysis of the standing question in this case is

similarly unsatisfactory, and, in my view, reflects the factthat the so-called

Shaw claim seeks to employ the federalcourts to impose a particular form of electoral process,

517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT
920 SHAW v. HUNT

Stevens, J., dissenting
rather than to redress any racially discriminatory treatmentthat the electoral process has imposed. In this instance,

therefore, I shall consider the standing question in light ofthe majority's assertions about the nature of the underlying
constitutional challenge.

I begin by noting that this case reveals the Shaw claim tobe useful less as a tool for protecting against racial discrimination than as a means by which state residents may second-guess legislative districting in federal court for partisan
ends. The plaintiff-intervenors in this case are Republicans.It is apparent from the record that their real grievance is
that they are represented in Congress by Democrats when
they would prefer to be represented by members of their
own party. They do not suggest that the racial identity of
their representatives is a matter of concern, but it is obvious
that their political identity is critical. See Pope v. Blue,
809 F. Supp. 392 (WDNC 1992).

Significantly, from the outset of the legislative deliberations, the Republican Party did not oppose the creation
of more than one majority-minority district. Indeed, several plans proposed by the Republicans in the state legislature provided two such districts. 861 F. Supp. 408, 460
(EDNC 1994). However, now that the State has created a
district that is designed to preserve Democratic incumbents,
and now that the plaintiff-intervenors' partisan gerrymandering suit has been dismissed for failure to state a claim,
these intervenors have joined this racial gerrymandering
challenge.

It is plain that these intervenors are using their allegations of impermissibly race-based districting to achieve the
same substantive result that their previous, less emotionally
charged partisan gerrymandering challenge failed to secure.
In light of the amorphous nature of the race discrimination
claim recognized in Shaw I, it is inevitable that allegations
of racial gerrymandering will become a standard means by
which unsuccessful majority-race candidates, and their par517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT

ties, will seek to obtain judicially what they could not obtain electorally.

Even if the other plaintiffs to this litigation do object to
the use of race in the districting process for reasons other
than partisan political advantage, the majority fails to explain adequately the nature of their constitutional challenge,
or why it should be cognizable under the Equal Protection
Clause. Not surprisingly, therefore, the majority's explanation of why these plaintiffs have standing to bring this
challenge is unconvincing.

It is important to point out what these plaintiffs do not
claim. Counsel for appellees put the matter succinctly when
he stated that this case is not Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364
U. S. 339 (1960).1 There, the plaintiffs had been prohibited
from voting in municipal elections; here, all voters remain
free to select representatives to Congress. Thus, while the
plaintiffs purport to be challenging an unconstitutional racial
gerrymander, they do not claim that they have been shut out
of the electoral process on account of race, or that their voting power has been diluted as a consequence of race-based
districting. Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 641.

What then is the wrong that these plaintiffs have suffered
that entitles them to call upon a federal court for redress?
In Shaw I, the majority construed the plaintiffs' claim to be
that the Equal Protection Clause forbids race-based districting designed solely to "separate" voters by race, and
that North Carolina's districting process violated the prohibition. Ibid. Even if that were the claim before us, these
plaintiffs should not have standing to bring it. The record
shows that North Carolina's districting plan served to require these plaintiffs to share a district with voters of a different race. Thus, the injury that these plaintiffs have suffered, to the extent that there has been injury at all, stems

from the integrative rather than the segregative effects ofthe State's redistricting plan.

Perhaps cognizant of this incongruity, counsel for plaintiffsasserted a rather more abstract objection to race-based districting at oral argument. He suggested that the plaintiffsobjected to the use of race in the districting process not because of any adverse consequence that these plaintiffs, onaccount of their race, had suffered more than other persons,
but rather because the State's failure to obey a constitutionalcommand to legislate in a color-blind manner conveyed a
message to voters across the State that "there are two blackdistricts and ten white districts."

2 Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.

Such a challenge calls to mind Justice Frankfurter's memo-rable characterization of the suit brought in

Colegrove v.Green, 328 U. S. 549, 552 (1946). "This is not an action to

recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusionof a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens," he explained. "The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, buta wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity."

Ibid. Suits of thistype necessarily press the boundaries of federal-court jurisdiction, if they do not surpass it. When a federal court iscalled upon, as it is here, to parse among varying legislative
choices about the political structure of a State, and when thelitigant's claim ultimately rests on "a difference of opinion as
to the function of representative government" rather than aclaim of discriminatory exclusion,

same way that the signs above the fountains would. Although neither
racial classification would deprive any person of a tangible benefit--water
from both fountains and effective political representation would remain
equally available to persons of all races--each would be unconstitutional
because of the very fact that the State had espoused a racial classification
publicly. Id., at 5-6.

Even if an objection to a State's decision to forgo color-blind districting is cognizable under some constitutional provision, I do not understand why that provision should be theEqual Protection Clause. In

Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S.
533, 561 (1964), we were careful to point out that "[a] predominant consideration in determining whether a State'slegislative apportionment scheme constitutes an invidious

discrimination violative of rights asserted under the EqualProtection Clause is that the rights allegedly impaired are
individual and personal in nature." In addition, in Palmerv.

Thompson, 403 U. S. 217, 225 (1971), we explained that
racially motivated legislation violates the Equal Protection
Clause only when the challenged legislation "affect[s] blacksdifferently from whites."

To be sure, as some commentators have noted, we have
permitted generalized claims of harm resulting from statesponsored messages to secure standing under the Establishment Clause. Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms, "Bizarre
Districts," and Voting Rights: Evaluating Election-District
Appearances After Shaw v. Reno, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 483, 499-
524 (1993). It would be quite strange, however, to confer
similarly broad standing under the Equal Protection Clause
because that Clause protects against wrongs which by definition burden some persons but not others.

Here, of course, it appears that no individual has been burdened more than any other. The supposedly insidious messages that Shaw I contends will follow from extremely irreg3 There, a majority of the Court stated that "[w]e have consistently
held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about
government--claiming only harm to his and every citizen's interest in
proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that

large--does not state an Article III case or controversy." Lujan v.

ular race-based districting will presumably be received inequal measure by all state residents. For that reason, the

claimed violation of a shared right to a color-blind districtingprocess would not seem to implicate the Equal Protection
Clause at all precisely because it rests neither on a challengeto the State's decision to distribute burdens and benefits unequally, nor on a claim that the State's formally equal treat-ment of its citizens in fact stamps persons of one race with
a badge of inferiority. See Bush v. Vera, post, at 1052-1054(

Souter, J., dissenting).Indeed, to the extent that any person has been burdened

more than any other by the State's districting plan, geog-raphy rather than race would seem to be to blame. The
State has not chosen to subject only persons of a particularrace to race-based districting. Rather, the State has selected certain geographical regions in which all voters--bothwhite and black--have been assigned to race-based districts.
Thus, what distinguishes those residents who have receiveda "color-blind" districting process from those who have not
is geography rather than racial identity. Not surprisingly,therefore,

Shaw I emphasizes that the race of the members
of the plaintiff class is irrelevant. Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 641.Given the absence of any showing, or, indeed, any allegation, that any person has been harmed more than any other
on account of race, the Court's decision to entertain the
claim of these plaintiffs would seem to emanate less from theEqual Protection Clause's bar against racial discrimination

than from the Court's unarticulated recognition of a new substantive due process right to "color-blind" districting itself.See

race, to assert the rights of jurors, who have been deprived because of

tional claim before us ultimately depends for its success onlittle more than speculative judicial suppositions about the

societal message that is to be gleaned from race-based dis-tricting. I know of no workable constitutional principle,
however, that can discern whether the message conveyed isa distressing endorsement of racial separatism, or an inspiring call to integrate the political process. As a result, Iknow of no basis for recognizing the right to color-blind
districting that has been asserted here.Even if there were some merit to the constitutional claim,
it is at least clear that it requires the recognition of a newconstitutional right. For that very reason, the Court's suggestion that pre-Shaw, race discrimination precedent some-how compels the application of strict scrutiny is disingenuous. The fact that our equal protection jurisprudencerequires strict scrutiny of a claim that the State has used
race as a criterion for imposing burdens on some persons butnot others does not mean that the Constitution demands that
a similar level of review obtain for a claim that the State hasused race to impose equal burdens on the polity as a whole,
or upon some nonracially defined portion thereof. As to thelatter claim, the State may well deserve more deference
when it determines that racial considerations are legitimatein a context that results in no race-based, unequal treatment.

To take but one example, I do not believe that it wouldmake sense to apply strict scrutiny to the Federal Government's decision to require citizens to identify their race oncensus forms, even though that requirement would force
citizens to classify themselves racially, and even though sucha requirement would arguably convey an insidious message
about the Government's continuing belief that race remainsrelevant to the formulation of public policy. Of course, if the
Federal Government required only those persons residing in
has shown either that he has uniquely been denied an otherwise generally
available benefit on account of race, or that anyone else has.

the Midwest to identify their race on the census form, I donot doubt that only persons living in States in that region

who filled out the forms would have standing to bring theconstitutional challenge. I do doubt, however, whether our
equal protection jurisprudence would require a federal courtto evaluate the claim itself under strict scrutiny. In such a
case, the only unequal treatment would have resulted fromthe State's decision to discriminate on the basis of geography,
a race-neutral selection criterion that has not generally beenthought to necessitate close judicial review.

The majority ignores these concerns and simply appliesthe standing test set forth in

United States v. Hays, 515 U. S.737 (1995), on the apparent assumption that this test adequately identifies those who have been personally denied"equal treatment" on account of race.

Id., at 745. In Hays,the Court held that a plaintiff has standing to challenge a

State's use of race in districting for Shaw claims if he (1)lives in a district that allegedly constitutes a racial gerrymander or (2) shows that, although he resides outside such adistrict, he has been personally subject to a racial classification. Ante, at 904. On this basis, the Court concludes thatnone of the plaintiffs in this action has standing to challenge
District 1, but that two of them have standing to challengeDistrict 12.

Ibid.As I understand it, the distinction drawn in Hays between

those who live within a district, and those who do not, isthought to be relevant because voters who live in the "gerrymandered" district will have suffered the "personal" injuriesinflicted by race-based districting more than other state residents.5 Those injuries are said to be "representational"harms in the sense that race-based districting may cause
officeholders to represent only those of the majority race in

5 As I have explained, even if the Hays test showed that much, it would
still only demonstrate that the State had used geography, rather than
race, to select the citizens who would be deprived of a color-blind districting process.

their district, or "stigmatic" harms, in the sense that therace-based line-drawing may promote racial hostility.

United States v. Hays, 515 U. S., at 744-745; Shaw I, 509U. S., at 646-649.

Even if I were to accept the flawed assumption that the
Hays test serves to identify any voter who has been bur-dened more than any other as a consequence of his race,

I would still find it a most puzzling inquiry. What the Courtfails to explain, as it failed to explain in

Hays, is why evidence showing either that one lives in an allegedly raciallygerrymandered district or that one's district assignment

directly resulted from a racial classification should suffice to
distinguish those who have suffered the representational
and stigmatic harms that supposedly follow from race-based
districting from those who have not.

If representational injuries are what one must show to
secure standing under Hays, then a demonstration that a
voter's race led to his assignment to a particular district
would perhaps be relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry, but
surely not sufficient to satisfy it. There is no necessary
correlation between race-based districting assignments and
inadequate representation. See Davis v. Bandemer, 478
U. S. 109, 132 (1986) (opinion of White, J.). Indeed, any assumption that such a correlation exists could only be based
on a stereotypical assumption about the kind of representation that politicians elected by minority voters are capable
of providing. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 930 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

To prove the representational harms that Hays holds are
needed to establish standing to assert a Shaw claim, one
would think that plaintiffs should be required to put forth
evidence that demonstrates that their political representatives are actually unlikely to provide effective representation to those voters whose interests are not aligned with
those of the majority race in their district. Here, as the
record reveals, no plaintiff has made such a showing. See

Stevens, J., dissenting
861 F. Supp., at 424-425, 471, n. 59. Given our general re-luctance to hear claims founded on speculative assertions of

injury, I do not understand why the majority concludes thatthe speculative possibility that race-based districting "may"
cause these plaintiffs to receive less than complete representation suffices to create a cognizable case or controversy.
United States v. Hays, 515 U. S., at 745.

If under Hays the so-called "stigmatic" harms which re-sult from extreme race-based districting suffice to secure

standing, then I fail to see why it matters whether the liti-gants live within the "gerrymandered" district or were
placed in a district as a result of their race. As I have
pointed out, all voters in North Carolina would seem to be
equally affected by the messages of "balkanization" or "racial
apartheid" that racially gerrymandered maps supposedly
convey, cf. Davis, 478 U. S., at 153 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment).

Even if race-based districting could be said to impose more
personal harms than the so-called "stigmatic" harms that
Hays itself identified, I do not understand why any voter's
reputation or dignity should be presumed to have been
harmed simply because he resides in a highly integrated,
majority-minority voting district that the legislature has
deliberately created. Certainly the background social facts
are not such that we should presume that the "stigmatic
harm" described in Hays and Shaw I amounts to that found
cognizable under the Equal Protection Clause in Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495 (1954), where statesponsored school segregation caused some students, but not
others, to be stamped with a badge of inferiority on account
of their race. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 682, n. 4 (Souter,
J., dissenting).

In sum, even if it could be assumed that the plaintiffs in
this case asserted the personalized injuries recognized in
Hays at the time of Shaw I by virtue of their bare allegations
of racial gerrymandering, they have surely failed to prove

Stevens, J., dissenting
the existence of such injuries to the degree that we normallyrequire at this stage of the litigation. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992). Thus, so long as theCourt insists on treating this type of suit as a traditional
equal protection claim, it must either mean to take a broaderview of the power of federal courts to entertain challenges
to race-based governmental action than it has heretoforeadopted, see

Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984); cf. Palmer,403 U. S., at 224-225, or to create a special exception to

general jurisdictional limitations for plaintiffs such as thosebefore us here. Suffice it to say, I charitably assume the
former to be the case, and proceed to consider the meritson the assumption that

Shaw I was correctly decided.

II
The District Court concluded that Shaw I required theapplication of strict scrutiny in any case containing proof

that "racial considerations played a `substantial' or `motivat-ing' role in the line-drawing process, even if they were not
the only factor that influenced that process." 861 F. Supp.,at 431. The court acknowledged that under this standard
any deliberate effort to draw majority-minority districts inconformity with the Voting Rights Act would attract the
strictest constitutional review, regardless of whether race-neutral districting criteria were also considered. Id., at 429.
As a consequence, it applied strict scrutiny in this case solelyon the basis of North Carolina's concession that it sought to
draw two majority-minority districts in order to comply withthe Voting Rights Act, and without performing any inquiry
into whether North Carolina had considered race-neutraldistricting criteria in drawing District 12's boundaries.

As the majority concludes, the District Court's test fortriggering strict scrutiny set too low a threshold for subjecting a State's districting effort to rigorous, if not fatal,constitutional review.

Ante, at 905. In my view, therefore,the Court should at the very least remand the case to allow

930 SHAW v. HUNT

Stevens, J., dissenting
the District Court, which possesses an obvious familiarity
with the record and a superior understanding of local dynamics,6 to make the fact-intensive inquiry into legislative
purpose that the proper test for triggering strict scrutiny
requires. Although I do not share the majority's willingness to divine on my own the degree to which race determined the precise contours of District 12, if forced to decide
the matter on this record, I would reject the majority's
conclusion that a fair application of precedent dictates that
North Carolina's redistricting effort should be subject to
strict scrutiny.

Subsequent to the District Court's decision, we handed
down Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), and issued our
summary affirmance in DeWitt v. Wilson, 515 U. S. 1170
(1995). As I understand the Miller test, and as it was
applied in DeWitt, state legislatures may take racial and
ethnic characteristics of voters into account when they are
drawing district boundaries without triggering strict scrutiny so long as race is not the "predominant" consideration
guiding their deliberations. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.,
at 916. To show that race has been "predominant," a plaintiff must show that "the legislature subordinated traditional
race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations" in drawing that district. Ibid.; see also id., at 928
(O'Connor, J., concurring) ("To invoke strict scrutiny, a
plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of customary and traditional districting
practices"); DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409, 1412 (ED
Cal. 1994), aff 'd in part, dism'd in part, 515 U. S. 1170 (1995)
(declining to apply strict scrutiny because State complied
with traditional districting principles).

6 That is particularly true here because the author of the District Court
opinion was also the author of the District Court opinion in Gingles v.
Edmisten, 590 F. Supp. 345 (EDNC 1984), aff'd in part, rev'd in part,
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986).

Indeed, the principal opinion in Bush v. Vera, post, p. 952,issued this same day, makes clear that the deliberate consideration of race in drawing district lines does not inand of itself invite constitutional suspicion. As the opinion
there explains, our precedents do not require the application
of strict scrutiny "to all cases of intentional creationof majority-minority districts."

Bush, post, at 958. Rather,
strict scrutiny should apply only upon a demonstration that" `race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationalein drawing its district lines.' "

Ibid. (quoting Miller, 515
U. S., at 913).

Because "the legitimate consideration of race in a districting decision is usually inevitable under the Voting
Rights Act when communities are racially mixed," Shaw I,
509 U. S., at 683 (Souter, J., dissenting), our decisions in
Miller, DeWitt, and Bush have quite properly declined to
deem all race-based districting subject to strict scrutiny.
Unlike many situations in which the consideration of race
itself necessarily gives rise to constitutional suspicion, see,
e. g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200 (1995), our precedents
have sensibly recognized that in the context of redistricting
a plaintiff must demonstrate that race had been used in a
particularly determinative manner before strict constitutional scrutiny should obtain. Cf. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). This higher threshold for
triggering strict scrutiny comports with the fact that the
shared representational and stigmatic harms that Shaw purports to guard against are likely to occur only when the State
subordinates race-neutral districting principles to a racial
goal. See Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 646-649; 861 F. Supp., at
476-478 (Voorhees, C. J., dissenting); Pildes & Niemi, 92
Mich. L. Rev., at 499-524.

Shaw I is entirely consistent with our holdings that racebased districting which respects traditional districting prin517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT
932 SHAW v. HUNT

Stevens, J., dissenting
ciples does not give rise to constitutional suspicion. As theDistrict Court noted, Shaw I expressly reserved the question whether " `the intentional creation of majority-minoritydistricts, without more,' always gives rise to an equal protection claim." 861 F. Supp., at 429 (quoting Shaw I, 509 U. S.,at 649).

Shaw I held only that an equal protection claimcould lie as a result of allegations suggesting that the State's

districting was "so extremely irregular on its face that itrationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the
races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditionaldistricting principles." Id., at 642 (emphasis added).

Moreover, Miller belies the conclusion that strict scrutinymust apply to all deliberate attempts to draw majorityminority districts if the Equal Protection Clause is to pro-vide any practical limitation on a State's power to engage in
race-based districting. Although Georgia argued that it hadcomplied with traditional districting principles, the

Millermajority had little difficulty concluding that the State's raceneutral explanations were implausible. Miller v. Johnson,515 U. S. 900 (1995).

7 Thus, Miller demonstrates that although States may avoid strict scrutiny by complying withtraditional districting principles, they may not do so by proffering pretextual, race-neutral explanations for their maps.The notion that conscientious federal judges will be able
to distinguish race-neutral explanations from pretextual onesis hardly foreign to our race discrimination jurisprudence.
In a variety of contexts, from employment to juror selection,we have required plaintiffs to demonstrate not only that a

7 For example, the State argued that it drew the majority-minority
district under review so that it would follow precinct lines, but the Court
found that precinct lines had been relied on only because they happened
to facilitate the State's effort to achieve a particular racial makeup. Similarly, the State argued that District 11 was drawn in order to ensure
that communities of interest would be kept within a single district, but
the Court found that no such communities could be found within the district's boundaries. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 918-920.

defendant's action could be understood as impermissiblyrace based, but also that the defendant's assertedly raceneutral explanation for that action was in fact a pretext forracial discrimination. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 767-
768 (1995); St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502,518-519 (1993). Similarly, I understand

Shaw I, Miller, De-Witt, and Bush to require plaintiffs to prove that the State

did not respect traditional districting principles in drawingmajority-minority districts. See Bush, post, at 958.

In holding that the present record shows race to have beenthe "predominant" consideration in the creation of District
12, the Court relies on two pieces of evidence: the State'sadmission that its "overriding" purpose was to " `create two
congressional districts with effective black voting majori-ties,' "

ante, at 906; and the " `geographically non-compact' "shape of District 12, ibid. In my view, this evidence does

not suffice to trigger strict scrutiny under the "demanding"test that Miller establishes. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.,
at 928 (O'Connor, J., concurring).8North Carolina's admission reveals that it intended to
create a second majority-minority district.9 That says noth8 It is unclear whether the majority believes that it is the combination
of these two pieces of evidence that satisfies Miller, or whether either one
would suffice.

9 Citing to trial and deposition testimony, the majority also relies on a

statement by North Carolina's chief mapmaker, Gerry Cohen, that the
creation of a majority-minority district was the " `principal reason' " for
the configurations of District 1 and District 12. Ante, at 906. Mr. Cohen's more complete explanation of the " `principal reason' " was to create
"two majority black districts that had communities of interest within each
one." Tr. 514. What Mr. Cohen admitted, therefore, was only that the
State intentionally drew a majority-minority district that would respect
traditional districting principles. Moreover, Mr. Cohen's "admission" in
his deposition only pertained to District 1. App. 675. Finally, he explained in his deposition that "other reasons" also explained that district's
configuration. Ibid. Absent a showing that those "other reasons" were
race based, Mr. Cohen's admission does not show that North Carolina

ing about whether it subordinated traditional districtingprinciples in drawing District 12. States that conclude that

federal law requires majority-minority districts have littlechoice but to give "overriding" weight to that concern. Indeed, in Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159 (1993), weexplained that evidence that showed that Ohio's chief
mapmaker preferred "federal over state law when he be-lieved the two in conflict does not raise an inference of intentional discrimination; it demonstrates obedience to theSupremacy Clause of the United States Constitution." For
that reason, we have not previously held that concessionssuch as North Carolina's suffice to trigger strict scrutiny.
Cf. Bush, post, at 958, 962.10 Thus, the State's concession isof little significance.

District 12's noncompact appearance also fails to show thatNorth Carolina engaged in suspect race-based districting.
There is no federal statutory or constitutional requirementthat state electoral boundaries conform to any particular
ideal of geographic compactness. In addition, although theNorth Carolina Constitution requires electoral districts for
state elective office to be contiguous, it does not requirethem to be geographically compact.

11 N. C. Const., Art. II,

subordinated race-neutral districting criteria in drawing District 1; it
shows only that the need to comply with federal law was critical.

10 In DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409 (ED Cal. 1994), for example,

the State conceded that compliance with $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act
constituted the one unavoidable limitation on its redistricting process.
Id., at 1410. Nevertheless, we affirmed the District Court's conclusion
that strict scrutiny did not apply because the State gave significant weight
to several race-neutral considerations in meeting that goal. Id., at 1415.
Moreover, in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), the Court applied
strict scrutiny only after it concluded that the State considered only race
in adding African-American voters to District 11; it did not hold that Georgia's general admissions about its desire to comply with federal law themselves sufficed. Id., at 917-919.

11 The State Constitution sets forth no limitation on districting for

federal offices. Moreover, the state-prepared 1991 Legislator's Guide to
North Carolina Legislative and Congressional Redistricting points out

$$ 2, 5 (1984). Given that numerous States have writtengeographical compactness requirements into their State

Constitutions, North Carolina's omission on this score isnoteworthy. See Grofman, Criteria for Districting: A Social
Science Perspective, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 77, 84 (1985). Itreveals that North Carolina's creation of a geographically
noncompact district does not itself mark a deviation fromany prevailing state districting principle.

12 Thus, while the

serpentine character of District 12 may give rise to an inference that traditional districting principles were subordinatedto race in determining its boundaries, it cannot fairly be said

to prove that conclusion in light of the clear evidence demon-strating race-neutral explanations for the district's tortured
shape. See infra, at 936-937.There is a more fundamental flaw in the majority's conclusion that racial concerns predominantly explain the cre-ation of District 12. The evidence of shape and intent relied on by the majority cannot overcome the basic fact thatNorth Carolina did not have to draw Districts 1 and 12 in
order to comply with the Justice Department's finding thatfederal law required the creation of two majority-minority
districts. That goal could have been more straightforthat the state-law prohibition against dividing counties in formulating
state electoral districts was eliminated in the 1980's. See Legislator's
Guide to North Carolina Legislative and Congressional Redistricting 12
(Feb. 1991).

12 Indeed, the State's guide to redistricting specifically informed state

legislators that compactness was of little legal significance. "Neither the
State nor federal constitution requires districts to be compact. Critics
often refer to the lack of compactness of a particular district or group of
districts as a sign of gerrymandering, but no court has ever struck down
a plan merely on the basis that it did not appear to be compact. Although
there are geometric methods for measuring the compactness of an area,
these methods have not been recognized as judicial standards for evaluating the compactness of districts.

"The recent decision in Davis v. Bandemer . . . mentions irregularlyshaped districts as a possible sign of gerrymandering but makes clear that
irregular shapes alone do not invalidate a redistricting plan." Ibid.

wardly accomplished by simply adopting the Attorney General's recommendation to draw a geographically compact district in the southeastern portion of the State in addition to
the majority-minority district that had already been drawn
in the northeastern and Piedmont regions. See Shaw I, 509
U. S., at 634-635; 861 F. Supp., at 460, 461-462, 464.

That the legislature chose to draw Districts 1 and 12 instead surely suggests that something more than the desire
to create a majority-minority district took precedence. For
that reason, this case would seem to present a version of
the very hypothetical that the principal opinion in Bush suggests should pose no constitutional problem--"an otherwise
compact majority-minority district that is misshapen by predominantly nonracial, political manipulation." Bush, post,
at 981.

Here, no evidence suggests that race played any role in
the legislature's decision to choose the winding contours of
District 12 over the more cartographically pleasant boundaries proposed by the Attorney General.13 Rather, the rec13 The State's decision to give little weight to how the district would
look on a map is entirely justifiable. Although a voter clearly has an interest in being in a district whose members share similar interests and
concerns, that interest need not, and often is not, vindicated by drawing
districts with attractive shapes. "[The Districts'] perceived `ugliness'--
their extreme irregularity of shape--is entirely a function of an artificial
perspective unrelated to the common goings and comings of the citizenvoter. From the mapmaker's wholly imaginary vertical perspective at
1:25,000 or so range, a citizen may well find his district's one-dimensional,
featureless shape aesthetically `bizarre,' `grotesque,' or `ugly.' But back
down at ground or eye-level, viewing things from his normal closely-bound
horizontal perspective, the irregularity of outline or exact volume of the
district in which he resides surely is not a matter of any great practical
consequence to his conduct as a citizen-voter." 861 F. Supp. 408, 472, n. 60
(EDNC 1994).

In the same vein, I doubt that residents of hook-shaped Massachusetts
receive less effective representation than their counterparts in perfectly
rectangular Wyoming, or that the voting power of residents of Hawaii

ord reveals that two race-neutral, traditional districting criteria determined District 12's shape: the interest in ensuring
that incumbents would remain residents of the districts they
have previously represented; and the interest in placing predominantly rural voters in one district and predominantly
urban voters in another. 861 F. Supp., at 466-472; see also
Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995) (considering whether
communities of interest were preserved); White v. Weiser,
412 U. S. 783, 793-797 (1973) (establishing incumbency protection as a legitimate districting principle).

Unlike most States, North Carolina has not given its chief
executive any power to veto enactments of its legislature.
Thus, even though the voters had elected a Republican
Governor, the Democratic majority in the legislature was
in control of the districting process. It was the Democrats
who first decided to adopt the 11-white-district plan that
arguably would have violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act
and gave rise to the Attorney General's objection under $ 5.
It was also the Democrats who rejected Republican Party
maps that contained two majority-minority districts because
they created too many districts in which a majority of the
residents were registered Republicans. 861 F. Supp., at 460.

If race rather than incumbency protection had been the
dominant consideration, it seems highly unlikely that the
Democrats would have drawn this bizarre district rather
than accepting more compact options that were clearly available. If race, rather than politics, had been the "predominant" consideration for the Democrats, they could have accepted the Republican Plan, thereby satisfying the Attorney
General and avoiding any significant risk of liability as well
as the attack mounted by the plaintiffs in this case. Instead,
as the detailed findings of the District Court demonstrate,
the legislature deliberately crafted a districting plan that

is in any way impaired by virtue of the fact that their State is not even
contiguous.

would accommodate the needs of Democratic incumbents.
Id., at 466-467.14

If the Democrats remain in control of the districting process after the remand in this case, it will be interesting to
see whether they will be willing to sacrifice one or more
Democratic-majority districts in order to create at least two
districts with effective minority voting majorities. My review of the history revealed in the findings of the District
Court persuades me that political considerations will probably take priority over racial considerations in the immediate future, just as they surely did during the process of rejecting the Republican Plan and ultimately adopting the plan
challenged in this case.15

A deliberate effort to consolidate urban voters in one district and rural voters in another also explains District 12's
highly irregular shape. Before District 12 had been drawn,
members of the public as well as legislators had urged that
"the observance of distinctive urban and rural communities
of interest should be a prime consideration in the general
redistricting process." Id., at 466. As a result, the legislature was naturally attracted to a plan that, although less
than esthetically pleasing, included both District 12, which
links the State's major urban centers, and District 1, which
has a population that predominantly lives in cities with populations of less than 20,000. Id., at 467.

14 It is ironic that despite the clear indications that party politics explain
the district's odd shape, the Court affirmed the District Court's dismissal
of the plaintiffs' partisan gerrymandering claim. See Pope v. Blue, 506
U. S. 801 (1992).

15 Interestingly, the Justice Department concluded that it was the State's

impermissible desire to favor white incumbents over African-American
voters that explained North Carolina's refusal to create a second district
and thus gave rise to a violation of the purpose prong of $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act. See Shaw I, 509 U. S. 630, 635 (1993). Of course, the white
plaintiffs before us here have no standing to object to District 12 on similar grounds.

Moreover, the record reveals that District 12's lines were
drawn in order to unite an African-American community
whose political tradition was quite distinct from the one that
defines African-American voters in the Coastal Plain, which
District 1 surrounds. Ibid. Indeed, two other majorityminority-district plans with less torturous boundaries were
thought unsatisfactory precisely because they did not unite
communities of interest. 861 F. Supp., at 465-466; Tr. 481.
Significantly, the irregular contours of District 12 track the
State's main interstate highway and are located entirely
within the culturally distinct Piedmont Crescent region.
861 F. Supp., at 466. Clearly, then, District 12 was drawn
around a community "defined by actual shared interests"
rather than racial demography. Miller v. Johnson, 515
U. S., at 916; see also Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647-648; DeWitt
v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp., at 1412, 1413-1414 (recognizing that
districts were "functionally" compact because they surrounded "communit[ies] of interest").

In light of the majority's decision not to remand for proper
application of the Miller test, I do not understand how it can
condemn the drawing of District 12 given these two raceneutral justifications for its shape. To be sure, in choosing
a district that snakes rather than sits, North Carolina did
not put a premium on geographical compactness. But I do
not understand why that should matter in light of the evidence that shows that other race-neutral districting considerations were determinative.16

16 Although the majority asserts that North Carolina "subordinated"
traditional districting principles to racial concerns because "[r]ace was
the criterion that, in the State's view, could not be compromised," ante,
at 907, no evidence suggests that North Carolina would have sacrificed
traditional districting principles in order to draw a second majorityminority district. Rather, the record reveals that the State chose District
12 over other options so that its plan would remain faithful to traditional,
race-neutral districting criteria. If strict scrutiny applies even when a
State draws a majority-minority district that respects traditional district517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT

As the foregoing discussion illustrates, legislative deci-sions are often the product of compromise and mixed motives. For that reason, I have always been skeptical aboutthe value of motivational analysis as a basis for constitutional
adjudication. See, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,253-254 (1976) (

Stevens, J., concurring). I am particularlyskeptical of such an inquiry in a case of this type, as mixed

motivations would seem to be endemic to the endeavor ofpolitical districting. See,

e. g, Bush, post, at 959 ("The pres-ent suit is a mixed motive case").

The majority's analysis of the "compelling interest" issuenicely demonstrates the problem with parsing legislative
motive in this context. The majority posits that the legis-lature's compelling interest in drawing District 12 was its
desire to avoid liability under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act.Yet it addresses the question whether North Carolina had a
compelling interest only because it first concludes that aracial purpose dominated the State's districting effort.

It seems to me that if the State's true purpose were toserve its compelling interest in staving off costly litigation
by complying with federal law, then it cannot be correct tosay that a racially discriminatory purpose

controlled itsline-drawing. A more accurate conclusion would be that the

State took race into account only to the extent necessaryto meet the requirements of a carefully thought out federal
statute. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at 159. Themajority's implicit equation of the intentional consideration

ing principles, then I do not see how a State can ever create a majorityminority district in order to fulfill its obligations under the Voting Rights
Act without inviting constitutional suspicion. I had thought that the
"demanding" standard Miller established, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.,
at 928 (O'Connor, J., concurring), as well as our summary affirmance
in DeWitt, reflected our determination that States should not be so
constrained.

of race in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act with
intentional racial discrimination reveals the inadequacy of
the framework it adopts for considering the constitutionality
of race-based districting.

However, even if I were to assume that strict scrutiny
applies, and thus that it makes sense to consider the question, I would not share the majority's hesitancy in concluding
that North Carolina had a "compelling interest" in drawing
District 12. In my view, the record identifies not merely
one, but at least three acceptable reasons that may have
motivated legislators to favor the creation of two such districts. Those three reasons easily satisfy the judicially created requirement that the state legislature's decision be supported by a "compelling state interest," particularly in a case
in which the alleged injury to the disadvantaged class--i. e.,
the majority of voters who are white--is so tenuous.

First, some legislators felt that the sorry history of race
relations in North Carolina in past decades was a sufficient
reason for making it easier for more black leaders to participate in the legislative process and to represent the State in
the Congress of the United States. 861 F. Supp., at 462-463.
Even if that history does not provide the kind of precise
guidance that will justify certain specific affirmative-action
programs in particular industries, see ante, at 909-910, it
surely provides an adequate basis for a decision to facilitate
the election of representatives of the previously disadvantaged minority.

As a class, state legislators are far more likely to be familiar with the role that race plays in electoral politics than
they are with the role that it plays in hiring decisions within
discrete industries. Moreover, given the North Carolina
Legislature's own recent experience with voting rights litigation, see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), as well
as the fact that 40 of the State's districts are so-called covered jurisdictions which the Attorney General directly moni517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT

tors as a result of prior discriminatory practices, see 42U. S. C. $ 1973c (1988 ed.), there is less reason to assume that

the state legislative judgments under review here are basedon unwarranted generalizations than may be true in other
contexts. Thus, even if a desire to correct past discrimina-tion did not itself drive the legislative decision to draw two
majority-minority districts, it plainly constituted a legiti-mate and significant additional factor supporting the decision
to do so. 861 F. Supp., at 472-473.Second, regardless of whether $ 5 of the Act was actually
violated, I believe the State's interest in avoiding the litiga-tion that would have been necessary to overcome the Attorney General's objection to the original plan provides anacceptable reason for creating a second majority-minority
district. It is entirely proper for a State whose past prac-tices have subjected it to the preclearance obligation set
forth in $ 5 to presume that the Attorney General's construc-tion of the Act is correct, and to take corrective action rather
than challenging him 17 in Court.Moreover, even if the State's interest in avoiding a court
challenge that might have succeeded does not constitute asufficient justification for its decision to draw a majorityminority district, the State plainly had an interest in comply-ing with a finding by the Attorney General that it reasonably
believed could not have been successfully challenged incourt. The majority disagrees, relying on our analysis in
Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 920-925. That reliance ismisplaced.

In Miller, the Court concluded that Georgia had simplyacceded to the Attorney General's unreasonable construction
of $ 5 without performing any independent assessment of itsvalidity.

Ibid. By contrast, the District Court here foundas a factual matter that the legislature's independent assess17 Although Attorney General Reno has endorsed the position taken by
the Republican administration in 1991, it was her male predecessor who
refused to preclear the State's original plan.

ment of the reasons for the Attorney General's denial of pre-clearance led it to the reasonable conclusion that its 11-white

district plan would violate the purpose prong of $ 5. 861F. Supp., at 474. As a result, I do not accept the Court's
conclusion that it was unreasonable for the State to believethat its decision to draw 1 majority-minority district out of
12 would have been subject to a successful attack under thepurpose prong of $ 5.

Ante, at 911-913.I acknowledge that when North Carolina sought preclearance it asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for deciding notto draw a second majority-minority district. See 861 F.
Supp., at 480, n. 9 (Vorhees, C. J., dissenting). On careful
reflection, however, the legislature concluded that thosereasons would not likely suffice in a federal action to challenge the Attorney General's ruling. The District Courtfound that conclusion to be reasonable.

Id., at 474. I am
mystified as to why this finding does not deserve our ac-ceptance. Nor do I understand the Court's willingness to

credit the State's declarations of nondiscriminatory purposein this context,

ante, at 912-913, in light of its unwillingness
to accept any of North Carolina's race-neutral explanations
for its decision to draw District 12, ante, at 905-906.Third, regardless of the possible outcome of litigation alleging that $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act would be violatedby a plan that ensured the election of white legislators in
11 of the State's 12 congressional districts, the interestin avoiding the expense and unpleasantness of such litigation was certainly legitimate and substantial. That thelegislature reasonably feared the possibility of a successful

$ 2 challenge cannot be credibly denied.18

18 While the majority is surely correct in stating that the threat of a
lawsuit, however unlikely to succeed, does not constitute a compelling interest, ante, at 908-909, n. 4, it does not follow that a State has no compelling interest in avoiding litigation over a substantial challenge. Here, of
course, the District Court found that North Carolina premised its decision
to draw a second majority-minority district on its reasonable conclusion

944 SHAW v. HUNT

Stevens, J., dissenting
In the course of the redistricting debate, numerous maps
had been presented showing that blacks could constitute
more than 50 percent of the population in two districts. 861
F. Supp., at 460-461, 474. The District Court found that
these plans had demonstrated that "the state's AfricanAmerican population was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in two congressional
districts." Id., at 464.

Moreover, the Attorney General denied preclearance on
the ground that North Carolina could have created a second majority-minority district that was, under any reasonable standard, geographically compact. Id., at 461-462;
Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 635. Maps prepared by the plaintiffintervenors for this litigation conclusively demonstrate that
two compact, majority-minority districts could indeed have
been drawn. 861 F. Supp., at 464-465; Plaintiff-Intervenors'
Exh. 301, A2-A3.

Even if many of the maps proposing two majorityAfrican-American districts were not particularly compact,
the legislature reasonably concluded that a federal court
might have determined that some of them could have provided the basis for a viable vote dilution suit pursuant to
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50-51. 861 F. Supp., at
474. That conclusion is particularly reasonable in light of
the fact that Gingles was a case fresh in the minds of many
of North Carolina's state legislators, id., at 463. There, the
State challenged the plaintiffs' $ 2 claim by pointing to the
oddly configured lines that defined their proposed majorityminority districts. See Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F. Supp.
345, 373 (EDNC 1984). As we know, North Carolina's defense to $ 2 liability proved unsuccessful in that instance,
even though the District Court acknowledged that the
"single-member district specifically suggested by the plainthat it would otherwise be subject to a successful $ 2 challenge, not a
"meritless" one. Ibid.

tiffs as a viable one is obviously not a model of aesthetictidiness." Id., at 374.

19

Finally, even if the record shows that African-Americanvoters would not have composed more than 50 percent of the

population in any plan containing two compact, majority-minority districts, the record reveals that it would have been
possible to have drawn a map containing one compact districtin which African-Americans would have composed more than
50 percent of the population and another compact district inwhich African-Americans, by reason of the large presence
of Native Americans, would have by far constituted thelargest racial group. Plaintiff-Intervenors' Exh. 301, A2-
A3. Given our recent emphasis on considering the totalityof the circumstances in $ 2 cases, we are in no position to
rebuke a State for concluding that a 40-plus percent African-American district could provide a defense to a viable Gingles
challenge as surely as could one with a 50.1 percent African-American population. See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S.
997, 1009-1012 (1994); Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146(1993);

19 Interestingly, although this Court in Thornburg v. Gingles held that

$ 2 plaintiffs must demonstrate that they live in "compact" majorityminority districts, we affirmed the District Court which had found that
the plaintiffs' proposed districts were contiguous but not compact. 478
U. S., at 38. Arguably, therefore, the State could have reasonably concluded that the maps proposing District 12 would have themselves provided the foundation for a viable $ 2 suit. For a discussion of how compact
"compact" districts must be, see Karlan, Maps and Misreadings: The Role
of Geographic Compactness in Racial Vote Dilution Litigation, 24 Harv.

IV
Although the Court assumes that North Carolina had a
compelling interest in avoiding liability under $ 2, ante,
at 916, it avoids conclusively resolving that question because it holds that District 12 was not a "narrowly tailored"
means of achieving that end. The majority reaches this
conclusion by determining that District 12 did not "remedy" any potential violation of $ 2 that may have occurred.
Ibid.

In my judgment, if a State's new plan successfully avoids
the potential litigation entirely, there is no reason why it
must also take the form of a "remedy" for an unproven violation. Thus, the fact that no $ 2 violation has been proved
in the territory that constitutes District 12 does not show
that the district fails to serve a compelling state interest.
It shows only that a federal court, which is constrained by
Article III, would not have had the power to require North
Carolina to draw that district. It is axiomatic that a State
should have more authority to institute a districting plan
than would a federal court. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S.,
at 156-157.

That District 12 will protect North Carolina from liability
seems clear. The record gives no indication that any of the
potential $ 2 claimants is interested in challenging the plan
that contains District 12. Moreover, as a legal matter,
North Carolina is in a stronger position to defend against a

$ 2 lawsuit with District 12 than without it.

Johnson v. De Grandy expressly states that, at least in the
context of single-member districting plans, a plaintiff cannot
make out a prima facie case of vote dilution under $ 2 unless
he can demonstrate that his proposed map contains more
majority-minority districts than the State's. 512 U. S., at
1008. By creating a plan with two majority-minority dis517US3$67i 02-07-99 19:56:41 PAGES OPINPGT

947Cite as: 517 U. S. 899 (1996)
Stevens, J., dissenting
tricts here, the State would seem to have precluded potential
litigants from satisfying that precondition.21

In addition, satisfaction of the so-called Gingles preconditions does not entitle an individual minority voter to inclusion in a majority-minority district. A court may conclude
that a State must create such a district only after it considers
the totality of the circumstances. A court would be remiss
if it failed to take into account that the State had drawn
majority-minority districts proportional to its minority population which include portions of the very minority community
in which an individual minority plaintiff resides. Indeed,
our recent decisions compel courts to perform just such a
calculus. See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1012-
1016; Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 (1993); see also African American Voting Rights Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v.
Villa, 54 F. 3d 1345, 1355-1357 (CA8 1995).

21 The majority's assertion that De Grandy only requires a plaintiff to
show that more "reasonably compact" majority-minority districts could
have been drawn would seem to expand dramatically a State's potential
liability under $ 2. Ante, at 916, n. 8. I would have thought that a State
that had drawn three majority-minority districts, one of which was "reasonably compact" and two of which straggled in order to preserve certain
distinctive communities of interest, would at the very least be immune to
a challenge by a single African-American plaintiff bearing a map proposing to draw but two compact majority-minority districts. The Court's expansive notion of $ 2 liability, combined with its apparent eagerness to
subject all legislative attempts to comply with that Act to strict scrutiny,
will place many States in the untenable position of facing substantial litigation no matter how they draw their maps. See Miller v. Johnson, 515
U. S., at 949 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

Of course, a State that unfairly "packs" African-American voters into a
limited number of districts may be subject to a $ 2 challenge on the ground
that it failed to create so-called "influence" districts, and perhaps the majority means to endorse that proposition as well. I note here, however,
that there is no indication that such a challenge could be successfully
brought against North Carolina's two majority-minority district plan,
which creates districts with only bare African-American majorities.

Finally, North Carolina's chosen means of avoiding liabilitywill impose none of the burdens on third parties that have

made the Court wary of voluntary, race-based state actionin the past. No white employees or applicants stand to lose
jobs on account of their race as a result of North Carolina'sactions. In fact, no white voters risk having their votes unlawfully diluted. At most, North Carolina's chosen meanswill require that some people of both races will be placed in
districts other than those to which they would have other-wise been assigned. Even assuming that "burden" is more
onerous when it results from racial considerations, it does
not rise to a level of injury that justifies a federal court intruding on the State's discretion to formulate a plan thatcomplies with the Voting Rights Act.

In fact, to the extent that plaintiffs in these cases premisetheir standing on the "representational" harms that they
suffer, see supra, at 927-928, a State's decision to locate amajority-minority district outside the area that suffers from
acute, racial bloc voting would seem to diminish the likeli-hood that representatives in majority-minority districts will
serve only the interests of minority voters. After all, a
representative of a majority-minority district that does notsuffer from racial bloc voting cannot safely ignore the interests of voters of either race. In this respect, the majority'snarrow tailoring requirement, by forcing States to remedy
perceived $ 2 violations only by drawing the district aroundthe area in which the

Gingles preconditions have been satisfied, has the perverse consequence of requiring States toinflict the very harm that supposedly renders racial gerrymandering challenges constitutionally cognizable.22

22 The Court's strict analysis in this case is in some tension with the
more reasonable approach endorsed by Justice O'Connor this same day.
On her view, state legislatures seeking to comply with the Voting Rights
Act clearly possess more freedom to draw majority-minority districts
than do federal courts attempting to enforce it. Bush v. Vera, post, at 994
(O'Connor, J., concurring).

Stevens, J., dissenting
Although I do not believe a judicial inquiry into "narrowtailoring" is either necessary or appropriate in these cases,

the foregoing discussion reveals that the "narrow tailoring"requirement that the Court has fashioned is a pure judicial
invention that unfairly deprives the legislature of a sover-eign State of its traditional discretion in determining the
boundaries of its electoral districts.23 The Court's analysisgives rise to the unfortunate suggestion that a State that
fears a $ 2 lawsuit must draw the precise district that it be-lieves a federal court would have the power to impose. Such
a proposition confounds basic principles of federalism, andforces States to imagine the legally "correct" outcome of a
lawsuit that has not even been filed.The proposition is also at odds with the course of the litigation that led to Gingles itself. In that case, the plaintiffsproposed a number of oddly configured majority-minority
districts to prove their vote dilution claim. In implement-ing a remedy for the $ 2 violation, the federal court wisely
permitted North Carolina to propose its own remedial dis-tricts, many of which were highly irregular in dimension.
Indeed, so peculiar were some of the shapes concocted bythe State that the

Gingles plaintiffs challenged them on thegrounds that they constituted racial gerrymanders which

failed to remedy the very violations that had given rise tothe need for their creation, and that they reflected only
grudging responses designed to protect incumbent office-holders. Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F. Supp., at 381.

Although the District Court in Gingles acknowledged thatthe State's plan was not the one that it would have implemented, it nonetheless concluded that the plan constituted areasonable exercise of state legislative judgment. "[A] state
legislature's primary jurisdiction for legislative apportion23 That judicial creativity rather than constitutional principle defines
the narrowing tailoring requirement in this area of our law is clear from
Bush's quite different analysis of the same question. See Bush, post,

ment and redistricting must include the right, free of judicialrejection, to implement state policies that may fail to remedy

to the fullest extent possible the voting rights violationsoriginally found." Id., at 382.

In dramatic contrast, the Court today rejects North Caro-lina's plan because it does not provide the precise remedy
that might have been ordered by a federal court, eventhough it satisfies potential plaintiffs, furthers such raceneutral legislative ends as incumbency protection and thepreservation of distinct communities of interest, and essentially serves to insulate the State from a successful stat-utory challenge. There is no small irony in the fact that
the Court's decision to intrude into the State's districtingprocess comes in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf
of white voters who have suffered no history of exclusionfrom North Carolina's political process, and whose only
claims of harm are at best rooted in speculative and stereo-typical assumptions about the kind of representation they
are likely to receive from the candidates that their neighborshave chosen.

V
It is, of course, irrelevant whether we, as judges, deemit wise policy to create majority-minority districts as a

means of assuring fair and effective representation to mi-nority voters. We have a duty to respect Congress' considered judgment that such a policy may serve to effectuatethe ends of the constitutional Amendment that it is charged
with enforcing. We should also respect North Carolina'sconscientious effort to conform to that congressional determination. Absent some demonstration that voters arebeing denied fair and effective representation as a result
of their race, I find no basis for this Court's interventioninto a process by which federal and state actors, both black
and white, are jointly attempting to resolve difficult ques-tions of politics and race that have long plagued North
Carolina. Nor do I see how our constitutional tradition can

BUSH, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, et al. v. VERA et al.

appeal from the district court for the southerndistrict of texas

No. 94-805. Argued December 5, 1995--Decided June 13, 1996*
Because the 1990 census revealed a population increase entitling Texas

to three additional congressional seats, and in an attempt to comply
with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), the Texas Legislature promulgated a redistricting plan that, among other things, created District
30 as a new majority-African-American district in Dallas County and
District 29 as a new majority-Hispanic district in Harris County, and
reconfigured District 18, which is adjacent to District 29, as a majorityAfrican-American district. After the Department of Justice precleared
the plan under VRA $ 5, the plaintiffs, six Texas voters, filed this challenge alleging that 24 of the State's 30 congressional districts constitute racial gerrymanders in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The three-judge District Court held Districts 18, 29, and 30 unconstitutional. The Governor of Texas, private intervenors, and the United
States (as intervenor) appeal.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
861 F. Supp. 1304, affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice
Kennedy, concluded:

1. Plaintiff Chen, who resides in District 25 and has not alleged any
specific facts showing that he personally has been subjected to any racial
classification, lacks standing under United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737,
744-745. But plaintiffs Blum and Powers, who reside in District 18,
plaintiffs Thomas and Vera, who reside in District 29, and plaintiff
Orcutt, who resides in District 30, have standing to challenge Districts
18, 29, and 30. See, e. g., ibid. Pp. 957-958.

2. Districts 18, 29, and 30 are subject to strict scrutiny under this
Court's precedents. Pp. 958-976.

(a) Strict scrutiny applies where race was "the predominant
factor" motivating the drawing of district lines, see, e. g., Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916 (emphasis added), and traditional, raceneutral districting principles were subordinated to race, see ibid. This
is a mixed motive suit, and a careful review is therefore necessary to

*Together with No. 94-806, Lawson et al. v. Vera et al., and No. 94-988,
United States v. Vera et al., also on appeal from the same court.

determine whether the districts at issue are subject to such scrutiny.
Findings that Texas substantially neglected traditional districting
criteria such as compactness, that it was committed from the outset to
creating majority-minority districts, and that it manipulated district
lines to exploit unprecedentedly detailed racial data, taken together,
weigh in favor of the application of strict scrutiny. However, because
factors other than race, particularly incumbency protection, clearly influenced the legislature, each of the challenged districts must be scrutinized to determine whether the District Court's conclusion that race
predominated can be sustained. Pp. 958-965.

(b) District 30 is subject to strict scrutiny. Appellants do not deny
that the district shows substantial disregard for the traditional districting principles of compactness and regularity, or that the redistricters
pursued unwaveringly the objective of creating a majority-AfricanAmerican district. Their argument that the district's bizarre shape is
explained by efforts to unite communities of interest, as manifested by
the district's consistently urban character and its shared media sources
and major transportation lines to Dallas, must be rejected. The record
contains no basis for displacing the District Court's conclusion that race
predominated over the latter factors, particularly in light of the court's
findings that the State's supporting data were largely unavailable to
the legislature before the district was created and that the factors
do not differentiate the district from surrounding areas with the same
degree of correlation to district lines that racial data exhibit. Appellants' more substantial claim that incumbency protection rivaled race
in determining the district's shape is also unavailing. The evidence
amply supports the District Court's conclusions that racially motivated
gerrymandering had a qualitatively greater influence on the drawing
of district lines than politically motivated gerrymandering, which is not
subject to strict scrutiny, see Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 132
(White, J., plurality opinion); and that political gerrymandering was
accomplished in large part by the use of race as a proxy for political
characteristics, which is subject to such scrutiny, cf. Powers v. Ohio, 499
U. S. 400, 410. Pp. 965-973.

(c) Interlocking Districts 18 and 29 are also subject to strict scrutiny. Those districts' shapes are bizarre, and their utter disregard of
city limits, local election precincts, and voter tabulation district lines
has caused a severe disruption of traditional forms of political activity and created administrative headaches for local election officials.
Although appellants adduced evidence that incumbency protection
played a role in determining the bizarre district lines, the District
Court's conclusion that the districts' shapes are unexplainable on
grounds other than race and, as such, are the product of presumptively

unconstitutional racial gerrymandering is inescapably corroborated by
the evidence. Pp. 973-976.

3. Districts 18, 29, and 30 are not narrowly tailored to serve a
compelling state interest. Pp. 976-983.

(a) Creation of the three districts was not justified by a compelling state interest in complying with the "results" test of VRA $ 2(b).
It may be assumed without deciding that such compliance can be a compelling state interest. See, e. g., Shaw v. Hunt, ante, at 915 (Shaw II).
States attempting to comply with $ 2 retain discretion to apply traditional districting principles and are entitled to a limited degree of
leeway. But a district drawn in order to satisfy $ 2 must not subordinate traditional districting principles to race substantially more than
is reasonably necessary. The districts at issue fail this test, since all
three are bizarrely shaped and far from compact, and those characteristics are predominantly attributable to gerrymandering that was racially motivated and/or achieved by the use of race as a proxy. Appellants Lawson et al. misinterpret Miller, supra, at 913, when they argue
that bizarre shaping and noncompactness go only to motive and are irrelevant to the narrow tailoring inquiry. Also unavailing is the United
States' contention that insofar as bizarreness and noncompactness are
necessary to achieve the State's compelling interest in compliance with

$ 2 while simultaneously achieving other legitimate redistricting goals,
the narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied. The bizarre shaping and
noncompactness of the districts in question were predominantly attributable to racial, not political, manipulation, while the Government's argument addresses the case of an otherwise compact majority-minority
district that is misshapen by predominantly nonracial, political manipulation. Pp. 976-981.

(b) The district lines at issue are not justified by a compelling state
interest in ameliorating the effects of racially polarized voting attributable to Texas' long history of discrimination against minorities in
electoral processes. Among the conditions that must be satisfied to
render an interest in remedying discrimination compelling is the requirement that the discrimination be specific and "identified." Shaw
II, ante, at 910. Here, the only current problem that appellants cite
as in need of remediation is alleged vote dilution as a consequence of
racial bloc voting, the same concern that underlies their VRA $ 2 compliance defense. Once the correct standard is applied, the fact that
these districts are not narrowly tailored to comply with $ 2 forecloses
this line of defense. Pp. 981-982.

(c) Creation of District 18 (only) was not justified by a compelling state interest in complying with VRA $ 5, which seeks to prevent
voting-procedure changes leading to a retrogression in the position of

racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise. See, e. g., Miller, 515 U. S., at 926. The problem with
appellants' contention that this "nonretrogression" principle applies
because Harris County previously contained a congressional district in
which African-American voters always succeeded in selecting AfricanAmerican representatives is that it seeks to justify not maintenance,
but substantial augmentation, of the African-American population
percentage, which has grown from 40.8% in the previous district to
50.9% in District 18. Nonretrogression is not a license for the State to
do whatever it deems necessary to ensure continued electoral success;
it merely mandates that the minority's opportunity to elect representatives of its choice not be diminished, directly or indirectly, by the State's
actions. District 18 is not narrowly tailored to the avoidance of $ 5
liability. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 655. Pp. 982-983.

4. Various of the dissents' arguments, none of which address the specifics of this suit, and which have been rebutted in other decisions, must
be rejected. Pp. 983-986.

Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that application of strict scrutiny in this suit was never a close question, since
this Court's decisions have effectively resolved that the intentional
creation of majority-minority districts, by itself, is sufficient to invoke
such scrutiny. See, e. g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S.
200, 227 (strict scrutiny applies to all government classifications based
on race); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 918-919 (Georgia's concession
that it intentionally created majority-minority districts was sufficient to
show that race was a predominant, motivating factor in its redistricting). DeWitt v. Wilson, 515 U. S. 1170, distinguished. Application of
strict scrutiny is required here because Texas has readily admitted
that it intentionally created majority-minority districts and that those
districts would not have existed but for its affirmative use of racial
demographics. Assuming that the State has asserted a compelling
state interest, its redistricting attempts were not narrowly tailored to
achieve that interest. Pp. 999-1003.

crease, largely in urban minority populations, that entitledTexas to three additional congressional seats. In response,

and with a view to complying with the Voting Rights Act of1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973 et
seq., the Texas Legislature promulgated a redistricting planthat, among other things, created District 30, a new
majority-African-American district in Dallas County; cre-ated District 29, a new majority-Hispanic district in and
around Houston in Harris County; and reconfigured District18, which is adjacent to District 29, to make it a majorityAfrican-American district. The Department of Justice pre-cleared that plan under VRA $ 5 in 1991, and it was used in
the 1992 congressional elections.The plaintiffs, six Texas voters, challenged the plan, alleging that 24 of Texas' 30 congressional districts constituteracial gerrymanders in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The three-judge United States District Court for theSouthern District of Texas held Districts 18, 29, and 30 unconstitutional. Vera v. Richards, 861 F. Supp. 1304 (1994).The Governor of Texas, private intervenors, and the United
States (as intervenor) now appeal. We noted probable juris-diction. 515 U. S. 1172 (1995). Finding that, under this
Court's decisions in Shaw I and Miller, the district lines atissue are subject to strict scrutiny, and that they are not
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, weaffirm.

I
As a preliminary matter, the State and private appellantscontest the plaintiffs' standing to challenge these districts.

Plaintiff Chen resides in Texas congressional District 25, andhas not alleged any specific facts showing that he personally
has been subjected to any racial classification. Under ourdecision in

Hays, he lacks standing. See Hays, supra, at744-745. But plaintiffs Blum and Powers are residents of

District 18, plaintiffs Thomas and Vera are residents of Dis-trict 29, and plaintiff Orcutt is a resident of District 30. We

stated in Hays that "[w]here a plaintiff resides in a raciallygerrymandered district, . . . the plaintiff has been denied

equal treatment because of the legislature's reliance on racialcriteria, and therefore has standing to challenge the legislature's action." Ibid.; accord, Miller, supra, at 910-911.Under this rule, these plaintiffs have standing to challenge
Districts 18, 29, and 30. II

We must now determine whether those districts are sub-ject to strict scrutiny. Our precedents have used a variety
of formulations to describe the threshold for the applicationof strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny applies where "redistricting legislation . . . is so extremely irregular on its face thatit rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the
races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditionaldistricting principles,"

Shaw I, supra, at 642, or where "racefor its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the

legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawingits district lines,"

Miller, 515 U. S., at 913, and "the legisla-ture subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations," id., at 916. See also id.,at 928 (

O'Connor, J., concurring) (strict scrutiny only ap-plies where "the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of customary and traditional districting practices").Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting
is performed with consciousness of race. See Shaw I, supra,at 646. Nor does it apply to all cases of intentional creation
of majority-minority districts. See DeWitt v. Wilson, 856F. Supp. 1409 (ED Cal. 1994) (strict scrutiny did not apply to
an intentionally created compact majority-minority district),summarily aff 'd, 515 U. S. 1170 (1995); cf.

Shaw I, supra, at649 (reserving this question). Electoral district lines are

"facially race neutral," so a more searching inquiry is neces-sary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable in redistricting cases than in cases of "classifications based explicitlyon race." See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen

200, 213 (1995); cf. post, at 999-1000, 1002-1003 (Thomas, J.,concurring in judgment) (assimilating our redistricting cases

to Adarand). For strict scrutiny to apply, the plaintiffsmust prove that other, legitimate districting principles were
"subordinated" to race. Miller, 515 U. S., at 916. By that,
we mean that race must be "the predominant factor motivat-ing the legislature's [redistricting] decision."

Ibid. (emphasis
added). We thus differ from Justice Thomas, who wouldapparently hold that it suffices that racial considerations be

a motivation for the drawing of a majority-minority district.See

post, at 1002.
The present suit is a mixed motive suit. The appellants
concede that one of Texas' goals in creating the three districts at issue was to produce majority-minority districts, but
they also cite evidence that other goals, particularly incumbency protection (including protection of "functional incumbents," i. e., sitting members of the Texas Legislature who
had declared an intention to run for open congressional
seats), also played a role in the drawing of the district lines.
The record does not reflect a history of " `purely race-based' "
districting revisions. Cf. Miller, supra, at 918 (emphasis
added). A careful review is, therefore, necessary to determine whether these districts are subject to strict scrutiny.
But review of the District Court's findings of primary fact
and the record convinces us that the District Court's determination that race was the "predominant factor" in the
drawing of each of the districts must be sustained.

We begin with general findings and evidence regarding the
redistricting plan's respect for traditional districting principles, the legislators' expressed motivations, and the methods
used in the redistricting process. The District Court began
its analysis by rejecting the factual basis for appellants'
claim that Texas' challenged "districts cannot be unconstitutionally bizarre in shape because Texas does not have and
never has used traditional redistricting principles such as
natural geographical boundaries, contiguity, compactness,

and conformity to political subdivisions." 861 F. Supp., at1333. The court instead found that "generally, Texas has

not intentionally disregarded traditional districting criteria,"and that only one pre-1991 congressional district in Texas
was comparable in its irregularity and noncompactness tothe three challenged districts.

Id., at 1334. The court alsonoted that "compactness as measured by an `eyeball' approach was much less important," id., at 1313, n. 9, in the1991 plan, App. 144, than in its predecessor, the 1980 Texas
congressional districting plan, id., at 138, and that districtswere especially irregular in shape in the Dallas and Harris
County areas where the challenged districts are located, see861 F. Supp., at 1313, n. 9.

These findings comport with the conclusions of an instruc-tive study that attempted to determine the relative compactness of districts nationwide in objective, numerical terms.That study gave Texas' 1980 districting plan a roughly average score for the compactness and regularity of its districtshapes, but ranked its 1991 plan among the worst in the
Nation. See Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms, "BizarreDistricts," and Voting Rights: Evaluating Election-District
Appearances After Shaw v. Reno, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 483, 571-573, table 6 (1993). The same study ranked Districts 18, 29,
and 30 among the 28 least regular congressional districts na-tionwide. See id., at 565, table 3. Our own review gives
us no reason to disagree with the District Court that thedistricts at issue "have no integrity in terms of traditional,
neutral redistricting criteria," 861 F. Supp., at 1339.The District Court also found substantial direct evidence
of the legislature's racial motivations. The State's submis-sion to the Department of Justice for preclearance under
VRA $ 5 reports a consensus within the legislature that thethree new congressional districts

" `should be configured in such a way as to allow mem-bers of racial, ethnic, and language minorities to elect
Congressional representatives. Accordingly, the three

new districts include a predominantly black districtdrawn in the Dallas County area [District 30] and predominantly Hispanic districts in the Harris County area[District 29] and in the South Texas region. In addition
to creating the three new minority districts, the pro-posed Congressional redistricting plan increases the
black voting strength of the current District 18 (HarrisCounty) by increasing the population to assure that the
black community may continue to elect a candidate ofits choice.' "

Id., at 1315 (quoting Narrative of VotingRights Act Considerations in Affected Districts, reprinted in App. 104-105).
The appellants also conceded in this litigation that the threedistricts at issue "were created for the purpose of enhancing

the opportunity of minority voters to elect minority repre-sentatives to Congress." 861 F. Supp., at 1337. And testimony of individual state officials confirmed that the decisionto create the districts now challenged as majority-minority
districts was made at the outset of the process and neverseriously questioned.

The means that Texas used to make its redistricting deci-sions provides further evidence of the importance of race.
The primary tool used in drawing district lines was a com-puter program called "REDAPPL." REDAPPL permitted
redistricters to manipulate district lines on computer maps,on which racial and other socioeconomic data were superimposed. At each change in configuration of the district linesbeing drafted, REDAPPL displayed updated racial composition statistics for the district as drawn. REDAPPL con-tained racial data at the block-by-block level, whereas other
data, such as party registration and past voting statistics,were only available at the level of voter tabulation districts
(which approximate election precincts). The availabilityand use of block-by-block racial data was unprecedented; before the 1990 census, data were not broken down beyond thecensus tract level. See App. 123. By providing uniquely

detailed racial data, REDAPPL enabled districters to makemore intricate refinements on the basis of race than on the

basis of other demographic information. The District Courtfound that the districters availed themselves fully of that
opportunity:

"In numerous instances, the correlation between race
and district boundaries is nearly perfect. . . . The bor-ders of Districts 18, 29, and 30 change from block to

block, from one side of the street to the other, and tra-verse streets, bodies of water, and commercially developed areas in seemingly arbitrary fashion until one realizes that those corridors connect minority populations."861 F. Supp., at 1336.

These findings--that the State substantially neglected traditional districting criteria such as compactness, that it was
committed from the outset to creating majority-minority dis-tricts, and that it manipulated district lines to exploit unprecedentedly detailed racial data--together weigh in favorof the application of strict scrutiny. We do not hold that any
one of these factors is independently sufficient to requirestrict scrutiny. The Constitution does not mandate regularity of district shape, see Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 647, and theneglect of traditional districting criteria is merely necessary,
not sufficient. For strict scrutiny to apply, traditional districting criteria must be subordinated to race. Miller, 515U. S., at 916. Nor, as we have emphasized, is the decision

to create a majority-minority district objectionable in and ofitself. The direct evidence of that decision is not, as

Justice Stevens suggests, post, at 1024, "the real key" to our
decision; it is merely one of several essential ingredients.
Nor do we "condemn state legislation merely because it was
based on accurate information." Post, at 1031, n. 28. The
use of sophisticated technology and detailed information in
the drawing of majority-minority districts is no more objectionable than it is in the drawing of majority-majority dis517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT

tricts. But, as the District Court explained, the direct evidence of racial considerations, coupled with the fact that the
computer program used was significantly more sophisticated
with respect to race than with respect to other demographic
data, provides substantial evidence that it was race that led
to the neglect of traditional districting criteria here. We
must therefore consider what role other factors played in
order to determine whether race predominated.

Several factors other than race were at work in the drawing of the districts. Traditional districting criteria were not
entirely neglected: Districts 18 and 29 maintain the integrity
of county lines; each of the three districts takes its character
from a principal city and the surrounding urban area; and
none of the districts is as widely dispersed as the North Carolina district held unconstitutional in Shaw II, ante, p. 899.
(These characteristics are, however, unremarkable in the
context of large, densely populated urban counties.) More
significantly, the District Court found that incumbency
protection influenced the redistricting plan to an unprecedented extent:

"[A]s enacted in Texas in 1991, many incumbent protection boundaries sabotaged traditional redistricting principles as they routinely divided counties, cities, neighborhoods, and regions. For the sake of maintaining or
winning seats in the House of Representatives, Congressmen or would-be Congressmen shed hostile groups
and potential opponents by fencing them out of their districts. The Legislature obligingly carved out districts
of apparent supporters of incumbents, as suggested by
the incumbents, and then added appendages to connect
their residences to those districts. The final result
seems not one in which the people select their representatives, but in which the representatives have selected the people." 861 F. Supp., at 1334 (citations and
footnotes omitted).

See also id., at 1317-1318 (describing specific evidence ofincumbency protection efforts statewide). This finding receives inferential support from the fact that all but one ofTexas' 27 incumbents won in the 1992 elections. See

id., at
1318. And the appellants point to evidence that in many
cases, race correlates strongly with manifestations of com-munity of interest (for example, shared broadcast and print

media, public transport infrastructure, and institutions suchas schools and churches) and with the political data that are
vital to incumbency protection efforts, raising the possibilitythat correlations between racial demographics and district
lines may be explicable in terms of nonracial motivations.
For example, a finding by a district court that district lines
were drawn in part on the basis of evidence (other than racial
data) of where communities of interest existed might weaken
a plaintiff 's claim that race predominated in the drawing of
district lines. Cf. post, at 1049 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recognizing the legitimate role of communities of interest in our
system of representative democracy).

Strict scrutiny would not be appropriate if race-neutral,
traditional districting considerations predominated over racial ones. We have not subjected political gerrymandering
to strict scrutiny. See Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109,
132 (1986) (White, J., plurality opinion) ("[U]nconstitutional
discrimination occurs only when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter's
or a group of voters' influence on the political process as a
whole"); id., at 147 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)
("[P]urely political gerrymandering claims" are not justiciable). And we have recognized incumbency protection, at
least in the limited form of "avoiding contests between incumbent[s]," as a legitimate state goal. See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 740 (1983); White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783,
797 (1973); Burns v. Richardson, 384 U. S. 73, 89, n. 16 (1966);

to allocate seats proportionately to major political parties).Because it is clear that race was not the only factor that

motivated the legislature to draw irregular district lines,we must scrutinize each challenged district to determine
whether the District Court's conclusion that race predomi-nated over legitimate districting considerations, including
incumbency, can be sustained.

A
The population of District 30 is 50% African-American and17.1% Hispanic. Fifty percent of the district's population is

located in a compact, albeit irregularly shaped, core in southDallas, which is 69% African-American. But the remainder
of the district consists of narrow and bizarrely shaped ten-tacles--the State identifies seven "segments"--extending
primarily to the north and west. See App. 335; see alsoM. Barone & G. Ujifusa, Almanac of American Politics 1996,
p. 1277 (1995) (describing the district). Over 98% of the dis-trict's population is within Dallas County, see App. 118, but
it crosses two county lines at its western and northern ex-tremities. Its western excursion into Tarrant County grabs
a small community that is 61.9% African-American, id., at331; its northern excursion into Collin County occupies a
hook-like shape mapping exactly onto the only area in thesouthern half of that county with a combined AfricanAmerican and Hispanic percentage population in excess of50%, id., at 153. The District Court's description of the
district as a whole bears repeating:

"The district sprawls throughout Dallas County, delib-erately excludes the wealthy white neighborhoods of

Highland Park and University Park and extends fingersinto Collin County, which include the outermost suburbs
of Dallas. In Collin County, the district picks up asmall African-American neighborhood. The district extends into Tarrant County only to pick up a small borderarea with a high African-American concentration. It

also reaches out to claim Hamilton Park, an affluentAfrican-American neighborhood surrounded by whites.

Part of the district runs along Trinity River bottom,using it to connect dispersed minority population. Numerous [voter tabulation districts] were split in order toachieve the population mix required for the district.

. . . . .
". . . It is at least 25 miles wide and 30 miles long."861 F. Supp., at 1337-1338.

See also Appendix A to this opinion (outline of District 30).Appellants do not deny that District 30 shows substantial
disregard for the traditional districting principles of com-pactness and regularity, or that the redistricters pursued
unwaveringly the objective of creating a majority-African-American district. But they argue that its bizarre shape is
explained by efforts to unite communities of interest in asingle district and, especially, to protect incumbents.

Appellants highlight the facts that the district has a con-sistently urban character and has common media sources
throughout, and that its tentacles include several majortransportation lines into the city of Dallas. These factors,
which implicate traditional districting principles, do corre-late to some extent with the district's layout. But we see
no basis in the record for displacing the District Court's con-clusion that race predominated over them, particularly in
light of the court's findings that the State's supporting datawere not "available to the Legislature in any organized fashion before District 30 was created," 861 F. Supp., at 1338, andthat they do not "differentiate the district from surrounding
areas," ibid., with the same degree of correlation to districtlines that racial data exhibit, see App. 150. In reaching that
conclusion, we do not, as Justice Stevens fears, requireStates engaged in redistricting to compile "a comprehensive
administrative record," post, at 1026 (Stevens, J., dissent-ing), and we do not dismiss facts not explicitly mentioned in
the redistricting plan's legislative history as "irrelevant,"

ibid. If, as may commonly happen, traditional districtingprinciples are substantially followed without much conscious

thought, they cannot be said to have been "subordinated torace." In considering whether race was the "predominant
factor motivating the legislatur[e]," it is, however, evidentially significant that at the time of the redistricting, theState had compiled detailed racial data for use in redistricting, but made no apparent attempt to compile, and did notrefer specifically to, equivalent data regarding communities
of interest.Appellants present a more substantial case for their claim
that incumbency protection rivaled race in determining the
district's shape. Representative Johnson was the principal
architect of District 30, which was designed in part to create
a safe Democratic seat for her. At an early stage in the
redistricting process, Johnson submitted to the state legislature a plan for Dallas County with a relatively compact 44%
African-American district that did not violate the integrity
of any voter tabulation district or county lines. See App.
139; 861 F. Supp., at 1338. The District Court found that
"[w]hile minority voters did not object" to it, id., at 1330,
"[t]hat plan drew much opposition from incumbents and was
quickly abandoned," id., at 1321, n. 22. "[F]ive other congressmen would have been thrown into districts other than
the ones they currently represent." Id., at 1330-1331. Appellants also point to testimony from Johnson and others to
the effect that the incumbents of the adjacent Democratic
Districts 5 and 24 exerted strong and partly successful efforts to retain predominantly African-American Democratic
voters in their districts. (There was evidence that 97% of
African-American voters in and around the city of Dallas
vote Democrat.) See generally id., at 1321-1322.

In some circumstances, incumbency protection might explain as well as, or better than, race a State's decision to
depart from other traditional districting principles, such as
compactness, in the drawing of bizarre district lines. And

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
the fact that, "[a]s it happens, . . . many of the voters beingfought over [by the neighboring Democratic incumbents]

were African-American," id., at 1338, would not, in and ofitself, convert a political gerrymander into a racial gerrymander, no matter how conscious redistricters were of the correlation between race and party affiliation. See Shaw I, 509U. S., at 646. If district lines merely correlate with race

because they are drawn on the basis of political affiliation,which correlates with race, there is no racial classification to
justify, just as racial disproportions in the level of prosecu-tions for a particular crime may be unobjectionable if they
merely reflect racial disproportions in the commission of that
crime, cf. post, at 1032, n. 30 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (discussing United States v. Armstrong, ante, at 456.

If the State's goal is otherwise constitutional political gerrymandering, it is free to use the kind of political data on
which Justice Stevens focuses--precinct general election
voting patterns, post, at 1030, precinct primary voting patterns, post, at 1017, and legislators' experience, post, at
1026--to achieve that goal regardless of its awareness of its
racial implications and regardless of the fact that it does so
in the context of a majority-minority district. To the extent
that the District Court suggested the contrary, it erred.
But to the extent that race is used as a proxy for political
characteristics, a racial stereotype requiring strict scrutiny
is in operation. Cf. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991)
("Race cannot be a proxy for determining juror bias or competence"). We cannot agree with the dissenters, see post, at
1031 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 1051-1052, n. 5 (Souter, J., dissenting); see also Shaw II, ante, at 924-925, n. 4
(Stevens, J., dissenting), that racial stereotyping that we
have scrutinized closely in the context of jury service can
pass without justification in the context of voting. If the
promise of the Reconstruction Amendments, that our Nation
is to be free of state-sponsored discrimination, is to be upheld, we cannot pick and choose between the basic forms of

political participation in our efforts to eliminate unjustifiedracial stereotyping by government actors.

Here, the District Court had ample bases on which to con-clude both that racially motivated gerrymandering had a
qualitatively greater influence on the drawing of districtlines than politically motivated gerrymandering, and that political gerrymandering was accomplished in large part by theuse of race as a proxy. The State's own VRA $ 5 submission
explains the drawing of District 30, and the rejection ofJohnson's more compact plan, in exclusively racial terms:

"Throughout the course of the Congressional redistrict-ing process, the lines of the proposed District 30 were
constantly reconfigured in an attempt to maximize thevoting strength for this black community in Dallas
County . . . While the legislature was in agreement thata safe black district should be drawn in the Dallas
County area, the real dispute involved the composition,configuration and quality of that district. The community insisted that [a] `safe' black district be drawn thathad a total black population of at least 50%. . . .
". . . Although some [alternative] proposals showed amore compact configuration, none of them reached the
threshold 50% total black population which the commu-nity felt was necessary to assure its ability to elect its
own Congressional representative without having toform coalitions with other minority groups. . . .
". . . The goal was to not only create a district that wouldmaximize the opportunity for the black community to
elect a Congressional candidate of its choice in 1992, butalso one that included some of the major black growth
areas which will assure continued electoral and economicopportunities over the next decades." App. 106-107.

As the District Court noted, testimony of state officials inearlier litigation (in which District 30 was challenged as a
political gerrymander) contradicted part of their testimony

517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
here, and affirmed that "race was the primary considerationin the construction of District 30." 861 F. Supp., at 1338;

see also id., at 1319-1321. And Johnson explained in a letterto the Department of Justice written at the end of the redistricting process that incumbency protection had been
achieved by using race as a proxy:

" `Throughout the course of the Congressional redistrict-ing process, the lines were continuously reconfigured to

assist in protecting the Democratic incumbents in theDallas/Fort Worth metroplex area by spreading the
Black population to increase the Democratic party index
in those areas.' " Id., at 1322 (quoting Plaintiff Exh.6E6).

This is not to say that the direct evidence of the districters'
intent showed race to be the sole factor considered. As Justice Stevens notes, post, at 1024-1025, nn. 23-24, state of-ficials' claims have changed as their interests have changed.

In the prior political gerrymandering suit and to the Depart-ment of Justice, they asserted that race predominated. In
this suit, their testimony was that political considerationspredominated. These inconsistent statements must be
viewed in light of their adversarial context. But such ques-tions of credibility are matters for the District Court, and
we simply differ from the dissenters in our reading of the
record when they find insupportable the District Court's reli-ance on the State's own statements indicating the importance

of race, see post, at 1024-1025, nn. 23-24, 1033, n. 31 (opinionof

Stevens, J.).
Finally, and most significantly, the objective evidence provided by the district plans and demographic maps suggests
strongly the predominance of race. Given that the districting software used by the State provided only racial data at
the block-by-block level, the fact that District 30, unlike
Johnson's original proposal, splits voter tabulation districts
and even individual streets in many places, see App. 150; 861

971Cite as: 517 U. S. 952 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
F. Supp., at 1339, suggests that racial criteria predominatedover other districting criteria in determining the district's

boundaries. And, despite the strong correlation betweenrace and political affiliation, the maps reveal that political
considerations were subordinated to racial classification inthe drawing of many of the most extreme and bizarre district
lines. For example, the northernmost hook of the district,where it ventures into Collin County, is tailored perfectly to
maximize minority population, see App. 153 (all whole andparts of 1992 voter tabulation districts within District 30's
Collin County hook have a combined African-American andHispanic population in excess of 50%, with an average
African-American population of 19.8%, id., at 331, while thecombined African-American and Hispanic population in all
surrounding voter tabulation districts, and the other partsof split districts, in Collin County is less than 25%), whereas
it is far from the shape that would be necessary to maximizethe Democratic vote in that area, see id., at 196 (showing a
Republican majority, based on 1990 voting patterns in sevenof the eight 1990 voter tabulation districts wholly or partly
included in District 30 in Collin County).*

*In the application of our precedents to District 30, our disagreement
with Justice Stevens' dissent, post, at 1014-1031, is largely factual. In
reviewing the District Court's findings of primary fact, we cannot ignore
the reality that the District Court heard several days of testimony and
argument and became significantly more familiar with the factual details
of this suit than this Court can be. We therefore believe that the dissent
errs in second-guessing the District Court's assessment of the witnesses'
testimony, see post, at 1025, n. 24, and in dismissing as mere "fine tuning,"
post, at 1030, the practice of using race as a proxy that the District Court
found, based on ample evidence, to be pervasive, see Vera v. Richards, 861
F. Supp 1304, 1322 (SD Tex. 1994).

For the same reason, we decline to debate the dissent on every factual
nuance on which it diverges from the District Court's, and our, view. But
two of its specific claims about District 30 merit a response. First, the
dissent asserts that "[a] comparison of the 1992 precinct results with a

depiction of the proportion of black population in each census block reveals
that Democratic-leaning precincts cover a far greater area [of District 30]

517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT
972 BUSH v. VERA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The combination of these factors compels us to agree withthe District Court that "the contours of Congressional District 30 are unexplainable in terms other than race." 861F. Supp., at 1339. It is true that District 30 does not evince
a consistent, single-minded effort to "segregate" voters onthe basis of race,

post, at 1023 (Stevens, J., dissenting), anddoes not represent "apartheid," post, at 1054, 1074 (

Souter,
J., dissenting). But the fact that racial data were used incomplex ways, and for multiple objectives, does not mean

that race did not predominate over other considerations.The record discloses intensive and pervasive use of race both

than majority-black census blocks." Post, at 1030 (emphasis added).
While that may be true, the dissent's reliance on 1992 election results is
misplaced. Those results were not before the legislature when it drew
the district lines in 1991, and may well reflect the popularity and campaign
success of Representative Johnson more than the party political predispositions of the district's residents. (The same error infects the dissent's
discussion of the Collin County hook, post, at 1020-1021, n. 19 (relying on
1992 election results).) And looking at totals, rather than at the difference between areas just inside and just outside the district lines, is misleading: Race may predominate in the drawing of district lines because
those lines are finely drawn to maximize the minority composition of the
district, notwithstanding that in an overwhelmingly Democratic area, the
total of Democrats in the district far exceeds its total minority population.

Second, the dissent suggests that strict scrutiny should not apply because District 30's compact core has a higher African-American population
percentage than its wayward tentacles. Post, at 1021-1023. In doing so,
it again ignores the necessity of determining whether race predominated
in the redistricters' actions in light of what they had to work with. Once
various adjacent majority-minority populations had been carved away
from it by the use of race as a proxy to enhance the electoral chances of
neighboring incumbents, the core of District 30 was substantially too small
to form an entire district. The principal question faced by the redistricters was, therefore, what territory to add to the core out of the remainder
of the Dallas area, which remainder has an average African-American
population substantially below the 21% county average. In answering
that question, as the District Court explained and the maps bear witness,
the redistricters created bizarre, far-reaching tentacles that intricately
and consistently maximize the available remaining African-American
population.

as a proxy to protect the political fortunes of adjacent incum-bents, and for its own sake in maximizing the minority population of District 30 regardless of traditional districting prin-ciples. District 30's combination of a bizarre, noncompact
shape and overwhelming evidence that that shape was essen-tially dictated by racial considerations of one form or another
is exceptional; Texas Congressional District 6, for example,which

Justice Stevens discusses in detail, post, at 1019-1020, has only the former characteristic. That combination

of characteristics leads us to conclude that District 30 is sub-ject to strict scrutiny.

In Harris County, centered on the city of Houston, Dis-tricts 18 and 29 interlock "like a jigsaw puzzle . . . in which

it might be impossible to get the pieces apart." Barone &Ujifusa, Almanac of American Politics 1996, at 1307-1308; see
also Appendixes B and C to this opinion (outlines of Districts18, 29). As the District Court noted: "[T]hese districts are
so finely `crafted' that one cannot visualize their exactboundaries without looking at a map at least three feet
square." 861 F. Supp., at 1323. According to the leadingstatistical study of relative district compactness and regularity, they are two of the three least regular districts in thecountry. See Pildes & Niemi, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 565.

District 18's population is 51% African-American and 15%Hispanic. App. 110. It "has some of the most irregular
boundaries of any congressional district in the country[,] . . .boundaries that squiggle north toward Intercontinental Airport and northwest out radial highways, then spurt southon one side toward the port and on the other toward the
Astrodome." Barone & Ujifusa, supra, at 1307. Its "manynarrow corridors, wings, or fingers . . . reach out to enclose
black voters, while excluding nearby Hispanic residents."Pildes & Niemi, supra, at 556.

District 29 has a 61% Hispanic and 10% African-Americanpopulation. App. 110. It resembles

Ujifusa, supra, at 1335.
Not only are the shapes of the districts bizarre; they alsoexhibit utter disregard of city limits, local election precincts,

and voter tabulation district lines. See, e. g., 861 F. Supp.,at 1340 (60% of District 18 and District 29 residents live in
split precincts). This caused a severe disruption of tradi-tional forms of political activity. Campaigners seeking to
visit their constituents "had to carry a map to identify thedistrict lines, because so often the borders would move from
block to block"; voters "did not know the candidates runningfor office" because they did not know which district they
lived in. Ibid. In light of Texas' requirement that votingbe arranged by precinct, with each precinct representing
a community that shares local, state, and federal represen-tatives, it also created administrative headaches for local
election officials:

"The effect of splitting dozens of [voter tabulationdistricts] to create Districts 18 and 29 was an electoral

nightmare. Harris County estimated that it must in-crease its number of precincts from 672 to 1,225 to accommodate the new Congressional boundaries. Pollingplaces, ballot forms, and the number of election employees are correspondingly multiplied. Voters were thrustinto new and unfamiliar precinct alignments, a few with
populations as low as 20 voters." Id., at 1325.

traditions); id., at 147 (map showing splitting of city limits);
id., at 128, Plaintiffs' Exh. 6E1, Attachment A (map illustrating splitting of voting precincts).As with District 30, appellants adduced evidence that incumbency protection played a role in determining the bizarre
district lines. The District Court found that one constrainton the shape of District 29 was the rival ambitions of its two

"functional incumbents," who distorted its boundaries in aneffort to include larger areas of their existing state legislative constituencies. 861 F. Supp., at 1340. But the DistrictCourt's findings amply demonstrate that such influences
were overwhelmed in the determination of the districts'
bizarre shapes by the State's efforts to maximize racial
divisions. The State's VRA $ 5 submission explains that the
bizarre configuration of Districts 18 and 29 "result[s] in the
maximization of minority voting strength" in Harris County,
App. 110, corroborating the District Court's finding that "[i]n
the earliest stages of the Congressional redistricting process,
state Democratic and Republican leaders rallied behind the
idea of creating a new Hispanic safe seat in Harris County
while preserving the safe African-American seat in District
18." 861 F. Supp., at 1324. State officials testified that "it
was particularly necessary to split [voter tabulation districts]
in order to capture pockets of Hispanic residents" for District 29, and that a 61% Hispanic population in that district--
not a mere majority--was insisted upon. Id., at 1340-1341.
The record evidence of the racial demographics and voting
patterns of Harris County residents belies any suggestion
that party politics could explain the dividing lines between
the two districts: The district lines correlate almost perfectly
with race, see App. 151-152, while both districts are similarly
solidly Democratic, see id., at 194. And, even more than in
District 30, the intricacy of the lines drawn, separating Hispanic voters from African-American voters on a block-byblock basis, betrays the critical impact of the block-by-block
racial data available on the REDAPPL program. The Dis517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

trict Court's conclusion is, therefore, inescapable: "BecauseDistricts 18 and 29 are formed in utter disregard for traditional redistricting criteria and because their shapes are ulti-mately unexplainable on grounds other than the racial quotas
established for those districts, they are the product of [pre-sumptively] unconstitutional racial gerrymandering." 861
F. Supp., at 1341. III

Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies, we must de-termine whether the racial classifications embodied in any of
the three districts are narrowly tailored to further a compel-ling state interest. Appellants point to three compelling interests: the interest in avoiding liability under the "results"test of VRA $ 2(b), the interest in remedying past and present racial discrimination, and the "nonretrogression" principle of VRA $ 5 (for District 18 only). We consider them in
turn. A

Section 2(a) of the VRA prohibits the imposition of any
electoral practice or procedure that "results in a denial or
abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on accountof race or color." In 1982, Congress amended the VRA by

changing the language of $ 2(a) and adding $ 2(b), which pro-vides a "results" test for violation of $ 2(a). A violation
exists if,

"based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that
the political processes leading to nomination or electionin the State or political subdivision are not equally open

to participation by members of a class of citizens pro-tected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of theelectorate to participate in the political process and
to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Appellants contend that creation of each of the three
majority-minority districts at issue was justified by Texas'
compelling state interest in complying with this results test.

As we have done in each of our previous cases in which
this argument has been raised as a defense to charges of
racial gerrymandering, we assume without deciding that
compliance with the results test, as interpreted by our precedents, see, e. g., Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 37-42 (1993),
can be a compelling state interest. See Shaw II, ante, at
915; Miller, 515 U. S., at 920-921. We also reaffirm that the
"narrow tailoring" requirement of strict scrutiny allows the
States a limited degree of leeway in furthering such interests. If the State has a "strong basis in evidence," Shaw
I, 509 U. S., at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted), for
concluding that creation of a majority-minority district is
reasonably necessary to comply with $ 2, and the districting
that is based on race "substantially addresses the $ 2 violation," Shaw II, ante, at 918, it satisfies strict scrutiny. We
thus reject, as impossibly stringent, the District Court's
view of the narrow tailoring requirement, that "a district
must have the least possible amount of irregularity in shape,
making allowances for traditional districting criteria." 861
F. Supp., at 1343. Cf. Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476
U. S. 267, 291 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (state actors should not be "trapped
between the competing hazards of liability" by the imposition
of unattainable requirements under the rubric of strict
scrutiny).

A $ 2 district that is reasonably compact and regular, taking into account traditional districting principles such as
maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries, may pass strict scrutiny without having to defeat rival
compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts in endless
"beauty contests." The dissenters misread us when they
make the leap from our disagreement about the facts of this

suit to the conclusion that we are creating a "stalemate" byrequiring the States to "get things just right," post, at 1063

(Souter, J., dissenting), or to draw "the precise compact dis-trict that a court would impose in a successful $ 2 challenge,"
post, at 1035 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also Shaw II,
ante, at 949 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Rather, we adhere toour longstanding recognition of the importance in our federal

system of each State's sovereign interest in implementing itsredistricting plan. See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146,
156 (1993) ("[I]t is the domain of the States, and not the fed-eral courts, to conduct apportionment in the first place");
Miller, supra, at 915 ("It is well settled that reapportion-ment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State")
(internal quotation marks omitted). Under our cases, theStates retain a flexibility that federal courts enforcing $ 2
lack, both insofar as they may avoid strict scrutiny alto-gether by respecting their own traditional districting principles, and insofar as deference is due to their reasonable fearsof, and to their reasonable efforts to avoid, $ 2 liability. And
nothing that we say today should be read as limiting "aState's discretion to apply traditional districting principles,"
post, at 1046 (Souter, J., dissenting), in majority-minority,as in other, districts. The constitutional problem arises only
from the subordination of those principles to race.Strict scrutiny remains, nonetheless, strict. The State
must have a "strong basis in evidence" for finding that the
threshold conditions for $ 2 liability are present:

"first, `that [the minority group] is sufficiently large and
geographically compact to constitute a majority in a
single member district'; second, `that it is politically
cohesive'; and third, `that the white majority votessufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat

the minority's preferred candidate.' " Growe, supra, at40 (emphasis added) (quoting

Thornburg v. Gingles, 478
U. S. 30, 50-51 (1986)).

979Cite as: 517 U. S. 952 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
And, as we have noted above, the district drawn in order to
satisfy $ 2 must not subordinate traditional districting principles to race substantially more than is "reasonably necessary" to avoid $ 2 liability. Districts 18, 29, and 30 fail to
meet these requirements.

We assume, without deciding, that the State had a "strong
basis in evidence" for finding the second and third threshold
conditions for $ 2 liability to be present. We have, however,
already found that all three districts are bizarrely shaped
and far from compact, and that those characteristics are predominantly attributable to gerrymandering that was racially
motivated and/or achieved by the use of race as a proxy.
See Part II, supra. District 30, for example, reaches out
to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities
which, based on the evidence presented, could not possibly
form part of a compact majority-minority district, and does
so in order to make up for minority populations closer to its
core that it shed in a further suspect use of race as a proxy
to further neighboring incumbents' interests. See supra, at
965-966, 969-973.

These characteristics defeat any claim that the districts
are narrowly tailored to serve the State's interest in avoiding
liability under $ 2, because $ 2 does not require a State to
create, on predominantly racial lines, a district that is not
"reasonably compact." See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S.
997, 1008 (1994). If, because of the dispersion of the minority population, a reasonably compact majority-minority district cannot be created, $ 2 does not require a majorityminority district; if a reasonably compact district can be
created, nothing in $ 2 requires the race-based creation of a
district that is far from compact.

Appellants argue that bizarre shaping and noncompactness do not raise narrow tailoring concerns. Appellants Lawson et al. claim that under Shaw I and Miller,
"[s]hape is relevant only as evidence of an improper motive."

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Brief for Appellants Lawson et al. 56. They rely on ourstatement in

Miller:

"Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a neces-sary element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold

requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasivecircumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and
not other districting principles, was the legislature'sdominant and controlling rationale in drawing its
district lines." 515 U. S., at 913.
The United States takes a more moderate position, accepting
that in the context of narrow tailoring, "consideration mustbe given to the extent to which the districts drawn by a

State substantially depart from its customary redistrictingpractices," Brief for United States 36, but asserting that insofar as bizarreness and noncompactness are necessary to
achieve the State's compelling interest in compliance with $ 2"while simultaneously achieving other legitimate redistricting goals," id., at 37, such as incumbency protection, the nar-rowly tailoring requirement is satisfied. Similarly,

Justice
Stevens' dissent argues that "noncompact districts should. . . be a permissible method of avoiding violations of [$ 2]."

Post, at 1034.These arguments cannot save the districts before us. The
Lawson appellants misinterpret Miller: District shape is not
irrelevant to the narrow tailoring inquiry. Our discussion in
Miller served only to emphasize that the ultimate constitutional values at stake involve the harms caused by the useof unjustified racial classifications, and that bizarreness is not

necessary to trigger strict scrutiny. See Miller, 515 U. S.,
at 912-913. Significant deviations from traditional districting principles, such as the bizarre shape and noncompactness
demonstrated by the districts here, cause constitutional
harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial. For example, the
bizarre shaping of Districts 18 and 29, cutting across pre517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

981Cite as: 517 U. S. 952 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
existing precinct lines and other natural or traditional divi-sions, is not merely evidentially significant; it is part of the

constitutional problem insofar as it disrupts nonracial basesof political identity and thus intensifies the emphasis on race.

Nor is the United States' argument availing here. In de-termining that strict scrutiny applies here, we agreed with
the District Court that in fact the bizarre shaping and non-compactness of these districts were predominantly attributable to racial, not political, manipulation. The UnitedStates' argument, and that of the dissent,

post, at 1033-1035(
Stevens, J., dissenting), address the case of an otherwisecompact majority-minority district that is misshapen by predominantly nonracial, political manipulation. See also post,at 1068 (

Souter, J., dissenting) (raising "the possibility thata State could create a majority-minority district that does

not coincide with the Gingles shape so long as racial dataare not overused"). We disagree with the factual premise of
Justice Stevens' dissent, that these districts were drawnusing "racial considerations only in a way reasonably designed" to avoid a $ 2 violation, post, at 1035. The districtsbefore us exhibit a level of racial manipulation that exceeds
what $ 2 could justify. B

The United States and the State next contend that thedistrict lines at issue are justified by the State's compelling
interest in "ameliorating the effects of racially polarized vot-ing attributable to past and present racial discrimination."
Brief for United States 32; Brief for Appellants Bush et al.24-25. In support of that contention, they cite Texas' long
history of discrimination against minorities in electoral proc-esses, stretching from the Reconstruction to modern times,
including violations of the Constitution and of the VRA.See,

e. g., Williams v. Dallas, 734 F. Supp. 1317 (ND Tex.1990); White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973); Terry v.

Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.649 (1944); Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73 (1932); Nixon v.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Herndon, 273 U. S. 536 (1927); see also 861 F. Supp., at 1317(because of its history of official discrimination, Texas became a covered jurisdiction under VRA $ 5 in 1975, and theDepartment of Justice has since "frequently interposed objections against the State and its subdivisions"). Appellantsattempt to link that history to evidence that in recent elections in majority-minority districts, "Anglos usually blocvoted against" Hispanic and African-American candidates.
Ibid.A State's interest in remedying discrimination is compelling when two conditions are satisfied. First, the discrimi-nation that the State seeks to remedy must be specific, "identified discrimination"; second, the State "must have had a`strong basis in evidence' to conclude that remedial action
was necessary, `before it embarks on an affirmative actionprogram.' " Shaw II, ante, at 910 (citations omitted).
Here, the only current problem that appellants cite as in needof remediation is alleged vote dilution as a consequence of
racial bloc voting, the same concern that underlies theirVRA $ 2 compliance defense, which we have assumed to be
valid for purposes of this opinion. We have indicated thatsuch problems will not justify race-based districting unless
"the State employ[s] sound districting principles, and . . . theaffected racial group's residential patterns afford the opportunity of creating districts in which they will be in the major-ity."

Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 657 (internal quotation marksomitted). Once that standard is applied, our agreement

with the District Court's finding that these districts are notnarrowly tailored to comply with $ 2 forecloses this line of
defense. C

The final contention offered by the State and private ap-pellants is that creation of District 18 (only) was justified by
a compelling state interest in complying with VRA $ 5. Wehave made clear that $ 5 has a limited substantive goal: " `to
insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minori-ties with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral

franchise.' " Miller, 515 U. S., at 926 (quoting Beer v. UnitedStates, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976)). Appellants contend that
this "nonretrogression" principle is implicated because Har-ris County had, for two decades, contained a congressional
district in which African-American voters had succeeded inselecting representatives of their choice, all of whom were
African-Americans.The problem with the State's argument is that it seeks to
justify not maintenance, but substantial augmentation, of theAfrican-American population percentage in District 18. At
the previous redistricting, in 1980, District 18's populationwas 40.8% African-American. Plaintiffs' Exh. 13B, p. 55.
As a result of Hispanic population increases and African-American emigration from the district, its population had
reached 35.1% African-American and 42.2% Hispanic at thetime of the 1990 census. The State has shown no basis for
concluding that the increase to a 50.9% African-Americanpopulation in 1991 was necessary to ensure nonretrogression.
Nonretrogression is not a license for the State to do what-ever it deems necessary to ensure continued electoral

suc-cess; it merely mandates that the minority's opportunity to

elect representatives of its choice not be diminished, directlyor indirectly, by the State's actions. We anticipated this
problem in Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 655: "A reapportionmentplan would not be narrowly tailored to the goal of avoiding
retrogression if the State went beyond what was reasonablynecessary to avoid retrogression." Applying that principle,
it is clear that District 18 is not narrowly tailored to theavoidance of $ 5 liability.

IV
The dissents make several further arguments against to-day's decision, none of which address the specifics of this

case. We have responded to these points previously. Justice Souter, for example, reiterates his contention from

517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT
984 BUSH v. VERA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Shaw I that because districts created with a view to satisfy-ing $ 2 do not involve "racial subjugation,"

post, at 1055, and
may in a sense be " `benign[ly]' " motivated, Shaw I, 509U. S., at 685 (

Souter, J., dissenting), strict scrutiny should
not apply to them. We rejected that argument in Shaw I,
and we reject it now. As we explained then, see id., at 653,we subject racial classifications to strict scrutiny precisely

because that scrutiny is necessary to determine whetherthey are benign--as

Justice Stevens' hypothetical of a
targeted outreach program to protect victims of sickle cellanemia, see

post, at 1032, would, no doubt, be--or whether
they misuse race and foster harmful and divisive stereotypes without a compelling justification. We see no need to
revisit our prior debates.

Both dissents contend that the recognition of the Shaw I
cause of action threatens public respect for, and the independence of, the Federal Judiciary by inserting the courts
deep into the districting process. We believe that the dissents both exaggerate the dangers involved, and fail to recognize the implications of their suggested retreat from
Shaw I.

As to the dangers of judicial entanglement, Justice Stevens' dissent makes much of cases stemming from state districting plans originally drawn up before Shaw I, in which
problems have arisen from the uncertainty in the law prior
to and during its gradual clarification in Shaw I, Miller, and
today's cases. See post, at 1037-1038 (Stevens, J., dissenting). We are aware of the difficulties faced by the States,
and by the district courts, in confronting new constitutional
precedents, and we also know that the nature of the expressive harms with which we are dealing, and the complexity of
the districting process, are such that bright-line rules are
not available. But we believe that today's decisions, which
both illustrate the defects that offend the principles of Shaw
I and reemphasize the importance of the States' discretion
in the redistricting process, see supra, at 978-979, will serve

985Cite as: 517 U. S. 952 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
to clarify the States' responsibilities. The States havetraditionally guarded their sovereign districting prerogatives jealously, and we are confident that they can fulfillthat requirement, leaving the courts to their customary and
appropriate backstop role.

This Court has now rendered decisions after plenary con-sideration in five cases applying the

Shaw I doctrine (Shaw
I, Miller, Hays, Shaw II, and this suit). The dissenterswould have us abandon those precedents, suggesting that

fundamental concerns relating to the judicial role are atstake. See

post, at 1035, 1038, 1041 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 1047, and n. 2, 1052, 1064, 1074, 1076-1077 (Souter, J., dissenting); Shaw II, ante, at 919-920, 922-923, and
n. 3, 929 (Stevens, J., dissenting); but see ante, at 932-933
(noting that the judicial task of distinguishing race-based
from non-race-based action in Shaw I cases is far from
unique). While we agree that those concerns are implicated
here, we believe they point the other way. Our legitimacy
requires, above all, that we adhere to stare decisis, especially
in such sensitive political contexts as the present, where partisan controversy abounds. Legislators and district courts
nationwide have modified their practices--or, rather, reembraced the traditional districting practices that were almost
universally followed before the 1990 census--in response to
Shaw I. Those practices and our precedents, which acknowledge voters as more than mere racial statistics, play
an important role in defining the political identity of the
American voter. Our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence evinces a commitment to eliminate unnecessary and
excessive governmental use and reinforcement of racial stereotypes. See, e. g., Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 59
(1992) ("[T]he exercise of a peremptory challenge must not
be based on either the race of the juror or the racial stereotypes held by the party"); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete
Co., 500 U. S. 614, 630-631 (1991) ("If our society is to continue to progress as a multiracial democracy, it must recog517us3$68j 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

nize that the automatic invocation of race stereotypes re-tards that progress and causes continued hurt and injury");

Powers, 499 U. S., at 410 ("We may not accept as a defenseto racial discrimination the very stereotype the law condemns"); Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 484, n. 2 (1990)("[A] prosecutor's `assumption that a black juror may be presumed to be partial simply because he is black' . . . violatesthe Equal Protection Clause");

Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S.79, 104 (1986) ("[T]he Equal Protection Clause prohibits a

State from taking any action based on crude, inaccurate ra-cial stereotypes"). We decline to retreat from that commitment today. * * *

The judgment of the District Court is

Affirmed.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I write separately to express my view on two points.First, compliance with the results test of $ 2 of the Voting

Rights Act (VRA) is a compelling state interest. Second,that test can coexist in principle and in practice with

Shawv. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993), and its progeny, as elaborated

in today's opinions. I

As stated in the plurality opinion, ante, at 977 (O'Connor,
J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, J.), this Courthas thus far assumed without deciding that compliance with

the results test of VRA $ 2(b) is a compelling state interest.See Shaw v. Hunt, ante, at 915 (Shaw II); Miller v. Johnson,
515 U. S. 900, 920-921 (1995). Although that assumption isnot determinative of the Court's decisions today, I believe
that States and lower courts are entitled to more definiteguidance as they toil with the twin demands of the Fourteenth Amendment and the VRA.The results test is violated if,

"based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown thatthe political processes leading to nomination or election
in the State or political subdivision are not equally opento participation by members of [

e. g., a racial minoritygroup] in that its members have less opportunity than

other members of the electorate to participate in thepolitical process and to elect representatives of their
choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b).
In the 14 years since the enactment of $ 2(b), we haveinterpreted and enforced the obligations that it places on

States in a succession of cases, assuming but never directlyaddressing its constitutionality. See Johnson v. De Grandy,
512 U. S. 997 (1994); Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874 (1994);Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 (1993); Growe v. Emison,

South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301 (1966) (upholding the original VRA as a valid exercise of Congress' power
under $ 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 477 (1980) (Katzenbach and its successors

enforce the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition against
denying a citizen the right to vote `on account of race' ").

Against this background, it would be irresponsible for
a State to disregard the $ 2 results test. The Supremacy
Clause obliges the States to comply with all constitutional

exercises of Congress' power. See U. S. Const., Art. VI,
cl. 2. Statutes are presumed constitutional, see, e. g., Fairbank v. United States, 181 U. S. 283, 285 (1901), and that
presumption appears strong here in light of the weight of
authority affirming the results test's constitutionality. In
addition, fundamental concerns of federalism mandate that
States be given some leeway so that they are not "trapped
between the competing hazards of liability." Wygant v.
Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 291 (1986) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring). We should allow States to assume the constitutionality of $ 2 of the VRA, including the 1982 amendments.

This conclusion is bolstered by concerns of respect for the
authority of Congress under the Reconstruction Amendments. See City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156,
179 (1980). The results test of $ 2 is an important part of
the apparatus chosen by Congress to effectuate this Nation's
commitment "to confront its conscience and fulfill the guarantee of the Constitution" with respect to equality in voting.
S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 4 (1982). Congress considered the test
"necessary and appropriate to ensure full protection of the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments rights." Id., at 27.
It believed that without the results test, nothing could be
done about "overwhelming evidence of unequal access to the
electoral system," id., at 26, or about "voting practices and
procedures [that] perpetuate the effects of past purposeful
discrimination," id., at 40. And it founded those beliefs on
the sad reality that "there still are some communities in our
Nation where racial politics do dominate the electoral process." Id., at 33. Respect for those legislative conclusions
mandates that the $ 2 results test be accepted and applied
unless and until current lower court precedent is reversed
and it is held unconstitutional.

In my view, therefore, the States have a compelling interest in complying with the results test as this Court has
interpreted it.

II
Although I agree with the dissenters about $ 2's role aspart of our national commitment to racial equality, I differ

from them in my belief that that commitment can and mustbe reconciled with the complementary commitment of our
Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence to eliminate the un-justified use of racial stereotypes. At the same time that
we combat the symptoms of racial polarization in politics, wemust strive to eliminate unnecessary race-based state action
that appears to endorse the disease.Today's decisions, in conjunction with the recognition of
the compelling state interest in compliance with the reason-ably perceived requirements of $ 2, present a workable
framework for the achievement of these twin goals. I wouldsummarize that framework, and the rules governing the
States' consideration of race in the districting process, asfollows.

First, so long as they do not subordinate traditional dis-tricting criteria to the use of race for its own sake or as
a proxy, States may intentionally create majority-minoritydistricts, and may otherwise take race into consideration,
without coming under strict scrutiny. See ante, at 958-959(plurality opinion);

post, at 1008-1011, and n. 8, 1025 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 1056, 1065, 1073 (Souter, J.,dissenting). Only if traditional districting criteria are neglected and that neglect is predominantly due to the misuseof race does strict scrutiny apply. Ante, at 962, 964, 978
(plurality opinion).Second, where voting is racially polarized, $ 2 prohibits
States from adopting districting schemes that would havethe effect that minority voters "have less opportunity than
other members of the electorate to . . . elect representativesof their choice." $ 2(b). That principle may require a State
to create a majority-minority district where the three
Gingles factors are present--viz., (i) the minority group "issufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a

517us3$68x 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., concurring
majority in a single-member district," (ii) "it is politicallycohesive," and (iii) "the white majority votes sufficiently as a

bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferredcandidate,"

Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50-51.
Third, the state interest in avoiding liability under VRA

$ 2 is compelling. See supra, at 990-992; post, at 1033 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 1065 (Souter, J., dissenting).
If a State has a strong basis in evidence for concluding thatthe

Gingles factors are present, it may create a majorityminority district without awaiting judicial findings. Its"strong basis in evidence" need not take any particular form,

although it cannot simply rely on generalized assumptions
about the prevalence of racial bloc voting.

Fourth, if a State pursues that compelling interest by creating a district that "substantially addresses" the potential
liability, Shaw II, ante, at 918, and does not deviate substantially from a hypothetical court-drawn $ 2 district for predominantly racial reasons, cf. ante, at 979 (plurality opinion)
(explaining how District 30 fails to satisfy these criteria), its
districting plan will be deemed narrowly tailored. Cf. ante,
at 981 (plurality opinion) (acknowledging this possibility);
post, at 1068 (Souter, J., dissenting) (same); post, at 1033-
1035 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (contending that it is applicable here).

Finally, however, districts that are bizarrely shaped and
noncompact, and that otherwise neglect traditional districting principles and deviate substantially from the hypothetical court-drawn district, for predominantly racial reasons,
are unconstitutional. See ante, at 979 (plurality opinion).

District 30 illustrates the application of these principles.
Dallas County has a history of racially polarized voting.
See, e. g., White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755, 765-767 (1973);
Lipscomb v. Wise, 399 F. Supp. 782, 785-786 (ND Tex. 1975),
rev'd, 551 F. 2d 1043 (CA5 1977), rev'd, 437 U. S. 535 (1978).
One year before the redistricting at issue here, a District
Court invalidated under $ 2 the Dallas City Council election

scheme, finding racial polarization and that candidates preferred by African-American voters were consistently defeated. See Williams v. Dallas, 734 F. Supp. 1317, 1387-
1394 (ND Tex. 1990). Expert testimony in this litigation
also confirmed the existence of racially polarized voting in
and around Dallas County. 4 Tr. 187; see also App. 227.
With respect to geographical compactness, the record contains two quite different possible designs for District 30, the
original Johnson Plan, id., at 139, and the Owens-Pate Plan,
id., at 141, that are reasonably compact and include, respectively, 44% and 45.6% African-American populations. This
evidence provided a strong basis for Texas' belief that the
creation of a majority-minority district was appropriate.
But Texas allowed race to dominate the drawing of District
30 to the almost total exclusion of nonracial districting considerations, and ultimately produced a district that, because
of the misuse of race as a proxy in addition to legitimate
efforts to satisfy $ 2, is bizarrely shaped and far from compact. See ante, at 965-966, 969-973, and n. (plurality opinion); compare post, at 1014-1032 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
It thus came under strict scrutiny and failed the narrow tailoring test.

As the disagreement among Members of this Court over
District 30 shows, the application of the principles that I
have outlined sometimes requires difficult exercises of judgment. That difficulty is inevitable. The VRA requires the
States and the courts to take action to remedy the reality of
racial inequality in our political system, sometimes necessitating race-based action, while the Fourteenth Amendment
requires us to look with suspicion on the excessive use of
racial considerations by the government. But I believe that
the States, playing a primary role, and the courts, in their
secondary role, are capable of distinguishing the appropriate
and reasonably necessary uses of race from its unjustified
and excessive uses.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I join the plurality opinion, but the statements in Part IIof the opinion that strict scrutiny would not apply to all cases

of intentional creation of majority-minority districts, ante, at958, 962-963, require comment. Those statements are unnecessary to our decision, for strict scrutiny applies here. Ido not consider these dicta to commit me to any position on
the question whether race is predominant whenever a State,in redistricting, foreordains that one race be the majority in
a certain number of districts or in a certain part of the State.In my view, we would no doubt apply strict scrutiny if a
State decreed that certain districts had to be at least 50 per-cent white, and our analysis should be no different if the
State so favors minority races.We need not answer this question here, for there is ample
evidence that otherwise demonstrates the predominance ofrace in Texas' redistricting, as the plurality shows,

ante, at958-976. And this question was not at issue in DeWitt v.

Wilson, 856 F. Supp. 1409 (ED Cal. 1994), summarily aff 'd inpart and dism'd in part, 515 U. S. 1170 (1995). (I note that
our summary affirmance in DeWitt stands for no propositionother than that the districts reviewed there were constitutional. We do not endorse the reasoning of the district courtwhen we order summary affirmance of the judgment.

Man-del v. Bradley, 432 U. S. 173, 176 (1977) (per curiam); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 (1974).)On the narrow-tailoring issue, I agree that the districts
challenged here were not reasonably necessary to serve theassumed compelling state interest in complying with $ 2 of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. As theplurality opinion indicates,

ante, at 978, in order for compli-ance with $ 2 to be a compelling interest, the State must have

a strong basis in the evidence for believing that all three ofthe threshold conditions for a $ 2 claim are met:

"[F]irst, `that [the minority group] is sufficiently largeand geographically compact to constitute a majority in

a single-member district'; second, `that it is politicallycohesive'; and third, `that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat theminority's preferred candidate.' " Growe v. Emison,
507 U. S. 25, 40 (1993), quoting Thornburg v. Gingles,478 U. S. 30, 50-51 (1986).

The first Gingles condition refers to the compactness of theminority population, not to the compactness of the contested
district. As the plurality observes: "If, because of the dis-persion of the minority population, a reasonably compact
majority-minority district cannot be created, $ 2 does not re-quire a majority-minority district . . . ."

Ante, at 979. Wemay assume, as the plurality does expressly, ibid., that there

was sufficient evidence of racial polarization to fulfill the sec-ond and third Gingles conditions, and we may assume, as
must be done to reach the narrow-tailoring question, thatthe African-American and Hispanic populations in Harris
County and the African-American population in DallasCounty were each concentrated enough to form a majority
in a reasonably compact district, thereby meeting the first
Gingles condition.If a State has the assumed compelling interest in avoiding

$ 2 liability, it still must tailor its districts narrowly to servethat interest. "[T]he districting that is based on race [must]
`substantially addres[s] the $ 2 violation.' " Ante, at 977(quoting

Shaw v. Hunt, ante, at 918 (Shaw II)). The Statemay not engage in districting based on race except as reasonably necessary to cure the anticipated $ 2 violation, nor mayit use race as a proxy to serve other interests. Ante, at 979.
The plurality gives as an example of the former the fact that"District 30 . . . reaches out to grab small and apparently
isolated minority communities which, based on the evidencepresented, could not possibly form part of a compact
majority-minority district." Ibid. (referring to tentacles ofDistrict 30 that coil around outlying African-American
communities in Collin and Tarrant Counties, ante, at 965-

966). And, as the plurality further holds in a portion of its
predominant-factor analysis that is central to the narrowtailoring inquiry, District 30 also involved the illicit use of
race as a proxy when legislators shifted blocs of AfricanAmerican voters to districts of incumbent Democrats in
order to promote partisan interests. See ante, at 968-970.

Narrow tailoring is absent in Districts 18 and 29 as well.
Although the State could have drawn either a majorityAfrican-American or majority-Hispanic district in Harris
County without difficulty, there is no evidence that two reasonably compact majority-minority districts could have been
drawn there. Of the major alternative plans considered
below, only the Owens-Pate plan drew majority-AfricanAmerican and majority-Hispanic districts in Harris County,
App. 142, but those districts were not compact. Section 2
does not require the State to create two noncompact
majority-minority districts just because a compact district
could be drawn for either minority independently. See ante,
at 979 ("$ 2 does not require a State to create, on predominantly racial lines, a district that is not `reasonably compact' "); Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1024 (1994)
(affirming, upon a finding of no vote dilution, District Court
decision not to give $ 2 remedies to both African-Americans
and Hispanics because population overlap made the remedies
mutually exclusive). The race-based districting that the
State performed in drawing Districts 18, 29, and 30 was not
justified by $ 2, or indeed by any other compelling interest,
either real or assumed. That itself suffices to defeat the
State's claim that those three districts were narrowly tailored. Shaw II, ante, at 915-918. (In this respect, I disagree with the apparent suggestion in Justice O'Connor's
separate concurrence that a court should conduct a second
predominant-factor inquiry in deciding whether a district
was narrowly tailored, see ante, at 994. There is nothing in

the plurality opinion or any opinion of the Court to support
that proposition. The simple question is whether the racebased districting was reasonably necessary to serve a compelling interest.)

While $ 2 does not require a noncompact majority-minority
district, neither does it forbid it, provided that the rationale
for creating it is proper in the first instance. Districts not
drawn for impermissible reasons or according to impermissible criteria may take any shape, even a bizarre one. States
are not prevented from taking into account race-neutral factors in drawing permissible majority-minority districts. If,
however, the bizarre shape of the district is attributable to
race-based districting unjustified by a compelling interest
(e. g., gratuitous race-based districting or use of race as a
proxy for other interests), such districts may "cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political
identity is, or should be, predominantly racial," ante, at 980.
While districts "may pass strict scrutiny without having to
defeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts
in endless `beauty contests,' " ante, at 977, the District Court
was right to declare unconstitutional the egregious, unjustified race-based districting that occurred here.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
concurring in the judgment.

In my view, application of strict scrutiny in this suit
was never a close question. I cannot agree with Justice
O'Connor's assertion that strict scrutiny is not invoked by
the intentional creation of majority-minority districts. See
ante, at 958. Though Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 649 (1993)
(Shaw I), expressly reserved that question, we effectively
resolved it in subsequent cases. Only last Term, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995), we
vigorously asserted that all governmental racial classifica517us3$68n 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

tions must be strictly scrutinized.1 And in Miller v. John-son, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), Georgia's concession that it intentionally created majority-minority districts was sufficient toshow that race was a predominant, motivating factor in its
redistricting. Id., at 918-919.Strict scrutiny applies to all governmental classifications
based on race, and we have expressly held that there isno exception for race-based redistricting.

Id., at 913-915;Shaw I, supra, at 643-647. While we have recognized the

evidentiary difficulty of proving that a redistricting plan is,in fact, a racial gerrymander, see Miller, supra, at 916-917;
Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 646-647, we have never suggested thata racial gerrymander is subject to anything less than strict
scrutiny. See id., at 646 ("The difficulty of proof, of course,does not mean that a racial gerrymander, once established,
should receive less scrutiny under the Equal ProtectionClause than other state legislation classifying citizens by
race").In

Shaw I, we noted that proving a racial gerrymander"sometimes will not be difficult at all,"

ibid., and suggestedthat evidence of a highly irregular shape or disregard for

traditional race-neutral districting principles could suffice toinvoke strict scrutiny. We clarified in Miller that a plaintiff
may rely on both circumstantial and direct evidence and saidthat a plaintiff "must prove that the legislature subordinated
traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racialconsiderations." 515 U. S., at 916. The shape of Georgia's

the Federal Government as well as to those by the States. For quite
some time, however, we have consistently held that race-based classifications by the States must be strictly scrutinized. See, e. g., Richmond v.
J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493-494 (1989) (plurality opinion); id., at

a racial gerrymander, but there was other evidence thatshowed that the legislature was motivated by a "predominant, overriding desire" to create a third majority-black dis-trict. That evidence was the State's own concession that the
legislature had intentionally created an additional majorityblack district. See id., at 918-919. On that record, wefound that the District Court could not have "reached any

conclusion other than that race was the predominant factorin drawing Georgia's Eleventh District."

Id., at 918.
We have said that impermissible racial classifications donot follow inevitably from a legislature's mere awareness of

racial demographics. See id., at 916; Shaw I, supra, at 646.
But the intentional creation of a majority-minority district
certainly means more than mere awareness that application
of traditional, race-neutral districting principles will result
in the creation of a district in which a majority of the district's residents are members of a particular minority group.
See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S.
256, 279 (1979) (distinguishing discriminatory intent from
"intent as volition" or "intent as awareness of consequences"). In my view, it means that the legislature affirmatively undertakes to create a majority-minority district
that would not have existed but for the express use of racial
classifications--in other words, that a majority-minority district is created "because of," and not merely "in spite of,"
racial demographics. See ibid. When that occurs, traditional race-neutral districting principles are necessarily
subordinated (and race necessarily predominates), and the
legislature has classified persons on the basis of race.
The resulting redistricting must be viewed as a racial
gerrymander.

Our summary affirmance of DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F. Supp.
1409 (ED Cal. 1994), summarily aff 'd in part and dism'd in
part, 515 U. S. 1170 (1995), cannot justify exempting intentional race-based redistricting from our well-established
Fourteenth Amendment standard. "When we summarily

affirm, without opinion, the judgment of a three-judge dis-trict court we affirm the judgment but not necessarily the

reasoning by which it was reached. An unexplicated sum-mary affirmance settles the issues for the parties, and is not
to be read as a renunciation by this Court of doctrines pre-viously announced in our opinions after full argument."
Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S. 379, 391-392 (1975) (Burger,C. J., concurring) (footnote omitted). I would not read our
summary affirmance of DeWitt to eviscerate the explicitholding of

Adarand or to undermine the force of our discus-sion of Georgia's concessions in Miller.

In this suit, Texas readily admits that it intentionallycreated majority-minority districts and that those districts
would not have existed but for its affirmative use of racialdemographics. As the State concedes in its brief:

"Texas intentionally maintained [District] 18 as anAfrican-American opportunity district and intentionally
created [Districts] 29 and 30 as minority opportunity dis-tricts in order to comply voluntarily with its reasonable
belief, based upon strong evidence, that it was requiredto do so by the Voting Rights Act, and because it desired
to insure that minorities who have historically been ex-cluded from the electoral process in Texas had a reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice."Brief for State Appellants 25.

See also ante, at 959-961, 969-970 (reciting similar con-cessions by Texas). That is enough to require application
of strict scrutiny in this suit.2 I am content to reaffirmour holding in Adarand that all racial classifications by
government must be strictly scrutinized and, even in the

2 It is unnecessary to parse in detail the contours of each challenged
district. See ante, at 965-976. I agree that the geographic evidence is
itself sufficient to invoke strict scrutiny, but once the State directly conceded that it intentionally used racial classifications to create majorityminority districts, there was no need to rely on circumstantial evidence.

sensitive area of state legislative redistricting, I would makeno exceptions.

I am willing to assume without deciding that the State hasasserted a compelling state interest. Given that assumption, I agree that the State's redistricting attempts were not
narrowly tailored to achieve its asserted interest. I concurin the judgment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The 1990 census revealed that Texas' population had
grown, over the past decade, almost twice as fast as the pop-ulation of the country as a whole. As a result, Texas was

entitled to elect three additional Representatives to theUnited States Congress, enlarging its delegation from 27
to 30. Because Texas' growth was concentrated in south
Texas and the cities of Dallas and Houston, the state legislature concluded that the new congressional districts should
be carved out of existing districts in those areas. The consequences of the political battle that produced the new map
are some of the most oddly shaped congressional districts in
the United States.

Today, the Court strikes down three of Texas' majorityminority districts, concluding, inter alia, that their odd
shapes reveal that the State impermissibly relied on predominantly racial reasons when it drew the districts as it did.
For two reasons, I believe that the Court errs in striking
down those districts.

First, I believe that the Court has misapplied its own tests
for racial gerrymandering, both by applying strict scrutiny
to all three of these districts, and then by concluding that
none can meet that scrutiny. In asking whether strict scrutiny should apply, the Court improperly ignores the "complex interplay" of political and geographical considerations
that went into the creation of Texas' new congressional districts, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915-916 (1995), and

Stevens, J., dissenting
focuses exclusively on the role that race played in the State's
decisions to adjust the shape of its districts. A quick comparison of the unconstitutional majority-minority districts
with three equally bizarre majority-Anglo districts, compare
ante, at Appendixes A-C, with infra, at Appendixes A-C,
demonstrates that race was not necessarily the predominant
factor contorting the district lines. I would follow the fair
implications of the District Court's findings,1 and conclude
that Texas' entire map is a political, not a racial, gerrymander.2 See Part IV, infra.

Even if strict scrutiny applies, I would find these districts
constitutional, for each considers race only to the extent necessary to comply with the State's responsibilities under the
Voting Rights Act while achieving other race-neutral political and geographical requirements. The plurality's finding
to the contrary unnecessarily restricts the ability of States
to conform their behavior to the Voting Rights Act while
simultaneously complying with other race-neutral goals.
See Part V, infra.

Second, even if I concluded that these districts failed an
appropriate application of this still-developing law to appropriately read facts, I would not uphold the District Court
decision. The decisions issued today serve merely to rein1 The District Court recognized, but erroneously ignored, the overwhelming weight of evidence demonstrating that political considerations
dominated the shaping of Texas' congressional districts. See Vera v.
Richards, 861 F. Supp. 1304, 1331, 1334-1336 (SD Tex. 1994); infra, at
1027-1029.

2 Because I believe that political gerrymanders are more objectionable

than the "racial gerrymanders" perceived by the Court in recent cases,
see Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 748 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring);
Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 161-162, 166 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I am not entirely unsympathetic to
the Court's holding. I believe, however, that the evils of political gerrymandering should be confronted directly, rather than through the racespecific approach that the Court has taken in recent years. See also

I
The factors motivating Texas' redistricting plan are clearlyrevealed in the results of the 1992 elections. Both before

and immediately after the 1990 census, the Democratic Partywas in control of the Texas Legislature. Under the new
map in 1992, more than two-thirds of the Districts--includ-ing each of the new ones--elected Democrats, even though
Texas voters are arguably more likely to vote Republicanthan Democrat.

3 Incumbents of both parties were just as

successful: 26 of the 27 incumbents were reelected, whileeach of the three new districts elected a state legislator who

had essentially acted as an incumbent in the districting proc-ess,

4 giving "incumbents" a 97% success rate.

3 In elections since 1980, the State has elected a Democrat in only two
of four gubernatorial races, and in only two of six races for the United
States Senate. America Votes 21: A Handbook of Contemporary American Election Statistics 417 (R. Scammon & A. McGillivray eds. 1995).
Furthermore, in 1994, Republican candidates received a total of 550,000
more votes than Democratic candidates in Texas' 30 races for the United
States House of Representatives, id., at 4, while in 1992, Democratic House
candidates outpolled Republicans by only 147,000 votes (despite winning
27 of 30 districts). America Votes 20: A Handbook of Contemporary

residence of its incumbent, contained the same number ofpeople, and complied with other federal and state districting
requirements. Much of Dallas and Houston, for example,
was already represented in Congress by Democrats, and cre-ating new Democratic districts in each city while ensuring

politically safe seats for sitting Representatives required sig-nificant political gerrymandering. This task was aided by
technological and informational advances that allowed theState to adjust lines on the scale of city blocks, thereby guaranteeing twists and turns that would have been essentiallyimpossible in any earlier redistricting.

Legislature's efforts," the District Court concluded, was "a

same committee, Frank Tejeda, also "attempted to draw a district [District 28] that would facilitate his potential candidacy." 861 F. Supp., at
1326. And State Senator Gene Green and State Representative Roman
Martinez, both Houston-area officials with designs on Congress, competed
in an effort to design District 29 in a way that would guarantee their own
election. Id., at 1324, n. 27. (Martinez later dropped out of the congressional race to run for State Senate.) Because the role that these legislators played in the redistricting process was largely identical to that played
by sitting incumbents, my references to the role of "incumbents" in the
redistricting process generally refer to these individuals as well.

5 As did many other States, Texas kept track of the shapes of its post1990 districts with a computer districting program loaded with 1990 census information and geographic information at scales ranging from statewide to that of a city block. See generally Shaw v. Hunt, 861 F. Supp.
408, 457 (EDNC 1994) (describing computer programs); 861 F. Supp., at
1318-1319. The dramatic increase in bizarrely shaped districts after 1990
can be traced, at least in part, to the fact that computers allowed legislators to achieve their political goals geographically in a manner far more
precise than heretofore possible. See Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms,

861 F. Supp. 1304, 1309 (SD Tex. 1994); see, e. g., Appen-dixes A-D.

It is clear that race also played a role in Texas' redistrict-ing decisions. According to the 1990 Census, Texas contained 16,986,510 residents, of whom 22.5% were of Hispanicorigin, and 11.6% were non-Hispanic African-American. 861
F. Supp., at 1311. Under the pre-1990 districting scheme,Texas' 27-member delegation included four Hispanics and
one African-American. In Harris County, a concentratedHispanic community was divided among several majorityAnglo districts as well as the majority-minority District 18.In Dallas County, the majority-black community in South
Dallas was split down the middle between two majority-Anglo districts. The legislature was well aware, after the
1990 census, that the minority communities in each countywere disproportionately responsible for the growth in population that gained three representatives for the State.Given the omnipresence of $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42
U. S. C. $ 1973, the demographics of the two communities,and the pressure from leaders of the minority communities
in those cities, it was not unreasonable--and certainly notinvidious discrimination of any sort--for the State to accede
to calls for the creation of majority-minority districts inboth cities.

6

6 The State added District 28 (a majority-Hispanic district in south
Texas), District 29 (a majority-Hispanic district in Houston), and District
30 (a majority-black district in Dallas). In addition, the State reconfigured Houston's District 18. That district had elected African-American
Representatives to Congress since the early 1970's and remained
majority-minority in 1990, although a plurality of its population was by
then Hispanic. To create District 29, the legislature altered the shape of
District 18 to move parts of its Hispanic population into that neighboring
district while retaining a majority-black population.

To the extent that the precise shape of these districts relied on race
rather than other factors, that racial gerrymandering was somewhat less

Stevens, J., dissenting
While complying with a multitude of other political andlegal requirements, then, Texas created three new majorityminority congressional districts and significantly reconfig-ured one pre-existing district. The District Court concluded that the State impermissibly emphasized race overnonracial factors when it drew two of these new districts
(District 30 in Dallas and District 29 in Houston) and thereconfigured District 18 in Houston. To determine whether
the Court correctly affirms that decision, I begin, as doesthe plurality, by asking whether "strict scrutiny" should be
applied to the State's consideration of race in the creation ofthese majority-minority districts.

II
We have traditionally applied strict scrutiny to state ac-tion that discriminates on the basis of race. Prior to

Shaw I,however, we did so only in cases in which that discrimination

harmed an individual or set of individuals because of theirrace. In contrast, the harm identified in

Shaw I and itsprogeny is much more diffuse. See Shaw II, ante, at 921-

925 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Racial gerrymandering of thesort being addressed in these cases is "discrimination" only
in the sense that the lines are drawn based on race, not inthe sense that harm is imposed on specific persons on account
of their race. Ante, at 923-924 (Stevens, J., dissenting).Aware of this distinction, a majority of this Court has endorsed a position crucial to a proper evaluation of Texas' con-gressional districts: Neither the Equal Protection Clause nor
any other provision of the Constitution was offended merelybecause the legislature considered race when it deliberately

effective than the political gerrymandering had been: District 29, created
as a majority-Hispanic district, elected an Anglo, former State Senator
Green, in 1992, and reelected him in 1994. America Votes 21, at 437.
Given his substantial role in crafting the district to meet his electoral
needs, see n. 4, supra, Green's success suggests the power of incumbency
over race.

created three majority-minority districts.7 The plurality'sstatement that strict scrutiny "does [not] apply to all cases

of intentional creation of majority-minority districts," ante,at 958, merely caps a long line of discussions, stretching from
Shaw I to Shaw II, which have both expressly and implicitlyset forth precisely that conclusion.

8

7 I do not agree with the Court's approach to these cases. Nonetheless,
given that the Court seems settled in its conclusion that racial gerrymandering claims such as these may be pursued, I endorse this proposition.

8 Though expressly reserving the issue in Shaw I, we noted there that

appellants wisely conceded that while "race-conscious redistricting is not
always unconstitutional. . . . This Court has never held that race-conscious
state decisionmaking is impermissible in all circumstances." 509 U. S., at
642 (emphasis in original). The threshold test for the application of strict
scrutiny as set forth in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), implicitly
accepts this as true, concluding that strict scrutiny applies not when race
merely influences the districting process, but only when "the legislature
subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial
considerations." Id., at 916 (emphasis added); see also id., at 928-929
(O'Connor, J., concurring) (test does not "throw into doubt the vast majority of the Nation's 435 congressional districts . . . even though race may
well have been considered in the redistricting process"). Shaw II similarly recognizes that intent does not trigger strict scrutiny: Although the
District Court concluded that the State "deliberately drew" the district in
question to ensure that it included a majority of African-American citizens,
see Shaw, 861 F. Supp., at 473; Shaw II, ante, at 905, the Court reviews
the District Court's findings regarding the demographics of the district to
determine whether the strict scrutiny was appropriately applied. See
ante, at 905-906; cf. ante, at 999 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)
(where State intends to create majority-minority district, application of
strict scrutiny not even a "close question").

Justice Thomas takes a strong view on this matter, arguing that a
majority-minority district should escape strict scrutiny only when it is
created "in spite of," not "because of," the race of its population. Ante,
at 1001. But because minorities are, by definition, minorities in the population, it will be rare indeed for a State to stumble across a district in
which the minority population is both large enough and segregated enough
to allow majority-minority districts to be created with at most a "mere
awareness" that the placement of the lines will create such a district. See
ibid. Indeed, I doubt that any such district exists in the entire Nation;

Stevens, J., dissenting
The conclusion that race-conscious districting should notalways be subject to strict scrutiny merely recognizes that

our equal protection jurisprudence can sometimes mislead uswith its rigid characterization of suspect classes and levels
of scrutiny. As I have previously noted, all equal protection
jurisprudence might be described as a form of rational basisscrutiny; we apply "strict scrutiny" more to describe the

likelihood of success than the character of the test to beapplied. See

Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473
U. S. 432, 452-453 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring). Be-cause race has rarely been a legitimate basis for state classifications, and more typically an irrational and invidiousground for discrimination, a "virtually automatic invalidation
of racial classifications" has been the natural result of the
application of our equal protection jurisprudence. Id., at453. In certain circumstances, however, when the state action (i) has neither the intent nor effect of harming any particular group, (ii) is not designed to give effect to irrational
prejudices held by its citizens but to break them down, and
(iii) uses race as a classification because race is "relevant" to
the benign goal of the classification, id., at 454, we need not

view the action with the typically fatal skepticism that we
have used to strike down the most pernicious forms of state
behavior. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,

erally require a conscious decision to draw its lines "just so" to ensure
that the group is not a minority in the district population. It appears,
however, that even when a district is placed "just so" in order to include
a traditional community in which race does correlate with community interests (consider, for example, New York District 15, which is centered
on Harlem), Justice Thomas would review that district with the same
presumption of invidiousness with which we viewed the district in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960). Cf. Miller, 515 U. S., at 944 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting that "ethnicity itself can tie people together"
in communities of interest). Because the creation of such a district
threatens neither the harms of Gomillion nor, I believe, any harms against
which the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to protect, I cannot accept his conclusion.

316-317 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Regents of Univ. ofCal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 320 (1978). While the Court

insisted in Shaw I that racial classifications of this sort injurethe Nation (though not necessarily any particular group) in
myriad ways, see 509 U. S., at 647-648, redistricting thatcomplies with the three factors I outline above simply is not
the sort of despicable practice that has been taken in thepast to exclude minorities from the electoral process. See
Shaw II, ante, at 931-933 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Shaw I,509 U. S., at 682-685 (

Souter, J., dissenting); cf., e. g., Gomil-lion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960); Terry v. Adams, 345

U. S. 461 (1953). While any racial classification may risksome stereotyping, the risk of true "discrimination" in this
case is extremely tenuous in light of the remedial purposethe classification is intended to achieve and the long history
of resistance to giving minorities a full voice in the politicalprocess. Given the balancing of subtle harms and strong
remedies--a balancing best left to the political process, notto our own well-developed but rigid jurisprudence--the plurality reasonably concludes that race-conscious redistrictingis not always a form of "discrimination" to which we should
direct our most skeptical eye.

III
While the Court has agreed that race can, to a point,govern the drawing of district lines, it nonetheless suggests

that at a certain point, when the State uses race "too much,"illegitimate racial stereotypes threaten to overrun and contaminate an otherwise legitimate redistricting process. In
Miller, the Court concluded that this point was reachedwhen "race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the . . . dominant and controlling rationale" behindthe shape of the district. 515 U. S., at 913. For strict scrutiny to apply, therefore, the plaintiff must demonstrate that"the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness,

(O'Connor, J., concurring) (strict scrutiny should be appliedonly if State emphasized race in "substantial disregard"
for traditional districting principles); ante, at 962 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.).Of course, determining the "predominant" motive of the

Texas Legislature, ante, at 959 (citing Miller, 515 U. S., at916), is not a simple matter.

9 The members of that body

9 Because the Court's approach to cases of this kind seeks to identify the
"predominant" motive of the legislature, it is worth pointing out, as we
have on so many prior occasions, that it is often "difficult or impossible for
any court to determine the `sole' or `dominant' motivation behind the
choices of a group of legislators." Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U. S. 217,
225 (1971). As in every other legislative body, each of the members of
Texas' Legislature has his or her own agenda and interests--particularly
in the "complicated process" of redistricting, in which every decision "inevitably has sharp political impact." White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 795-
796 (1973). In these circumstances, "[r]arely can it be said that a legislature . . . operating under a broad mandate made a decision motivated solely
by a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the `dominant'
or `primary' one. In fact, it is because legislators . . . are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing considerations that courts
refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of
arbitrariness or irrationality." Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 265 (1977) (footnote omitted); see
also Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 636-639 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting); Shaw II, ante, at 940 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Not only is this a case in which a legislature is operating under a "broad
mandate," but other factors weigh in favor of deference as well. First,
the inherently political process of redistricting is as much at the core of
state sovereignty as any other. Second, the "motive" with which we are
concerned is not per se impermissible. (For that reason, this litigation is
very different from Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), and
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S.
252 (1977), in which the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant's action was
motivated by an intent to harm individuals because of their status as members of a particular group. Where there is "proof that a discriminatory
purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision," the "judicial deference" due to the legislative process is no longer justified. Id., at 265-

faced many unrelenting pressures when they negotiated the
creation of the contested districts. They had to ensure that
there was no deviation in population from district to district.10 They reasonably believed that they had to create
districts that would comply with the Voting Rights Act.
See supra, at 1007. If the redistricting legislation was to
be enacted, they had to secure the support of incumbent Congressmen of both parties by drawing districts that would
ensure their election. And all of these desires had to be
achieved within a single contiguous district. Every time a
district line was shifted from one place to another, each of
these considerations was implicated, and additional, compensating shifts were necessary to ensure that all competing
goals were simultaneously accomplished. In such a constrained environment, there will rarely be one "dominant and
controlling" influence. Nowhere is this better illustrated

266.) Finally, those that are injured by the allegedly discriminatory
districts can alleviate their injury through the democratic process: Those
in the district could elect a representative who is not a part of their racial
group, while the population at large could elect a legislature that refused
to rely on racial considerations in the drawing of districts. In such circumstances we should take particular care in questioning the legislature's
motives and, if in doubt, presume that the legislature has acted appropriately. See post, at 1058-1062 (Souter, J., dissenting).

10 We require state legislatures to ensure that populations, from district

to district, are "as mathematically equal as reasonably possible," with de
minimis exceptions permissible only in "unavoidable" instances. White
v. Weiser, 412 U. S., at 790; see also Karcher, 462 U. S., at 734-735. Population variances are not permissible even " `if they necessarily result from
a State's attempt to avoid fragmenting political subdivisions by drawing
congressional district lines along existing . . . political subdivision boundaries.' " White, 412 U. S., at 791 (citing Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S.
526, 533-534 (1969)). The legislature, therefore, understandably felt compelled to achieve mathematical equality regardless of other concerns.
Rather surprisingly, they were able to do so: Every one of Texas' 30
congressional districts contains precisely 566,217 persons. Of course,
this precision could not have been accomplished without breaking apart
counties, cities, neighborhoods, and even pre-existing voting precincts.

than in Dallas' District 30 where, at the very least, it is clearthat race was not such an overriding factor.

IV
The plurality lists several considerations which, whentaken in combination, lead it to conclude that race, and no

other cause, was the predominant factor influencing District30's configuration. First, there is the shape itself. Second,
there is evidence that the districts were intentionally drawnwith consciousness of race in an effort to comply with the
Voting Rights Act. Third, the plurality dismisses two race-neutral considerations (communities of interest and incumbency protection) that appellants advanced as race-neutralconsiderations that led to the odd shape of the districts. Finally, the plurality concludes that race was impermissiblyused as a proxy for political affiliation during the course of
redistricting. In my opinion, an appropriate reading of therecord demonstrates that none of these factors--either singly or in combination--suggests that racial considerations"subordinated" race-neutral districting principles. I discuss
each in turn.
Bizarre Shape

As noted, supra, at 1003, and n. 6, Texas' Legislature con-cluded that it would add a new district to Dallas County that

would incorporate the rapidly growing minority communitiesin South Dallas. To do so, the new district would have to
fit into the existing districts: Before redistricting, most ofsouthern Dallas County (including the African-American
communities in South Dallas) was divided between Districts5 and 24, represented by Democratic Representatives Bryant
and Frost, respectively. The middle of the northern sectionof the county was divided between Districts 3 and 26, both
represented by Republicans.Then-State Senator Johnson began the redistricting process by proposing a compact, Democratic, majority-minority

district encompassing all of South Dallas. See App. 139; 861F. Supp., at 1321, n. 22. Representatives Bryant and Frost

objected, however, because the proposed district includednot only Johnson's residence, but their own homes, located
within only 10 miles of each other on opposite sides of thecity. Furthermore, Johnson's plan transferred many of
Frost and Bryant's most reliable Democratic supporters intothe proposed district. Rather than acquiesce to the creation
of this compact majority-minority district, Frost and Bryantinsisted that the new district avoid both their own homes
and many of the communities that had been loyal to them.Johnson's plan was, therefore, "quickly abandoned."

Ibid.To accommodate the incumbents' desires, District 30 required geographical adjustments that had telling effects onits shape. First, two notches carefully avoiding the residences of and neighborhoods surrounding Frost and Bryantwere carved out of District 30's side. See Appendix D,
infra.11 Furthermore, Frost and Bryant retained severalcommunities--many majority-black--along the southern and
eastern sides of the proposed district. See generally 861F. Supp., at 1321-1322.

12

11 This phenomenon is not unique to Dallas County: Throughout the
State, "incumbent residences repeatedly fall just along district lines."
861 F. Supp., at 1318 (giving examples); see State's Exhs. 10A and 10B
(showing incumbent residences). District 6, for instance, changed from a
rural district stretching far to the southeast of Dallas to a more suburban
district wrapping around Fort Worth. As it did so, however, the district
pivoted around the home of incumbent Representative Joe Barton, whose
residence sits at the extreme southeastern end of a district stretching in
a 100-mile-long loop around Fort Worth. See Appendix D, infra.

12 The plurality suggests that these communities were shed from District

30 in a "suspect use of race as a proxy to further neighboring incumbents'
interests." Ante, at 979; see also ante, at 971-972, n. I had thought,
however, that the Court's concern in these cases was the "resemblance to
political apartheid" involved in the creation of majority-minority districts.
Shaw I, 509 U. S. 630, 647 (1993). I do not see how the decision to include
minority communities in a neighboring majority-white district bears any
resemblance to such "apartheid" or, for that matter, how it has any rele517us3$68i 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Had these communities been retained by District 30, itwould have been much more compact. By giving up these

voters to Frost and Bryant, however, District 30 was forcedto seek out population and Democratic voters elsewhere.
The Democratic incumbents had blocked its way to the south
and east; north (and, to a lesser extent, west) was the onlyway it could go.

13

It would not have helped the prospects of a Democraticcandidate in the new District 30 had it simply plowed directly north to pick up additional population. Immediatelynorth of the city of Dallas are the "Park Cities," which include a population that has voted strongly Republicanthroughout recent elections. See State's Exhs. 9A and 9B
(depicting one index of political affiliation in 1990 and 1992elections). Rather than dilute the Democratic vote (and
threaten the Republican incumbents) in this manner, District
30 skirted these communities on the west, and then curved
east, picking up communities on either side of the region's
major interstate freeways.14

As the process of extracting Democratic voters out of the
core of the Republican districts in North Dallas progressed,
the distinction between Democratic and Republican voters
moved from the precinct level (the smallest level at which
political affiliation data was immediately available in the revance to the validity of the creation of a district from which those minority
communities have been excluded. See also infra, at 1030-1032.

13 See, e. g., 3 Tr. 187 (testimony of Christopher Sharman: "[A]ny time

you took part of a district away on one end, you would usually squeeze or
push the district out on another end; and in this case, most of the time the
district would get pushed to the north").

14 The author of the District Court opinion was herself aware of these

political realities. See id., at 194 (Jones, J., noting that Johnson did not
want anything to do with the Park Cities because she "[d]idn't want competition from Ross Perot"). In light of this recognition, it is difficult to
understand why the District Court described District 30's efforts to avoid
that community as a contributing factor to the allegedly race-based bizarreness of the district borders. See 861 F. Supp., at 1337; ante, at 967.

districting programs) down to the smaller census block level(the smallest level at which demographic and socioeconomic

data was available).15 In an effort to further identify whichcensus blocks were likely to support their candidacy, the incumbents used not only census data, but their own long expe-rience as local representatives as well as the experiences of
staffers and supporters. See 3 Tr. 177-179, 181-182 (de-scribing methods, such as simply driving through neighborhoods, that staff members and candidates for office used todevelop block-specific information regarding the likely political affiliation of voters).16In addition, although information about political affiliation
was not available at the block level through the computerprogram, legislators and staffers were able to get relatively
precise information about voter preferences through a sys-tem, developed by the Democratic Party, that allowed candidates to determine in which party primary voters had partic-ipated. Id., at 179-180. By examining this information,
legislators were able to further fine-tune district lines to in-clude likely supporters and exclude those who would prob15 Because political boundaries are more closely packed in urban than in
rural areas, drawing lines based on such boundaries will almost always
require tighter twists and turns in urban districts than in rural districts.
Significantly, the three districts struck down by the District Court are the
only three districts in the entire State with population densities of over
2,000 persons per square mile. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census, Population and Housing Characteristics for Congressional
Districts of the 103d Congress: Texas 40-44 (Feb. 1993). If enough empty
land were added to these districts that they matched the sparse densities
of rural districts (such as District 28, which was upheld by the District
Court), their turns would not appear so sharp, and the open space, without
its demographic implications, could smooth the deepest of the districts'
notches.

16 As Democratic communities were identified, they had to be connected

with the core of the district. Although Texas has no state statutory or
constitutional requirement to that effect, state legislators agreed that each
of the 30 districts should be entirely contiguous, permitting any candidate,
map in hand, to visit every residence in her district without leaving it.

along one street rather than another").17The careful gerrymandering conducted by the Texas Legislature under the watchful eye of Johnson and her staff wasa success not only on a districtwide level (Johnson was
elected with over 70% of the vote in both 1992 and 1994),but on a precinct level. While the pre-1990 precincts in the
heavily Republican North Dallas gave little reason for aDemocratic incumbent to hope for much support, see State's
Exh. 9B (maps of Dallas and Collin Counties with 1990 elec-tion index results showing only a few Democrat-leaning precincts in North Dallas), the gerrymandering that occurred in1991 resulted in smaller precincts that, by all indications,
gathered concentrations of Democratic voters into District30 while leaving concentrations of Republican voters in surrounding Districts 3 and 26. See State's Exh. 9A (maps ofDallas and Collin Counties with 1992 election index results
showing many more Democrat-leaning precincts in the NorthDallas sections of District 30).

17 Incumbents influenced the shape of districts in other ways. Both District 30 and District 29, for instance, detoured to include portions of the
state legislative districts that were being represented by the state legislators who hoped to run for Congress. See, e. g., State's Exh. 31 (showing
that portion of Tarrant County included in District 30 had been part of
Johnson's State Senate district). In some cases, legislators drew districts
to avoid the residences of potential primary challengers. See 3 Tr. 192-
193; 4 id., at 46. Incumbents also sought to include communities that they
expected (or knew) to contain particularly active supporters; this interest
in "active" voters often trumped any desire to ensure a particular racial
makeup. See 3 id., at 190; 4 id., at 40-41; 861 F. Supp., at 1320.

U. S., at 646-647, the plurality offers mathematical proof thatDistrict 30 is one of the most bizarre districts in the Nation,

see ante, at 960, and relates the now-obligatory florid de-scription of the district's shape, ante, at 965-966; see also
ante, at 973-974 (describing District 29). As the maps ap-pended to this opinion demonstrate, neither District 30 nor
the Houston districts have a monopoly on either of thesecharacteristics. Three other majority-white districts are
ranked along with the majority-minority districts as amongthe oddest in the Nation. See Pildes & Niemi, Expressive
Harms, "Bizarre Districts," and Voting Rights: EvaluatingElection-District Appearances After

Shaw v. Reno, 92 Mich.L. Rev. 483, 565 (1993). Perhaps the clearest example of

partisan gerrymandering outside of the context of majority-minority districts is District 6, a majority-Anglo district represented by a Republican.18

18 While two extremely noncompact majority-Anglo districts in Texas
(Districts 3 and 25) might be able to blame part (though by no means all) of
their contortions on their contiguity with the majority-minority districts,
District 6 has little excuse. Although it shares a border with District 30
for a short distance, that stretch is one of the straightest in either of
the districts, running almost entirely along the county line through the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. See Appendix D, infra.

As for the obligatory florid description: District 6 has far less of an
identifiable core than any of the majority-minority districts struck down
by the District Court. To the extent that it "begins" anywhere, it is probably near the home of incumbent Rep. Barton in Ennis, located almost 40
miles southwest of downtown Dallas. From there, the district winds
across predominantly rural sections of Ellis County, finally crossing into
Tarrant County, the home of Fort Worth. It skips across two arms of Joe
Pool Lake, noses its way into Dallas County, and then travels through
predominantly Republican suburbs of Fort Worth. Nearing the central
city, the borders dart into the downtown area, then retreat to curl around
the city's northern edge, picking up the airport and growing suburbs north
of town. Worn from its travels into the far northwestern corner of the
county (almost 70 miles, as the crow flies, from Ennis), the district lines
plunge south into Eagle Mountain Lake, traveling along the waterline for
miles, with occasional detours to collect voters that have built homes along
its shores. Refreshed, the district rediscovers its roots in rural Parker

For every geographic atrocity committed by District 30,District 6 commits its own and more. District 30 split precincts to gerrymander Democratic voters out of Republicanprecincts; District 6 did the same. See State's Exh. 9B (Tarrant County, showing District 6 cuts). District 30 travels
down a riverbed; District 6 follows the boundaries of a lake.District 30 combines various unrelated communities of interest within Dallas and its suburbs; District 6 combines rural,urban, and suburban communities. District 30 sends tentacles nearly 20 miles out from its core; District 6 is a tentacle,hundreds of miles long (as the candidate walks), and it has
no core.The existence of the equally bizarre majority-white District 6 makes the plurality's discussion of District 30's odd
shape largely irrelevant. If anything, the similarities be-tween Districts 6 and 30 suggest that it is more likely than

not that the incumbency considerations that led to the mutation of District 6 were the same considerations that forced
District 30 to twist and turn its way through North Dallas.19

County, then flows back toward Fort Worth from the southwest for another bite at Republican voters near the heart of that city. As it does so,
the district narrows in places to not much more than a football field in
width. Finally, it heads back into the rural regions of its fifth county--
Johnson--where it finally exhausts itself only 50 miles from its origin, but
hundreds of "miles apart in distance and worlds apart in culture." Miller,
515 U. S., at 908 (describing a similar combined rural/urban district).

19 Seeking specific examples, the plurality makes much hay over a portion of Collin County located just over the county line north of Dallas.
See ante, at 965, 971. There, District 30 excludes a portion of a precinct
that voted Democratic in 1990, and maps "exactly onto the only area in
the southern half of th[e] county with a [minority] percentage population
in excess of 50%." Ante, at 965.

The map to which the plurality refers, however, groups the minority
percentage by precinct, and since precincts are defined by the district
boundaries, it is no surprise that the district maps "exactly" onto the precinct. See App. 153. (One might similarly argue that "District 30 maps
exactly onto the only area in all of north Texas that is 50% black," but

The political, rather than the racial, nature of District 30'sgerrymander is even more starkly highlighted by comparing

it with the districts struck down in Shaw II and Miller.District 30's black population is, for instance, far more concentrated than the minority population in North Carolina'sDistrict 12. And in

Miller, the Court made it clear that theodd shape of Georgia's Eleventh District was the result of a

conscious effort to increase its proportion of minority popula-tions: It was, the Court found, " `exceedingly obvious' from
the shape of the Eleventh District, together with the racialdemographics, that the drawing of narrow land bridges to
incorporate within the district outlying appendages contain-ing

nearly 80% of the district's total black population was adeliberate attempt to bring black populations into the district." Miller, 515 U. S., at 917 (emphasis added; citationomitted).

District 30 is the precise demographic converse of the dis-trict struck down in Miller. District 30, for example, has a
compact core in South Dallas which contains 50% of thedistrict population and

nearly 70% of the district's totalblack population. Cf. ibid. Unlike the appendages to Georgia's District 11, the tentacles stretching north and west
cific sections of the district.) The more telling maps are the census block
maps, which demonstrate that the Collin County section of District 30
contains many more census blocks of less than 25% minority population
than it does blocks that are more than 50% minority. See State's Exhs.
45 and 46 (Exh. 45 is reproduced, in part, as Appendix D, infra). Even if
those majority-white blocks have relatively small populations, they were
nonetheless included, suggesting that the creation of the district was not
as single-mindedly focused on race as the Court and the District Court
assume.

Even more significant is the fact that the new precinct leaned overwhelmingly Democratic in the 1992 election, while the portion of the precinct that was not included in District 30 voted overwhelmingly Republican. See State's Exh. 9B (Collin County). While the excluded portion of
the 1990 precinct may have been dropped, in part, to help comply with the
State's goals under the Voting Rights Act, it also involved a successful
effort to maximize Democratic votes while avoiding Republican votes.

from District 30 add progressively less in the way of popula-tion, and, more important for purposes of this inquiry, they

actually reduce the proportional share of minorities in thedistrict. See State's Exh. 33.

For example: The worst offender, in the trained eye of
the Court, may be the northern arm of the district thatwinds around the Park Cities and then up into Collin County.

But that arm, which contains 22% of the population, is only
21% black, ibid.--a proportion essentially identical to the
proportion of African-Americans in Dallas County as a
whole.20

The plurality is certainly correct in pointing out that
District 30's outlying reaches encompass some communities
with high concentrations of minorities.21 It is implausible

20 See 861 F. Supp., at 1312 (black population in Dallas County is
362,130); Bureau of Census, Population and Housing Unit Counts 185
(Oct. 1993) (total population of Dallas County is 1,852,810).

21 Several responses to the plurality's specific examples are worth

making, however. In Collin County, the plurality relies on the fact that
the "combined African-American and Hispanic" population in the Collin
County extremity of the northern appendage to District 30 is in excess
of 50%. Ante, at 971. But District 30 was created with an eye to a
majority-black population, rather than a majority-minority population, so
the more relevant facts are that (i) African-Americans make up only 19.8%
of the Collin County appendage, App. 331, (ii) those African-Americans
consist of only two-tenths of 1% of the entire population in the district,
ibid., and (iii) this appendage contains more majority-white census blocks
than it does majority-minority census blocks, see State's Exh. 45.

The plurality also points out that a small portion of one of the tentacles--the one that extends west into Tarrant County--contains an
African-American majority. Ante, at 965. It would be implausible to
claim, however, that race was the "predominant" reason that this community was included in District 30. First, the community had been part of
Senator Johnson's state legislative district, see n. 17, supra; second, it also
includes majority-white census blocks; and third, the total population in
that portion of the district is less than 2,000 people. App. 331. Finally,
and more important, the population of the entire western tentacle (at the
tip of which is the Tarrant County community) is only 29% black, see
State's Exh. 33--less than half the proportion of minorities in the core of
the district.

to suggest, however, that an effort to "segregate" votersdrove District 30 to collect those populations. After all,

even the District Court noted that African-American votersimmediately adjacent to the core of District 30 were intentionally excluded from the district "in order to protect
incumbents." 861 F. Supp., at 1339 (emphasis added).Forced into Republican territory to collect Democratic votes,

the district intentionally picked up some minority commu-nities (though far more majority-white communities). If it
had not, the goal of creating a majority-black district wouldhave been sacrificed to incumbency protection (the very sort
of "predominance" of race over race-neutral factors that theplurality discredits). But unlike Georgia's District 11 and
North Carolina's District 12, the reason that the district wasthere in the first place was not to collect minority communities, but to collect population--preferably Democrats. Itwould, therefore, be fanciful to assert that the "several
appendages" to District 30 were "drawn for the obvious,"let alone the

predominant, "purpose of putting black popu-lations into the district."

Miller, 515 U. S., at 910.22In sum, a fair analysis of the shape of District 30, like the

equally bizarre shape of District 6, belies the notion that itsshape was determined by racial considerations.

22 Indeed, if the "appendages" to District 30 reaching into neighboring
counties were cut off, the proportion of African-Americans in the resulting
district would actually increase. See App. 331. As presently constituted, District 30 includes 566,217 people, of which 283,225 (or 50.02%) are
African-American. If the Tarrant County and Collin County portions of
the district were removed, the resulting district would have 557,218 people, of which 280,620 (or 50.36%) would be African-American. While the
resulting district would not include the "zero deviation" necessary under
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), and its progeny, see n. 10, supra,
the missing population could easily be acquired in majority-black census
blocks adjacent to District 30's southern and eastern edge, thereby increasing the proportion of black population still further. Because the alleged racial goals of the district could be achieved more effectively by
making the district more compact, I simply do not comprehend how the
plurality can conclude that the effort to create a majority-minority district
"predominated" over other, race-neutral goals.

Intent

Perhaps conscious that noncompact congressional districtsare the rule rather than the exception in Texas, the plurality

suggests, ante, at 960-961, 969-970, that the real key is thedirect evidence, particularly in the form of Texas' $ 5 Voting
Rights Act submissions and the person of then-State SenatorJohnson, that the State expressed an intent to create these
districts with a given "minimum percentage of the favoredminority." 861 F. Supp., at 1309. Even if it were appropriate to rest this test of dominance on an examination ofthe subjective motivation of individual legislators,

23 or on

23 Testimony by individuals is relevant, but hardly dispositive evidence
of collective motivations. See n. 9, supra. It may be true that the most
important concern motivating Senator Johnson, the Chairman of the Senate Districting Committee, was her desire to create the first Congressional
District in the history of the State in which African-Americans were in
the majority. Johnson never testified, however, that racial considerations
were the sole concern motivating the changes to the shapes of the districts. See, e. g., App. 454-456 (certain areas that were minority communities were assigned to Anglo incumbents because of incumbent power),
id., at 459 ("[J]ust as 30 went looking for friendly territory regardless of
color, [the incumbents] went looking for friendly territory as well regardless of color"). Since this testimony was not only irrelevant to the $ 2
proceedings but arguably harmful to her claim there that racial considerations had been taken into account, these admissions are particularly
telling.

To the extent that testimony of individual legislators is relevant, the
following statements from the floor of the Texas House confirm that many
legislators viewed these districts as political, not racial, gerrymanders:

"This plan was drawn to protect incumbents. . . .

"[I]n order to protect an incumbent Dallas congressman and an incumbent Houston congressman, county lines were not respected, urban boundaries were not respected, precinct boundaries were not respected." Id.,
at 374-375 (statement of Rep. Ogden).

"With the adoption of this plan, you will have 8 Republican Congressmen
out of 30. That's de facto regression and provides for less Republican
representation in Washington, D. C.

testimony given in a legal proceeding designed to prove aconflicting conclusion,

24 this information does little more than

confirm that the State believed it necessary to comply withthe Voting Rights Act. Given its reasonable understanding

of its legal responsibilities, see supra, at 1007, the legislatureacted to ensure that its goal of creating a majority-black district in Dallas County was not undermined by the changesmade to accommodate District 30 to other, race-neutral districting principles. As the plurality admits, see ante, at 958,the intent to create majority-minority districts does not in
itself trigger strict scrutiny; these admissions prove nothingmore than that. See also

Shaw II, ante, at 930-932 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Nonracial Factors: Community

In an effort to provide a definitive explanation for the oddshape of the district, the State emphasized two factors: The

cal and very rational. The lines have been drawn, dissecting communities
very creatively in order to pack Republicans and maximize Democratic
representation." Id., at 376 (statement of Rep. Gusendorf).

See also id., at 377-380 (statement of Rep. Gusendorf illustrating the gerrymandering process by reference to District 6, not a majority-minority
district).

These gerrymanders "d[o] not have to happen. It has nothing to do
with fairness. It has nothing to do with minority representation because
if we were really concerned about minority representation, we would have
drawn this map in such a way that the minorities were considered and not
simply to elect Democrats." Id., at 384 (statement of Rep. Hill).

24 It is ironic and slightly unfair for the plurality and District Court to

use the State's $ 5 submission and Congresswoman Johnson's testimony
in a $ 2 challenge to the congressional district as evidence against them
in these cases. See, e. g., 861 F. Supp., at 1319-1321, 1338-1339; ante,
at 969-970. Both of those proceedings required the State to assure the
Attorney General and a federal court, respectively, that the State had
adequately considered the interests of minority voters in the 1991 redistricting process. Under such circumstances, it is not at all surprising that
the relevant declarant would limit his or her comments to the role that
race played in the redistricting process, for other considerations were
largely irrelevant (the District Court's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, see 861 F. Supp., at 1339).

presence of communities of interest tying together the popu-lations of the district, and the role of incumbency protection.

The District Court and the plurality improperly dismissedthese considerations as ultimately irrelevant to the shape of
the districts.First, the appellants presented testimony that the districts
were drawn to align with certain communities of interest,such as land use, family demographics, and transportation
corridors. See 861 F. Supp., at 1322-1323. Although theDistrict Court recognized that these community characteristics amounted to accurate descriptions of District 30, id., at1323, it dismissed them as irrelevant to the districting process, concluding that there was no evidence that "the Legisla-ture had these particular `communities of interest' in mind
when drawing the boundaries of District 30." Ibid. Theplurality concludes that appellants present no reason to displace that conclusion. Ante, at 966-967.I do not understand why we should require such evidence
ever to exist. It is entirely reasonable for the legislature torely on the experience of its members when drawing particular boundaries rather than on clearly identifiable "evidence"presented by demographers and political scientists. Most of
these representatives have been members of their communi-ties for years. Unless the Court intends to interfere in state
political processes even more than it has already expressedan intent to do, I presume that it does not intend to require
States to create a comprehensive administrative record insupport of their redistricting process. State legislators
should be able to rely on their own experience, not only pre-pared reports. To the extent that the presence of obvious
communities of interest among members of a district explic-itly or implicitly guided the shape of District 30, it amounts
to an entirely legitimate nonracial consideration.25

can tie people together" in communities of interest. 515 U. S., at 944; see

Nonracial Factors: Incumbency

The plurality admits that the appellants "present a . . .
substantial case for their claim that incumbency protectionrivaled race in determining the district's shape."

Ante, at
967. Every individual who participated in the redistricting
process knew that incumbency protection was a critical factor in producing the bizarre lines and, as the plurality points
out, ante, at 963-964, even the District Court recognized that
this nearly exclusive focus on the creation of "safe" districts
for incumbents was intimately related to the bizarre shape
of district lines throughout the State.

"[I]n Texas in 1991, many incumbent protection
boundaries sabotaged traditional redistricting principles
as they routinely divided counties, cities, neighborhoods,
and regions. For the sake of maintaining or winning
seats in the House of Representatives, Congressmen or
would-be Congressmen shed hostile groups and potential opponents by fencing them out of their districts.
The Legislature obligingly carved out districts of apparent supporters of incumbents, . . . and then added appendages to connect their residences to those districts.
The final result seems not one in which the people select
their representatives, but in which the representatives

("Whenever identifiable groups in our society are disadvantaged, they will
share common political interests and tend to vote as a `bloc' "). Furthermore, it may be that the very fact of racial bloc voting, a prerequisite to

$ 2 liability, see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 51 (1986) (and, under
the Court's recent jurisprudence, to the voluntary formation of a
majority-minority district), demonstrates the presence of a minority community. While communities based on race may merit a more skeptical
review to ensure that a bond, rather than mere stereotyping, ties the
community, see 861 F. Supp., at 1338, recognition of such a community

in an electoral district certainly could, in certain circumstances, serve as
a legitimate race-neutral explanation for particularly odd district shapes.
By suggesting the contrary, I believe that the District Court erred.

have selected the people." 861 F. Supp., at 1334 (cita-tions and footnotes omitted).

See also id., at 1335, n. 43. Despite this overwhelming evi-dence that incumbency protection was the critical motivating
factor in the creation of the bizarre Texas districts, the Dis-trict Court reached the stunning conclusion that because the
process was so "different in degree" from the "generalized,and legitimate, goal of incumbent and seniority protection"
that this Court has previously recognized, it could not serveas a legitimate explanation for the bizarre boundaries of the
congressional districts. Id., at 1334-1335. In dismissingincumbency protection once and for all, the District Court
stated that "[i]ncumbent protection is a valid state interestonly to the extent that it is not a pretext for unconstitutional
racial gerrymandering." Id., at 1336.It is difficult to know where to begin to attack the misperceptions reflected in these conclusions,26 and the plurality'sfailure to do so seriously taints its evaluation of the relative
importance of nonracial considerations in the creation of Dis-trict 30. The initial problem, of course, is that under the
Court's threshold test as set forth in Miller, one must con-sider the role of incumbency protection

before determiningwhether there is an "unconstitutional racial gerrymander."

And because the ultimate focus in these gerrymanderingcases is the claim that race was the "dominant and controlling rationale in drawing [the] district lines," 515 U. S., at913, a court

must, in applying that test, consider a State'sclaim that a given race-neutral rationale controlled the creation of those lines. See id., at 916 ("Where [compactness,contiguity,] or

other race-neutral considerations are thebasis for redistricting legislation, and are not subordinated

to race, a State can `defeat a claim that a district has been

gerrymandered on racial lines' "). Although a court may not
like the State's explanation, that is no excuse for ignoring it.

If some independent bar prevented the use of that raceneutral criterion, then the District Court might be in a position to object to the State's use of it. We have, however,
affirmed that a State has an interest in incumbency protection, see, e. g., ante, at 964-965 (opinion of O'Connor, J.);
White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783, 791, 797 (1973), and also assured States that the Constitution does not require compactness, contiguity, or respect for political borders, see Shaw I,
509 U. S., at 647. While egregious political gerrymandering
may not be particularly praiseworthy, see infra, at 1038-
1040, it may nonetheless provide the race-neutral explanation necessary for a State to avoid strict scrutiny of the district lines where gerrymandering is the "dominant and
controlling" explanation for the odd district shapes.27

The District Court's error had an apparently dispositive
effect on its assessment of whether strict scrutiny should
apply at all. Although aspects of our dispute with the plurality are "largely factual," ante, at 971, n., they arise not
out of our disagreement with the District Court's credibility
assessments, but out of that court's erroneous conclusion that
the State's overwhelming reliance on this race-neutral factor
was illegitimate and irrelevant to its evaluation of the factors
involved in the shifting of this district's lines. A fair evaluation of the record made in light of appropriate legal standards requires a conclusion very different from the District
Court's. By following the District Court down its misdirected path, the plurality itself goes astray.

27 While it may be that the political gerrymandering in this case is "different in degree" from that previously recognized, 861 F. Supp., at 1334, I
do not believe that the reference in Shaw I and Miller to "traditional"
districting principles, see Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 642; Miller, 515 U. S., at
916, was intended to prohibit a State from changing the process or policies
underlying the complex negotiating process that is modern redistricting.

Race as a Proxy

Faced with all this evidence that politics, not race, was thepredominant factor shaping the district lines, the plurality

ultimately makes little effort to contradict appellants' asser-tions that incumbency protection was far more important in
the placement of District 30's lines than race. See ante, at967-969. Instead, it adopts a fallback position based on an
argument far removed from even the "analytically distinct"claim set forth in

Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 652. In it, the plural-ity suggests that even if the predominant reason for the bizarre features of the majority-minority districts was incum-bency protection, the State impermissibly used race as a
proxy for determining the likely political affiliation of blocksof voters. See

ante, at 968-971 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).The effect of this process, in all likelihood, was relatively

unimportant to the overall shape of the district. A compari-son of the 1992 precinct results with a depiction of the proportion of black population in each census block reveals thatDemocratic-leaning precincts cover a far greater area than
majority-black census blocks. Compare State's Exh. 9Awith State's Exh. 45. One would expect the opposite effect
if the single-minded goal of those drawing the districts wasracial composition rather than political affiliation. At the
very least, the maps suggest that the drawing of boundariesinvolves a demographic calculus far more complex than
simple racial stereotyping.Furthermore, to the extent that race served as a proxy at
all, it did so merely as a means of "fine tuning" borders thatwere already in particular locations for primarily political
reasons. This "fine tuning" through the use of race is, ofcourse, little different from the kind of fine tuning that could
have legitimately occurred around the edges of a compact
majority-minority district.28 I perceive no reason why a

legitimate process--choosing minority voters for inclusionin a majority-minority district--should become suspect once

nonracial considerations force district lines away from itscore.

Finally, I note that in most contexts racial classifications
are invidious because they are irrational. For example, it isirrational to assume that a person is not qualified to vote or

to serve as a juror simply because she has brown hair orbrown skin. It is neither irrational, nor invidious, however,
to assume that a black resident of a particular community isa Democrat if reliable statistical evidence discloses that 97%
of the blacks in that community vote in Democratic primaryelections. See Brief for United States 44. For that reason,
the fact that the architects of the Texas plan sometimes appear to have used racial data as a proxy for making politicaljudgments seems to me to be no more "unjustified,"

ante, at
969 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), and to have no more constitutional significance, than an assumption that wealthy suburbanites, whether black or white, are more likely to be Repubargues that the State's effort to "compil[e] detailed racial data," ante, at
967, is evidence of the controlling role of race in the computer-dominated
process of redistricting. See ante, at 961-962; 861 F. Supp., at 1318-1319.
It is worth noting, however, that the State made no particular "effort" to
gather these data; it was included, along with similarly detailed information about sex, age, and income levels, in the data set provided by
the Census Bureau and imported wholesale into the State's redistricting
computers. Cf. Shaw, 861 F. Supp., at 457. Furthermore, even if the
computer was used to fine tune the district lines to ensure that minority
communities were included in District 30 (rather than individualized requests from candidates and their staffers on the basis of block-level data,
see supra, at 1017-1018), such a technique amounts to little more than the
use of a particularly efficient and accurate means of ensuring that the
intended nature of the district was not undermined as incumbency protection forced it out of a compact district. I do not suggest that the end can
always justify the means, but if those means are no more invidious than
the end itself, I do not understand why their use should affect the analysis.
I would not condemn state legislation merely because it was based on
accurate information.

licans than Communists.29 Requiring the State to ignore
the association between race and party affiliation would be
no more logical, and potentially as harmful, as it would be to
prohibit the Public Health Service from targeting AfricanAmerican communities in an effort to increase awareness
regarding sickle-cell anemia.30

Despite all the efforts by the plurality and the District
Court, then, the evidence demonstrates that race was not, in
all likelihood, the "predominant" goal leading to the creation
of District 30. The most reasonable interpretation of the
record evidence instead demonstrates that political considerations were. In accord with the presumption against interference with a legislature's consideration of complex and
competing factors, see n. 9, supra, I would conclude that the
configuration of District 30 does not require strict scrutiny.

29 "A prediction based on a racial characteristic is not necessarily more
reliable than a prediction based on some other group characteristic. Nor,
since a legislator's ultimate purpose in making the prediction is political
in character, is it necessarily more invidious or benign than a prediction
based on other group characteristics. In the line-drawing process, racial,
religious, ethnic, and economic gerrymanders are all species of political
gerrymanders." Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 88 (1980) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment) (footnote omitted).

To the extent that a political prediction based on race is incorrect, the
voters have an entirely obvious way to ensure that such irrationality is
not relied upon in the future: Vote for a different party. A legislator
relying on racial demographics to ensure his or her election will learn
a swift lesson if the presumptions upon which that reliance was based
are incorrect.

30 I find it particularly ironic that the Court considers the use of race

verboten in this benign context, while the Court just recently, on the basis
of evidence that, inter alia, "[m]ore than 90% of the persons sentenced in
1994 for crack cocaine trafficking were black," dismissed out of hand the
Ninth Circuit's assumption that "people of all races commit all types of
crimes." United States v. Armstrong, ante, at 469. The Ninth Circuit's
conclusion, it seems to me, is a model of the sort of race-neutral decisionmaking that this Court insists should be a part of constitutional decisionmaking processes.

The Houston districts present a closer question on the ap-plication of strict scrutiny. There is evidence that many of

the same race-neutral factors motivating the zigzags of Dis-trict 30 were present at the creation (or recreation) of Districts 29 and 18. In contrast to District 30, however, there isalso evidence that the interlocking shapes of the Houston districts were specifically, and almost exclusively, the result of an
effort to create, out of largely integrated communities, both
a majority-black and a majority-Hispanic district. For pur-poses of this opinion, then, I am willing to accept,

arguendo,
the plurality's conclusion that the Houston districts shouldbe examined with strict scrutiny.

31 Even so, the plurality

errs by concluding that these districts would fail that test.The plurality begins with the perfectly obvious assumptions that a State has a compelling interest in complyingwith $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act and that Texas had a strong
basis for believing that it would have violated that Act in1991 if it did not create three new majority-minority districts.32 The plurality goes on to conclude, however, thatbecause the final shape of these districts is not coextensive
with the community that would form the core of a $ 2 violation, these districts would not be "narrowly tailored" tofurther that state interest.

Ante, at 979. I respectfully
disagree.Neither evidence nor insinuation suggests that the State

in the redistricting process considered race for any reason

31 Although I conclude that no reasonable interpretation of the record
would require the application of strict scrutiny to District 30, I believe for
the reasons that follow that it, too, would survive strict scrutiny if it were
to be subject to that level of review.

32 While I believe that the evidence supporting the State's conclusions

in this regard is stronger than that suggested by the plurality or Justice
Kennedy in his concurring opinion, I will simply assume, arguendo, as
the plurality does, that the State had a reasonable fear of liability under

$ 2. See also supra, at 1007.

other than as a means of accomplishing its compelling inter-est of creating majority-minority districts in accord with the

Voting Rights Act. The goal was, by all accounts, achieved,for these districts would certainly avoid liability under $ 2 of
the Voting Rights Act.33 For reasons that continue to es-cape me, however, the plurality simply insists that the lack
of compactness in the districts prevents them from being"narrowly tailored" solutions to the State's interests.

The plurality uses two premises to reach its conclusionthat compactness is required to meet the "narrow tailoring"
requirement: (i) $ 2 would not have been violated unless areasonably compact majority-minority district could have
been created; and (ii) nothing in $ 2 requires the creation ofa noncompact district. I have no quarrel with either proposition, but each falls far short of mandating the conclusionthat the plurality draws from it. While a State can be liable
for a $ 2 violation only if it could have drawn a compact dis-trict and failed to do so, it does not follow that creating such
a district is the only way to avoid a $ 2 violation. See gener-ally Shaw II, ante, at 946-950 (

Stevens, J., dissenting).The plurality admits that a State retains "a limited degree

of leeway" in drawing a district to alleviate fears of $ 2 liabil-ity, ante, at 977, but if there is no independent constitutional
duty to create compact districts in the first place, and theplurality suggests none, there is no reason why noncompact
districts should not be a permissible method of avoiding vio-lations of law. The fact that they might be unacceptable judicial remedies does not speak to the question whether they

33 Even if the Court in Shaw II is correct in asserting that North Carolina's District 12 would not have allowed the State to avoid liability under

$ 2, see ante, at 916-918, no such plausible argument could be made in
these cases. The core of District 30, for instance, contains more than half
of all the African-American population in the district, and coincides precisely with the heart of the compact community that the State reasonably
believes would give rise to a $ 2 violation were it not placed in a majorityminority district. The same facts are true with respect to the Houston
districts.

may be acceptable when adopted by a state legislature. Be-cause these districts satisfy the State's compelling interest

and do so in a manner that uses racial considerations only ina way reasonably designed to ensure such a satisfaction, I
conclude that the districts are narrowly tailored.

VI
I cannot profess to know how the Court's developing juris-prudence of racial gerrymandering will alter the political and

racial landscape in this Nation--although it certainly willalter that landscape. As the Court's law in this area has
developed, it has become ever more apparent to me that theCourt's approach to these cases creates certain perverse
incentives and (I presume) unanticipated effects that serveto highlight the essentially unknown territory into which it
strides. Because I believe that the social and political riskscreated by the Court's decisions are not required by the Constitution, my first choice would be to avoid the precedinganalysis altogether, and leave these considerations to the
political branches of our Government.The first unintended outcome of the legal reasoning in
Shaw II and this case is the very result that those decisionsseek to avoid: the predominance of race in the districting
process, over all other principles of importance. Given theCourt's unwillingness to recognize the role that race-neutral
districting principles played in the creation of the bizarrelyshaped districts in both this case and Shaw II, it now seems
clear that the only way that a State can both create amajority-minority district and avoid a racial gerrymander is
by drawing, "without much conscious thought," ante, at 967(opinion of

O'Connor, J.), and within the "limited degree ofleeway" granted by the Court, ante, at 977, the precise compact district that a court would impose in a successful $ 2challenge. See post, at 1066-1067 (

Souter, J., dissenting).After the Court's decisions today, therefore, minority voters

can make up a majority only in compact districts, whether

Stevens, J., dissenting
intentionally or accidentally drawn, while white voters canbe placed into districts as bizarre as the State desires.

The great irony, of course, is that by requiring the Stateto place the majority-minority district in a particular place
and with a particular shape, the district may stand out as a
stark, placid island in a sea of oddly shaped majority-whiteneighbors. See Karlan, Still Hazy After All These Years:

Voting Rights in the Post-Shaw Era, 26 Cumberland L. Rev.287, 309 (1995-1996). The inviolable sanctity of the $ 2-
eligible districts will signal in a manner more blatant thanthe most egregious of these racial gerrymanders that "a minority community sits here: Interfere with it not." The
Court-imposed barriers limiting the shape of the district will
interfere more directly with the ability of minority voters to
participate in the political process than did the oddly shaped
districts that the Court has struck down in recent cases.
Unaffected by the new racial jurisprudence, majority-white
communities will be able to participate in the districting
process by requesting that they be placed into certain districts, divided between districts in an effort to maximize representation, or grouped with more distant communities that
might nonetheless match their interests better than communities next door. By contrast, none of this political maneuvering will be permissible for majority-minority districts,
thereby segregating and balkanizing them far more effectively than the districts at issue here, in which they were
manipulated in the political process as easily as white voters.
This result, it seems to me, involves "discrimination" in a
far more concrete manner than did the odd shapes that so
offended the Court's sensibilities in Miller, Shaw II, and
these cases.

In light of this Court's recent work extolling the importance of state sovereignty in our federal scheme, cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, ante, p. 44, I would have expected the Court's sensibilities to steer a course rather more
deferential to the States than the one that it charts with its

decisions today. As we have previously noted, "[e]lectoraldistricting is a most difficult subject for legislatures, and so

the States must have discretion to exercise the political judg-ment necessary to balance competing interests." Miller,
515 U. S., at 915; see also post, at 1047-1048 (Souter, J., dis-senting). The record in these cases evidences the "complex
interplay of forces that enter a legislature's redistrictingcalculus," 515 U. S., at 915-916, and the Court's failure to
respect those forces demonstrates even less respect for thelegislative process than I would have expected after the
decision in Miller.The results are not inconsequential. After

Miller and to-day's decisions, States may find it extremely difficult to avoid

litigation flowing from decennial redistricting. On one hand,States will risk violating the Voting Rights Act if they fail
to create majority-minority districts. If they create thosedistricts, however, they may open themselves to liability
under Shaw and its progeny. See Miller, 515 U. S., at 949(

Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Perhaps States will simplyavoid the problem by abandoning voluntary compliance with

$ 2 of the Voting Rights Act altogether. See Shaw I, 509U. S., at 672 (White, J., dissenting);

post, at 1063-1064 (Souter, J., dissenting).34 This result would not necessarilybring peace to redistricting, for there is no guarantee that

districts created by court order to comply with $ 2 will beimmune from attack under Shaw; in both Florida and Illinois,
for instance, that very sort of schizophrenic second-guessinghas already occurred. See

King v. State Bd. of Elections,

34 The difficulty of balancing between these competing legal requirements will only be exacerbated by the ability of litigants (and courts) to
use evidence proffered in defense by the State or its actors in one context
as evidence against the State in another. See n. 24, supra. While there
is nothing wrong with using prior inconsistent statements (to the extent
that they really are inconsistent), States will be all the more unwilling to
enter into the process at all given the certainty that they will be subject
to suits in which evidence offered in one as defense will be fodder for the
plaintiffs in another.

the difficulty of reconciling these competing legal responsi-bilities, the political realities of redistricting, and the cost of

ongoing litigation, some States may simply step out of the
redistricting business altogether, citing either frustration orhopes of getting a federal court to resolve the issues definitively in a single proceeding. See, e. g., Johnson v. Miller,922 F. Supp. 1556, 1559 (SD Ga. 1995) (after remand from

Regardless of the route taken by the States, the Court
has guaranteed that federal courts will have a hand--and
perhaps the only hand--in the "abrasive task of drawing district lines." Wells v. Rockefeller, 394 U. S. 542, 553 (1969)
(White, J., dissenting). Given the uniquely political nature
of the redistricting process, I fear the impact this new role
will have on the public's perception of the impartiality of
the Federal Judiciary. I can only reiterate the Court's cautionary admonition, issued over two decades ago, that "[i]n
fashioning a reapportionment plan or in choosing among
plans, a district court should not pre-empt the legislative
task nor `intrude upon state policy any more than necessary.' " White v. Weiser, 412 U. S., at 795 (citing Whitcomb
v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 160 (1971)).

I do not wish to leave the impression that decisions of the
Court from Shaw I to the present are focusing on entirely
nonexistent problems. I merely believe that the Court has
entirely misapprehended the nature of the harm that flows
from this sort of gerrymandering. Rather than attach
blameworthiness to a decision by the majority to share political power with the victims of past discriminatory practices,
the Court's real concern should be with the more significant
harms that flow from legislative decisions that "serve no

position of strength at a particular point in time, or todisadvantage a politically weak segment of the community."
Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 748 (1983) (Stevens, J.,
concurring). These cases are as good an illustration of suchself-serving behavior on the part of legislators as any--but

not with respect to racial gerrymandering. The real prob-lem is the politically motivated gerrymandering that occurred in Texas. Many of the oddest twists and turns of theTexas districts would never have been created if the legislature had not been so intent on protecting party and incum-bents. See also

Shaw II, ante, at 937-938 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting the same influences behind the bizarre shape
of North Carolina's District 12).By minimizing the critical role that political motives

played in the creation of these districts, I fear that the Court
may inadvertently encourage this more objectionable use
of power in the redistricting process.35 Legislatures and
elected representatives have a responsibility to behave in
a way that incorporates the "elements of legitimacy and
neutrality that must always characterize the performance of
the sovereign's duty to govern impartially." Cleburne, 473
U. S., at 452. That responsibility is not discharged when
legislatures permit and even encourage incumbents to use
their positions as public servants to protect themselves and
their parties rather than the interests of their constituents.
See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S., at 748, 754 (Stevens, J.,
concurring). If any lines in Texas are worth straightening,

35 The contrary is also possible, of course. Perhaps the burgeoning role
of federal courts in this process, along with their relative isolation from
the political pressures that motivate legislatures to bend district lines, will
mean that there will actually be fewer politically gerrymandered districts.
Regardless of whether political gerrymanders are more or less prevalent
after our decisions today, my point is the same: The Court has its hierarchy of values upside down.

The history of race relations in Texas and throughout theSouth demonstrates overt evidence of discriminatory voting

practices lasting through the 1970's. Brischetto, Richards,Davidson, & Grofman, Texas, in Quiet Revolution in the
South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, 1965-1990,pp. 233-248 (C. Davidson & B. Grofman eds. 1994). Even in
recent years, Texans have elected only two black candidatesto statewide office; majority-white Texas districts have
never elected a minority to either the State Senate orthe United States Congress. Brief for Appellants in No. 94-

806, p. 53. One recent study suggests that majority-whitedistricts throughout the South remain suspiciously unlikely

36 My view that a State may act unconstitutionally by gerrymandering
to minimize the influence of a group on the political process is consistent
with the belief that there is no constitutional error in the drawing of district lines based on benign racial considerations. As Justice Powell noted
in his opinion in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 165, there is a sharp
distinction between "gerrymandering in the `loose' sense" (i. e., the drawing of district lines to advance general political and social goals), and "gerrymandering that amounts to unconstitutional discrimination" (i. e., the
drawing of district lines for the sole purpose of " `occupy[ing] a position of
strength at a particular time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment of the community,' " id., at 164 (citing Karcher, 462 U. S., at 748
(Stevens, J., concurring)). See also 478 U. S., at 125, n. 9 ("[A] preference
for nonpartisan as opposed to partisan gerrymanders . . . merely recognizes that nonpartisan gerrymanders in fact are aimed at guaranteeing
rather than infringing fair group representation"). While I believe that
allegations of discriminatory intent and impact, if proved, should give rise
to a constitutional violation, Shaw, Miller, and these cases all involve allegations of both impact and intent that are far more diffuse than the allegations to which we have traditionally directed our most rigorous review.
See Shaw II, ante, at 921-923 (Stevens, J., dissenting); cf. Gomillion v.
Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960). Limiting the constitutional ban on gerrymandering to those claims alleging that a specific group (as opposed to every
group) has been harmed would be far more consistent with prior precedent
than the Court's still-developing jurisprudence of racial gerrymandering.

to elect black representatives. Davidson & Grofman, TheEffect of Municipal Election Structure on Black Representation in Eight Southern States, in Quiet Revolution inthe South, at 344. And nationwide, fewer than 15 of the
hundreds of legislators that have passed through Congresssince 1950 have been black legislators elected from majoritywhite districts.37 In 1994, for example, 36 of the Nation's 39black Representatives were elected from majority-minority
districts, while only 3 were elected from majority-whitedistricts.

38 See post, at 1050-1051 (Souter, J., dissenting).

Perhaps the state of race relations in Texas and, for thatmatter, the Nation, is more optimistic than might be expected in light of these facts. If so, it may be that theplurality's exercise in redistricting will be successful. Perhaps minority candidates, forced to run in majority-whitedistricts, will be able to overcome the long history of stereotyping and discrimination that has heretofore led the vastmajority of majority-white districts to reject minority candidacies. Perhaps not. I am certain only that bodies ofelected federal and state officials are in a far better position
than anyone on this Court to assess whether the Nation'slong history of discrimination has been overcome, and that
nothing in the Constitution requires this unnecessary in-trusion into the ability of States to negotiate solutions to
political differences while providing long-excluded groupsthe opportunity to participate effectively in the democratic
process. I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

When the Court devises a new cause of action to enforcea constitutional provision, it ought to identify an injury distinguishable from the consequences of concededly constitu-tional conduct, and it should describe the elements necessary
and sufficient to make out such a claim. Nothing less cangive notice to those whose conduct may give rise to liability
or provide standards for courts charged with enforcing theConstitution. Those principles of justification, fair notice,
and guidance have never been satisfied in the instance of theaction announced three Terms ago in

Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.630 (1993) (Shaw I), when a majority of this Court decided

that a State violates the Fourteenth Amendment's EqualProtection Clause by excessive consideration of race in drawing the boundaries of voting districts, even when the result-ing plan does not dilute the voting strength of any voters
and so would not otherwise give rise to liability under theFourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, or under the Voting
Rights Act.Far from addressing any injury to members of a class subjected to differential treatment, the standard presuppositionof an equal protection violation,

Shaw I addressed a putative
harm subject to complaint by any voter objecting to an unto-ward consideration of race in the political process. Although the Court has repeatedly disclaimed any intent togo as far as to outlaw all conscious consideration of race in
districting, after three rounds of appellate litigation seekingto describe the elements and define the contours of the

Shaw
cause of action, a helpful statement of a Shaw claim still
eludes this Court. This is so for reasons that go to theconceptual bone.

The result of this failure to provide a practical standardfor distinguishing between the lawful and unlawful use of
race has not only been inevitable confusion in statehousesand courthouses, but a consequent shift in responsibility for

Souter, J., dissenting
setting district boundaries from the state legislatures, which
are invested with front-line authority by Article I of the Constitution, to the courts, and truly to this Court, which is left
to superintend the drawing of every legislative district in
the land.

Today's opinions do little to solve Shaw's puzzles or return
districting responsibility to the States. To say this is not to
denigrate the importance of Justice O'Connor's position in
her separate opinion, ante, at 990-992, that compliance with

$ 2 of the Voting Rights Act is a compelling state interest; her
statement takes a very significant step toward alleviating
apprehension that Shaw is at odds with the Voting Rights
Act. It is still true, however, that the combined plurality,
minority, and Court opinions do not ultimately leave the law
dealing with a Shaw claim appreciably clearer or more manageable than Shaw I itself did. And to the extent that some
clarity follows from the knowledge that race may be considered when reasonably necessary to conform to the Voting
Rights Act, today's opinions raise the specter that this ostensible progress may come with a heavy constitutional price.
The price of Shaw I, indeed, may turn out to be the practical
elimination of a State's discretion to apply traditional districting principles, widely accepted in States without racial
districting issues as well as in States confronting them.

As the flaws of Shaw I persist, and as the burdens placed
on the States and the courts by Shaw litigation loom larger
with the approach of a new census and a new round of redistricting, the Court has to recognize that Shaw's problems
result from a basic misconception about the relation between
race and districting principles, a mistake that no amount of
case-by-case tinkering can eliminate. There is, therefore, no
reason for confidence that the Court will eventually bring
much order out of the confusion created by Shaw I, and
because it has not, in any case, done so yet, I respectfully
dissent.

As its text indicates and our cases have necessarily andrepeatedly recognized,

1 Article I of the Constitution places

responsibility for drawing voting districts on the States inthe first instance. See Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1 ("The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen everysecond Year by the People of the several States, and the
Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisitefor Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature"); Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1 ("The Times, Places and Manner ofholding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be
prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but theCongress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations"). The Court has nonetheless recognized limits onstate districting autonomy when it could discern a strong
constitutional justification and a reasonably definite standardfor doing so, as, for example, in announcing the numerical
requirement of one person, one vote, see Reynolds v. Sims,377 U. S. 533 (1964).

2 But the Court has never ignored the

Constitution's commitment of districting responsibility to thepolitical branches of the States and has accordingly assumed

over the years that traditional districting principles widelyaccepted among States represented an informal baseline of
acceptable districting practices. We have thus accorded
substantial respect to such traditional principles (as those,for example, meant to preserve the integrity of neighborhood

communities, to protect incumbents, to follow existing politi-cal boundaries, to recognize communities of interest, and to
achieve compactness and contiguity); we have seen theseobjectives as entirely consistent with the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments' demands. See, e. g., id., at 578 ("AState may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of
various political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and provide
for compact districts of contiguous territory in designing alegislative apportionment scheme");

White v. Weiser, 412

an atomistic exercise.3 Although it is the law of the Consti-tution that representatives represent people, not places or

things or particular interests, Reynolds, supra, at 562, thenotion of representative democracy within the federalist
framework presumes that States may group individual voters together in a way that will let them choose a representative not only acceptable to individuals but ready to represent widely shared interests within a district. Aleinikoff &

Lines After Shaw v. Reno, 92 Mich. L. Rev. 588, 601 (1993)
("It is only as collective partisans of the same political preference--whether that preference is defined by party or race
or any other measure--that voters can assert their right to
meaningful participation in the political process"). Hence,
in respecting the States' implementation of their own, traditional districting criteria, the Court has recognized the
basically associational character of voting rights in a representative democracy.

3 As Professor Issacharoff notes, our vote-dilution cases acknowledged
that "the right to cast an effective ballot implied more than simply the
equal weighting of all votes . . . . To be effective, a voter's ballot must
stand a meaningful chance of effective aggregation with those of likeminded voters to claim a just share of electoral results. For this reason,
any sophisticated right to genuinely meaningful electoral participation
must be evaluated and measured as a group right . . . ." Issacharoff,

Accordingly, before Shaw I, the Court required evidenceof substantial harm to an identifiable group of voters to

justify any judicial displacement of these traditional district-ing principles. Such evidence existed in

Reynolds v. Sims,supra, when the disparate weighting of votes was held unconstitutional, and it was present again when the Court rec-ognized the unconstitutional consequences of vote dilution,
see Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124 (1971); White v.
Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973). In the one case, the harmwas mathematically identifiable; in the other, the arithmetic

provided powerful circumstantial evidence of the impossibil-ity of political success for the chosen candidate of a racial
and numerical minority in an area with pervasive racial-blocvoting. In both cases, the complainants were from an easily
identified group of voters; and even in cases of racial vote-dilution claims, which were conceptually more difficult to
state than the principle of one person, one vote, there werereadily recognized examples of the harm in question. Indeed, even when one acknowledged that voters would beserved by a representative not of their own race and that
the Constitution guaranteed no right to pick a winner, see
Whitcomb, supra, at 153-155, it was impossible to see merehappenstance in the facts that the American voting-age population was 10.5% black, but the Congress that assembled in1981 had only 17 black representatives out of 435 and no
black senator. Statistical Abstract of the United States,1982-83, p. 490 (103d ed. 1982) (Table 802); Black Americans:

foreign-born, or who had been residents of the state for more than five

to hope that conditions are improving. See infra, at 1076 (discussing
elections in which crossover voting favors minority incumbents and in
which racial issues have not played a significant role in the outcome). As
I discuss in detail in Part IV, infra, I believe that these improvements
may be attributed in large part to the effect of the Voting Rights Act, and
thus to our willingness to allow race-conscious districting in certain
situations.

5 I recognize, of course, that elsewhere we have imposed prohibitions on

the consideration of race, but contexts are crucial in determining how we
define "equal opportunity." Consider our decisions on peremptory jury
challenges. There, as in politics, one race may not have had a fair shake
from the other. But the differences between jury decisionmaking and
political decisionmaking are, I believe, important ones. Politics includes
choices between different sets of social values, choices that may ultimately
turn on the ability of a particular group to enforce its demands through
the ballot box. Jury decisionmaking is defined as a neutral process, the
impartial application of law to a set of objectively discovered facts. To
require racial balance in jury selection would risk redefining the jury's
role. Without denying the possibility that race, especially as an imperfect
proxy for experience, makes a difference in jury decisionmaking (and, in
some cases, legitimately so), it seems to me that the better course is to

Before Shaw I, we not only thus limited judicial interfer-ence with state districting efforts to cases of readily demonstrable harm to an identifiable class of voters, but we alsoconfined our concern with districting to cases in which we
were capable of providing a manageable standard for courtsto apply and for legislators to follow. Within two years of
holding in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), that malappor-tionment was a justiciable issue, "the Court recognized that
its general equal protection jurisprudence was insufficientfor the task and announced an increasingly rigid, simple to
apply, voting-specific mandate of equipopulousity." Karlan,Still Hazy After All These Years: Voting Rights in the PostShaw Era, 26 Cumberland L. Rev. 287, 299 (1996) (herein-after Karlan, Post-Shaw Era). Likewise, although it is
quite true that the common definition of a racial vote-dilutioninjury ("less opportunity . . . to participate in the political
process and to elect representatives . . . ," 42 U. S. C.$ 1973(b)) is no model of concrete description, the Court has
identified categories of readily comprehensible evidencebearing on the likelihood of such an injury, including facts
about size of minority population, quantifiable indications ofpolitical cohesiveness and bloc voting, historical patterns of

ensure a fair shake by denying each side the right to make race-based
selections. The cost of the alternative is simply too great. It is an entirely different matter, however, to recognize that racial groups, like all
other groups, play a real and legitimate role in political decisionmaking.
It involves nothing more than an acknowledgment of the reality that our
concepts of common interest, geography, and personal allegiances are in
many places simply too bound up with race to deny some room for a theory
of representative democracy allowing for the consideration of racially conceived interests. A majority of the Court has never disagreed in principle
with this position. See, e. g., Shaw I, 509 U. S. 630, 642 (1993) (noting
that race-conscious redistricting is not always unconstitutional); Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 928-929 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (consideration of race in the redistricting process does not always violate the
Constitution); ante, at 958 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (noting that strict
scrutiny does "not apply merely because redistricting is performed with
consciousness of race").

success or failure of favored candidates, and so on. See, e. g.,Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986); White v. Regester,

412 U. S., at 766-770. The particularity of this evidencegoes far to separate victims of political "inequality" from
those who just happened to support losing candidates.

B
Shaw I, however, broke abruptly with these standards, in-cluding the very understanding of equal protection as a practical guarantee against harm to some class singled out fordisparate treatment. Whereas malapportionment measurably reduces the influence of voters in more populous dis-tricts, and vote dilution predestines members of a racial minority to perpetual frustration as political losers, what ShawI spoke of as harm is not confined to any identifiable class
singled out for disadvantage. See Shaw v. Hunt, ante, at923-925, 928

(Shaw II) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting theabsence of a customary disadvantaged class and describing

the Shaw I cause of action as a substantive due process,rather than an equal protection, claim). If, indeed, what
Shaw I calls harm is identifiable at all in a practical sense, itwould seem to play no favorites, but to fall on every citizen
and every representative alike. The Court in Shaw I ex-plained this conception of injury by saying that the forbidden
use of race "reinforces the perception that members of thesame racial group . . . think alike, share the same political
interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls,"and that it leads elected officials "to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of thatgroup, rather than their constituency as a whole."

Shaw I,509 U. S., at 647-648. This injury is probably best understood as an "expressive harm," that is, one that "results fromthe idea or attitudes expressed through a governmental
action, rather than from the more tangible or material conse-quences the action brings about." Pildes & Niemi, Expressive Harms, "Bizarre Districts," and Voting Rights: Evaluat517us3$68m 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

ing Election-District Appearances after Shaw v. Reno, 92
Mich. L. Rev. 483, 506-507 (1993); see also id., at 493 ("The
theory of voting rights [that Shaw I] endorses centers on the
perceived legitimacy of structures of political representation,
rather than on the distribution of actual political power between racial or political groups"). To the extent that racial
considerations do express such notions, their shadows fall on
majorities as well as minorities, whites as well as blacks,
the politically dominant as well as the politically impotent.
Thus, as an injury supposed to be barred by the Equal Protection Clause, this subject of the "analytically distinct"
cause of action created by Shaw I, supra, at 652, bears virtually no resemblance to the only types of claims for gerrymandering we had deemed actionable following Davis v.
Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986), those involving districting
decisions that removed an identifiable class of disfavored
voters from effective political participation. See, e. g.,
Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960); Thornburg v.
Gingles, supra.6

Just as the logic of traditional equal protection analysis is
at odds with Shaw's concept of injury, so the Court's rhetoric
of racially motivated injury is inapposite to describe the consideration of race that it thinks unreasonable. Although the
Court used the metaphor of "political apartheid" as if to refer
to the segregation of a minority group to eliminate its association with a majority that opposed integration, Shaw I,
supra, at 647, talk of this sort of racial separation is not on
point here. The de jure segregation that the term "political

violation of the Equal Protection Clause, there still might be a use of race
that harms all district voters because it is used to an unreasonable degree.
But see Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 489 (1982). But the Court
has never succeeded in identifying how much is too much, having adopted
a "predominant purpose" test that amounts to a practical repudiation of
any hope of devising a workable standard. See Part I-C, infra.

apartheid" brings to mind is unconstitutional because it em-phatically implies the inferiority of one race. See

Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954) ("To separate[minority children] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community"). Shaw I, in con-trast, vindicated the complaint of a white voter who objected

not to segregation but to the particular racial proportions ofthe district. See Karlan, Our Separatism? Voting Rights
as an American Nationalities Policy, 1995 U. Chi. LegalForum 83, 94 (hereinafter Karlan, Our Separatism) (noting
the irony of using the term "apartheid" to describe what
are "among the most integrated districts in the country").
Whatever this district may have symbolized, it was not
"apartheid." Nor did the proportion of its racial mixture
reflect any purpose of racial subjugation, the district in question having been created in an effort to give a racial minority
the same opportunity to achieve a measure of political power
that voters in general, and white voters and members of ethnic minorities in particular, have enjoyed as a matter of
course. In light of a majority-minority district's purpose to
allow previously submerged members of racial minorities
into the active political process, this use of race cannot plausibly be said to affect any individual or group in any sense
comparable to the injury inflicted by de jure segregation. It
obviously conveys no message about the inferiority or outsider status of members of the white majority excluded from
a district. And because the condition addressed by creating
such a district is a function of numbers, the plan implies
nothing about the capacity or value of the minority to which
it gives the chance of electoral success.

Added to the anomalies of Shaw I 's idea of equal protection
injury and the rhetoric of its descriptions, there is a further
conceptual inadequacy in Shaw I. Whereas it defines injury
as the reinforcement of the notion that members of a racial
group will prefer the same candidates at the polls, the imme517us3$68m 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

diate object of the constitutional prohibition against the in-tentional dilution of minority voting strength is to protect

the right of minority voters to make just such a preferenceeffective. There would, for example, be no vote dilution by
virtue of racial-bloc voting unless voters of a racial minority
would themselves tend to stick together in voting for a givencandidate (perhaps, though not necessarily, of their own race,

as well). Indeed, if there were no correlation between raceand candidate preference, it would make no sense to say that
minority voters had less opportunity than others to electwhom they would; they would be part of the mainstream and
the winners would be their own choices. When voting is
thus racially polarized, it is just because of this polarization
that majority-minority districts provide the only practical
means of avoiding dilution or remedying the dilution injury
that has occurred already. Shaw I has thus placed those
who choose to avoid the long-recognized constitutional harm
of vote dilution at risk by casting doubt on the legitimacy of
its classic remedy; the creation of a majority-minority district "reinforces" the notion that there is a correlation between race and voting, for that correlation is the very condition on which the success of the court-ordered remedy
depends. So it is that the Court's definition of injury is so
broad as to cover constitutionally necessary efforts to prevent or remedy a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments and of $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

One way to temper the overreach of the Court's concept
of injury (though it would not avoid the difficulty that there
is no equal protection injury in the usual sense, discussed
above, see supra, at 1050) would be simply to exclude by
definition from Shaw I injury a use of race in districting that
is reasonably necessary to remedy or avoid dilution; the
Court's move at least in this direction, see infra, at 1066-
1069, is a sound one, as is its continuing recognition (despite
its broad definition of harm) that not every intentional creation of a majority-minority district requires strict scrutiny.

See ante, at 958; ante, at 993 (O'Connor, J., concurring); cf.Miller, 515 U. S., at 928 (

O'Connor, J., concurring). But thesuggested qualification would fall short of eliminating the

difficulty caused by the existing definition, for the uses ofrace to remedy past dilution or to hedge against future dilution are not the only legitimate uses of race that are covered,and threatened, by the overbreadth of the Shaw injury.
This will become clear in examining the Court's efforts tosolve its definitional problems by relying upon the degree to
which race is used in defining the injury it discerns.

C
The Court's failure to devise a concept of Shaw harm thatdistinguishes those who are injured from those who are not,

or to differentiate violation from remedy, is matched by itsinability to provide any manageable standard to distinguish
forbidden districting conduct from the application of tradi-tional state districting principles and the plans that they
produce. This failure, while regrettable, need not haveoccurred, for when the Court spoke in Shaw I of a district
shape so "bizarre" as to be an unequivocal indication thatrace had influenced the districting decision to an unreasonable degree, Shaw I could have been pointing to some work-able criterion of shape translatable into objective standards.
Leaving Shaw's theoretical inadequacies aside, it would havebeen possible to devise a cause of action that rested on the
expressive character of a district's shape, and created a safeharbor in the notion of a compact district objectively quantified in terms of dispersion, perimeter, and population. SeePildes & Niemi, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 553-575. Had the
Court followed this course, the districts whose grotesqueshapes provoke the sharpest reaction would have been eliminated in racially mixed States, which would have known howto avoid Shaw violations and, thus, federal judicial intrusion.
Shaw would have been left a doctrinal incongruity, but notan unmanageable one.

The Court, however, rejected this opportunity last Termin Miller v. Johnson, supra, when it declined to contain

Shaw by any standard sufficiently quantifiable to guide thedecisions of state legislators or to inform and limit review
of districting decisions by the courts. The Court rejectedshape as a sufficient condition for finding a

Shaw viola-tion, or even a necessary one. 515 U. S., at 915. See also

Issacharoff, The Constitutional Contours of Race and Poli-tics, 1995 S. Ct. Rev. 45, 56 (hereinafter Issacharoff, Constitutional Contours) ("Miller is rather categorical in its refusalto limit the application of the equal protection clause to bizarre districts alone"). Instead, it recharacterized the causeof action in terms devised in other cases addressing essentially different problems, by proscribing the consideration ofrace when it is the "predominant factor motivating the legislatur[e]," 515 U. S., at 916, or when the use of race is "insubstantial disregard of customary and traditional districting
practices," id., at 928 (O'Connor, J., concurring).As a standard addressed to the untidy world of politics,
neither "predominant factor" nor "substantial disregard" in-spires much hope.

7 It is true of course that the law rests

certain other liability decisions on the feasibility of untan-gling mixed motives, and courts and juries manage to do the

be said that a legislature or administrative body operatingunder a broad mandate made a decision motivated solely by
a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the`dominant' or `primary' one"). At first glance, then, it may
not seem entirely out of the question for courts to sort outthe strands in

Shaw cases. But even this cool comfortwould be misplaced.

While a court may be entitled to some confidence that inmost cases it will be able, for example, to distinguish the
relative strength of an employer's dissatisfaction with an em-ployee's job performance from his displeasure over a worker's union membership, see NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 403-405 (1983), such confidencewould be unwarranted in the districting context. It is not

merely that the very nature of districting decisions makes itdifficult to identify whether any particular consideration, racial or otherwise, was the "predominant motive," though thatis certainly true:

"Districting plans are integrated bundles of compro-mises, deals and principles. To ask about the reason
behind the design of any one particular district is typi-cally to implicate the entire pattern of purposes and
trade-offs behind a districting plan as a whole. Search-ing for `the reason' or `the dominant reason' behind a
particular district's shape is often like asking why oneyear's federal budget is at one level rather than another.

cific shape of even one district is to impose a model of
legalistic decisionmaking on the one political process
that least resembles that model." Pildes & Niemi,
supra, at 585-586 (footnote omitted).

The reason that use of the predominant motive standard
in reviewing a districting decision is bound to fail is more
fundamental than that: in the political environment in which
race can affect election results, many of these traditional
districting principles cannot be applied without taking race
into account and are thus, as a practical matter, inseparable
from the supposedly illegitimate racial considerations. See
Pildes & Niemi, supra, at 578 ("[R]ace frequently correlates
with other socioeconomic factors. In evaluating oddly
shaped districts, this correlation will require courts to attempt to untangle legitimate communities of interest from
the now-illegitimate one of race. If blacks as blacks cannot
be grouped into a `highly irregular' district, but urban residents or the poor can, how will courts distinguish these contexts, and under what mixed-motive standard?"); Issacharoff,
Constitutional Contours 58 ("Given the palpability of racial
concerns in the political arena, [Miller's causation standard
could] either doom all attempts to distribute political power
in multi-ethnic communities or . . . fail to provide a basis
for distinguishing proper from improper considerations in
redistricting").

If, for example, a legislature may draw district lines to
preserve the integrity of a given community, leaving it intact
so that all of its members are served by one representative,
this objective is inseparable from preserving the community's racial identity when the community is characterized, or
even self-defined, by the race of the majority of those who
live there. This is an old truth, having been recognized
every time the political process produced an Irish or Italian
or Polish ward.

Or take the traditional principle of providing protectionfor incumbents. The plurality seems to assume that incumbents may always be protected by drawing lines on the basisof data about political parties. Cf.

ante, at 967-968, 970-971.But what if the incumbent has drawn support largely for

racial reasons? What, indeed, if the incumbent was electedin a majority-minority district created to remedy vote dilution that resulted from racial-bloc voting? It would besheer fantasy to assume that consideration of race in these
circumstances is somehow separable from application of thetraditional principle of incumbency protection, and sheer
incoherence to think that the consideration of race that
is constitutionally required to remedy Fourteenth and Fif-teenth Amendment vote dilution somehow becomes unconstitutional when aimed at protecting the incumbent the next
time the census requires redistricting.Thus, it is as impossible in theory as in practice to untangle racial consideration from the application of traditionaldistricting principles in a society plagued by racial-bloc voting 8 with a racial minority population of political significance,or at least the unrealized potential for achieving it. And it

certain traditional districting principles may involve a legitimate consideration of race.

is for just this fundamental reason that a test turning on
predominant purpose is incapable of producing any answer
when traditional districting principles are applied in the
political environment in which Shaw I actions are brought.

II
Shaw I 's recognition of a misuse of race in districting even
when no vote dilution results thus rests upon two basic deficiencies: first, the failure to provide a coherent concept of
equal protection injury, there being no separably injured
class and no concept of harm that would not condemn a constitutionally required remedy for past dilution as well as
many of the districting practices that the Court is seeking
to preserve; second, the failure to provide a coherent test for
distinguishing a "predominant" racial consideration from the
application of traditional districting principles in a society
whose racial mixture is politically significant and where
racial-bloc voting exists. The necessary consequence of
these shortcomings is arbitrariness; it is impossible to distinguish what is valid from what is not, or to decide how far
members of racial minorities may engage "in the same sort
of pluralist electoral politics that every other bloc of voters
enjoys." Karlan, Our Separatism 103. Indeed, if one
needed further proof of this arbitrariness, one need go no
further than Justice Stevens's dissent in this case. The
plurality effectively concedes that Justice Stevens has not
unfairly applied the principles governing the Shaw cause of
action, cf. ante, at 971, n. (noting that "[i]n the application of
our precedents to District 30, our disagreement with Justice Stevens' dissent, [ante], at 1014-1031, is largely factual"); in my judgment he has faithfully applied those principles in the spirit intended by the plurality. And yet the
conclusions that the two sides reach after applying precisely
the same test could not be more different.

Along with this endemic unpredictability has come the
destruction of any clear incentive for the States with substantial minority populations to take action to avoid vote
dilution. Before Shaw, state politicians who recognized that
minority vote dilution had occurred, or was likely to occur
without redistricting aimed at preventing it, could not only
urge their colleagues to do the right thing under the Fourteenth Amendment, but counsel them in terrorem that losing
a dilution case would bring liability for counsel fees under 42
U. S. C. $ 1988(b) or 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(e). See Issacharoff,
Constitutional Contours 48 ("Minority political actors could
leverage not only their political power but the enforcement
provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and the
threat of suit under Section 2 of the Act against adverse
districting decisions"); cf. Hastert v. Illinois State Bd. of
Election Commr's, 28 F. 3d 1430, 1444 (CA7 1993) (awarding
fees to the prevailing parties in a case in which the state
legislature failed to draw congressional districts, over the
Board of Elections's objection that it had "no interest in the
eventual outcome except that there be an outcome" for it
to implement) (emphasis in original). But this argument is
blunted now, perhaps eliminated in practice, by the risk of
counsel fees in a Shaw I action. States seeking to comply
in good faith with the requirements of federal civil rights
laws "now find themselves walking a tightrope: if they draw
majority-black districts they face lawsuits under the equal
protection clause; if they do not, they face both objections
under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and lawsuits under
section 2." Karlan, Post-Shaw Era 289. See ante, at 1037
(Stevens, J., dissenting) ("On one hand, States will risk violating the Voting Rights Act if they fail to create majorityminority districts. If they create those districts, however,
they may open themselves to liability under Shaw and its
progeny"). The States, in short, have been told to get
things just right, no dilution and no predominant consider517us3$68m 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

ation of race short of dilution, without being told how to doit. The tendency of these conflicting incentives is toward a

stalemate, and neither the moral force of the Constitutionnor the mercenary threat of liability can operate effectively
in this obscurity.As a consequence, where once comprehensible districting
obligations confronted the legislators and governors of theStates, there is now a vacuum of responsibility in any State
with the mixed population from which Shaw suits come. Wecan no longer say with the old assurance that such States
have a duty to comply with federal requirements in district-ing, since a State, like an individual, can hardly be blamed
for failing to fulfill an obligation that has never been ex-plained. It is true, of course, that a State may suffer consequences if the ultimate arbiter decides on a result differentfrom the one the State has put in place, but that bad luck
does not change the fact that a State cannot be said to beobliged to apply a standard that has not been revealed. Because the responsibility for the result can only be said torest with the final arbiter, the practical responsibility over
districting has simply shifted from the political branches ofthe States with mixed populations to the courts, and to this
Court in particular. "The Court has apparently set itselfupon a course of . . . reviewing challenged districts one by
one and issuing opinions that depend so idiosyncratically onthe unique facts of each case that they provide no real
guidance to either lower courts or legislatures." Karlan,Post-Shaw Era 288. The tragedy in this shift of political
responsibility lies not only in the fact of its occurrencein this instance, but in the absence of coherent or persuasive
justifications for causing it to occur.

III
Although today's cases do not address the uncertaintiesthat stem from

Shaw's underlying incoherence, they do aimto mitigate its inscrutability with some specific rules.

A
In each of today's cases, the Court expressly assumes thatavoiding a violation of the Voting Rights Act qualifies as a

sufficiently compelling government interest to satisfy the re-quirements of strict scrutiny. See

ante, at 977 ("As we havedone in each of our three previous cases . . . , we assume

without deciding that compliance with the results test [of$ 2 of the Voting Rights Act] . . . can be a compelling state
interest"); Shaw II, ante, at 915 ("We assume, arguendo, forthe purpose of resolving this case, that compliance with $ 2
could be a compelling interest"). While the Court's decisionto assume this important point,

arguendo, is no holding, seeSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, ante, at 125 (S

outer, J.,dissenting), the assumption itself is encouraging because it

confirms the view that the intentional creation of majority-minority districts is not necessarily a violation of

Shaw I,
ante, at 958 (strict scrutiny does not "apply to all cases ofintentional creation of majority-minority districts"), and it

indicates that the Court does not intend to bring the Shawcause of action to what would be the cruelly ironic point
of finding in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (as amended) aviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
guarantee. Cf. Pildes & Niemi, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 498(observing that "[i]f the Court believed there were serious
constitutional questions with the fundamental structure ofthis scheme, the Court had numerous means to avoid permitting an unconstitutionally composed legislature to assumepower," and seeing the reservation of this question in

Voino-vich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at 157, as "evidence that a majority

of the Court is not prepared to find a general ban on race-conscious districting in the Constitution").

Justice O'Connor's separate opinion, ante, at 990-992, bears on each ofthese points all the more emphatically, for her view that compliance with $ 2 is (not just arguendo) a compelling state in-terest and her statement of that position virtually insulate
the Voting Rights Act from jeopardy under Shaw as such.

B
The second point of reference to come out of today's casesis the rule that if a State begins its map-drawing efforts with

a compact majority-minority district required by Gingles,the State may not rely too heavily on racial data in adjusting that district to serve traditional districting principles.While this rule may indeed provide useful guidance to state
legislatures, its inherent weakness is clear from what wassaid above, supra, at 1060-1062: it is in theory and in fact impossible to apply "traditional districting principles" in areaswith substantial minority populations without considering
race. As to some of those principles, to be sure, the ban onthe overuse of racial data may not have much significance;
racially identified communities can be identified in otherways and will be, after today. But protecting a minority
incumbent may be another matter, since we cannot assume,as the plurality does, that reliance on information about
"party affiliation" will serve to protect a minority incumbent,and we cannot tell when use of racial data will go too far on
the plurality's view, ante, at 962-963. It therefore may wellbe that loss of the capacity to protect minority incumbency
is the price of the rule limiting States' use of racial data. Ifso, it will be an exceedingly odd result, when the whole point
of creating yesterday's majority-minority district was toremedy prior dilution, thus permitting the election of the
minority incumbent who (the Court now seems to declare)cannot be protected as any other incumbent could be.

C
The third point of reference attributable to today's casesis as yet only a possibility; a suggestion in the discussions of

the narrow tailoring test that States seeking to avoid violat-ing $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act may draw the district that
the Voting Rights Act compels, and this district alone. See
Shaw II, ante, at 915-918 (rejecting North Carolina's Dis-trict 12 because it does not sufficiently coincide with the

assumed Gingles district); ante, at 1035 (Stevens, J., dis-senting) ("[I]t now seems clear that the only way that a State

can both create a majority-minority district and avoid a ra-cial gerrymander is by drawing . . . within the `limited degree of leeway' granted by the Court . . . the precise compact
district that a court would impose in a successful $ 2 chal-lenge"). If the Court were to say that a district drawn to

avoid dilution must respond to the dilution threat in somegeographically exact way, but see

Shaw II, ante, at 916, n. 8
(suggesting that States may have flexibility in complyingwith $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act);

ante, at 1037 (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (noting that States traditionally have enjoyed
a broader discretion in drawing district lines), then presumably a district drawn in a race-conscious fashion could
survive only if it was as compact as the Gingles district hypothesized for purposes of stating a vote-dilution claim, and
positioned where the hypothetical district would be.

If the Court ultimately were to reach such a conclusion, it
would in one respect be taking a step back toward Shaw I
and its suggestion that a district's shape might play an important, if not determinative role in establishing a cause of
action. Such a step would, however, do much more than
return to Shaw I, which suggested that a compact district
would be a safe haven, but not that the district hypothesized
under Gingles was the only haven. See, e. g., Shaw I, 509
U. S., at 646 ("The district lines may be drawn, for example,
to provide for compact districts of contiguous territory, or to
maintain the integrity of political subdivisions").

I refer to this step as a "possibility" deliberately. The
Court in Shaw II does not go beyond an intimation to this
effect, and Bush raises doubt that the Court would go so
far. See ante, at 977-978 (rejecting the argument made by
Justice Stevens); see also ante, at 978 ("[T]he States retain a flexibility that federal courts enforcing $ 2 lack . . . .
And nothing that we say today should be read as limiting

ples' "); but see ante, at 994 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[I]fa State pursues that compelling interest by creating a district that `substantially addresses' the potential liability, anddoes not deviate substantially from a hypothetical courtdrawn $ 2 district for predominantly racial reasons, its districting plan will be deemed narrowly tailored" (citationsomitted)); but see also

ante, at 977 ("We also reaffirm that
the `narrow tailoring' requirement of strict scrutiny allowsthe States a limited degree of leeway in furthering such interests. . . . We thus reject, as impossibly stringent, the Dis-trict Court's view of the narrow tailoring requirement, that
`a district must have the least possible amount of irregularity
in shape, making allowances for traditional districting criteria' " (citation omitted)). Indeed, Bush leaves open the possibility that a State could create a majority-minority district
that does not coincide with the Gingles shape so long as
racial data are not overused, ante, at 962, 981, and it does

not suggest that a Shaw claim could be premised solely on a
deviation from a Gingles district.

Suffice it to say for now that if the Court were to try to
render Shaw more definite by imposing any such limitations
on shape and placement, the added measure of clarity would
either be elusive or it would come at an exorbitant price from
States seeking to comply with the Voting Rights Act and the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. It would be elusive if the Court meant that race could be considered in
alleviating racial dilution but not in applying any traditional
districting principle: we have already seen that race is inextricably intertwined with some common districting principles when applied in a multiracial society. See supra, at
1060-1062. Or it would come at an exorbitant price, because
no other districting principle would be allowed to affect the
compactness or placement that would be required for purposes of Gingles. The Court would thus be cutting back on
a State's power to vary district shape through its application
of the very districting principles that are supposed to pre517us3$68m 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., dissenting
dominate in importance over racial consideration. Thatis, the Court would be reducing the discretion of a State

seeking to avoid or correct dilution to the scope of a fed-eral court's discretion when devising a remedy for dilution.
There could, of course, be no justification for taking any suchstep. While there is good reason to limit a federal court's
discretion to interfere in a State's political process when itemploys its remedial power in dilution cases, cf.

Voinovich v.Quilter, 507 U. S., at 156 ("Federal courts are barred from

intervening in state apportionment in the absence of a viola-tion of federal law precisely because it is the domain of the
States . . . to conduct apportionment"), there is no apparentreason to impose the same limitations upon the discretion
accorded to a State subject to an independent constitutionalduty to make apportionment decisions, see

ibid. ("Becausethe States . . . derive their reapportionment authority . . .

from independent provisions of state and federal law, . . . thefederal courts are bound to respect the States' apportionment choices unless those choices contravene federal require-ments") (internal quotation marks omitted). The principles
of federalism that we have tried to follow strongly counselagainst imposing any such limitations.

D
In sum, the three steps the Court takes today toward amore definite cause of action either fail to answer the objections to Shaw I or prompt objections of their own. Recogni-tion of a State's interest in complying with the Voting Rights
Act does not address the practical impossibility courts willencounter in identifying a predominant use of race, as distinguished from some lesser, reasonable consideration of it,when a State applies its customary districting principles.
The limitation on the use of racial data is unlikely to makemuch difference in practice except to jeopardize minority incumbency protection. And the possibility that the Courtwill require Gingles districts (or districts substantially close

to them) when compliance with $ 2 of the Voting Rights Actis an object of districting would render a State's districting

obligation more definite only by eliminating its ability toapply the very districting principles traditionally considered
to be important enough to furnish a theoretical baseline ofreasonable districting practices.

IV
If today's developments fall short of curing Shaw'sunworkability, it must be said that options for addressing

them are few. Assuming that Shaw is not to be overruledas a flawed experiment, the Court may select from two
alternatives, depending on whether its weightier concernis to preserve traditional districting principles or to cure
the anomalies created by Miller's "predominant purpose"criterion.

If the Court's first choice is to preserve Shaw in someguise with the least revolutionary effect on districting principles and practice, the Court could give primacy to the prin-ciple of compactness and define the limits of tolerance for
unorthodox district shape by imposing a measurable limita-tion on the bizarre, presumably chosen by reference to historical practice (adjusted to eliminate the influence of anydilution that very practice may have caused in the past, cf.
Pildes & Niemi, 92 Mich. L. Rev., at 573-574, n. 246 (discuss-ing the egregious racial gerrymanders of the 19th century))
and calculated on the basis of a district's dispersion, perime-ter, and population. See

id., at 553-575. This alternativewould be true to Shaw I in maintaining that a point can be

reached when the initially lawful consideration of race be-comes unreasonable and in identifying appearance as the expression of undue consideration; and it would eliminate Miller's impossible obligation to untangle racial considerationsfrom so-called "race-neutral" objectives (such as according

respect to community integrity and protecting the seats of

1071Cite as: 517 U. S. 952 (1996)
Souter, J., dissenting
incumbents) when the racial composition of a district and
voter behavior bar any practical chance of separating them.
The incongruities of Shaw's concept of injury when considered in light of our customary equal protection analysis, our
remedial practice, and traditional respect for state districting discretion would, of course, persist, but if Shaw were
defined by measures that identified forbidden shape as the
manifestation of unreasonable racial emphasis, we would at
least provide the notice and guidance that are missing from
the law today.

The other alternative for retaining a Shaw cause of action
in some guise would be to accept the fact that, in the kind of
polarized multiracial societies that will generate Shaw actions as presently understood, racial considerations are inseparable from many traditional districting objectives, making it impossible to speak of race as predominating. The
consequence of facing this reality is that if some consideration of race is to be forbidden as supposedly unreasonable
in degree, then the use of districting principles that implicate
the use of race must be forbidden. That is, traditional districting practices must be eliminated. Such a result would,
of course, be consistent with Shaw I 's concept of injury as
affecting voters of whatever race. But cf. Valley Forge
Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 489 (1982) (fact that
some expressive harms are insufficient to satisfy Article III
standing requirements does not allow for relaxation of those
requirements). The result, in short, would be colorblindness in determining the manner of choosing representatives,
either by eliminating the practice of districting entirely, or
by replacing it with districting on some principle of randomness that would not account for race in any way.

While such is the direction in which Shaw and Miller
together point, the objections to following any such course
seem insurmountable. The first is the irony that the price

517us3$68m 02-19-99 11:09:45 PAGES OPINPGT
1072 BUSH v. VERA

Souter, J., dissenting
of imposing a principle of colorblindness in the name of the
Fourteenth Amendment would be submerging the votes of
those whom the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
were adopted to protect, precisely the problem that necessitated our recognition of vote dilution as a constitutional violation in the first place. Eliminating districting in the name
of colorblindness would produce total submersion; random
submersion (or packing) would result from districting by
some computerized process of colorblind randomness. Thus,
unless the attitudes that produce racial-bloc voting were
eliminated along with traditional districting principles, dilution would once again become the norm. While dilution as
an intentional constitutional violation would be eliminated
by a randomly districted system, this theoretical nicety
would be overshadowed by the concrete reality that the
result of such a decision would almost inevitably be a socalled "representative" Congress with something like 17
black members. See supra, at 1050. In any event, the
submergence would violate the prohibition of even nonintentional dilution found in $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
The only way to avoid this conflict would be to declare the
Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, a prospect hardly in harmony with the Court's readiness to assume today that compliance with the Voting Rights Act qualifies as a compelling
state interest for purposes of litigating a Shaw claim.

The second objection is equally clear. Whatever may be
the implications of what I have called Shaw's failings, the
Court has repeatedly made it plain that Shaw was in no way
intended to effect a revolution by eliminating traditional
districting practice for the sake of colorblindness. Shaw I,
509 U. S., at 642 ("Despite their invocation of the ideal of
a `color-blind' Constitution, see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.
537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting), appellants appear
to concede that race-conscious districting is not always
unconstitutional. . . . That concession is wise: This Court

never has held that race-conscious state decisionmaking is
impermissible in all circumstances"); cf. Richmond v. J. A.
Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520-521 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (criticizing the majority for rejecting a
strict principle of colorblindness). Indeed, the very fear
that led to the creation of the Shaw cause of action was that
racial concerns were taking too heavy a toll on districting
practices that had evolved over the years through the political process. Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 644-649. Justice
O'Connor, moreover, has made it obvious that race has
a legitimate place in districting, id., at 642 ("[R]aceconscious redistricting is not always unconstitutional");
Miller, 515 U. S., at 928-929 (O'Connor, J., concurring);
ante, at 993 (O'Connor, J., concurring), that the intentional
creation of majority-minority districts is not forbidden by
Shaw, Miller, supra, at 928 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (districts may be permissible "even though race may well have
been considered in the redistricting process"); ante, at 990-
992 (O'Connor, J., concurring), and that Shaw was aimed
at only the exceptional district, 515 U. S., at 928-929 ("Application of the Court's standard does not throw into doubt
the vast majority of the Nation's 435 congressional districts"). Of the present Court majority, only Justices
Scalia and Thomas are on record as concluding that any
intentional creation of a majority-minority district is a forbidden racial gerrymander. Ante, at 1001 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).

Since a radical transformation of the political selection
process in the name of colorblindness is out of the question,
the Court's options for dealing with Shaw's unworkability
are in truth only these: to confine the cause of action by
adopting a quantifiable shape test or to eliminate the cause
of action entirely. Because even a truncated Shaw would
rest on the untenable foundation I have described, and the
supposed, expressive harm Shaw seeks to remedy is unlikely

Souter, J., dissenting
to justify the disruption that even a modified Shaw would
invite, there is presently no good reason that the Court's
withdrawal from the presently untenable state of the law
should not be complete. While I take the commands of stare
decisis very seriously, the problems with Shaw and its progeny are themselves very serious. The Court has been unable to provide workable standards, the chronic uncertainty
has begotten no discernible reliance, and the costs of persisting doubt about the limits of state discretion and state responsibility are high.

There is, indeed, an added reason to admit Shaw's failure
in providing a manageable constitutional standard and to
allow for some faith in the political process. That process
not only evolved the very traditional districting principles
that the Court has pledged to preserve, but has applied them
in the past to deal with ethnicity in a way that should influence our thinking about the prospects for race. It is difficult
to see how the consideration of race that Shaw condemns
(but cannot avoid) is essentially different from the consideration of ethnicity that entered American politics from the
moment that immigration began to temper regional homogeneity. Recognition of the ethnic character of neighborhoods
and incumbents, through the application of just those districting principles we now view as traditional, allowed ethnically identified voters and their preferred candidates to enter
the mainstream of American politics, see Miller, supra, at
944-945 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); D. Judd, The Politics of
American Cities: Private Power and Public Policy 70 (3d ed.
1988); see generally S. Erie, Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans
and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985
(1988), and to attain a level of political power in American
democracy. The result has been not a state regime of ethnic
apartheid, but ethnic participation and even a moderation of
ethnicity's divisive effect in political practice. For although
consciousness of ethnicity has not disappeared from the

Souter, J., dissenting
There is, then, some reason to hope that if vote dilution isattacked at the same time that race is given the recognition

that ethnicity has historically received in American politics,the force of race in politics will also moderate in time.
There are even signs that such hope may be vindicated, evenif the evidence is necessarily tentative as yet. See U. S.
Comm'n on Civil Rights, The Voting Rights Act: Ten YearsAfter, p. 155 (Jan. 1975) ("In many areas the great increase
in minority registration and voting since the passage of theVoting Rights Act in 1965 has meant that politicians can no
longer afford to ignore minority voters. This has broughtabout a significant decline in racial appeals by candidates
and has made incumbents and candidates more responsive tominority needs"); Carsey, The Contextual Effects of Race on
White Voter Behavior: The 1989 New York City MayoralElection, 57 J. of Politics 221, 228 (1995) (reporting, in 1994,
that "the contextual effects of race may not be so differentfrom the contextual effects of factors like partisanship, ethnicity, or social class as we might have believed"); Sigelman,Sigelman, Walkosz, & Nitz, Black Candidates, White Voters:
Understanding Racial Bias in Political Perceptions, 39 Am.J. of Political Science 243, 244 (1995) ("Over the years, white
Americans have expressed increasing willingness to vote forblack candidates"); Peirce, Fresh Air in City Hall, Baltimore
Sun, Nov. 8, 1993, p. 7A ("In contest after contest, victoryhas gone to mayoral candidates who eschew talk of race");
see also Gingles, 478 U. S., at 56 (noting that crossover votingin favor of minority candidates is more common when minority incumbents stand for reelection); Collins v. Norfolk, 883F. 2d 1232, 1243 (CA4 1989) (same). This possibility that
racial politics, too, may grow wiser so long as minority votesare rescued from submergence should be considered in determining how far the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendmentsrequire us to devise constitutional common law to supplant

fact that "Nassau Italian-Americans feel less marginali[zed] as an ethnic
group").

Memorandum of Stevens, J.1174
Memorandum of Justice Stevens, respecting the denial of thepetition for certiorari.

The Court's opinion in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739(1987), correctly summarized a long established principle of our
jurisprudence: "The fact that [a legislative] Act might operateunconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is
insufficient to render it wholly invalid." Id., at 745.Unfortunately, the preceding sentence in the Salerno opinion
went well beyond that principle. That sentence opens Part II ofthe opinion with a rhetorical flourish, stating that a facial challenge must fail unless there is "no set of circumstances" in whichthe statute could be validly applied. Ibid.; post, at 1178. That
statement was unsupported by citation or precedent. It was alsounnecessary to the holding in the case, for the Court effectively
held that the statute at issue would be constitutional as appliedin a large fraction of cases. See 481 U. S., at 749-750.

While a facial challenge may be more difficult to mount thanan as-applied challenge, the dicta in Salerno "does not accurately
characterize the standard for deciding facial challenges," and "nei-ther accurately reflects the Court's practice with respect to facial
challenges, nor is it consistent with a wide array of legal princi-ples." Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46
Stan. L. Rev. 235, 236, 238 (1994). For these reasons, Salerno'srigid and unwise dictum has been properly ignored in subsequent
cases even outside the abortion context.1 Accordingly, there is

1 See, e. g., Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.
833, 895 (1992) (statute facially invalid as "substantial obstacle" to exerciseof right in "large fraction" of cases); id., at 972-973 (

Rehnquist, C. J., con-curring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that "no circumstance" dictum should have led to different result); Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v.Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance, 505 U. S. 71, 82 (1992) (

Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting) (arguing that tax statute was facially valid because it wouldbe constitutional under certain facts); INS v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 188 (1991) (applying appropriate rule:"That the regulation may be invalid as applied in [some] cases, . . . does not
mean that the regulation is facially invalid"); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S.589, 602 (1988) (statute facially invalid under Establishment Clause only if,
inter alia, law's "primary effect" is advancement of religion, or if it requires"excessive entanglement" between church and state); id., at 627, n. 1 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (pointing out and agreeing with majority's failure toapply "no circumstance" dictum); Shaffer v.

Scalia, J., dissenting 517 U. S.
no need for this Court affirmatively to disavow that unfortunatelanguage, in the abortion context or otherwise, until it is clear
that a federal court has ignored the appropriate principle andapplied the draconian "no circumstance" dictum to deny relief in
a case in which a facial challenge would otherwise be successful.2I thus concur in the denial of this petition.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and JusticeThomas join, dissenting.
In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit declared unconstitutional a South Dakota law which requires a physician to notify a pregnant minor's parent of an im-pending abortion 48 hours before the abortion is to be performed.

1

(examining facial validity of state statute permitting exercise of personaljurisdiction over defendant without reference to whether statute was constitutional as applied to petitioner).These cases, along with other decisions and the holding in Salerno itself
(that the challenged Act was constitutional in most circumstances, notmerely one), should have braced the dissent against the minor risk of whiplash from the "head-snapping" observation, post, at 1180, that our "doctrinalpattern is somewhat more complex" than Salerno's "no circumstance" language suggests, Fallon, Making Sense of Overbreadth, 100 Yale L. J. 853,859, n. 29 (1991) (citing cases).

2 In all likelihood, the decision of the Fifth Circuit applying the "no circumstance" test would have been decided the same way even if that courthad utilized the "large fraction" test applied by the Eighth Circuit in this

case. See Barnes v. Moore, 970 F. 2d 12, 14 (CA5 1992) (noting that theprovisions at issue were "substantially identical" to provisions upheld in
Casey).Furthermore, it is not at all clear to me, given intervening statements by
Members of this Court, see Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Schafer,507 U. S. 1013, 1014 (1993), that subsequent Fifth Circuit panels would follow
Barnes' application of the "no circumstance" test, providing yet another rea-son to deny the petition in this case.

1 South Dakota Codified Laws $ 34-23A-7 (1994 rev.) provides, in relevant
part:"No abortion may be performed upon an unemancipated minor or upon a

female for whom a guardian has been appointed because of a finding ofincompetency, until at least forty-eight hours after written notice of the
pending operation has been delivered in the manner specified in this section.The notice shall be addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of
the parent and shall be delivered personally to the parent by the physicianor an agent. In lieu of such delivery, notice may be made by certified mail
addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of the parent with returnreceipt requested and restricted delivery to the addressee, which means a
postal employee can only deliver the mail to the authorized addressee. If

Scalia, J., dissenting1174
The court's basis for the invalidation was that "a large fractionof minors seeking pre-viability abortions would be unduly burdened by [the] statute, despite its abuse exception," 2 PlannedParenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller, 63 F. 3d 1452, 1463
(1995) (emphasis added).This decision is questionable enough that we should, since the
invalidation of state law is at issue, accord review. Among otherthings, it rested upon the court's belief that "it seems, South
Dakota's abuse exception will sometimes result in parental notifi-cation, even if after-the-fact." Id., at 1461. That reasoning is
inconsistent with our holding in Ohio v. Akron Center for Repro-ductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 514 (1990), another case involving
a parental notification provision, that "[t]he Court of Appealsshould not have invalidated the Ohio statute on a facial challenge
based upon a worst-case analysis that may never occur." TheEighth Circuit's holding is also dependent on the questionable
conclusions (1) that "parental-notice provisions, like parental-consent provisions, are unconstitutional without a Bellotti-type
bypass," 63 F. 3d, at 1460, see Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622(1979), and (2) that the South Dakota law's exception for abused

notice is made by certified mail, the time of delivery shall be deemed tooccur at twelve o'clock noon on the next day on which regular mail delivery
takes place, subsequent to mailing."

2 South Dakota Codified Laws $ 34-23A-7 (1994 rev.) sets forth the following exceptions to its notice requirement:"No notice is required under this section if:

"(1) The attending physician certifies in the pregnant minor's medical rec-ord that, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, a medical emergency exists that so complicates the medical condition of a pregnantfemale as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert
her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial andirreversible impairment of a major bodily function and there is insufficient
time to provide the required notice; or"(2) The person who is entitled to notice certifies in writing that he has
been notified; or"(3) The pregnant minor declares, or provides information that indicates,
that she is an abused or neglected child as defined in $ 26-8A-2 and theattending physician has reported the alleged or suspected abuse or neglect
as required in accordance with [state law]. In such circumstances, the de-partment of social services, the state's attorney and law enforcement officers
to whom the report is made or referred for investigation or litigation shallmaintain the confidentiality of the fact that she has sought or obtained an
abortion and shall take all necessary steps to ensure that this information isnot revealed to her parents."

and neglected minors did not satisfy the need for a bypass proce-dure, 63 F. 3d, at 1460-1463.

Beyond these issues, however (or, more accurately, precedingthem), is another question that virtually cries out for our review.
In United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), summarizing along established principle of our jurisprudence, we observed:

"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, themost difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances existsunder which the Act would be valid. The fact that [a legislative Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some con-ceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly
invalid, since we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doc-trine outside the limited context of the First Amendment."
Id., at 745.
It has become questionable whether, for some reason, this clearprinciple does not apply in abortion cases. As I observed three

Terms ago in a case very similar to this one, we have sent mixedsignals on the question--seemingly employing an overbreadth approach in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), but explicitly reject-ing that approach in such later abortion cases as Ohio v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 514, and Rust v. Sulli-van, 500 U. S. 173, 183 (1991).

3 In dissenting from denial of certiorari in Ada v. Guam Soc. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists,

3 See also Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 524
(1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)("[S]ome quite straightforward applications of the Missouri ban on the use

of public facilities for performing abortions would be constitutional and thatis enough to defeat appellees' assertion that the ban is facially unconstitutional"). Justice Stevens' memorandum in support of the denial of certio-rari says that the Salerno rule "has been properly ignored in subsequent
cases even outside the abortion context." Ante, at 1175. If he means bythis that the rule has consistently been ignored, the statement is proved
false by the cases cited here in text, where the rule was both recited andfollowed. (And there are other post-Salerno cases reciting and applying the
rule outside the abortion context, see, e. g., Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S.143, 155-156, n. 6 (1995), and Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301, 309 (1993).)
If, on the other hand, Justice Stevens merely means that the Salerno rulehas sometimes "been ignored," though it has other times been applied, then
he makes a good case for granting, rather than denying, certiorari.

Scalia, J., dissenting1174
506 U. S. 1011, 1013 (1992), I expressed my view that "[t]he Courtdid not purport to change this well-established rule . . . in
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833(1992)." Since then, two Members of the Casey majority have
expressed their view that Salerno is "inconsistent with Casey."See Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Schafer, 507 U. S.
1013, 1014 (1993) (O'Connor, J., joined by Souter, J., concurring).In this case--after reviewing the incompatible pronouncements
of the Court's opinions on this subject, and remarking that "eventhe Justices of the Supreme Court dispute Casey's effect," 63 F.
3d, at 1457--the Court of Appeals concluded, in effect, that Sa-lerno had been chewed up by the "ad hoc nullification machine"
which is our abortion jurisprudence, Madsen v. Women's HealthCenter, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 785 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting).
The court decided that Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), without so much as alluding to
the facial-challenge rule, "effectively overruled Salerno for facialchallenges to abortion statutes," 63 F. 3d, at 1458. This holding
conflicts head on with a post-Casey decision of the Fifth Circuit.In Barnes v. Moore, 970 F. 2d 12, cert. denied, 506 U. S. 1021
(1992), the Fifth Circuit rejected a facial challenge to the Missis-sippi Informed Consent to Abortion Act. In the process, it said
that "[b]ecause the plaintiffs are challenging the facial validity ofthe Mississippi Act, they must `establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,' " 970 F. 2d,at 14, adding that "we do not interpret Casey as having overruled,
sub silentio, longstanding Supreme Court precedent governingchallenges to the facial constitutionality of statutes," id., at 14,
n. 2. The split between the Fifth and Eighth Circuits is unmis-takably clear. The Third Circuit has also weighed in on this
question (albeit in dictum), siding with the Eighth Circuit. SeeCasey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa., 14 F. 3d 848,
863, n. 21 (1994).The Salerno question could not be more squarely presented.
The Court of Appeals explained that "[t]he critical issue in thiscase is . . . what is the standard for a challenge to the facial
constitutionality of an abortion law?" 63 F. 3d, at 1456 (emphasisadded). It specifically acknowledged that "Planned Parenthood
cannot meet the Salerno test." Id., at 1457. Had the Court ofAppeals not concluded that the Salerno rule has been selectively

(and sub silentio) nullified in abortion cases, respondents' facialchallenge quite simply would have failed.

Justice Stevens' memorandum in support of the denial of thispetition provides even stronger reasons than I have why it should
be granted. Justice Stevens asserts that Casey could not pos-sibly have been contrary to the "no set of circumstances" rule
because, contrary to the repeated statement of our cases, thatrule never existed. For that head-snapping proposition, he relies
upon no less weighty authority than a law review article by Mi-chael C. Dorf. According to that author, The Chief Justice's
statement on behalf of the Court in Salerno was not only "wrong"but "draconian." Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal
Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 238, 239 (1994); see ante, at 1176.But if that is so, if Salerno is a dead letter even outside of the
abortion context, all the more reason to grant certiorari and makethat clear.

4 For the courts of appeals regularly enforce that supposed dead letter, often in cases in which its "draconian" characterprevents the facial challenge from succeeding. See, e. g., Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 56 F. 3d 1434, 1437 (CADC 1995) ("We discern
at least one scenario where the off-site rule would be procedurallyvalid. . . . While this hypothetical scenario may not be common,
it is sufficient to establish that petitioners' facial challenge mustfail"); United States v. Mena, 863 F. 2d 1522, 1527 (CA11 1989)
("[T]he defendants have simply failed even to suggest `that no setof circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.'
Such is the defendant's burden in a case challenging the facialvalidity of a congressional enactment on other than firstamendment grounds"); Roulette v. Seattle, 78 F. 3d 1425, 1430(CA9 1996) ("Plaintiffs have conceded that `the city may prevent
individuals or groups of people from sitting or lying across asidewalk in such a way as to prevent others from passing.' The
Seattle ordinance plainly may be applied to such cases, and plain-tiffs' facial substantive due process challenge therefore fails") (ci4 While we are in the process of adopting Professor Dorf's revisionist view
of Salerno, we could also embrace his modest proposal for what ought toreplace the rule described in that case. His proposal is not, curiously

enough, the regime that Justice Stevens suggests, but rather total elimi-nation of the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges. Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 294(1994).

INS, 9 F. 3d 8, 10 (CA2 1993).

Finally, I cannot let pass without comment Justice Stevens'
suggestion that Fifth Circuit panels might, in future abortion
cases, ignore the clear language of Salerno, and the Fifth Circuit's
own decision in Barnes, "given intervening statements by Members of this Court"--by which he means the memorandum of Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Souter, concurring in the
Court's order of April 2, 1993, denying (without opinion) the application for stay and injunction pending appeal in Fargo Women's
Health Organization v. Schafer, supra. See ante, at 1176, n. 2.
That the Fifth Circuit might give such authoritative effect to this
two-Justice concurrence is certainly true; courts of appeals, no
less than practitioners, sometimes count votes instead of following
cases. But I am surprised to find that practice endorsed by Justice Stevens, who has hitherto taken a dim view of separate
writings appended to discretionary (and unexplained) denials, calling "all opinions dissenting from the denial of certiorari" "totally
unnecessary" and "examples of the purest form of dicta." Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 944-945 (1978) (Stevens, J.,
respecting denial of certiorari). More fundamentally, I find it
hard to understand why one who believes that Salerno's "no set
of circumstances" rule is nothing more than unwise, rigid, and
inaccurate dictum, ante, at 1175, would not seize upon this opportunity "affirmatively to disavow" it, ante, at 1176, instead of hoping that the courts of appeals will be induced to abandon it by
reading the tea leaves of concurring opinions. Today's denial
serves only one rational purpose: It makes our abortion ad hoc
nullification machine as stealthful as possible.

For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the Court's denial of
the petition for certiorari.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, JusticeGinsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.
In my opinion, it is both unnecessary and profoundly unwisefor the Court to order expedited briefing of the important questions raised by the petition for certiorari and application for awrit of habeas corpus. Even if the majority were right that this
petition squarely presents substantial constitutional questionsabout the power of Congress to limit this Court's jurisdiction, our
consideration of them surely should be undertaken with the ut-most deliberation, rather than unseemly haste. Accordingly, I
respectfully dissent from the entry of the foregoing order.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia andJustice Thomas join, dissenting.

I dissent from the denial of certiorari. Petitioners identify adivision between the Courts of Appeals about whether a city
violates the First Amendment when its seal includes as one com-ponent a religious symbol, in particular a Latin cross. Compare
68 F. 3d 1226 (CA10 1995) and Harris v. City of Zion, 927 F. 2d1401 (CA7 1991) (finding an Establishment Clause violation), with
Murray v. City of Austin, 947 F. 2d 147 (CA5 1991) (finding noviolation), cert. denied sub nom. Derden v. McNeel, 508 U. S. 960
(1992). Their petition also suggests--though it does not expresslyraise--a serious question about respondents' standing to press
their First Amendment claim.The Court of Appeals observed that neither party disputed
respondents' standing, but correctly observed that "[s]tanding"

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting 517 U. S.
was always necessary. 68 F. 3d, at 1229, n. 6. Last Term, wepointed out that "[t]he question of standing is not subject to
waiver: `We are required to address the issue even if the courtsbelow have not passed on it, and even if the parties fail to raise
the issue before us.' " United States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 742(1995) (quoting FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 230-231
(1990)) (citation omitted).The Court of Appeals noted respondents had standing under
its decision in Foremaster v. City of St. George, 882 F. 2d 1485,1490 (CA10 1989), cert. denied, 495 U. S. 910 (1990). 68 F. 3d, at
1229, n. 6. In Foremaster, the Court of Appeals inquired whethera plaintiff challenging a city logo containing a depiction of the
local Mormon temple alleged a direct injury when he alleged thathe was "confronted by the logo on a daily basis." 882 F. 2d, at
1491. Reviewing our decision in Valley Forge Christian Collegev. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,
454 U. S. 464 (1982), the court held that "an allegation of directpersonal contact with the offensive action alone" alleged a direct
injury, and that it was not necessary for a plaintiff to allege alsothat "he has altered his behavior as a consequence" of the offensive action. 882 F. 2d, at 1490.The only factual statement as to what injury respondents in
the present case might have suffered is that "[p]laintiffs are non-Christians who live or work in Edmond." 68 F. 3d, at 1228.
Mere presence in the city, without further allegations as to injury,quite clearly fails to meet the standing requirements laid down
in cases such as Valley Forge. There, we said:

"Although respondents claim that the Constitution has beenviolated, they claim nothing else. They fail to identify any

personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of thealleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conductwith which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient to
confer standing under Art. III . . . ." 454 U. S., at 485.
The Foremaster court acknowledged that there was disagree-ment among the Courts of Appeals about whether Valley Forge

allowed standing to a plaintiff alleging direct injury by beingexposed to a state symbol that offends his beliefs. 882 F. 2d, at
1490; see also Freedom From Religion v. Zielke, 845 F. 2d 1463(CA7 1988) (finding this allegation insufficient); Saladin v. City of

Milledgeville, 812 F. 2d 687 (CA11 1987); Hawley v. City of Cleve-land, 773 F. 2d 736 (CA6 1985) (finding it sufficient), cert. denied,
475 U. S. 1047 (1986). Because there are serious arguments onboth sides of this question, the Courts of Appeals have divided
on the issue, and the issue determines the reach of federal courts'power of judicial review of state actions, I would take this opportunity to consider it.For these reasons, I would grant the petition for certiorari and
request the parties to address the additional question whetherrespondents showed an injury in fact sufficient to give them
standing to raise their claim of violation of the EstablishmentClause of the First Amendment.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
NETHERLAND, WARDEN v. TUGGLE
on application to vacate stay of execution

No. A-910. Decided May 15, 1996
An application to vacate the Fourth Circuit's order staying respondent

Tuggle's execution has been filed. However, there is no such stay in
effect in this case. Although Tuggle asked the Fourth Circuit both to
stay his execution and to stay issuance of its mandate in his case, the
court order only stayed the issuance of its mandate.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, Circuit Justice.
Applicant has filed an application to vacate an order of theCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit staying the execution of respondent Tuggle. It is my understanding, how-ever, that no such stay of execution is in effect. While Tuggle asked the Court of Appeals both to stay his executionand to stay issuance of its mandate in his case, see

Tuggle v.Netherland, 79 F. 3d 1386 (1996), the Court of Appeals' order

only stayed the issuance of its mandate for a period of 30days. Hence there is no stay of execution for me to vacate.

ABSTENTION.

Remand order.--An abstention-based remand order is appealable under
28 U. S. C. $ 1291; because damages, rather than equitable or discretionary relief, were sought here, District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of abstention doctrine of Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,
319 U. S. 315. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., p. 706.

ACTUAL ENUMERATION. See Constitutional Law, I.
ADMIRALTY.

1. Proximate causation requirement.--Doctrines of legal or "proximate" causation and "superseding cause" apply in admiralty tort and contract actions notwithstanding this Court's adoption of comparative fault
principle in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397. Exxon
Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., p. 830.

2. Service of process--Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.--Rule 4 governs manner and timing of service in federal actions, which are nonjurisdictional matters of procedure, and thus it supersedes instruction in $ 2
of Suits in Admiralty Act that process be served "forthwith." Henderson
v. United States, p. 654.

in initial enumeration, Secretary of Commerce's decision not to use that

adjustment was well within constitutional bounds. Wisconsin v. City of
New York, p. 1.

II. Due Process.

1. Criminal trial--Presumption of competence.--An Oklahoma statute
requiring that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be competent
to stand trial unless he proves his incompetence by clear and convincing
evidence violates due process. Cooper v. Oklahoma, p. 348.

2. Punitive damages--Excessive awards.--Where BMW failed to disclose that it had repainted a new car before Gore bought it, $2 million
in punitive damages awarded to Gore by an Alabama court was grossly
excessive in violation of Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, p. 559.

3. Res judicata--Parties to case.--Petitioners were deprived of Fourteenth Amendment due process when Alabama Supreme Court held that
they were barred from challenging an allegedly unconstitutional county
tax by a prior adjudication of tax in a case to which they were not parties.
Richards v. Jefferson County, p. 793.

III. Equal Protection of the Laws.

1. Redistricting plan--Narrow tailoring of reapportionment scheme.--
North Carolina's congressional redistricting plan violates Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because State's reapportionment
scheme is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.
Shaw v. Hunt, p. 899.

2. Redistricting plan--Racial gerrymanders.--Three-judge District
Court judgment that Texas' majority-minority congressional Districts
18, 29, and 30 constitute racial gerrymanders in violation of Fourteenth
Amendment is affirmed. Bush v. Vera, p. 952.

3. Repeal of laws banning discrimination on basis of sexual orientation.--"Amendment 2" to Colorado Constitution, which prohibits all
state governmental action designed to protect status of persons based
on their sexual orientation, violates Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Romer v. Evans, p. 620.

IV. Export Clause.

Federal taxes--Goods in export transit.--Export Clause does not permit imposition of a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory federal tax
on goods in export transit. United States v. International Business
Machines Corp., p. 843.

V. Freedom of Speech.

Advertisement ban--Liquor prices.--Rhode Island laws banning advertisement of retail liquor prices except at place of sale violate First Amend517ind$$BV 01-28-99 09:02:28 PGT*INDBV (Bound Volume)

ment and are not saved by Twenty-first Amendment. 44 Liquormart, Inc.
v. Rhode Island, p. 484.

VI. Right to Jury Trial.

Patent construction--Disputed term of art.--Construction of a patent,
including its terms of art, is a matter of law reserved entirely for court,
and is not subject to a Seventh Amendment guarantee that a jury will
determine any disputed term of art on which expert testimony is offered.
Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., p. 370.

VII. Searches and Seizures.

Vehicle stops--Temporary detention of motorists.--Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures does not require police
to support temporary detention of motorists during stop of their vehicles
with anything more than probable cause to believe they committed traffic
violations. Whren v. United States, p. 806.

VIII. Separation of Powers.

Presidential authority--Promulgation of aggravating factors for sentencing of Armed Forces personnel.--President does not lack authority,
under separation-of-powers doctrine, to promulgate aggravating factors
that permit a court-martial to impose a death penalty upon an Armed
Forces member convicted of murder. Loving v. United States, p. 748.

IX. States' Immunity from Suit.

Suits by Indian tribes--Indian Commerce Clause.--Eleventh Amendment prevents Congress from authorizing suits by Indian tribes against
States to enforce legislation--here, Indian Gaming Regulatory Act--enacted under Indian Commerce Clause. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,
p. 44.

cution on basis of his race, he must make a threshold showing that Government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races.
United States v. Armstrong, p. 456.

vacation of Rutledge's concurrent life sentences and either his conviction for conspiring to distribute controlled substances or his conviction

STANDING TO SUE.

Suit by union on behalf of its members.--Third prong of associational
standing test--that neither claim asserted nor relief requested requires
participation of individual members in lawsuit--is prudential; thus Congress had authority to abrogate that prong's bar to suit and permit a
union to sue for damages on behalf of its members for violations of Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Food and Commercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., p. 544.

STATES' IMMUNITY FROM SUIT. See Constitutional Law, IX.
STAYS.

1. Stay of execution--Habeas corpus petition.--Application to vacate

Court's careful treatment of Williams' claims in denying his third habeas
petition, implausibility of those claims, and Circuit's failure to reveal its
grounds for relief. Bowersox v. Williams, p. 345.

there is nothing to vacate (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers). Netherland
