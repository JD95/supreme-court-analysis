CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2002

BENEFICIAL NATIONAL BANK et al. v. ANDERSON

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 02-306. Argued April 30, 2003--Decided June 2, 2003
Respondents, who secured loans from petitioner national bank, filed a

state-court suit against the bank and two other petitioners, seeking
damages on the theory, among others, that the bank's interest rates
violated "the common law usury doctrine" and an Alabama usury statute. The complaint did not refer to any federal law. Petitioners removed the case to Federal District Court, asserting that the National
Bank Act governs the interest rate that a national bank may charge,
see 12 U. S. C. $ 85, that the rates charged to respondents complied with

$ 85, that $ 86 provides the exclusive remedies available against a national bank charging excessive interest, and that respondents' action
was therefore one "arising under" federal law that could be removed
under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441. The District Court denied respondents' motion to remand the case to state court, but certified the question
whether it had jurisdiction to the Eleventh Circuit. In reversing, the
latter court held that under the "well-pleaded complaint" rule, removal
is not permitted unless the complaint expressly alleges a federal claim,
and that the narrow exception known as the complete pre-emption doctrine did not apply because there was no evidence of clear congressional
intent to permit removal under $$ 85 and 86.

Held: Respondents' cause of action arose only under federal law and could,

therefore, be removed under $ 1441. Pp. 6-11.

2 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Syllabus
(a) As a general rule, absent diversity jurisdiction, a case is not removable if the complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim.
Potential defenses, including a federal statute's pre-emptive effect,
Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for
Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, do not provide a basis for removal. One
exception to the general rule occurs when a federal statute completely
pre-empts a cause of action. Where this Court has found such preemption, the federal statutes at issue--the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, see Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, and the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, see Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58--provided the exclusive cause of
action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies
governing that cause of action. Pp. 6-8.

(b) Because respondents' complaint expressly charged petitioners
with usury, Metropolitan Life, Avco, and Franchise Tax Bd. provide the
framework for answering the question whether the National Bank Act
provides the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national
banks. Section 85 sets substantive limits on the interest rates that national banks may charge, while $ 86 prescribes the remedies available to
borrowers who are charged higher rates and the procedures governing
such claims. If the interest charged here did not violate $ 85 limits, the
statute pre-empts any common-law or Alabama statutory rule that
would treat those rates as usurious and would, thus, provide a federal
defense. That defense would not justify removal. Only if Congress
intended $ 86 to provide the exclusive cause of action for usury claims
against national banks would the statute be comparable to the provisions construed in Avco and Metropolitan Life. This Court has long
construed the National Bank Act as providing the exclusive federal
cause of action for usury against national banks. See, e. g., Farmers'
and Mechanics' Nat. Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29. The Court has also
recognized the special nature of federally chartered banks. Uniform
rules limiting their liability and prescribing exclusive remedies for their
overcharges are an integral part of a banking system that needed protection from possible unfriendly state legislation. The same federal interest supports the established interpretation of $$ 85 and 86 that gives
those provisions the requisite pre-emptive force to provide removal jurisdiction. Pp. 9-11.

4 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
may be removed to a federal court because it actually arisesunder federal law. We hold that it may.

I
Respondents are 26 individual taxpayers who madepledges of their anticipated tax refunds to secure short-term

loans obtained from petitioner Beneficial National Bank, anational bank chartered under the National Bank Act. Respondents brought suit in an Alabama court against the bankand the two other petitioners that arranged the loans, seeking compensatory and punitive damages on the theory,among others, that the bank's interest rates were usurious.
App. 18-30. Their complaint did not refer to any federallaw.

Petitioners removed the case to the United States DistrictCourt for the Middle District of Alabama. In their notice of
removal they asserted that the National Bank Act, Rev. Stat.$ 5197, as amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 85,

1 is the exclusive provi1 Title 12 U. S. C. $ 85 provides:
"Rate of interest on loans, discounts and purchases
"Any association may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or
discount made, or upon any notes, bills of exchange, or other evidences of
debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, Territory, or
District where the bank is located, or at a rate of 1 per centum in excess
of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal reserve bank in the Federal reserve district where the bank is located,
whichever may be the greater, and no more, except that where by the
laws of any State a different rate is limited for banks organized under
state laws, the rate so limited shall be allowed for associations organized
or existing in any such State under title 62 of the Revised Statutes.
When no rate is fixed by the laws of the State, or Territory, or District,
the bank may take, receive, reserve, or charge a rate not exceeding 7 per
centum, or 1 per centum in excess of the discount rate on ninety day
commercial paper in effect at the Federal reserve bank in the Federal
reserve district where the bank is located, whichever may be the greater,
and such interest may be taken in advance, reckoning the days for which
the note, bill, or other evidence of debt has to run. The maximum amount
of interest or discount to be charged at a branch of an association located
outside of the States of the United States and the District of Columbia

Opinion of the Court
sion governing the rate of interest that a national bank maylawfully charge, that the rates charged to respondents complied with that provision, that Rev. Stat. $ 5198, 12 U. S. C.$ 86, provides the exclusive remedies available against a national bank charging excessive interest,2 and that the re-moval statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1441, therefore applied. App.
31-35. The District Court denied respondents' motion to
remand the case to state court but certified the questionwhether it had jurisdiction to proceed with the case to the

Court of Appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b).A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit reversed.

Anderson v. H&R Block, Inc., 287 F. 3d 1038 (2002). The majorityheld that under our "well-pleaded complaint" rule, removal

is generally not permitted unless the complaint expressly al-leges a federal claim and that the narrow exception from that
rule known as the "complete preemption doctrine" did notapply because it could "find no clear congressional intent to
permit removal under $$ 85 and 86." Id., at 1048. Because
this holding conflicted with an Eighth Circuit decision, Krisshall be at the rate allowed by the laws of the country, territory, dependency, province, dominion, insular possession, or other political subdivision
where the branch is located. And the purchase, discount, or sale of a bona
fide bill of exchange, payable at another place than the place of such purchase, discount, or sale, at not more than the current rate of exchange for
sight drafts in addition to the interest, shall not be considered as taking
or receiving a greater rate of interest."

2 Section 86 provides:

"Usurious interest; penalty for taking; limitations
"The taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a rate of interest greater
than is allowed by section 85 of this title, when knowingly done, shall be
deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other
evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid
thereon. In case the greater rate of interest has been paid, the person
by whom it has been paid, or his legal representatives, may recover back,
in an action in the nature of an action of debt, twice the amount of the
interest thus paid from the association taking or receiving the same: Provided, That such action is commenced within two years from the time the
usurious transaction occurred."

Opinion of the Court
pin v. May Dept. Stores Co., 218 F. 3d 919 (2000), we grantedcertiorari. 537 U. S. 1169 (2003).

II
A civil action filed in a state court may be removed tofederal court if the claim is one "arising under" federal law.

$ 1441(b). To determine whether the claim arises under fed-eral law, we examine the "well pleaded" allegations of the
complaint and ignore potential defenses: "[A] suit arisesunder the Constitution and laws of the United States only
when the plaintiff 's statement of his own cause of actionshows that it is based upon those laws or that Constitution.
It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some anticipateddefense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is
invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of theUnited States."

Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley,211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908); see Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S.

74 (1914). Thus, a defense that relies on the preclusive ef-fect of a prior federal judgment, Rivet v. Regions Bank of
La., 522 U. S. 470 (1998), or the pre-emptive effect of a fed-eral statute, Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1 (1983),will not provide a basis for removal. As a general rule, absent diversity jurisdiction, a case will not be removable ifthe complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim.

Congress has, however, created certain exceptions to thatrule. For example, the Price-Anderson Act contains an unusual pre-emption provision, 42 U. S. C. $ 2014(hh), that notonly gives federal courts jurisdiction over tort actions arising out of nuclear accidents but also expressly provides forremoval of such actions brought in state court even when
they assert only state-law claims. See El Paso Natural Gas
Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 484-485 (1999).We have also construed $ 301 of the Labor Management

Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C. $ 185, as not onlypre-empting state law but also authorizing removal of ac539US1 Unit: $U62 [07-05-05 16:41:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tions that sought relief only under state law. Avco Corp. v.
Machinists, 390 U. S. 557 (1968). We later explained that
holding as resting on the unusually "powerful" pre-emptiveforce of $ 301:

"The Court of Appeals held, 376 F. 2d, at 340, and weaffirmed, 390 U. S., at 560, that the petitioner's action
`arose under' $ 301, and thus could be removed to federalcourt, although the petitioner had undoubtedly pleaded
an adequate claim for relief under the state law of con-tracts and had sought a remedy available

only under
state law. The necessary ground of decision was thatthe pre-emptive force of $ 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action `for violation of
contracts between an employer and a labor organiza-tion.' Any such suit is purely a creature of federal law,

notwithstanding the fact that state law would provide acause of action in the absence of $ 301.

Avco stands for
the proposition that if a federal cause of action com-pletely pre-empts a state cause of action any complaint

that comes within the scope of the federal cause of ac-tion necessarily `arises under' federal law."

Franchise
Tax Bd., 463 U. S., at 23-24 (footnote omitted).

Similarly, in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481
U. S. 58 (1987), we considered whether the "complete pre-emption" approach adopted in

Avco also supported the removal of state common-law causes of action asserting im-proper processing of benefit claims under a plan regulated

by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA), 29 U. S. C. $ 1001

et seq. For two reasons, we held
that removal was proper even though the complaint purported to raise only state-law claims. First, the statutory
text in $ 502(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132, not only provided an express federal remedy for the plaintiffs' claims, but also in its
jurisdiction subsection, $ 502(f), used language similar to the
statutory language construed in Avco, thereby indicating

8 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
that the two statutes should be construed in the same way.
481 U. S., at 65. Second, the legislative history of ERISA
unambiguously described an intent to treat such actions "as
arising under the laws of the United States in similar fashion
to those brought under section 301 of the Labor-Management
Relations Act of 1947." Id., at 65-66 (internal quotation
marks and emphasis omitted).

Thus, a state claim may be removed to federal court in
only two circumstances--when Congress expressly so provides, such as in the Price-Anderson Act, supra, at 6, or
when a federal statute wholly displaces the state-law cause
of action through complete pre-emption.3 When the federal
statute completely pre-empts the state-law cause of action,
a claim which comes within the scope of that cause of action,
even if pleaded in terms of state law, is in reality based on
federal law. This claim is then removable under 28 U. S. C.

$ 1441(b), which authorizes any claim that "arises under" federal law to be removed to federal court. In the two categories of cases 4 where this Court has found complete preemption--certain causes of action under the LMRA and
ERISA--the federal statutes at issue provided the exclusive
cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action. See
29 U. S. C. $ 1132 (setting forth procedures and remedies for
civil claims under ERISA); $ 185 (describing procedures and
remedies for suits under the LMRA).

3 Of course, a state claim can also be removed through the use of the
supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1367(a), provided that another claim in the complaint is removable.

4 This Court has also held that federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to hear posessory land claims under state law brought by Indian
tribes because of the uniquely federal "nature and source of the possessory
rights of Indian tribes." Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of
Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 667 (1974). Because that case turned on the special
historical relationship between Indian tribes and the Federal Government,
it does not assist the present analysis.

Opinion of the Court

III
Count IV of respondents' complaint sought relief for"usury violations" and claimed that petitioners "charged . . .

excessive interest in violation of the common law usury doc-trine" and violated "Alabama Code $ 8-8-1, et seq. by charging excessive interest." App. 28. Respondents' complaintthus expressly charged petitioners with usury.

Metropoli-tan Life, Avco, and Franchise Tax Board provide the framework for answering the dispositive question in this case:Does the National Bank Act provide the exclusive cause of
action for usury claims against national banks? If so, thenthe cause of action necessarily arises under federal law and
the case is removable. If not, then the complaint does notarise under federal law and is not removable.

Sections 85 and 86 serve distinct purposes. The formersets forth the substantive limits on the rates of interest that
national banks may charge. The latter sets forth the ele-ments of a usury claim against a national bank, provides for
a 2-year statute of limitations for such a claim, and pre-scribes the remedies available to borrowers who are charged
higher rates and the procedures governing such a claim. If,as petitioners asserted in their notice of removal, the interest
that the bank charged to respondents did not violate $ 85limits, the statute unquestionably pre-empts any commonlaw or Alabama statutory rule that would treat those ratesas usurious. The section would therefore provide the petitioners with a complete federal defense. Such a federal de-fense, however, would not justify removal. Caterpillar Inc.
v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 393 (1987). Only if Congress in-tended $ 86 to provide the exclusive cause of action for usury
claims against national banks would the statute be compara-ble to the provisions that we construed in the Avco and Metropolitan Life cases.5

5 Because the proper inquiry focuses on whether Congress intended the
federal cause of action to be exclusive rather than on whether Congress
intended that the cause of action be removable, the fact that these sections

10 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
In a series of cases decided shortly after the Act waspassed, we endorsed that approach. In Farmers' and Mechanics' Nat. Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29, 32-33 (1875), werejected the borrower's attempt to have an entire debt forfeited, as authorized by New York law, stating that the vari-ous provisions of $$ 85 and 86 "form a system of regulations
. . . [a]ll the parts [of which] are in harmony with each otherand cover the entire subject," so that "the State law would
have no bearing whatever upon the case." We also ob-served that "[i]n any view that can be taken of [$ 86], the
power to supplement it by State legislation is conferred nei-ther expressly nor by implication."

Id., at 35. In Evans v.National Bank of Savannah, 251 U. S. 108, 114 (1919), we

stated that "federal law . . . completely defines what con-stitutes the taking of usury by a national bank, referring to
the state law only to determine the maximum permittedrate." See also Barnet v. National Bank, 98 U. S. 555, 558
(1879) (The "statutes of Ohio and Indiana upon the subjectof usury . . . cannot affect the case" because the Act "creates
a new right" that is "exclusive"); Haseltine v. Central Bank
of Springfield, 183 U. S. 132, 134 (1901) ("[T]he definition ofusury and the penalties affixed thereto must be determined

by the National Banking Act and not by the law of theState").

In addition to this Court's longstanding and consistent con-struction of the National Bank Act as providing an exclusive
federal cause of action for usury against national banks, thisCourt has also recognized the special nature of federally
chartered banks. Uniform rules limiting the liability of na-tional banks and prescribing exclusive remedies for their
overcharges are an integral part of a banking system thatneeded protection from "possible unfriendly State legislation." Tiffany v. National Bank of Mo., 18 Wall. 409, 412
of the National Bank Act were passed in 1864, 11 years prior to the passage of the statute authorizing removal, is irrelevant, contrary to respondents' assertions.

Scalia, J., dissenting
(1874). The same federal interest that protected nationalbanks from the state taxation that Chief Justice Marshall

characterized as the "power to destroy," McCulloch v. Mary-land, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 (1819), supports the established interpretation of $$ 85 and 86 that gives those provisions therequisite pre-emptive force to provide removal jurisdiction.
In actions against national banks for usury, these provisionssupersede both the substantive and the remedial provisions
of state usury laws and create a federal remedy for over-charges that is exclusive, even when a state complainant, as
here, relies entirely on state law. Because $$ 85 and 86 pro-vide the exclusive cause of action for such claims, there is, in
short, no such thing as a state-law claim of usury against anational bank. Even though the complaint makes no mention of federal law, it unquestionably and unambiguouslyclaims that petitioners violated usury laws. This cause of
action against national banks only arises under federal lawand could, therefore, be removed under $ 1441.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

Today's opinion takes the view that because the NationalBank Act, 12 U. S. C. $$ 85, 86, provides the exclusive cause
of action for claims of usury against a national bank, all suchclaims--even if explicitly pleaded under state law--are to
be construed as "aris[ing] under" federal law for purposesof our jurisdictional statutes.

Ante this page. This view
finds scant support in our precedents and no support what-ever in the National Bank Act or any other Act of Congress.

I respectfully dissent.Unless Congress expressly provides otherwise, the federal
courts may exercise removal jurisdiction over state-court
actions "of which the district courts of the United States

have original jurisdiction." 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). In thiscase, petitioners invoked as the predicate for removal the

district courts' original jurisdiction over "all civil actionsarising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States." $ 1331.This so-called "arising under" or "federal question" jurisdiction has long been governed by the well-pleadedcomplaint rule, which provides that "federal jurisdiction ex-ists only when a federal question is presented on the face of

the plaintiff 's properly pleaded complaint." Caterpillar
Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386, 392 (1987). A federal question "is presented" when the complaint invokes federal law
as the basis for relief. It does not suffice that the facts alleged in support of an asserted state-law claim would also
support a federal claim. "The [well-pleaded-complaint] rule
makes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may
avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law."
Ibid. See also The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228
U. S. 22, 25 (1913) ("Of course the party who brings a suit
is master to decide what law he will rely upon"). Nor does
it even suffice that the facts alleged in support of an asserted
state-law claim do not support a state-law claim and would
only support a federal claim. "Jurisdiction may not be sustained on a theory that the plaintiff has not advanced."
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S.
804, 809, n. 6 (1986).

Under the well-pleaded-complaint rule, "a federal court
does not have original jurisdiction over a case in which the
complaint presents a state-law cause of action, but also asserts that federal law deprives the defendant of a defense he
may raise, . . . or that a federal defense the defendant may
raise is not sufficient to defeat the claim." Franchise Tax
Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for
Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 10 (1983). Of critical importance
here, the rejection of a federal defense as the basis for original federal-question jurisdiction applies with equal force

when the defense is one of federal pre-emption. "By unim-peachable authority, a suit brought upon a state statute does

not arise under an act of Congress or the Constitution of theUnited States because prohibited thereby."

Gully v. First
Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 116 (1936). "[A] casemay

not be removed to federal court on the basis of . . . the
defense of pre-emption . . . ." Caterpillar, supra, at 393.
To be sure, pre-emption requires a state court to dismiss aparticular claim that is filed under state law, but it does not,

as a general matter, provide grounds for removal.This Court has twice recognized exceptions to the wellpleaded-complaint rule, upholding removal jurisdiction notwithstanding the absence of a federal question on the face of
the plaintiff 's complaint. First, in Avco Corp. v. Machinists,
390 U. S. 557 (1968), we allowed removal of a state-court action to enforce a no-strike clause in a collective-bargaining
agreement. The complaint concededly did not advance a
federal claim, but was subject to a defense of pre-emption
under $ 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947
(LMRA), 29 U. S. C. $ 185. The well-pleaded-complaint rule
notwithstanding, we treated the plaintiff 's state-law contract
claim as one arising under $ 301, and held that the case could
be removed to federal court. Avco, supra, at 560.

The only support mustered by the Avco Court for its conclusion was a statement wrenched out of context from our
decision in Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353
U. S. 448, 457 (1957), that "[a]ny state law applied [in a $ 301
case] will be absorbed as federal law and will not be an independent source of private rights." To begin with, this
statement is entirely unnecessary to the landmark holding
in Lincoln Mills--that $ 301 not only gives federal courts
jurisdiction to decide labor relations cases but also supplies
them with authority to create the governing substantive law.
Id., at 456. More importantly, understood in the context of
that holding, the quoted passage in no way supports the
proposition for which it is relied upon in Avco--that state539US1 Unit: $U62 [07-05-05 16:41:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
14 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Scalia, J., dissenting
law claims relating to labor relations necessarily arise under$ 301. If one reads

Lincoln Mills with any care, it is clear
beyond doubt that the relevant passage merely confirms thatwhen, in deciding cases arising under $ 301, courts employ

legal rules that overlap with, or are even explicitly borrowedfrom, state law, such rules are nevertheless rules of federal
law. It is in this sense that "[a]ny state law applied [in a

$ 301 case] will be absorbed as federal law"--in the sensethat federally adopted state rules become federal rules, not

in the sense that a state-law claim becomes a federal claim.Other than its entirely misguided reliance on

Lincoln
Mills, the opinion in Avco failed to clarify the analytic basisfor its unprecedented act of jurisdictional alchemy. The

Court neglected to explain why state-law claims that arepre-empted by $ 301 of the LMRA are exempt from the strictures of the well-pleaded-complaint rule, nor did it explain
how such a state-law claim can plausibly be said to "arise
under" federal law. Our subsequent opinion in Franchise
Tax Board struggled to prop up Avco's puzzling holding:

"The necessary ground of decision [in Avco] was that thepre-emptive force of $ 301 is so powerful as to displace

entirely any state cause of action `for violation of con-tracts between an employer and a labor organization.'
Any such suit is purely a creature of federal law, notwithstanding the fact that state law would provide acause of action in the absence of $ 301.

Avco stands for
the proposition that if a federal cause of action com-pletely pre-empts a state cause of action any complaint

that comes within the scope of the federal cause of action necessarily `arises under' federal law." 463 U. S.,
at 23-24 (footnote omitted).

This passage has repeatedly been relied upon by the Court
as an explanation for its decision in Avco. See, e. g., ante, at
7, Caterpillar, supra, at 394; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 64 (1987). Of course it is not an expla539US1 Unit: $U62 [07-05-05 16:41:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nation at all. It provides nothing more than an account ofwhat

Avco accomplishes, rather than a justification (unless
ipse dixit is to count as justification) for the radical depar-ture from the well-pleaded-complaint rule, which demands

rejection of the defense of federal pre-emption as a basisfor federal jurisdiction.

Gully, supra, at 116. Neither the
excerpt quoted above, nor any other fragment of the decision
in Franchise Tax Board, explains how or why the nonviabil-ity (due to pre-emption) of the state-law contract claim in

Avco magically transformed that claim into one "arisingunder" federal law.

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, supra, was our second departure from the prohibition against resting federal
"arising under" jurisdiction upon the existence of a federal
defense. In that case, Taylor sued his former employer and
its insurer, alleging breach of contract and seeking, inter alia,
reinstatement of certain disability benefits and insurance
coverages. Id., at 61. Though Taylor invoked no federal
law in his complaint, we treated his case as one arising under

$ 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132, and upheld the District
Court's exercise of removal jurisdiction. 481 U. S., at 66-67.

In reaching this conclusion, the Taylor Court broke no
new analytic ground; its opinion follows the exception established in Avco and described in Franchise Tax Board, but
says nothing to commend that exception to logic or reason.
Instead, Taylor simply relies on the "clos[e] parallels," 481
U. S., at 65, between the language of the pre-emptive provision in ERISA and the language of the LMRA provision
deemed in Avco to be so dramatically pre-emptive as to summon forth a federal claim where none had been asserted.
"No more specific reference to the Avco rule can be expected," we said, than what was found in $ 502(a); and we
accordingly concluded that "Congress has clearly manifested
an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the
civil enforcement provisions of $ 502(a) removable to federal

court." 481 U. S., at 66. As in Avco and Franchise TaxBoard, no explanation was provided for Avco's abrogation of

the rule that "[f]ederal pre-emption is ordinarily a federaldefense to the plaintiff 's suit[, and as such] it does not appear
on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, [nor does it] author-ize removal to federal court."

1 481 U. S., at 63.

It is noteworthy that the straightforward (though simi-larly unsupported) rule announced in today's opinion--under

which (1) removal is permitted "[w]hen [a] federal statutecompletely pre-empts a state-law cause of action,"

ante, at 8,and (2) a federal statute is completely pre-emptive when it

"provide[s] the exclusive cause of action for the claim as-serted," ibid.--is nowhere to be found in either Avco or
Taylor. To the contrary, the analysis in today's opinionimplicitly contradicts (by rendering inexplicable) Taylor's
discussion of pre-emption and removal. (Avco, as I observedearlier, has no discussion to be contradicted.) Had it
thought that today's decision was the law, the Taylor Courtneed not have taken pains to emphasize the "clos[e] parallels"
between $ 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA and $ 301 of the LMRA andneed not have pored over the legislative history of $ 502(a)
to show that Congress expected ERISA to be treated likethe LMRA. See

Taylor, supra, at 65-66 (citing H. R. Conf.Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 327 (1974); 120 Cong. Rec. 29933 (1974)

(remarks of Sen. Williams); id., at 29942 (remarks of Sen.Javits)). Instead, it could have rested after noting the
"unique pre-emptive force of ERISA," Taylor, supra, at 65.Indeed, it could even have spared itself the trouble of add1 This is not to say that Taylor was wrongly decided. Having been
informed through the Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), decision that the language of $ 301 triggered "arising under" jurisdiction even
with respect to certain state-law claims, Congress' subsequent decision to
insert language into ERISA that "closely parallels" the text of $ 301 can
be viewed to be, as we said, a "specific reference to the Avco rule." 481
U. S., at 65-66. Taylor, in other words, rests upon a sort of statutory
incorporation of Avco. Avco itself, on the other hand, continues to rest
upon nothing.

ing the adjective "unique. " While there is somethingunique about statutes whose pre-emptive force is closely patterned after that of the LMRA (which we had held to sup-port removal), there is nothing whatever unique about a federal cause of action that displaces state causes of action.Displacement alone, if today's opinion is to be believed,
would have sufficed to establish the existence of removal
jurisdiction.The best that can be said, from a precedential perspective,

for the rule of law announced by the Court today is thatvariations on it have twice appeared in our cases in the purest dicta. Rivet v. Regions Bank of La., 522 U. S. 470, 476
(1998) ("[O]nce an area of state law has been completely preempted, any claim purportedly based on that pre-empted
state-law claim is considered, from its inception, a federal
claim, and therefore arises under federal law" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Caterpillar, 482 U. S., at 393 ("[I]f a
federal cause of action completely pre-empts a state cause of
action any complaint that comes within the scope of the federal cause of action necessarily `arises under' federal law"
(some internal quotation marks omitted)). Dicta of course
have no precedential value, see U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co.
v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 24 (1994), even
when they do not contradict, as they do here, prior holdings
of the Court.

The difficulty with today's holding, moreover, is not limited
to the flimsiness of its precedential roots. As has been
noted already, the holding cannot be squared with bedrock
principles of removal jurisdiction. One or another of two of
those principles must be ignored: Either (1) the principle
that merely setting forth in state court facts that would
support a federal cause of action--indeed, even facts that
would support a federal cause of action and would not support the claimed state cause of action--does not produce a
federal question supporting removal, Caterpillar, 482 U. S.,
at 391, or (2) the principle that a federal defense to a state

18 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Scalia, J., dissenting
cause of action does not support federal-question jurisdic-tion, see

id., at 393. Relatedly, today's holding also represents a sharp break from our long tradition of respect forthe autonomy and authority of state courts. For example,

in Healy v. Ratta, 292 U. S. 263, 270 (1934), we explained that"[d]ue regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that
they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the pre-cise limits which the statute has defined." And in

Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100, 108 (1941),we insisted on a "strict construction" of the federal removal

statutes.2 Today's decision ignores these venerable princi-ples and effectuates a significant shift in decisional authority
from state to federal courts.In an effort to justify this shift, the Court explains that
"[b]ecause [12 U. S. C.] $$ 85 and 86 provide the exclu-sive cause of action for such claims, there is . . . no such
thing as a state-law claim of usury against a national bank."
Ante, at 11. But the mere fact that a state-law claim is invalid no more deprives it of its character as a state-law claim
which does not raise a federal question, than does the fact
that a federal claim is invalid deprive it of its character as
a federal claim which does raise a federal question. The
proper response to the presentation of a nonexistent claim
to a state court is dismissal, not the "federalize-and-remove"
dance authorized by today's opinion. For even if the Court
is correct that the National Bank Act obliterates entirely
any state-created right to relief for usury against a national bank, that does not explain how or why the claim of

2 Our traditional regard for the role played by state courts in interpreting and enforcing federal law has other doctrinal manifestations. We indulge, for example, a "presumption of concurrent [state and federal] jurisdiction," which can be rebutted only "by an explicit statutory directive,
by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests." Gulf
Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473, 478 (1981).

Scalia, J., dissenting
such a right is transmogrified into the claim of a federalright. Congress's mere act of creating a federal right and

eliminating all state-created rights in no way suggests anexpansion of federal jurisdiction so as to wrest from state
courts the authority to decide questions of pre-emptionunder the National Bank Act.

Petitioners seek to justify their end run around the wellpleaded-complaint rule by insisting that, in determiningwhether federal jurisdiction exists, we are required to " `look

beyond the pleadings.' " Brief for Petitioners 18 (quoting
Indianapolis v. Chase Nat. Bank, 314 U. S. 63, 69 (1941)).
They point out:

"[A] long line of cases disallow[s] manipulations by plaintiffs designed to create or avoid diversity jurisdiction,such as misaligning the interests of the parties, naming

parties (whether plaintiffs or defendants) who have noreal interest in or relationship to the controversy, misstating the citizenship of a party (whether plaintiffs ordefendants), or misstating the amount in controversy."
Brief for Petitioners 17-18.
Petitioners insist that, like the "manipulative" complaints in
these diversity cases, "[r]espondents' complaint is disingenu-ously pleaded, not `well pleaded' in any respect, for it purports to raise a state law claim that does not exist." Id.,at 16. Accordingly, the argument continues, just as federal
courts may assert jurisdiction where a plaintiff seeks to hidethe true citizenship of the parties, so too they may assert
jurisdiction where a plaintiff cloaks a necessarily federalclaim in state-law garb.

To begin with, the cases involving diversity jurisdiction
are probably distinguishable on the ground that there is a
crucial difference between, on the one hand, "looking beyond
the pleadings" to determine whether a factual assertion is
true, and, on the other hand, doing so in order to determine
whether the plaintiff has proceeded on the basis of the "cor539US1 Unit: $U62 [07-05-05 16:41:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
20 BENEFICIAL NAT. BANK v. ANDERSON

Scalia, J., dissenting
rect" legal theory. But even assuming that the analogy tothe diversity cases is apt, petitioners can derive no support

from it in this case. Their argument proceeds from thefaulty premise that if one looks behind the pleadings in this
case, one discovers that the plaintiffs have, in fact, presenteda federal claim. But that begs the question--that is, it assumes the answer to the very question presented. It assumes that whenever a claim of usury is brought against anational bank, that claim is a federal one. As I have discussed above, neither logic nor precedent supports that con-clusion; they support, at best, the proposition that the only
viable claim against a national bank for usury is a federalone. Federal jurisdiction is ordinarily determined--invariably determined, except for Avco and Taylor--on the basisof what claim is pleaded, rather than on the basis of what
claim can prevail.There may well be good reasons to favor the expansion of
removal jurisdiction that petitioners urge and that the Courtadopts today. As the United States explains in its

amicus
brief:

"Absent removal, the state court would have only two
legitimate opti ons--to recharacterize the claim infederal-law terms or to dismiss the claim altogether.

Any plaintiff who truly seeks recovery on that claim
would prefer the first option, which would make the pro-priety of removal crystal clear. A third possibility,

however, is that the state court would err and allow theclaim to proceed under state law notwithstanding Congress's decision to make the federal cause of action exclusive. The complete pre-emption rule avoids that
potential error." Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 17-18.

True enough, but inadequate to render today's decision either rational or properly within the authority of this Court.
Inadequate for rationality, because there is no more reason

to fear state-court error with respect to federal pre-emptionaccompanied by creation of a federal cause of action than

there is with respect to federal pre-emption unaccompaniedby creation of a federal cause of action--or, for that matter,
than there is with respect to any federal defense to a state-law claim. The rational response to the United States' concern is to eliminate the well-pleaded-complaint rule entirely.And inadequate for judicial authority, because it is up to Congress, not the federal courts, to decide when the risk ofstate-court error with respect to a matter of federal law becomes so unbearable as to justify divesting the state courtsof authority to decide the federal matter. Unless and until
we receive instruction from Congress that claims pre-empted under the National Bank Act--in contrast to almost
all other claims that are subject to federal pre-emption--"arise under" federal law, we simply lack authority to
"avoi[d] . . . potential errors," id., at 18, by permittingremoval.

Today's opinion has succeeded in giving to our Avco deci-sion a theoretical foundation that neither Avco itself nor Taylor provided. Regrettably, that theoretical foundation is it-self without theoretical foundation. That is to say, the more
general proposition that (1) the existence of a pre-emptivefederal cause of action causes the invalid assertion of a state
cause of action to raise a federal question, has no more logicor precedent to support it than the very narrow proposition
that (2) the LMRA (Avco) and statutes modeled after theLMRA

(Taylor) cause invalid assertions of state causes ofaction pre-empted by those particular statutes to raise federal questions. Since I believe that, as between an inexpli-cable narrow holding and an inexplicable broad one, the former is the lesser evil, I would adhere to the approach takenby Taylor and on the basis of stare decisis simply affirm,
without any real explanation, that the LMRA and statutesmodeled after it have a "unique pre-emptive force" that

(quite illogically) suspends the normal rules of removal juris-diction. Since no one asserts that the National Bank Act is

modeled after the LMRA, the state-law claim pleaded herecannot be removed, and it is left to the state courts to
dismiss it. From the Court's judgment to the contrary,I respectfully dissent.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-428. Argued April 2, 2003--Decided June 2, 2003
General Dwight D. Eisenhower's World War II book, Crusade in Europe,

was published by Doubleday, which registered the work's copyright and
granted exclusive television rights to an affiliate of respondent Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (Fox). Fox, in turn, arranged for
Time, Inc., to produce a Crusade in Europe television series based on
the book, and Time assigned its copyright in the series to Fox. The
series was first broadcast in 1949. In 1975, Doubleday renewed the
book's copyright, but Fox never renewed the copyright on the television
series, which expired in 1977, leaving the series in the public domain.
In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in the book, including the
exclusive right to distribute the Crusade television series on video and
to sublicense others to do so. Respondents SFM Entertainment and
New Line Home Video, Inc., acquired from Fox the exclusive rights
to manufacture and distribute Crusade on video. In 1995, petitioner
Dastar released a video set, World War II Campaigns in Europe, which
it made from tapes of the original version of the Crusade television
series and sold as its own product for substantially less than New Line's
video set. Fox, SFM, and New Line brought this action alleging, inter
alia, that Dastar's sale of Campaigns without proper credit to the Crusade television series constitutes "reverse passing off" in violation of

$ 43(a) of the Lanham Act. The District Court granted respondents
summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding, among other things, that because Dastar copied substantially the
entire Crusade series, labeled the resulting product with a different
name, and marketed it without attribution to Fox, Dastar had committed a "bodily appropriation" of Fox's series, which was sufficient to
establish the reverse passing off.

Held: Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not prevent the unaccredited

copying of an uncopyrighted work. Pp. 28-38.

(a) Respondents' claim that Dastar has made a "false designation of
origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which . . . is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the
origin . . . of [its] goods" in violation of $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15
U. S. C. $ 1125(a), would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought

some of New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackaged them
as its own. However, Dastar has instead taken a creative work in the
public domain, copied it, made modifications (arguably minor), and
produced its very own series of videotapes. If "origin" refers only to
the manufacturer or producer of the physical "good" that is made available to the public (here, the videotapes), Dastar was the origin. If,
however, "origin" includes the creator of the underlying work that
Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of
Dastar's product. At bottom, the Court must decide what $ 43(a) means
by the "origin" of "goods." Pp. 28-31.

(b) Because Dastar was the "origin" of the physical products it sold
as its own, respondents cannot prevail on their Lanham Act claim. As
dictionary definitions affirm, the most natural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"--the source of wares--is the producer of the tangible
product sold in the marketplace, here Dastar's Campaigns videotape.
The phrase "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act is incapable of connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas that "goods" embody
or contain. The consumer typically does not care about such origination, and $ 43(a) should not be stretched to cover matters that are of no
consequence to purchasers. Although purchasers do care about ideas
or communications contained or embodied in a communicative product
such as a video, giving the Lanham Act special application to such products would cause it to conflict with copyright law, which is precisely
directed to that subject, and which grants the public the right to copy
without attribution once a copyright has expired, e. g., Sears, Roebuck &
Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 230. Recognizing a $ 43(a) cause of action here would render superfluous the provisions of the Visual Artists
Rights Act that grant an artistic work's author "the right . . . to claim
authorship," 17 U. S. C. $ 106A(a)(1)(A), but carefully limit and focus
that right, $$ 101, 106A(b), (d)(1), and (e). It would also pose serious practical problems. Finally, reading $ 43(a) as creating a cause
of action for, in effect, plagiarism would be hard to reconcile with, e. g.,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U. S. 205, 211.

called Crusade in Europe, based on the book, and Time as-signed its copyright in the series to Fox. The television series, consisting of 26 episodes, was first broadcast in 1949.It combined a soundtrack based on a narration of the book
with film footage from the United States Army, Navy, andCoast Guard, the British Ministry of Information and War
Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified
"Newsreel Pool Cameramen." In 1975, Doubleday renewedthe copyright on the book as the " `proprietor of copyright in

a work made for hire.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a. Fox,however, did not renew the copyright on the Crusade television series, which expired in 1977, leaving the television
series in the public domain.

In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in General
Eisenhower's book, including the exclusive right to distribute the Crusade television series on video and to sublicense
others to do so. Respondents SFM Entertainment and New
Line Home Video, Inc., in turn, acquired from Fox the exclusive rights to distribute Crusade on video. SFM obtained
the negatives of the original television series, restored them,
and repackaged the series on videotape; New Line distributed the videotapes.

Enter petitioner Dastar. In 1995, Dastar decided to expand its product line from music compact discs to videos.
Anticipating renewed interest in World War II on the 50th
anniversary of the war's end, Dastar released a video set
entitled World War II Campaigns in Europe. To make Campaigns, Dastar purchased eight beta cam tapes of the original version of the Crusade television series, which is in the
public domain, copied them, and then edited the series.
Dastar's Campaigns series is slightly more than half as long
as the original Crusade television series. Dastar substituted a new opening sequence, credit page, and final closing
for those of the Crusade television series; inserted new
chapter-title sequences and narrated chapter introductions;
moved the "recap" in the Crusade television series to the

beginning and retitled it as a "preview"; and removed refer-ences to and images of the book. Dastar created new packaging for its Campaigns series and (as already noted) a newtitle.

Dastar manufactured and sold the Campaigns video set asits own product. The advertising states: "Produced and
Distributed by: Entertainment D istr ibuting " (which isowned by Dastar), and makes no reference to the Crusade television series. Similarly, the screen credits state"DASTAR CORP presents" and "an ENTERTAINMENT
DISTRIBUTING Production," and list as executive producer, producer, and associate producer employees ofDastar. Supp. App. 2-3, 30. The Campaigns videos themselves also make no reference to the Crusade television se-ries, New Line's Crusade videotapes, or the book. Dastar
sells its Campaigns videos to Sam's Club, Costco, Best Buy,and other retailers and mail-order companies for $25 per set,
substantially less than New Line's video set.In 1998, respondents Fox, SFM, and New Line brought
this action alleging that Dastar's sale of its Campaigns video
set infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower'sbook and, thus, their exclusive television rights in the book.

Respondents later amended their complaint to add claimsthat Dastar's sale of Campaigns "without proper credit" to

to respondents and doubled them pursuant to $ 35 of theLanham Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1117(a), to deter future infringing

judgment for respondents on the Lanham Act claim, but re-versed as to the copyright claim and remanded. 34 Fed.

Court of Appeals reasoned that "Dastar copied substantiallythe entire

Crusade in Europe series created by TwentiethCentury Fox, labeled the resulting product with a different

name and marketed it without attribution to Fox[, and]therefore committed a `bodily appropriation' of Fox's series."
Id., at 314. It concluded that "Dastar's `bodily appropri-ation' of Fox's original [television] series is sufficient to
establish the reverse passing off." Ibid.2 The court alsoaffirmed the District Court's award under the Lanham Act

the registration, use, and infringement of trademarks andrelated marks, $ 43(a), 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a) is one of the few

provisions that goes beyond trademark protection. As orig-inally enacted, $ 43(a) created a federal remedy against a
person who used in commerce either "a false designation oforigin, or any false description or representation" in connection with "any goods or services." 60 Stat. 441. As theSecond Circuit accurately observed with regard to the original enactment, however--and as remains true after the 1988revision--$ 43(a) "does not have boundless application as a
remedy for unfair trade practices," Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v.
Interstate Cigar Co., 499 F. 2d 232, 237 (1974). "[B]ecauseof its inherently limited wording, $ 43(a) can never be a federal `codification' of the overall law of `unfair competition,' "4 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition $ 27:7,
p. 27-14 (4th ed. 2002) (McCarthy), but can apply only tocertain unfair trade practices prohibited by its text.

Although a case can be made that a proper reading of$ 43(a), as originally enacted, would treat the word "origin"
as referring only "to the geographic location in which thegoods originated,"

$ 27:14; Two Pesos, supra, at 768. Moreover, every Circuit
to consider the issue found $ 43(a) broad enough to encompass reverse passing off. See, e. g., Williams v. CurtissWright Corp., 691 F. 2d 168, 172 (CA3 1982); Arrow United

Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., 913 F. 2d 958,
963-964, n. 6 (CADC 1990) (Thomas, J.).

Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of respondents' claim
is that, in marketing and selling Campaigns as its own product without acknowledging its nearly wholesale reliance on
the Crusade television series, Dastar has made a "false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or
false or misleading representation of fact, which . . . is likely
to cause confusion . . . as to the origin . . . of his or her goods."

$ 43(a). See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 8, 11. That claim
would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought some
of New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackaged
them as its own. Dastar's alleged wrongdoing, however, is
vastly different: It took a creative work in the public domain--the Crusade television series--copied it, made modifications (arguably minor), and produced its very own series
of videotapes. If "origin" refers only to the manufacturer
or producer of the physical "goods" that are made available
to the public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar was the
origin. If, however, "origin" includes the creator of the underlying work that Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product. At bottom,
we must decide what $ 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act means
by the "origin" of "goods."

III

The dictionary definition of "origin" is "[t]he fact or process of coming into being from a source," and "[t]hat from
which anything primarily proceeds; source." Webster's
New International Dictionary 1720-1721 (2d ed. 1949). And
the dictionary definition of "goods" (as relevant here) is
"[w]ares; merchandise." Id., at 1079. We think the most
natural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"--the source
of wares--is the producer of the tangible product sold in the
marketplace, in this case the physical Campaigns videotape
sold by Dastar. The concept might be stretched (as it was

under the original version of $ 43(a)) 5 to include not only the
actual producer, but also the trademark owner who commissioned or assumed responsibility for ("stood behind") production of the physical product. But as used in the Lanham
Act, the phrase "origin of goods" is in our view incapable of
connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas or
communications that "goods" embody or contain. Such an
extension would not only stretch the text, but it would be
out of accord with the history and purpose of the Lanham
Act and inconsistent with precedent.

Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits actions like
trademark infringement that deceive consumers and impair a
producer's goodwill. It forbids, for example, the Coca-Cola
Company's passing off its product as Pepsi-Cola or reverse
passing off Pepsi-Cola as its product. But the brand-loyal
consumer who prefers the drink that the Coca-Cola Company or PepsiCo sells, while he believes that that company
produced (or at least stands behind the production of ) that
product, surely does not necessarily believe that that company was the "origin" of the drink in the sense that it was
the very first to devise the formula. The consumer who
buys a branded product does not automatically assume that
the brand-name company is the same entity that came up
with the idea for the product, or designed the product--and
typically does not care whether it is. The words of the Lan5 Under the 1946 version of the Act, $ 43(a) was read as providing a cause
of action for trademark infringement even where the trademark owner
had not itself produced the goods sold under its mark, but had licensed
others to sell under its name goods produced by them--the typical franchise arrangement. See, e. g., My Pie Int'l, Inc. v. Debould, Inc., 687 F. 2d
919 (CA7 1982). This stretching of the concept "origin of goods" is seemingly no longer needed: The 1988 amendments to $ 43(a) now expressly
prohibit the use of any "word, term, name, symbol, or device," or "false or
misleading description of fact" that is likely to cause confusion as to "affiliation, connection, or association . . . with another person," or as to "sponsorship, or approval" of goods. 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a).

Opinion of the Court
ham Act should not be stretched to cover matters that aretypically of no consequence to purchasers.

It could be argued, perhaps, that the reality of purchaserconcern is different for what might be called a communicative product--one that is valued not primarily for its physi-cal qualities, such as a hammer, but for the intellectual content that it conveys, such as a book or, as here, a video. The
purchaser of a novel is interested not merely, if at all, in theidentity of the producer of the physical tome (the publisher),

but also, and indeed primarily, in the identity of the creatorof the story it conveys (the author). And the author, of
course, has at least as much interest in avoiding passing off
(or reverse passing off) of his creation as does the publisher.
For such a communicative product (the argument goes) "origin of goods" in $ 43(a) must be deemed to include not merely
the producer of the physical item (the publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux, or the video producer Dastar) but
also the creator of the content that the physical item conveys
(the author Tom Wolfe, or--assertedly--respondents).

The problem with this argument according special treatment to communicative products is that it causes the Lanham
Act to conflict with the law of copyright, which addresses
that subject specifically. The right to copy, and to copy
without attribution, once a copyright has expired, like
"the right to make [an article whose patent has expired]--
including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried
when patented--passes to the public." Sears, Roebuck &
Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 230 (1964); see also Kellogg
Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111, 121-122 (1938).
"In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a
patent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject to
copying." TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,
Inc., 532 U. S. 23, 29 (2001). The rights of a patentee or
copyright holder are part of a "carefully crafted bargain,"

right monopoly has expired, the public may use the inventionor work at will and without attribution. Thus, in construing

the Lanham Act, we have been "careful to caution againstmisuse or over-extension" of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by patent or copyright.
TrafFix, 532 U. S., at 29. "The Lanham Act," we have
said, "does not exist to reward manufacturers for their

innovation in creating a particular device; that is the pur-pose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity."

Id.,
at 34. Federal trademark law "has no necessary relation toinvention or discovery,"

Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 94
(1879), but rather, by preventing competitors from copying
"a source-identifying mark," "reduce[s] the customer's costs
of shopping and making purchasing decisions," and "helps
assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor)
will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated
with a desirable product," Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products
Co., 514 U. S. 159, 163-164 (1995) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). Assuming for the sake of argument
that Dastar's representation of itself as the "Producer" of its
videos amounted to a representation that it originated the
creative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause of
action under $ 43(a) for that representation would create a
species of mutant copyright law that limits the public's "federal right to `copy and to use' " expired copyrights, Bonito
Boats, supra, at 165.

When Congress has wished to create such an addition to
the law of copyright, it has done so with much more specificity than the Lanham Act's ambiguous use of "origin." The
Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, $ 603(a), 104 Stat. 5128,
provides that the author of an artistic work "shall have the
right . . . to claim authorship of that work." 17 U. S. C.

$ 106A(a)(1)(A). That express right of attribution is carefully limited and focused: It attaches only to specified
"work[s] of visual art," $ 101, is personal to the artist,

$$ 106A(b) and (e), and endures only for "the life of the au539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

35Cite as: 539 U. S. 23 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
thor," $ 106A(d)(1). Recognizing in $ 43(a) a cause of action
for misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works
(visual or otherwise) would render these limitations superfluous. A statutory interpretation that renders another
statute superfluous is of course to be avoided. E. g., Mackey
v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,
837, and n. 11 (1988).

Reading "origin" in $ 43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems.
Without a copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word "origin" has no discernable limits. A video of the MGM film
Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar
Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the film
was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which
the musical was based), and to Prosper Me' rime' e (who wrote
the novel on which the opera was based). In many cases,
figuring out who is in the line of "origin" would be no simple
task. Indeed, in the present case it is far from clear that
respondents have that status. Neither SFM nor New Line
had anything to do with the production of the Crusade television series--they merely were licensed to distribute the
video version. While Fox might have a claim to being in
the line of origin, its involvement with the creation of the
television series was limited at best. Time, Inc., was the
principal, if not the exclusive, creator, albeit under arrangement with Fox. And of course it was neither Fox nor Time,
Inc., that shot the film used in the Crusade television series.
Rather, that footage came from the United States Army,
Navy, and Coast Guard, the British Ministry of Information
and War Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified "Newsreel Pool Cameramen." If anyone has a
claim to being the original creator of the material used in
both the Crusade television series and the Campaigns videotapes, it would be those groups, rather than Fox. We do not

FILM CORP.

Opinion of the Court

think the Lanham Act requires this search for the source ofthe Nile and all its tributaries.

Another practical difficulty of adopting a special definitionof "origin" for communicative products is that it places the
manufacturers of those products in a difficult position. Onthe one hand, they would face Lanham Act liability for

failing to credit the creator of a work on which their lawful
copies are based; and on the other hand they could face Lan-ham Act liability for

crediting the creator if that should be
regarded as implying the creator's "sponsorship or approval"of the copy, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(1)(A). In this case, for example, if Dastar had simply "copied [the television series] as
Crusade in Europe and sold it as Crusade in Europe," without changing the title or packaging (including the original
credits to Fox), it is hard to have confidence in respondents'
assurance that they "would not be here on a Lanham Act
cause of action," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.

Finally, reading $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act as creating a
cause of action for, in effect, plagiarism--the use of otherwise unprotected works and inventions without attribution--would be hard to reconcile with our previous decisions.
For example, in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers,
Inc., 529 U. S. 205 (2000), we considered whether productdesign trade dress can ever be inherently distinctive. WalMart produced "knockoffs" of children's clothes designed and
manufactured by Samara Brothers, containing only "minor
modifications" of the original designs. Id., at 208. We concluded that the designs could not be protected under $ 43(a)
without a showing that they had acquired "secondary meaning," id., at 214, so that they " `identify the source of the
product rather than the product itself,' " id., at 211 (quoting
Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456
U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982)). This carefully considered limitation would be entirely pointless if the "original" producer
could turn around and pursue a reverse-passing-off claim
under exactly the same provision of the Lanham Act. Sa539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

37Cite as: 539 U. S. 23 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
mara would merely have had to argue that it was the "ori-gin" of the designs that Wal-Mart was selling as its own line.

It was not, because "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act re-ferred to the producer of the clothes, and not the producer
of the (potentially) copyrightable or patentable designs thatthe clothes embodied.

Similarly under respondents' theory, the "origin of goods"
provision of $ 43(a) would have supported the suit that werejected in

Bonito Boats, 489 U. S. 141, where the defendants had used molds to duplicate the plaintiff 's unpatentedboat hulls (apparently without crediting the plaintiff). And

it would have supported the suit we rejected in TrafFix,
532 U. S. 23: The plaintiff, whose patents on flexible road
signs had expired, and who could not prevail on a trade-dress
claim under $ 43(a) because the features of the signs were
functional, would have had a reverse-passing-off claim for
unattributed copying of his design.

In sum, reading the phrase "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act in accordance with the Act's common-law foundations (which were not designed to protect originality or creativity), and in light of the copyright and patent laws (which
were), we conclude that the phrase refers to the producer
of the tangible goods that are offered for sale, and not to
the author of any idea, concept, or communication embodied
in those goods. Cf. 17 U. S. C. $ 202 (distinguishing between
a copyrighted work and "any material object in which the
work is embodied"). To hold otherwise would be akin to
finding that $ 43(a) created a species of perpetual patent and
copyright, which Congress may not do. See Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186, 208 (2003).

The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the Campaigns videos is not left without protection. The original
film footage used in the Crusade television series could have
been copyrighted, see 17 U. S. C. $ 102(a)(6), as was copyrighted (as a compilation) the Crusade television series, even
though it included material from the public domain, see

$ 103(a). Had Fox renewed the copyright in the Crusadetelevision series, it would have had an easy claim of

copyright infringement. And respondents' contention thatCampaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book is still a live question on remand. If,moreover, the producer of a video that substantially copied
the Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to givepurchasers the impression that the video was quite different
from that series, then one or more of the respondents mighthave a cause of action--not for reverse passing off under the
"confusion . . . as to the origin" provision of $ 43(a)(1)(A), butfor misrepresentation under the "misrepresents the nature,
characteristics [or] qualities" provision of $ 43(a)(1)(B). Formerely saying it is the producer of the video, however, no
Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.

* * *
Because we conclude that Dastar was the "origin" of theproducts it sold as its own, respondents cannot prevail on

their Lanham Act claim. We thus have no occasion to con-sider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of double
petitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or deci-sion of this case.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, INC. v. LOUISIANA PUBLIC

SERVICE COMMISSION et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana

No. 02-299. Argued April 28, 2003--Decided June 2, 2003
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates

the sale of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce, must ensure
that wholesale rates are "just and reasonable," 16 U. S. C. $ 824d(a).
Under the filed rate doctrine, FERC-approved cost allocations between
affiliated energy companies may not be subjected to reevaluation in
state ratemaking proceedings. Nantahala Power & Light Co. v.
Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953; Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi
ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354 (MP&L). Petitioner Entergy Louisiana,
Inc. (ELI), one of five public utilities owned by Entergy Corporation
(Entergy), shares capacity with its corporate siblings in other States,
which allows each company to access additional capacity when demand
exceeds the supply generated by that company alone. The resulting
costs are allocated among the companies; and that allocation is critical
to the setting of retail rates by state regulators, such as respondent
Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). Entergy allocates costs
through a tariff approved by FERC called the system agreement.
Service Schedule MSS-1, which is included in the system agreement,
provides a formula under which those companies that use more capacity
than they contribute make payments to companies that contribute more
than their fair share of capacity. ELI has typically made, rather than
received, MSS-1 payments. In the 1980's, the operating committee initiated the Extended Reserve Shutdown (ERS) program, which responded to systemwide overcapacity by allowing some generating units
not immediately necessary for capacity needs to be effectively mothballed. Because ERS units could be reactivated if needed, they were
considered available for purposes of calculating MSS-1 payments. On
August 5, 1997, FERC found that Entergy had violated the system
agreement in classifying ERS units as available, but determined that a
refund was not due to ELI customers as a result of MSS-1 overpayments by ELI to other operating companies. FERC also approved an
amendment to the system agreement allowing an ERS unit to be
treated as available under MSS-1 if the operating committee determines
it intends to return the unit to service at a future date. In 1997, ELI
made its annual retail rate filing with the LPSC. One of the contested
issues in this proceeding was whether the cost of ERS units should be

considered in setting ELI's retail rates. Confining its review to MSS-1
payments made after August 5, 1997, the LPSC concluded that it was
not pre-empted from disallowing MSS-1 related costs as imprudent subsequent to that date. Thus, ELI was not permitted to charge retail
rates that reflected the cost of its MSS-1 payments. The State District
Court denied ELI's petition for review, and the State Supreme Court
upheld the LPSC's decision.

Held: Nantahala and MP&L rest on a foundation that is broad enough to

require pre-emption of the LPSC's order. Pp. 47-51.

(a) The filed rate doctrine requires "that interstate power rates filed
with FERC or fixed by FERC must be given binding effect by state
utility commissions determining intrastate rates," Nantahala, supra, at
962. In Nantahala and MP&L, this Court applied the doctrine to hold
that FERC-mandated cost allocations could not be second-guessed by
state regulators. The state order in Nantahala, which involved two
corporate siblings, allocated more of Nantahala's purchases to low-cost
power than the proportion approved by FERC. By requiring Nantahala to calculate its rates as if it needed to procure less high-cost power
than under FERC's order, the state order "trapped" a portion of the
costs incurred by Nantahala in procuring its power. This ran counter
to the rationale for FERC approval of cost allocations because, when
costs under a FERC tariff are categorically excluded from consideration
in retail rates, the regulated entity cannot fully recover its costs of
purchasing at the FERC-approved rate. In MP&L, the Court concluded that, contrary to the Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling, the
pre-emptive effect of FERC jurisdiction does not turn on whether
a particular matter was actually determined in FERC proceedings.
Pp. 47-49.

(b) Applying Nantahala and MP&L here, the LPSC order impermissibly "traps" costs that have been allocated in a FERC tariff. That the
operating committee has discretion to classify ERS units, while Nantahala and MP&L involved specific mandates, does not provide room for
the LPSC's imprudence finding. The Federal Power Act specifically
allows for the use of automatic adjustment clauses, and MSS-1 constitutes such a clause. The Louisiana Supreme Court's other basis for
upholding the LPSC's order--that FERC had not specifically approved
the MSS-1 cost allocation after August 5--revives precisely the same
erroneous reasoning advanced by the Mississippi Supreme Court in
MP&L. It matters not whether FERC has spoken to the precise classification of ERS units, but only whether the FERC tariff dictates how
and by whom the classification should be made. Because the amended
system agreement clearly does so, the LPSC's second-guessing of the

Opinion of the Court
classification here is pre-empted. Finally, respondents advance the contention that including ERS units in MSS-1 calculations violated the
amended agreement despite the LPSC's own prior holding that it does
not have jurisdiction to determine whether the agreement was violated
and the State Supreme Court's acceptance of that concession. The
question here is whether the LPSC order is pre-empted under Nantahala and MP&L; that order does not rest on a finding that the system
agreement was violated. Consequently, this Court has no occasion to
address the question of the exclusivity of FERC's jurisdiction to determine whether and when a filed rate has been violated. Pp. 49-51.

42 ENTERGY LA., INC. v. LOUISIANA PUB. SERV. COMM'N

Opinion of the Court
nies may not be subjected to reevaluation in state ratemaking proceedings. We consider today whether a FERC
tariff that delegates discretion to the regulated entity to determine the precise cost allocation similarly pre-empts an
order that adjudges those costs imprudent.

I
Petitioner Entergy Louisiana, Inc. (ELI), is one of five
public utilities owned by Entergy Corporation (Entergy), a
multistate holding company. ELI operates in the State of
Louisiana and shares capacity with its corporate siblings operating in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively, the
operating companies). This sharing arrangement allows
each operating company to access additional capacity when
demand exceeds the supply generated by that company
alone. But keeping excess capacity available for use by all
is a benefit shared by the operating companies, and the costs
associated with this benefit must be allocated among them.
State regulators establish the rates each operating company
may charge in its retail sales, allowing each company to recover its costs and a reasonable rate of return. Thus, the
cost allocation between operating companies is critical to the
setting of retail rates.

Entergy allocates costs through the system agreement, a
tariff approved by FERC under $ 205 of the Federal Power
Act (FPA), 41 Stat. 1063, 16 U. S. C. $ 824d. The system
agreement is administered by the Entergy operating committee, which includes one representative from each operating company and one from Entergy Services, a subsidiary of
Entergy that provides administrative services to the system.
Service Schedule MSS-1, which is included as $ 10 of the system agreement, allows for cost equalization of shared capacity through a formula that dictates that those operating companies contributing less than their fair share, i. e., using more
capacity than they contribute, make payments to the others

539US1 Unit: $U64 [05-03-05 18:06:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

43Cite as: 539 U. S. 39 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
that contribute more than their fair share of capacity.1Those making such payments are known as "short" companies, and those accepting the payments are known as "long"companies. Each operating company's capability is determined monthly, and payments are made on a monthly basis--a long company receives a payment equal to its average cost
of generating units multiplied by the number of megawattsthe company is long. Because the variables that determine
the MSS-1 cost allocation can change monthly, ServiceSchedule MSS-1 is an automatic adjustment clause under

$ 205(f) of the FPA, 16 U. S. C. $ 824d(f ),2 which exempts itfrom the FPA's ordinary requirements for tariff changes.

In order to determine whether an operating company islong or short in a given month, one must know how much
capacity that operating company is making available to itssiblings. The question is not as easy as asking whether the
generating facilities are on or off, however, because in themid-1980's the operating committee initiated the Extended
Reserve Shutdown (ERS) program. Responding to system-wide overcapacity, ERS allowed some generating units to be
identified as not immediately necessary for capacity needsand effectively mothballed. However, these units could be
activated if demand increased, meaning that the capacitythey represented was not forever placed out of reach of the
operating companies. As a result, ERS units were consid-ered "available" for purposes of calculating MSS-1 cost
equalization payments. Counting ERS units as available

1 Where, as here, public utilities share capacity, the allocation of costs of
maintaining capacity and generating power constitutes "the sale of electric
energy at wholesale in interstate commerce." 16 U. S. C. $ 824(b)(1).

2 Section 824d(f)(4) provides the definition of "automatic adjustment

clause":
"a provision of a rate schedule which provides for increases or decreases
(or both), without prior hearing, in rates reflecting increases or decreases
(or both) in costs incurred by an electric utility. Such term does not include any rate which takes effect subject to refund and subject to a later
determination of the appropriate amount of such rate."

Opinion of the Court
has generally had the effect of making ELI, already a shortcompany, even more short, thus increasing its cost equalization payments.In December 1993, FERC initiated a proceeding under

$ 206 of the FPA, 16 U. S. C. $ 824e, to decide whether thesystem agreement permitted ERS units to be treated as
available. Respondent Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC), which regulates ELI's retail rates in Louisiana,participated in the FERC proceeding and argued that customers of ELI were entitled to a refund as a result of MSS-1overpayments made by ELI after the alleged misclassification of ERS units as available. FERC agreed that Entergyhad violated the system agreement in its classification of
ERS units as available, but determined that a refund wasnot supported by the equities because the resultant cost allocations, while violative of the tariff, were not unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory. Entergy Servs., Inc., 80
FERC || 61,197, pp. 61,786-61,788 (1997) (Order No. 415).
FERC also approved, over the objection of the LPSC, an
amendment to the system agreement that allows an ERS
unit to be treated as available under MSS-1 if the operating
committee determines it intends to return the unit to service
at a future date.3 The Court of Appeals for the District of

3 Section 10.02 of the system agreement, as amended on August 5, 1997,
pursuant to FERC Order No. 415 provides:
"A unit is considered available to the extent the capability can be demonstrated and (1) is under the control of the System Operator, or (2) is down
for maintenance or nuclear refueling, or (3) is in extended reserve shutdown (ERS) with the intent of returning the unit to service at a future
date in order to meet Entergy System requirements. The Operating
Committee's decision to consider an ERS unit to be available to meet future System requirements shall be evidenced in the minutes of the Operating Committee and shall be based on consideration of current and future
resource needs, the projected length of time the unit would be in ERS
status, the projected cost of maintaining such unit, and the projected cost
of returning the unit to service." 80 FERC, at 61,788-61,789 (emphasis
deleted).

Opinion of the Court
Columbia Circuit denied the LPSC's petition for review of
FERC Order No. 415. Louisiana Public Service Comm'n
v. FERC, 174 F. 3d 218 (1999). With respect to the amendment, the Court of Appeals found that "FERC understandably concluded that [it] set out the parameters of the
operating committee's discretion, and that discriminatory
implementation of the amendment could be remedied in a
proceeding under FPA $ 206." Id., at 231.

ELI made its annual retail rate filing with the LPSC in
May 1997. One of the contested issues was "whether payments under the System Agreement for the cost of generating units in Extended Reserve Shutdown should be included
or excluded from ELI's revenue requirement." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 25a. Given FERC's determination that the inclusion of ERS units as available prior to August 5, 1997 (the
date FERC Order No. 415 issued), was just and reasonable,
the LPSC confined its review to MSS-1 payments made after
August 5, 1997. Its own staff argued before the LPSC that
after August 5, 1997, ELI and the operating committee violated amended $ 10.02(a) of the operating agreement by continuing to count ERS units as available. The LPSC concluded, however, that it was "pre-empted from determining
whether the terms of a FERC tariff have been met, for the
issue of violation of or compliance with a FERC tariff is peculiarly within FERC's purview." Id., at 64a.

Nevertheless, the LPSC held that it was not pre-empted
from disallowing MSS-1-related costs as imprudent subsequent to August 5, 1997:

"[T]hough FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of whether the System Agreement has been violated, there currently exists no FERC order that has
found that the Operating Committee's decision is in compliance with the System Agreement. In the absence of
such FERC determination, this Commission can scrutinize the prudence of the Operating Committee's decision

Opinion of the Court
without violating the [S]upremacy [C]lause insofar as
that decision affects retail rates." Id., at 65a.

The LPSC concluded that the operating committee's treatment of ERS units after August 5, 1997, was imprudent and
that ELI's MSS-1 payments would not be considered when
setting ELI's retail rates in Louisiana. In other words,
though ELI made the MSS-1 payments to its "long" corporate siblings, it would not be allowed to recoup those costs
in its retail rates.4

ELI petitioned for review of the LPSC's decision in State
District Court. That petition was denied, and ELI appealed
to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which upheld the LPSC's
decision. 2001-1725 (La. 4/3/02), 815 So. 2d 27. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the LPSC's order was
not barred by federal pre-emption because the LPSC was
not "attempting to regulate interstate wholesale rates" or
"challeng[ing] the validity of the FERC's declination to order
refunds of amounts paid in violation of the System Agreement prior to the amendment." Id., at 38. Further, the
court reasoned, "FERC never ruled on the issue of whether
ELI's decision to continue to include the ERS units [after
August 5, 1997, was] a prudent one" or made "it mandatory
for the [operating committee] to include the ERS units in its
MSS-1 calculations." Ibid.

We granted ELI's petition for writ of certiorari to address
whether the Court's decisions in Nantahala and MP&L lead
to federal pre-emption of the LPSC's order. 537 U. S. 1152
(2003). We hold that Nantahala and MP&L "res[t] on a
foundation that is broad enough," MP&L, 487 U. S., at 369,
to require pre-emption of the order in this case.

4 The MSS-1 payments that were disallowed were, in fact, those made
in 1996, which were to be used in calculating 1997-1998 retail rates by the
LPSC. App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a.

Opinion of the Court

II

A

The filed rate doctrine requires "that interstate power
rates filed with FERC or fixed by FERC must be given
binding effect by state utility commissions determining intrastate rates." Nantahala, 476 U. S., at 962. When the
filed rate doctrine applies to state regulators, it does so
as a matter of federal pre-emption through the Supremacy
Clause. Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571,
581-582 (1981).

In Nantahala and MP&L, the Court applied the filed rate
doctrine to hold that FERC-mandated cost allocations could
not be second-guessed by state regulators. Nantahala involved two corporate siblings, Nantahala Power & Light
Company and Tapoco, Inc., the former of which served retail
customers in North Carolina. Both Nantahala and Tapoco
provided power to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA),
which in turn sold power back to them pursuant to an agreement between all three parties. But the power was not purchased at a uniform price. Low-cost power was made available to both Nantahala and Tapoco in consideration for the
right to pour all of their power into the TVA grid. This
low-cost power was apportioned 80% to Tapoco, which
served exclusively the corporate parent of Tapoco and Nantahala, and 20% to Nantahala. Nantahala purchased the remainder of its power requirements at higher prices. FERC
approved this cost allocation with a slight modification, so
that Nantahala received 22.5% of the low-cost entitlement
power. However, the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the North Carolina Utilities Commission's (NCUC) determination that Nantahala's share of the low-cost power
was properly 24.5%. This resulted in a lower cost computation for Nantahala, and therefore lower rates for North Carolina retail customers, than would have obtained if FERC's
cost allocation had been respected by NCUC.

48 ENTERGY LA., INC. v. LOUISIANA PUB. SERV. COMM'N

Opinion of the Court
This Court held that the state cost allocation order waspre-empted:

"Nantahala must under NCUC's order calculate its re-tail rates as if it received more entitlement power than
it does under FERC's order, and as if it needed toprocure less of the more expensive purchased power
than under FERC's order. A portion of the costs in-curred by Nantahala in procuring its power is therefore `trapped.' " 476 U. S., at 971.
Trapping of costs "runs directly counter," id., at 968, to the
rationale for FERC approval of cost allocations, the Courtconcluded, because when costs under a FERC tariff are categorically excluded from consideration in retail rates, the reg-ulated entity "cannot fully recover its costs of purchasing at
the FERC-approved rate . . . ," id., at 970.In

MP&L, the Court further defined the scope of filed rate
doctrine pre-emption in the cost allocation context. Prede-cessors of the operating companies concerned here were

jointly involved in the construction of the Grand Gulf nuclearpower plant in Mississippi. The costs of the project turned
out to be significantly higher than had been originally
planned, and as a result the wholesale cost of power gener-ated at Grand Gulf was much higher than power available

from other system generating units. But the high fixedcosts of building Grand Gulf had to be recouped, and the
operating companies agreed that each of them would pur-chase a specific proportion of the high-cost power generated
at Grand Gulf. The original allocation was challenged be-fore FERC, which ultimately approved a modified tariff.
That tariff required Mississippi Power and Light (MP&L,
now Entergy Mississippi) to purchase 33% of the power
produced at Grand Gulf.

Mississippi regulators allowed MP&L to pass along these
costs to consumers through retail rate increases. The Mississippi Supreme Court, however, reasoned that "FERC's de539US1 Unit: $U64 [05-03-05 18:06:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
termination that MP&L's assumption of a 33% share of thecosts associated with Grand Gulf would be fair to its sister

operating companies did not obligate the State to approvea pass-through of those costs to state consumers without
a prudence review." MP&L, 487 U. S., at 367. The Missis-sippi Supreme Court distinguished Nantahala by limiting
the scope of its holding to "matters actually determined,whether expressly or impliedly, by the FERC."

Mississippiex rel. Pittman v. Mississippi Public Service Comm'n, 506

So. 2d 978, 986 (Miss. 1987) (citation omitted).This Court disagreed, holding that the state court "erred
in adopting the view that the pre-emptive effect of FERCjurisdiction turned on whether a particular matter was actually determined in the FERC proceedings." MP&L, 487U. S., at 374. Although FERC had not explicitly held that
the construction of Grand Gulf was prudent, the cost alloca-tion filed with FERC pre-empted any state prudence review,
because "if the integrity of FERC regulation is to be pre-served, it obviously cannot be unreasonable for MP&L to
procure the particular quantity of high-priced Grand Gulfpower that FERC has ordered it to pay for."

Ibid.

B
Applying Nantahala and MP&L to the facts of this case,we conclude that the LPSC's order impermissibly "traps"

costs that have been allocated in a FERC tariff. Theamended system agreement differs from the tariffs in
MP&L and Nantahala because it leaves the classification ofERS units to the discretion of the operating committee,
whereas in Nantahala and MP&L the cost allocations werespecific mandates. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded
that this delegated discretion provided room for the LPSC'sfinding of imprudence where a mandated cost allocation
would not. However, Congress has specifically allowed forthe use of automatic adjustment clauses in the FPA, and it
is uncontested that the MSS-1 schedule constitutes such an

50 ENTERGY LA., INC. v. LOUISIANA PUB. SERV. COMM'N

Opinion of the Court
automatic adjustment clause. We see no reason to create anexception to the filed rate doctrine for tariffs of this type

that would substantially limit FERC's flexibility in approv-ing cost allocation arrangements.

The Louisiana Supreme Court's other basis for upholdingthe LPSC's order was that FERC had not specifically approved the MSS-1 cost allocation after August 5, 1997, when
it issued Order No. 415. See 815 So. 2d, at 38 ("The FERCnever ruled on the issue of whether ELI's decision to continue to include the ERS units is a prudent one"). In soholding, the Louisiana Supreme Court revived precisely the
same erroneous reasoning that was advanced by the Mississippi Supreme Court in MP&L. There this Court noted
that the "view that the pre-emptive effect of FERC jurisdiction turn[s] on whether a particular matter was actually determined in the FERC proceedings" has been "long rejected." MP&L, supra, at 374. It matters not whether
FERC has spoken to the precise classification of ERS units,
but only whether the FERC tariff dictates how and by whom
that classification should be made. The amended system
agreement clearly does so, and therefore the LPSC's secondguessing of the classification of ERS units is pre-empted.

Finally, we address respondents' contention that the inclusion of ERS units in MSS-1 calculations was a violation of
the amended system agreement and that, consequently, the
LPSC's order is shielded from federal pre-emption. Curiously, respondents advance this argument here despite the
LPSC's own prior holding that it does not have jurisdiction
to determine whether the system agreement was violated
and the Louisiana Supreme Court's acceptance of that concession. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a; 815 So. 2d, at 35-36.
ELI and the United States maintain that the LPSC was correct when it initially held that FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a FERC tariff has been violated
and that state regulatory agencies may not, consistent with
the FPA, disallow costs based on their own assessment of

Opinion of the Court
noncompliance with a FERC tariff. But the question beforeus is whether the LPSC's order is pre-empted under Nantahala and MP&L, and that order does not rest on a findingthat the system agreement was violated. The LPSC's express statement that it had no jurisdiction to conclude thatthere had been a violation of the system agreement confirms
this. Consequently, we have no occasion to address thequestion of the exclusivity of FERC's jurisdiction to determine whether and when a filed rate has been violated.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Louisiana
Supreme Court is reversed.

It is so ordered.

THE CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC., et al.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supremecourt of alabama

No. 02-1295. Decided June 2, 2003
Respondents Alafabco, Inc., and its officers filed suit in Alabama Circuit

Court, alleging that Alafabco had incurred massive debt because petitioner bank had unlawfully reneged on an agreement to provide capital
sufficient to complete a specific building project. The bank moved to
compel arbitration as provided in the parties' debt-restructuring agreements. The court ordered respondents to submit to arbitration, but the
State Supreme Court reversed, finding that, because the agreements
had no substantial effect on interstate commerce, there was an insufficient nexus with such commerce to establish Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA) coverage of the parties' dispute.

Held: There is sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make the arbitration provision enforceable under the FAA. By applying to a contract "evidencing a transaction involving commerce," 9 U. S. C. $ 2, the
FAA provides for "the enforcement of arbitration agreements within
the full reach of the Commerce Clause," Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483,
490. It is thus perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range
of transactions than those actually "in commerce." Although the debtrestructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy the FAA's "involving commerce" test.
First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern United
States, using substantial loans from the bank that were renegotiated
and redocumented in the debt-restructuring agreements. Second, the
restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw
materials. Third, commercial lending has a broad impact on the national economy. The Alabama Supreme Court's cramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power appears to rest on a misreading of
United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, which does not suggest that limits
on the power to regulate commerce are breached by applying the FAA
to disputes arising out of commercial loan transactions such as these.

Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.

The question presented is whether the parties' debtrestructuring agreement is "a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce" within the meaning of the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA). 9 U. S. C. $ 2. As we concluded in
Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995),
there is a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make
enforceable, pursuant to the FAA, an arbitration provision
included in that agreement.

I
Petitioner The Citizens Bank--an Alabama lending institution--seeks to compel arbitration of a financial dispute
with respondents Alafabco, Inc.--an Alabama fabrication and
construction company--and its officers. According to a complaint filed by respondents in Alabama state court, the dispute among the parties arose out of a series of commercial
loan transactions made over a decade-long course of business
dealings. In 1986, the complaint alleges, the parties entered
into a quasi-contractual relationship in which the bank
agreed to provide operating capital necessary for Alafabco
to secure and complete construction contracts. That relationship began to sour in 1998, when the bank allegedly encouraged Alafabco to bid on a large construction contract
in Courtland, Alabama, but refused to provide the capital
necessary to complete the project. In order to compensate
for the bank's alleged breach of the parties' implied agreement, Alafabco completed the Courtland project with funds
that would otherwise have been dedicated to repaying existing obligations to the bank. Alafabco in turn became delinquent in repaying those existing obligations.

On two occasions, the parties attempted to resolve the
outstanding debts. On May 3, 1999, Alafabco and the bank
executed " `renewal notes' " in which all previous loans were

restructured and redocumented. 872 So. 2d 798 (Ala. 2002).
The debt-restructuring arrangement included an arbitration
agreement covering " `all disputes, claims, or controversies.' "
That agreement provided that the FAA " `shall apply to [its]
construction, interpretation, and enforcement.' " Id., at 799.
Alafabco defaulted on its obligations under the renewal notes
and sought bankruptcy protection in federal court in September 1999.

In return for the dismissal of Alafabco's bankruptcy petition, the bank agreed to renegotiate the outstanding loans in
a second debt-restructuring agreement. On December 10,
1999, the parties executed new loan documents encompassing
Alafabco's entire outstanding debt, approximately $430,000,
which was secured by a mortgage on commercial real estate
owned by the individual respondents, by Alafabco's accounts
receivable, inventory, supplies, fixtures, machinery, and
equipment, and by a mortgage on the house of one of the
individual respondents. Id., at 800. As part of the second
debt-restructuring agreement, the parties executed an arbitration agreement functionally identical to that of May 3,
1999.

Within a year of the December 1999 debt restructuring,
Alafabco brought suit in the Circuit Court of Lawrence
County, Alabama, against the bank and its officers. Alafabco alleged, among other causes of action, breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, intentional infliction
of emotional distress, and interference with a contractual or
business relationship. Essentially, the suit alleged that Alafabco detrimentally " `incur[red] massive debt' " because the
bank had unlawfully reneged on its agreement to provide
capital sufficient to complete the Courtland project. Id., at
799. Invoking the arbitration agreements, the bank moved
to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute. The Circuit
Court ordered respondents to submit to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreements.

The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed over JusticeSee's dissent. Applying a test it first adopted in Sisters of

a "substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872 So. 2d,at 801, 803. Because there was no showing "that any portion of the restructured debt was actually attributable tointerstate transactions; that the funds comprising that debt
originated out-of-state; or that the restructured debt was in-separable from any out-of-state projects,"

id., at 805, thecourt found an insufficient nexus with interstate commerce

to establish FAA coverage of the parties' dispute.Justice See in dissent explained why, in his view, the court
had erred by using the test formulated in Sisters of the Visi-tation, in which the Supreme Court of Alabama read this
Court's opinion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549(1995), to require that "a particular contract, in order to be
enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act must, by it-self, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872
So. 2d, at 808. Rejecting that stringent test and assessingthe evidence with a more generous view of the necessary
effect on interstate commerce, Justice See would have foundthat the bank's loans to Alafabco satisfied the FAA's "involving commerce" requirement.

II
The FAA provides that a

"written provision in any maritime transaction or a con-tract

evidencing a transaction involving commerce tosettle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out

of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to performthe whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy aris-ing out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall

be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon suchgrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation

of any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2 (emphasis added).
The statute further defines "commerce" to include "com-merce among the several States." $ 1. Echoing Justice

See's dissenting opinion, petitioner contends that the deci-sion below gives inadequate breadth to the "involving commerce" language of the statute. We agree.We have interpreted the term "involving commerce" in the
FAA as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term"affecting commerce"--words of art that ordinarily signal
the broadest permissible exercise of Congress' CommerceClause power. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., 513 U. S., at
273-274. Because the statute provides for "the enforcementof arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause," Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 490 (1987), itis perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range
of transactions than those actually "in commerce"--that is,"within the flow of interstate commerce," Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., supra, at 273 (internal quotation marks, citation,and emphasis omitted).

The Supreme Court of Alabama was therefore misguidedin its search for evidence that a "portion of the restructured
debt was actually attributable to interstate transactions" orthat the loans "originated out-of-state" or that "the restructured debt was inseparable from any out-of-state projects."872 So. 2d, at 805. Such evidence might be required if the
FAA were restricted to transactions actually " `in com-merce,' "

Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186,195-196 (1974), but, as we have explained, that is not the

limit of the FAA's reach.Nor is application of the FAA defeated because the individual debt-restructuring transactions, taken alone, didnot have a "substantial effect on interstate commerce." 872
So. 2d, at 803. Congress' Commerce Clause power "maybe exercised in individual cases without show ing any

specific effect upon interstate commerce" if in the aggregatethe economic activity in question would represent "a general

practice . . . subject to federal control." Mandeville Island
Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219,
236 (1948). See also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146,154 (1971);

Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128 (1942).
Only that general practice need bear on interstate commerce
in a substantial way. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196-197, n. 27 (1968);

NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301
U. S. 1, 37-38 (1937).This case is well within our previous pronouncements on

the extent of Congress' Commerce Clause power. Although
the debt-restructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy the
FAA's "involving commerce" test for at least three reasons.
First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern United States using substantial loans from the bank
that were renegotiated and redocumented in the debtrestructuring agreements. Indeed, the gravamen of Alafabco's state-court suit was that it had incurred " `massive
debt' " to the bank in order to keep its business afloat, and
the bank submitted affidavits of bank officers establishing
that its loans to Alafabco had been used in part to finance
large construction projects in North Carolina, Tennessee,
and Alabama.

Second, the restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw materials. If the
Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate local
business establishments purchasing substantial quantities of
goods that have moved in interstate commerce, Katzenbach
v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 304-305 (1964), it necessarily
reaches substantial commercial loan transactions secured by
such goods.

Third, were there any residual doubt about the magnitude
of the impact on interstate commerce caused by the particu539US1 Unit: $U65 [07-05-05 16:58:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN
58 CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC.

Per Curiam
lar economic transactions in which the parties were engaged,that doubt would dissipate upon consideration of the "general practice" those transactions represent. Mandeville Island Farms, supra, at 236. No elaborate explanation is
needed to make evident the broad impact of commercial lend-ing on the national economy or Congress' power to regulate

that activity pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Lewis v.
BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 38-39 (1980)("[B]anking and related financial activities are of profound

local concern. . . . Nonetheless, it does not follow that thesesame activities lack important interstate attributes");

Perez,
supra, at 154-155 ("Extortionate credit transactions, though
purely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affect
interstate commerce").

The decision below therefore adheres to an improperly
cramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power. That
view, first announced by the Supreme Court of Alabama in
Sisters of the Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775
So. 2d 759 (2000), appears to rest on a misreading of our
decision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995).
Lopez did not restrict the reach of the FAA or implicitly
overrule Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.--indeed, we did not
discuss that case in Lopez. Nor did Lopez purport to announce a new rule governing Congress' Commerce Clause
power over concededly economic activity such as the debtrestructuring agreements before us now. 514 U. S., at 561.
To be sure, "the power to regulate commerce, though broad
indeed, has limits," Maryland v. Wirtz, supra, at 196, but
nothing in our decision in Lopez suggests that those limits
are breached by applying the FAA to disputes arising out of
the commercial loan transactions in this case.

Accordingly, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted,
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

HILLSIDE DAIRY INC. et al. v. LYONS, SECRE-TARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-950. Argued April 22, 2003--Decided June 9, 2003*
In most of the country, but not California, the minimum price paid to dairy

farmers producing raw milk is regulated pursuant to federal marketing
orders, which guarantee a uniform price for the producers, but through
pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy
products to pay different prices. California has adopted a similar, although more complex, program to regulate the minimum prices paid
by California processors to California producers. Three state statutes
create California's milk marketing structure: 1935 and 1967 Acts establish milk pricing and pooling plans, while a 1947 Act governs the composition of milk products sold in the State. Under the state scheme, California processors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes
into a price equalization pool) that is higher than the prices paid to
producers. During the 1990's, it became profitable for some California
processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers. In 1997, the
California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its regulations
to require contributions to the price equalization pool on some out-ofstate purchases. Petitioners, out-of-state dairy farmers, brought these
suits, alleging that the 1997 amendment unconstitutionally discriminates
against them. Without reaching the merits, the District Court dismissed both cases. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding, inter alia, that
a 1996 federal statute immunized California's milk pricing and pooling
laws from Commerce Clause challenge, and that the individual petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims failed because the 1997
amendment did not, on its face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.

Held:

1. California's milk pricing and pooling regulations are not exempted
from Commerce Clause scrutiny by $ 144 of the Federal Agriculture
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 7 U. S. C. $ 7254, which provides:

"Nothing in this Act . . . shall be construed to . . . limit the authority of

of milk solids or solids not fat in fluid milk products sold . . . in [that]
State . . . ; or . . . the labeling of such fluid milk products . . . ." Section
144 plainly covers California laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milk products, but does not mention pricing laws. This
Court will not assume that Congress has authorized state regulations
that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce unless such an
intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc.
v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82, 91. Because $ 144 does not express such an
intent with respect to California's pricing and pooling laws, the Ninth
Circuit erred in relying on that section to dismiss petitioners' Commerce
Clause challenge. Pp. 64-66.

2. The Ninth Circuit's rejection of the individual petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims is inconsistent with Chalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R. Co., 249 U. S. 522, 527, in which this Court
held that the practical effect of a Tennessee tax--which did not on its
face draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence, but did impose a higher rate on persons having their principal offices out of
State--was discriminatory, given that an individual's chief office is commonly in the State of which he is a citizen. In these cases as well, the
absence of an express statement in the California laws and regulations
identifying out-of-state residency or citizenship as a basis for disparate
treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting petitioners' claim. In
so holding, this Court expresses no opinion on the merits of that claim.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
In most of the United States, not including California,
the minimum price paid to dairy farmers producing raw milkis regulated pursuant to federal marketing orders. Those

orders guarantee a uniform price for the producers, butthrough pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy products to pay different prices. Thus,for example, processors of fluid milk pay a premium price,
part of which goes into an equalization pool that provides a
partial subsidy for cheese manufacturers who pay a net price
that is lower than the farmers receive. See West Lynn
Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 189, n. 1 (1994).

The California Legislature has adopted a similar program
to regulate the minimum prices paid by California processors
to California producers. In the cases before us today, outof-state producers are challenging the constitutionality of a
1997 amendment to that program. They present us with
two questions: (1) whether $ 144 of the Federal Agriculture

Opinion of the Court
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 917, 7U. S. C. $ 7254, exempts California's milk pricing and pooling

regulations from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause; and(2) whether the individual petitioners' claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause is foreclosed because those reg-ulations do not discriminate on their face on the basis of state
citizenship or state residence.

I
Government regulation of the marketing of raw milk hasbeen continuous since the Great Depression.

1 In California,

three related statutes establish the regulatory structure formilk produced, processed, or sold in California. First, in

1935, the State enacted the Milk Stabilization and MarketingAct, Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. $$ 61801-62403 (West
2001), "to establish minimum producer prices at fair and rea-sonable levels so as to generate reasonable producer incomes
that will promote the intelligent and orderly marketing ofmarket milk . . . ." $ 61802(h). Then, California created
requirements for composition of milk products in the Milkand Milk Products Act of 1947. $$ 32501- 39912. The
standards created under this Act mandate minimum percent-ages of fat and solids-not-fat in dairy products and often require fortification of milk by adding solids-not-fat. In 1967,California passed another milk pricing Act, the Gonsalves
Milk Pooling Act, $$ 62700-62731, to address deficiencies inthe existing pricing scheme. Together, these three Acts (including numerous subsequent revisions) create the state milk
marketing structure: The 1935 and 1967 Acts establish themilk pricing and pooling plans, while the 1947 Act governs

the composition of milk products sold in California.While it serves the same purposes as the federal marketing orders, California's regulatory program is more complex.

1 The history and purpose of federal regulation of milk marketing is
described in some detail in Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 172-187 (1969).

Opinion of the Court
Federal orders typically guarantee all producers the sameminimum price and create only two or three classes of end

uses to determine the processors' contributions to, or with-drawals from, the equalization pools, whereas under the California scheme some of the farmers' production commands a"quota price" and some receives a lower "overbase price,"
and the processors' end uses of the milk are divided into five
different classes.The complexities of the California scheme are not relevant

to these cases; what is relevant is the fact California proces-sors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes
into a pool) that is higher than either of the prices paid tothe producers.

2 During the early 1990's, market conditions

made it profitable for some California processors to buy rawmilk from out-of-state producers at prices that were higher

than either the quota prices or the overbase prices guaran-teed to California farmers yet lower than the premium prices
they had to pay when making in-state purchases. The regulatory scheme was at least partially responsible for the advantage enjoyed by out-of-state producers because it did not
require the processors to make any contribution to the equalization pool on such purchases. In other words, whereas an
in-state purchase of raw milk resold as fluid milk required
the processor both to pay a guaranteed minimum to the
farmer and also to make a contribution to the pool, an outof-state purchase at a higher price would often be cheaper
because it required no pool contribution.

In 1997, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its plan to require that contributions to the

2 Because processors of fluid milk typically manufacture some other
products as well, their respective pool contributions reflect the relative
amounts of those end uses. Each processor's mix of end uses produces an
individual monthly "blend price" that is multiplied by its total purchases.
Under federal orders the term "blend price" has a different meaning; it
usually refers to the price that the producer receives. See West Lynn
Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 189, n. 1 (1994).

pool be made on some out-of-state purchases.3 It is the im-position of that requirement that gave rise to this litigation.

Petitioners in No. 01-950 operate dairy farms in Nevada;petitioners in No. 01-1018 operate such farms in Arizona.
They contend that the 1997 amendment discriminatesagainst them. In response, the California officials contend
that it merely eliminated an unfair competitive advantage for
out-of-state producers that was the product of the regulatoryscheme itself.

Without reaching the merits of petitioners' constitutionalclaims, the District Court dismissed both cases and the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 259 F. 3d1148 (2001). Relying on its earlier decision in

Shamrock
Farms Co. v. Veneman, 146 F. 3d 1177 (1998), the court heldthat a federal statute enacted in 1996 had immunized California's milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clausechallenge. It also held that the corporate petitioners had no
standing to raise a claim under the Privileges and Immuni-ties Clause, and that the individuals' claim under that Clause
failed because the 1997 plan amendments did not, "on their
face, create classifications based on any individual's residency
or citizenship." 259 F. 3d, at 1156. We granted certiorari
to review those two holdings, 537 U. S. 1099 (2003), but in
doing so we do not reach the merits of either constitutional
claim.

II

In some respects, the State's composition standards set
forth in the 1947 Act exceed those set by the federal Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). For example, California's
minimum standard for reduced fat milk requires that it contain at least 10 percent solids-not-fat (which include protein,

quota price must make contributions to the pool on their out-of-state purchases as well as their in-state purchases.

calcium, lactose, and other nutrients). Cal. Food & Agric.Code Ann. $ 38211 (West 2001). Federal standards require

that reduced fat milk contain only 8.25 percent solids-not-fat.See 21 CFR $$ 131.110, 101.62 (2002). Some of California's
standards were arguably pre-empted by Congress' enact-ment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990,
104 Stat. 2353, which contains a prohibition against the appli-cation of state quality standards to foods moving in interstate commerce. See 21 U. S. C. $ 343-1(a). The DistrictCourt so held in

Shamrock Farms Co. v. Veneman, No. Civ-S-95-318 (ED Cal., Sept. 25, 1996). In response to that decision, California sought an exemption from both the FDAand Congress. See Shamrock Farms, 146 F. 3d, at 1180.
Before the FDA acted, Congress responded favorably withthe enactment of the statute that governs our disposition of
these cases. That statute, $ 144 of the Federal AgricultureImprovement and Reform Act of 1996, provides:

"Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shallbe construed to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise limit the
authority of the State of California, directly or indi-rectly, to establish or continue to effect any law, regulation, or requirement regarding--
"(1) the percentage of milk solids or solids not fat influid milk products sold at retail or marketed in the

State of California; or
"(2) the labeling of such fluid milk products with regard
to milk solids or solids not fat." 7 U. S. C. $ 7254.

Thereafter, Shamrock Farms brought another suit againstthe Secretary of the California Department of Food and

Agriculture challenging the validity of both the State's com-positional standards and its milk pricing and pooling laws.
In that case, the Court of Appeals held that $ 144 had immu-nized California's marketing programs as well as the compositional standards from a negative Commerce Clause chal539US1 Unit: $U66 [05-03-05 18:18:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
lenge. Shamrock Farms, 146 F. 3d, at 1182. In adheringto that ruling in the cases before us today, the Ninth Circuit erred.The text of the federal statute plainly covers California
laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milkproducts, but does not mention laws regulating pricing.
Congress certainly has the power to authorize state regula-tions that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce, Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408 (1946),but we will not assume that it has done so unless such an
intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82, 91-92 (1984). While$ 144 unambiguously expresses such an intent with respect

to California's compositional and labeling laws, that expres-sion does not encompass the pricing and pooling laws. This
conclusion is buttressed by the separate California statutesaddressing the composition and labeling of milk products, on
the one hand, and the pricing and pooling of milk on theother. See

supra, at 62-65 and this page. The mere factthat the composition and labeling laws relate to the sale of

fluid milk is by no means sufficient to bring them within thescope of $ 144. Because $ 144 does not clearly express an
intent to insulate California's pricing and pooling laws froma Commerce Clause challenge, the Court of Appeals erred in
relying on $ 144 to dismiss the challenge.

III
Article IV, $ 2, of the Constitution provides:

"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privi-leges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."

Petitioners, who include both individual dairy farmers andcorporate dairies, have alleged that California's milk pricing
laws violate that provision. The Court of Appeals held thatthe corporate petitioners have no standing to advance such

Opinion of the Court
a claim, and it rejected the individual petitioners' claims be-cause the California laws "do not, on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship."259 F. 3d, at 1156. Petitioners do not challenge the first
holding, but they contend that the second is inconsistent withour decision in Chalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R.
Co., 249 U. S. 522 (1919). We agree.In

Chalker, we held that a Tennessee tax imposed on acitizen and resident of Alabama for engaging in the business

of constructing a railroad in Tennessee violated the Privi-leges and Immunities Clause. The tax did not on its face
draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence. Itdid, however, impose a higher rate on persons who had their
principal offices out of State. Taking judicial notice of thefact that "the chief office of an individual is commonly in the
State of which he is a citizen," we concluded that the practi-cal effect of the provision was discriminatory. Id., at 527.
Whether Chalker should be interpreted as merely applyingthe Clause to classifications that are but proxies for differential treatment against out-of-state residents, or as prohibit-ing any classification with the practical effect of discriminating against such residents, is a matter we need not decide atthis stage of these cases. Under either interpretation, we
agree with petitioners that the absence of an express state-ment in the California laws and regulations identifying outof-state citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment is nota sufficient basis for rejecting this claim. In so holding,
however, we express no opinion on the merits of petitioners'Privileges and Immunities Clause claim.

NGUYEN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-10873. Argued March 24, 2003--Decided June 9, 2003*
Petitioners were tried, convicted, and sentenced on federal narcotics

charges in the District Court of Guam, a territorial court with subjectmatter jurisdiction over both federal-law and local-law causes. The
Ninth Circuit panel convened to hear their appeals included two judges
from that court, both of whom are life-tenured Article III judges, and
the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands,
an Article IV territorial-court judge appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Senate for a 10-year term. Neither petitioner objected to the panel's composition before the cases were submitted for
decision, and neither sought rehearing to challenge the panel's authority
to decide their appeals after it affirmed their convictions. However,
each filed a certiorari petition claiming that the judgment is invalid because a non-Article III judge participated on the panel.

Held: The Ninth Circuit panel did not have the authority to decide petitioners' appeals. Pp. 74-83.

(a) In light of the relevant statutory provisions and historical usage,
it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District
Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be "district judges" within
the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 292(a), which authorizes the assignment of
"one or more district judges within [a] circuit" to sit on the court of
appeals "whenever the business of that court so requires." As used
throughout Title 28, "district court" means a " `court of the United
States' " "constituted by chapter 5 of this title." $ 451. Among other
things, Chapter 5 creates a "United States District Court" for each judicial district, $ 132(a), exhaustively enumerates the districts so constituted, $ 133(a), and describes "district judges" as holding office "during
good behavior," $ 134(a). Significantly, the District Court for the
Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the enumerated courts, nor is it
even mentioned in Chapter 5. See $ 133(a). Because that court's
judges are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the
President for cause, they also do not satisfy $ 134(a)'s command for district judges to hold office during good behavior. Although the Chief

Syllabus
Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is literally
a "district judge" of a court "within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit," such a reading of $ 292(a) is so capacious that it would also justify the designation
of "district judges" of any number of state courts "within" the Ninth
Circuit. Moreover, historically, the term "United States District
Court" in Title 28 has ordinarily excluded Article IV territorial courts,
even when their jurisdiction is similar to that of an Article III United
States District Court. E. g., Mookini v. United States, 303 U. S. 201,
205. Pp. 74-76.

(b) The Government's three grounds for leaving the judgments below
undisturbed are not persuasive. First, this Court's precedents concerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judges do not compel
application here of the de facto officer doctrine, which confers validity
upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title
even though it is later discovered that the legality of that person's
appointment to office is deficient, Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S.
177, 180. Typically, the Court has found a judge's actions to be valid
de facto when there is a "merely technical" defect of statutory authority, McDowell v. United States, 159 U. S. 596, 601-602, but not when,
as here, there has been a violation of a statutory provision that embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization
of the federal courts, see, e. g., American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville,
T. & K. W. R. Co., 148 U. S. 372, 387. Second, for essentially the same
reasons, it is inappropriate to accept the Government's invitation to
assess the merits of petitioners' convictions or whether the fairness,
integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the
composition of the panel. Third, the Government's argument that the
presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the panel is
sufficient to support the decision below is rejected for two reasons.
The federal quorum statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 46(d), has been on the books
(in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century, yet this
Court has never doubted its power to vacate a judgment entered by an
improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum
of judges competent to consider the appeal. See, e. g., United States v.
American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685. Moreover, the statute
authorizing courts of appeals to sit in panels, $ 46(b), requires the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance. Although the two
Article III judges who took part below would have constituted a quorum
had the original panel been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.
Thus, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for
fresh consideration by a properly constituted panel. Pp. 77-83.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases present the question whether a panel of theCourt of Appeals consisting of two Article III judges and

one Article IV judge had the authority to decide petitioners'appeals. We conclude it did not, and we therefore vacate
the judgments of the Court of Appeals.

72 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
to the United States," the Organic Act of Guam created a
territorial court, the District Court of Guam, and vested it
with subject-matter jurisdiction over causes arising under
both federal law and local law.3 Petitioners were tried before a jury, convicted, and sentenced in the District Court of
Guam to lengthy prison terms for federal narcotics offenses.
Petitioners do not dispute that court's jurisdiction to conduct
their criminal trial and enter judgments of conviction.

As authorized by statute,4 petitioners appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The
panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief
Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both
of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who
serve during "good Behaviour" for compensation that may
not be diminished while in office. U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1.
The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. That
court is not an Article III court but an Article IV territorial
court with subject-matter jurisdiction substantially similar

3 See Organic Act of Guam $ 22, 64 Stat. 389, 48 U. S. C. $ 1424. "The
`District Court of Guam' rather than `United States District Court of
Guam' was chosen as the court's title, since it was created under Art. IV,

$ 3, of the Federal Constitution rather than under Art. III, and since

$ 22 vested the court with original jurisdiction to decide both local and
federal-question matters." Guam v. Olsen, 431 U. S. 195, 196-197, n. 1
(1977) (citing S. Rep. No. 2109, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1950)). The Guam
Legislature was authorized as well to create local courts and transfer to
them jurisdiction over certain cases that otherwise could be heard by the
District Court of Guam. See Olsen, 431 U. S., at 200-201 (citing Agana

Opinion of the Court
to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Guam.5 TheChief Judge of the District for the Northern Mariana Islands,

unlike an Article III judge, is appointed by the Presidentand confirmed by the Senate for a term of 10 years, "unless
sooner removed by the President for cause." 6The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as
a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during specialsittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. When
the Court of Appeals heard arguments in Guam, the ChiefJudge of the Ninth Circuit invited the Chief Judge of the
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to partici-pate. A judge of the District Court of Guam was similarly
invited to participate in appeals heard while the Ninth Cir-cuit sat in the Northern Mariana Islands.

The panel affirmed petitioners' convictions without dissent. 284 F. 3d 1086 (2002). Neither Nguyen nor Phan ob-jected to the composition of the panel before the cases were

submitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearing
after the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challengethe panel's authority to decide their appeals. Each did,

however, file a petition for certiorari raising the questionwhether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalid
because of the participation of a non-Article III judge onthe panel. In accordance with this Court's Rule 10(a), we
granted the writ, 537 U. S. 999 (2002), to determine whether

Opinion of the Court
the Court of Appeals had "so far departed from the accepted
and usual course of judicial proceedings as to call for an exercise of this Court's supervisory powers." Pet. for Cert. in
No. 01-10873, p. 6; Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-5034, p. 5. For
the following reasons, we find these to be appropriate cases
for the exercise of that power.

II
We begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district
judges to serve on the courts of appeals. In relevant part,
the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit
to assign "one or more district judges within the circuit" to
sit on the court of appeals "whenever the business of that
court so requires." 28 U. S. C. $ 292(a). Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the "district judges" who may
be assigned to the court of appeals. However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District
Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not "district
judges" within the meaning of $ 292(a).

Outside of $ 292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly
instructive provisions. The term "district court" as used
throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a " `court of the United
States' " that is "constituted by chapter 5 of this title."

$ 451. Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a "United States
District Court" for each judicial district. $ 132(a) ("There
shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall
be a court of record known as the United States District
Court for the district"). And "district judge[s]" are established as the members of those courts. $ 132(b) ("Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for
the district in regular active service"). The judicial districts
constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.

$ 133(a) ("The President shall appoint, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several ju539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dicial districts, as follows [listing districts]"). Lastly, Chapter 5 describes "district judges" as holding office "during
good behavior." $ 134(a).

Taking these provisions together, $ 292(a) cannot be read
to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge
of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.
Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana
Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of
Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.7
See $ 133(a). Because the judges of the District Court for
the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of
years and may be removed by the President for cause, they
also do not satisfy the command for district judges within
the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.

$ 134(a).

The Government agrees these statutory provisions are
best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the
Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth
Circuit. The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term "district judge" separately from the term
"district court." This contention requires an excessively
strained interpretation of the statute. To be sure, a literal
reading of the words "district judges" in isolation from the
rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief
Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands
for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a "district
judge" of a court "within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit." But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would also
justify the designation of "district judges" of any number of

Opinion of the Court
state courts "within" the Ninth Circuit.8 The statute cannotplausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.Moreover, we do not read the designation statute without
regard for the "historic significance" of the term "UnitedStates District Court" used in Title 28. Mookini v. United
States, 303 U. S. 201, 205 (1938). "[W]ithout an addition ex-pressing a wider connotation," that term ordinarily excludes
Article IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdictionis similar to that of a United States District Court created
under Article III. Ibid. See also Summers v. United
States, 231 U. S. 92, 101-102 (1913) ("[T]he courts of the Ter-ritories may have such jurisdiction of cases arising under the

Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested inthe circuit and district courts, but this does not make them
circuit and district courts of the United States"); Stephens v.Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 476-477 (1899) ("It must be
admitted that the words `United States District Court' werenot accurately used . . . [to refer to] the United States Court
in the Indian Territory"). Construing the relevant statu-tory provisions together with further aid from historical
usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate thejudges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be "district judges" within the meaning of $ 292(a).It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member
of the panel deciding petitioners' appeals was unauthorized.9

8 Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington are all
States within the Ninth Circuit whose judiciaries include "district judges."

Opinion of the Court

III
Although the Government concedes that the panel of theCourt of Appeals was improperly constituted, it advances

three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undis-turbed. Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm
concern petitioners' failure to object to the panel's composi-tion in the Court of Appeals. Relying on the so-called "

defacto officer" doctrine, the Government contends petitioners'

failure to challenge the panel's composition at the earliestpracticable moment completely forecloses relief in this
Court. The Government also contends that petitioners donot meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review. The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualifiedjudges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third
ground sufficient to support the decision below. We do notfind these contentions persuasive.

The de facto officer doctrine, we have explained, "confersvalidity upon acts performed by a person acting under the
color of official title even though it is later discovered thatthe legality of that person's appointment or election to office
is deficient." Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177, 180(1995). Whatever the force of the

de facto officer doctrinein other circumstances, an examination of our precedents

concerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judges
does not compel us to apply it in these cases.Typically, we have found a judge's actions to be valid

de
facto when there is a "merely technical" defect of statutoryauthority.

Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 535 (1962)
(plurality opinion of Harlan, J.). In McDowell v. United
States, 159 U. S. 596, 601-602 (1895), for example, the Court
declined to notice alleged irregularities in a Circuit Judge'sdesignation of a District Judge for temporary service in another district. See also Ball v. United States, 140 U. S. 118,
tion. We find it unnecessary to discuss the constitutional questions because the statutory violation is clear.

Opinion of the Court
128-129 (1891) (assigned judge had de facto authority to replace a deceased judge even though he had been designated
to replace a disabled judge). We observed in McDowell,
however, that the judge whose assignment had been questioned was otherwise qualified to serve, because he was
"a judge of the United States District Court, having all the
powers attached to such office," and because the Circuit
Judge was otherwise empowered to designate him. 159
U. S., at 601.

By contrast, we have agreed to correct, at least on direct
review, violations of a statutory provision that "embodies a
strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial
business" even though the defect was not raised in a timely
manner. Glidden, 370 U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). In
American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148
U. S. 372 (1893), the case Justice Harlan cited for this proposition in Glidden, a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
was challenged because one member of that court had been
prohibited by statute from taking part in the hearing and
decision of the appeal.10 This Court succinctly observed: "If
the statute made him incompetent to sit at the hearing, the
decree in which he took part was unlawful, and perhaps absolutely void, and should certainly be set aside or quashed by
any court having authority to review it by appeal, error or
certiorari." 148 U. S., at 387. The American Constr. Co.
rule was again applied in William Cramp & Sons Ship &
Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Tur10 The petitioners in American Constr. Co. challenged the participation
of a Circuit Judge who, while sitting as a trial judge, had entered an order
closely related to the matter under review in the Circuit Court of Appeals.
At the time, the relevant statute governing the composition of the circuit
courts of appeals provided that "no justice or judge before whom a cause
or question may have been tried or heard in a district court, or existing
circuit court, shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in
the circuit court of appeals." Evarts Act, ch. 517, $ 3, 26 Stat. 827.

Opinion of the Court
bine Co., 228 U. S. 645 (1913), even though the parties had
consented in the Circuit Court of Appeals to the participation of a District Judge who was not permitted by statute to
consider the appeal. Id., at 650. Rather than sift through
the underlying merits, we remanded to the Circuit Court of
Appeals "so that the case may be heard by a competent
court, [organized] conformably to the requirements of the
statute." Id., at 651. See also Moran v. Dillingham, 174
U. S. 153, 158 (1899) ("[T]his court, without considering
whether that decree was or was not erroneous in other respects, orders the Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals to
be set aside and quashed, and the case remanded to that
court to be there heard and determined according to law by
a bench of competent judges" (emphasis deleted)).

We are confronted in petitioners' cases with a question of
judicial authority more fundamental than whether "some effort has been made to conform with the formal conditions
on which [a judge's] particular powers depend." Johnson v.
Manhattan R. Co., 61 F. 2d 934, 938 (CA2 1932) (L. Hand, J.).
The difference between the irregular judicial designations
in McDowell and Ball and the impermissible panel designation in the instant cases is therefore the difference between
an action which could have been taken, if properly pursued,
and one which could never have been taken at all. Like the
statutes in William Cramp & Sons, Moran, and American
Constr. Co., $ 292(a) embodies weighty congressional policy
concerning the proper organization of the federal courts.11

11 The Government seeks to distinguish William Cramp & Sons, Moran,
and American Constr. Co. on the ground that the statutory provision at
issue in each of those cases, unlike $ 292(a), "expressly prohibited" the
challenged judge's participation. Brief for United States 18. In light of
our conclusion that there is no plausible interpretation of $ 292(a) permitting the designation in the instant cases, see supra, at 74-76, we think this
is a distinction without a difference. In any event, there was no "express"
prohibition at play in United States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363
U. S. 685, 690-691 (1960), in which this Court vacated the judgment of a

539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
80 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Section 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service on
the courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoy
the protections set forth in Article III. Congress' decision
to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals
is more than a trivial concern, cf. Northern Pipeline Constr.
Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 57-60 (1982)
(plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect. The Chief
Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport
to have "all the powers attached to" the position of an
Article III judge, McDowell, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was the
Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by

$ 292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.
Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.

For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate
to accept the Government's invitation to assess the merits of
petitioners' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or
public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the
composition of the panel. It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limits
an appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 U. S. C.

$ 2111; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners'
part could create authority Congress has quite carefully
withheld. Even if the parties had expressly stipulated to
the participation of a non-Article III judge in the considerCourt of Appeals, sitting en banc, because a Senior Circuit Judge who had
participated in the decision was not authorized by statute to do so. See
also id., at 691 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The statute need hardly be read,
as the Court now holds it should be, as saying that a case in an en banc
court shall be `heard and determined' by the active circuit judges").

Opinion of the Court
ation of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well
qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not
have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.12
See William Cramp & Sons, 228 U. S., at 650.

More fundamentally, our enforcement of $ 292(a)'s outer
bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of
petitioners' convictions at trial but for the validity of the
composition of the Court of Appeals. As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial
effect. See Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.
250, 254-255 (1988). Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that "embodies
a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business," however, our exercise of supervisory power

is not inconsistent with that general rule.13 Glidden, 370
U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). Thus, we invalidated the

judgment of a Court of Appeals without assessing prejudice,
even though urged to do so, when the error alleged was
the improper composition of that court. See United States
v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685, 690-691
(1960) (vacating judgment of en banc Court of Appeals because participation by Senior Circuit Judge was not provided
by statute).

12 We agree with the Government's submission that the improper composition of the court below was "an isolated, one-time mistake." Brief for
United States 5. Countervailing concerns for gamesmanship, which animate the requirement for contemporaneous objection, therefore dissipate
in these cases in light of the rarity of the improper panel assignment at
issue.

13 "The authority which Congress has granted this Court to review judgments of the courts of appeals undoubtedly vests us not only with the
authority to correct errors of substantive law, but to prescribe the method
by which those courts go about deciding the cases before them." Lehman
Brothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 393 (1974) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).

82 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
It is also true that two judges of a three-judge panel constitute a quorum legally able to transact business.14 Moreover, settled law permits a quorum to proceed to judgment
when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.
United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F. 2d 925, 927
(CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.). For two reasons, however, the
presence of a quorum on the Ninth Circuit panel does not
save the judgments below. First, the quorum statute has
been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged)
for over a century,15 yet this Court has never doubted its
power to vacate the judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of
judges competent to consider the appeal. See United States
v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685 (1960); William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., 228 U. S. 645 (1913);

U. S. 372 (1893).

Second, the statutory authority for courts of appeals to sit
in panels, 28 U. S. C. $ 46(b), requires the inclusion of at least
three judges in the first instance.16 As the Second Circuit

14 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 46(d) provides: "A majority of the number of judges
authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute a
quorum." As used in $ 46(d), "quorum . . . means such a number of the
members of the court as may legally transact judicial business." Tobin v.
Ramey, 206 F. 2d 505, 507 (CA5 1953).

15 See Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 6, $ 117, 36 Stat. 1131:

"There shall be in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consist
of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum . . . ."

The Evarts Act, which established the original circuit courts of appeals,
contained essentially the same provision:

"[T]here is hereby created in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which
shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum."
Ch. 517, $ 2, 26 Stat. 826.

court may authorize the hearing and determination of cases and controversies by separate panels, each consisting of three judges, at least a majority

has noted, Congress apparently enacted $ 46(b) in part "tocurtail the prior practice under which some circuits were

routinely assigning some cases to two-judge panels." Mur-ray v. National Broadcasting Co., 35 F. 3d 45, 47 (1994). It
is "clear that the statute was not intended to preclude dispo-sition by a panel of two judges in the event that one member of a three-judge panel to which the appeal is assignedbecomes unable to participate,"

ibid., but it is less clearwhether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution

for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise com-petent to be part of the panel under $ 292(a). Thus, although
the two Article III judges who took part in the decision ofpetitioners' appeals would have constituted a quorum if the
original panel had been properly created, it is at least highlydoubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel. In light of that doubt, it is appropriate toreturn these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners' appeals by a properly constituted panelorganized "comformably to the requirements of the statute." 17 William Cramp & Sons, 228 U. S., at 651.Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases for further proceedings con-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), courtshave "a

limited power to correct errors that were forfeited

of whom shall be judges of that court, unless such judges cannot sit because recused or disqualified . . . ."

17 Unlike the dissent, we believe that it would "flou[t] the stated will of

Congress," post, at 84 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), and call into serious
question the integrity as well as the public reputation of judicial proceedings to permit the decision below to stand, for no one other than a properly
constituted panel of Article III judges was empowered to exercise appellate jurisdiction in these cases.

By ignoring this well-established limitation of our remedialauthority, the Court flouts the stated will of Congress and

almost 70 years of our own precedent.

It was undoubtedly a mistake, for the reasons stated by
the Court, ante, at 74-76, for the appellate panel to include
an Article IV judge. Exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction
was warranted to review the case and to state the law correctly. To that extent, I agree with the Court's opinion.
But I do not agree that that error is a valid basis for vacating petitioners' convictions, because even assuming that the
error affected petitioners' substantial rights, it simply did
not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

Petitioners knew of the composition of the panel of the
Court of Appeals more than a week before the case was
orally argued. App. 7, 9-12. They made no objection then
or later in that court, preferring to wait until the panel had
decided against them on the merits to raise it. The Court
first concedes, as it must, that a failure to object to error
limits an appellate court to review for plain error. Ante,
at 80. But the Court then completely ignores the fact that
"the authority created by Rule 52(b) is circumscribed."
Olano, supra, at 732. Indeed, the opinion fails to cite, much
less apply, Olano or our other recent cases reaffirming that
"we exercise our power under Rule 52(b) sparingly," Jones

wise result,' " Olano, supra, at 736 (quoting United States v.Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985)).

This failure is baffling in light of our well-established prec-edent and the clarity of Congress' intent to limit federal
courts' authority to correct plain error. As we explained inOlano, we articulated the standard that should guide the
exercise of remedial discretion under Rule 52(b) almost 70years ago in

United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157 (1936).507 U. S., at 736. Congress then codified that standard in

Rule 52(b). Ibid. (quoting Young, supra, at 7). Since then,"we repeatedly have quoted the Atkinson language in describing plain-error review." Olano, supra, at 736 (citingcases). According to this long line of cases, when an error
is plain and affects substantial rights, "an appellate courtmust then determine whether the forfeited error seriously
affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicialproceedings before it may exercise its discretion to correct
the error." Johnson, supra, at 469-470 (quoting Olano,
supra, at 736) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasisadded).

This mandatory inquiry confirms that no "miscarriage ofjustice" would result if petitioners' convictions were affirmed. Petitioners make no claim that Chief Judge Munsonwas biased or incompetent. His character and abilities as a
jurist, peculiarly experienced in adjudicating matters arisingwithin the United States Territories, stand unimpeached.
It is therefore difficult to understand how fairness or thepublic reputation of the judicial process is advanced by
allowing criminal defendants, whose convictions are sup-ported by " `overwhelming' " evidence, Cotton, supra, at 633,
634, and whose arguments on appeal were meritless, to con-sume the public resources necessary for a second appellate
review.*

The Court proffers several justifications for ignoring ourcontrolling precedents, none of which is persuasive. First,

the Court's reliance on United States v. American-ForeignS. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685 (1960), is misplaced. See ante, at
79-80, n. 11, 81, 82. In that case, Circuit Judge Medina re-tired three months after the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit granted a petition for rehearing en banc, but beforethe court issued its en banc decision. 363 U. S., at 686-687.
He nonetheless participated in consideration of the case andsubsequently joined the en banc decision.

Id., at 687. ThisCourt vacated the judgment because, under the relevant

statute, a "court in banc" could consist only of "active circuitjudges." Id., at 685 (quoting 28 U. S. C. $ 46(c) (internal quotation marks omitted)).American-Foreign does not speak to the situation here because the petitioner in that case did not forfeit the error.Forfeiture is " `the failure to make timely assertion of the
right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.' "
Johnson, 520 U. S., at 465 (quoting Olano, 507 U. S., at 731).The petitioner in American-Foreign did not so fail. Rather,

it objected at the earliest possible moment: immediatelyafter the Court of Appeals issued an en banc decision that
Judge Medina joined. It did not know that Judge Medinawould retire or then participate in the en banc decision until
after the case was briefed and submitted; it availed itself ofthe earliest opportunity to object to this error by filing a

discovered drug paraphernalia, "nearly a hundred little plastic zip lock
bags," and $6,000 in cash. Id., at 1088, 1091.

All three members of the Ninth Circuit panel agreed that petitioners'
challenges--that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions--lacked merit. Judge Goodwin, writing for the court, explained
that petitioners' evidentiary challenges were "overstate[d]," and that the
District Court "clearly performed the necessary" analysis. Id., at 1090.
With respect to petitioners' sufficiency of the evidence argument, the
judges were also unanimous "[t]here was plenty of evidence," id., at 1091,
and "abundant facts," id., at 1090, in support of petitioners' convictions.

motion for further rehearing en banc. Petitioner did notforfeit the error, so Rule 52(b) did not apply.

That is not the case here. Petitioners Nguyen and Phanlearned before oral argument that Chief Judge Munson was a
member of their Court of Appeals panel. They nonethelessfailed to object at oral argument or in a petition for rehearing en banc. This forfeiture requires us to apply the Olano
test faithfully.The Court also relies mistakenly on

William Cramp &
Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss
Marine Turbine Co., 228 U. S. 645 (1913), and American
Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148 U. S. 372
(1893). Ante, at 78-79, and n. 11. In both cases, this Court
considered an Act of Congress providing that " `no judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard
in a district court . . . shall sit on the trial or hearing of such
cause or question in the Circuit Court of Appeals.' " 228
U. S., at 649; 148 U. S., at 387. This Court held that, when
a district judge sat in contravention of that "comprehensive
and inflexible" prohibition, 228 U. S., at 650, the court of appeals was statutorily unable to act. See also American
Construction, supra, at 387.

But these cases do not control here because, as the Court
fails to note, both cases predate our adoption of the standard
for plain-error review in Atkinson in 1936, and Congress'
codification of that standard in Rule 52(b) in 1944. This, and
not some broader principle, explains the Court's failure in
those cases to apply our modern plain-error analysis. The
Court has no such excuse. The cases can also easily be distinguished from this litigation on the facts: They held only
that courts constituted "in violation of the express prohibitions of [a] statute" lack the authority to act. Cramp, 228
U. S., at 650 (emphasis added). In contrast, the Ninth Circuit panel in this litigation did not run afoul of any "comprehensive and inflexible" statutory "prohibition." Ibid.
Rather, the error must be deduced by negative implication,

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
from a series of statutes that describe the proper use of dis-trict judges in panels of the Courts of Appeals. See

ante,
at 75-76.The Court also says that "to ignore the violation of the

designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggestthat some action (or inaction) on petitioners' part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld." Ante,
at 80. But proper affirmance of petitioners' convictions onthe ground that the error did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings would notso suggest. The Government has conceded the error, and
the Court's opinion properly makes clear to the Courts of
Appeals that Chief Judge Munson's participation constituted
plain error. Indeed, the Court unwittingly explains why its
own holding is mistaken: By ignoring the limits that Congress has imposed on appellate courts' discretion via Rule
52(b), the Court "create[s]" for itself and exercises "authority
[that] Congress has quite carefully withheld." Ibid.

On this record, there is no basis for concluding that the
error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. No miscarriage of justice
will result from deciding not to notice the plain error here.
Accordingly, I would proceed to address petitioners' constitutional claims. Petitioners argue that the designation of a
non-Article III judge to sit on the Ninth Circuit panel violated the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2,
and the structural guarantees embodied in Article III.
I would decline to address the first question because it was
"neither raised nor decided below, and [was] not presented
in the petition for certiorari." Blessing v. Freestone, 520
U. S. 329, 340, n. 3 (1997).

Petitioners' second constitutional claim, like their statutory one, is subject to plain-error review. "No procedural
principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases
by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before

Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000)); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,514 U. S. 211, 231 (1995) ("[T]he proposition that legal defenses based upon doctrines central to the courts' structuralindependence can never be waived simply does not accord

which civil and criminal matters must be tried").Assuming, arguendo, that petitioners could satisfy the first
three elements of the plain-error inquiry, see Olano, 507U. S., at 732; supra, at 84-85, their constitutional claim fails
for the same reason as does their statutory claim: Petitionershave not shown that the claimed error seriously affected the
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed-ings. See

supra, at 85. I would therefore affirm the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-679. Argued April 21, 2003--Decided June 9, 2003
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it an "unlawful employment

practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual . . . ,
because of . . . sex." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). In Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, this Court considered whether an employment
decision is made "because of" sex in a "mixed-motive" case, i. e., where
both legitimate and illegitimate reasons motivated the decision. Although the Court concluded that an employer had an affirmative defense
if it could prove that it would have made the same decision had gender
not played a role, it was divided on the question of when the burden of
proof shifts to an employer to prove the defense. Justice O'Connor,
concurring in the judgment, concluded that the burden would shift only
where a disparate treatment plaintiff could show by "direct evidence
that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision." Id., at 276. Congress subsequently passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which provides, among other things, that
(1) an unlawful employment practice is established "when the complaining party demonstrates that . . . sex . . . was a motivating factor for
any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the
practice," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(m), and (2) if an individual proves a violation under $ 2000e-2(m), the employer can avail itself of a limited affirmative defense that restricts the available remedies if it demonstrates
that it would have taken the same action absent the impermissible motivating factor, $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Respondent, who was petitioner's
only female warehouse worker and heavy equipment operator, had problems with management and her co-workers, which led to escalating disciplinary sanctions and her ultimate termination. She subsequently
filed this lawsuit, asserting, inter alia, a Title VII sex discrimination
claim. Based on the evidence she presented at trial, the District Court
denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitted the case to the jury. The District Court instructed the jury, as
relevant here, that if respondent proved by a preponderance of the evidence that sex was a motivating factor in the adverse work conditions
imposed on her, but petitioner's conduct was also motivated by lawful

Syllabus
reasons, she was entitled to damages unless petitioner proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have treated her similarly had
gender played no role. Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to this instruction, claiming that respondent had not adduced "direct evidence"
that sex was a motivating factor in petitioner's decision. The jury
awarded respondent backpay and compensatory and punitive damages,
and the District Court denied petitioner's renewed motion for judgment
as a matter of law. A Ninth Circuit panel vacated and remanded,
agreeing with petitioner that the District Court had erred in giving the
mixed-motive instruction. The en banc court, however, reinstated the
judgment, finding that the 1991 Act does not impose any special evidentiary requirement.

Held: Direct evidence of discrimination is not required for a plaintiff to

obtain a mixed-motive jury instruction under Title VII. The starting
point for this Court's analysis is the statutory text. See Connecticut
Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254. Where, as here, the
statute's words are unambiguous, the judicial inquiry is complete. Id.,
at 254. Section 2000e-2(m) unambiguously states that a plaintiff need
only demonstrate that an employer used a forbidden consideration with
respect to any employment practice. On its face, it does not mention
that a plaintiff must make a heightened showing through direct evidence. Moreover, Congress explicitly defined "demonstrates" as to
"mee[t] the burdens of production and persuasion." $ 2000e-2(m). Had
Congress intended to require direct evidence, it could have included
language to that effect in $ 2000e-2(m), as it has unequivocally done
when imposing heightened proof requirements in other circumstances.
See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 5851(b)(3)(D). Title VII's silence also suggests
that this Court should not depart from the conventional rule of civil
litigation generally applied in Title VII cases, which requires a plaintiff
to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence using direct or
circumstantial evidence. This Court has often acknowledged the utility
of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases and has never questioned its adequacy in criminal cases, even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required. Finally, the use of the term "demonstrates"
in other Title VII provisions tends to show that $ 2000e-2(m) does
not incorporate a direct evidence requirement. See e. g., $ 2000e-
2(k)(1)(A)(i). Pp. 98-102.

vidual . . . , because of such individual's race, color, religion,sex, or national origin." 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-

2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,490 U. S. 228 (1989), the Court considered whether an employment decision is made "because of " sex in a "mixed-motive" case,

i. e., where both legitimate and illegitimate
reasons motivated the decision. The Court concluded that,
under $ 2000e-2(a)(1), an employer could "avoid a finding ofliability . . . by proving that it would have made the same

decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such arole."

Id., at 244; see id., at 261, n. (White, J., concurring in
judgment); id., at 261 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The Court was divided, however, over the predicate
question of when the burden of proof may be shifted to an
employer to prove the affirmative defense.

Justice Brennan, writing for a plurality of four Justices,
would have held that "when a plaintiff . . . proves that her
gender played a motivating part in an employment decision,
the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving
by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made
the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff 's gender into account." Id., at 258 (emphasis added). The plurality did not, however, "suggest a limitation on the possible
ways of proving that [gender] stereotyping played a motivating role in an employment decision." Id., at 251-252.

Justice White and Justice O'Connor both concurred in
the judgment. Justice White would have held that the case
was governed by Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429
U. S. 274 (1977), and would have shifted the burden to the
employer only when a plaintiff "show[ed] that the unlawful
motive was a substantial factor in the adverse employment
action." Price Waterhouse, supra, at 259. Justice O'Connor, like Justice White, would have required the plaintiff to
show that an illegitimate consideration was a "substantial
factor" in the employment decision. 490 U. S., at 276. But,
under Justice O'Connor's view, "the burden on the issue

of causation" would shift to the employer only where "adisparate treatment plaintiff [could] show by

direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factorin the decision."

Ibid. (emphasis added).
Two years after Price Waterhouse, Congress passed the1991 Act "in large part [as] a response to a series of decisions

of this Court interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and
1964." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 250(1994). In particular, $ 107 of the 1991 Act, which is at issue

in this case, "respond[ed]" to Price Waterhouse by "settingforth standards applicable in `mixed motive' cases" in two
new statutory provisions.1 511 U. S., at 251. The first es-tablishes an alternative for proving that an "unlawful employment practice" has occurred:

"Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, an
unlawful employment practice is established when thecomplaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor forany employment practice, even though other factors also
motivated the practice." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(m).
The second provides that, with respect to "a claim in which
an individual proves a violation under section 2000e-2(m),"the employer has a limited affirmative defense that does not

absolve it of liability, but restricts the remedies available to
a plaintiff. The available remedies include only declaratory
relief, certain types of injunctive relief, and attorney's fees
and costs. $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).2 In order to avail itself of

have divided over whether a plaintiff must prove by directevidence that an impermissible consideration was a "motivating factor" in an adverse employment action. See 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(m). Relying primarily on

Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Price Waterhouse, a number of courtshave held that direct evidence is required to establish liability under $ 2000e-2(m). See, e. g., Mohr v. Dustrol, Inc., 306F. 3d 636, 640-641 (CA8 2002);

Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Ma-sonry, Inc., 199 F. 3d 572, 580 (CA1 1999); Trotter v. Board

of Trustees of Univ. of Ala., 91 F. 3d 1449, 1453-1454 (CA111996); Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F. 3d 1137, 1142 (CA4 1995). In
the decision below, however, the Ninth Circuit concluded oth-erwise. See infra, at 97-98.

B
Petitioner Desert Palace, Inc., dba Caesar's Palace Hotel &Casino of Las Vegas, Nevada, employed respondent Catharina Costa as a warehouse worker and heavy equipment op-erator. Respondent was the only woman in this job and in
her local Teamsters bargaining unit.Respondent experienced a number of problems with management and her co-workers that led to an escalating seriesof disciplinary sanctions, including informal rebukes, a denial
of privileges, and suspension. Petitioner finally terminatedrespondent after she was involved in a physical altercation
in a warehouse elevator with fellow Teamsters member Her-bert Gerber. Petitioner disciplined both employees because
the facts surrounding the incident were in dispute, but
attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m) of this
title; and

"(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,
reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment, described in subparagraph
(A)."

Opinion of the Court
Gerber, who had a clean disciplinary record, received only a5-day suspension.

Respondent subsequently filed this lawsuit against peti-tioner in the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada, asserting claims of sex discrimination and sexualharassment under Title VII. The District Court dismissed
the sexual harassment claim, but allowed the claim for sexdiscrimination to go to the jury. At trial, respondent presented evidence that (1) she was singled out for "intense`stalking' " by one of her supervisors, (2) she received
harsher discipline than men for the same conduct, (3) shewas treated less favorably than men in the assignment of
overtime, and (4) supervisors repeatedly "stack[ed]" her dis-ciplinary record and "frequently used or tolerated" sex-based
slurs against her. 299 F. 3d 838, 845-846 (CA9 2002).Based on this evidence, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law, and submittedthe case to the jury with instructions, two of which are relevant here. First, without objection from petitioner, the Dis-trict Court instructed the jury that " `[t]he plaintiff has the
burden of proving . . . by a preponderance of the evidence' "that she " `suffered adverse work conditions' " and that her
sex " `was a motivating factor in any such work conditionsimposed upon her.' " Id., at 858.

Second, the District Court gave the jury the followingmixed-motive instruction:

" `You have heard evidence that the defendant's treat-ment of the plaintiff was motivated by the plaintiff 's sex
and also by other lawful reasons. If you find that theplaintiff 's sex was a motivating factor in the defendant's
treatment of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to yourverdict, even if you find that the defendant's conduct was
also motivated by a lawful reason.
" `However, if you find that the defendant's treatment ofthe plaintiff was motivated by both gender and lawful

reasons, you must decide whether the plaintiff is entitled

Opinion of the Court
to damages. The plaintiff is entitled to damages unlessthe defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant would have treated plaintiffsimilarly even if the plaintiff 's gender had played no role
in the employment decision.' " Ibid.
Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to this instruction, claim-ing that respondent had failed to adduce "direct evidence"

that sex was a motivating factor in her dismissal or in anyof the other adverse employment actions taken against her.
The jury rendered a verdict for respondent, awarding back-pay, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. The
District Court denied petitioner's renewed motion for judg-ment as a matter of law.

The Court of Appeals initially vacated and remanded,holding that the District Court had erred in giving the
mixed-motive instruction because respondent had failed topresent "substantial evidence of conduct or statements by
the employer directly reflecting discriminatory animus."268 F. 3d 882, 884 (CA9 2001). In addition, the panel concluded that petitioner was entitled to judgment as a matterof law on the termination claim because the evidence was
insufficient to prove that respondent was "terminated be-cause she was a woman." Id., at 890.

The Court of Appeals reinstated the District Court's judg-ment after rehearing the case en banc. 299 F. 3d 838 (CA9
2002). The en banc court saw no need to decide whether
Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Price Waterhouse con-trolled because it concluded that

Justice O'Connor's refer-ences to "direct evidence" had been "wholly abrogated" by

the 1991 Act. 299 F. 3d, at 850. And, turning "to the lan-guage" of $ 2000e-2(m), the court observed that the statute
"imposes no special [evidentiary] requirement and does notreference `direct evidence.' "

Id., at 853. Accordingly, thecourt concluded that a "plaintiff . . . may establish a violation

through a preponderance of evidence (whether direct or cir-cumstantial) that a protected characteristic played `a moti539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
vating factor.' " Id., at 853-854 (footnote omitted). Basedon that standard, the Court of Appeals held that respondent's evidence was sufficient to warrant a mixed-motive in-struction and that a reasonable jury could have found that
respondent's sex was a "motivating factor in her treatment."Id., at 859. Four judges of the en banc panel dissented, relying in large part on "the reasoning of the prior opinion ofthe three-judge panel."

Id., at 866.We granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 1099 (2003).

II
This case provides us with the first opportunity to considerthe effects of the 1991 Act on jury instructions in mixedmotive cases. Specifically, we must decide whether a plain-tiff must present direct evidence of discrimination in order
to obtain a mixed-motive instruction under 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e-2(m). Petitioner's argument on this point proceeds
in three steps: (1) Justice O'Connor's opinion is the holdingof Price Waterhouse; (2)

Justice O'Connor's Price Waterhouse opinion requires direct evidence of discrimination be-fore a mixed-motive instruction can be given; and (3) the

1991 Act does nothing to abrogate that holding. Like theCourt of Appeals, we see no need to address which of the
opinions in Price Waterhouse is controlling: the third stepof petitioner's argument is flawed, primarily because it is
inconsistent with the text of $ 2000e-2(m).Our precedents make clear that the starting point for our
analysis is the statutory text. See Connecticut Nat. Bankv.

Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992). And where, ashere, the words of the statute are unambiguous, the " `judicial inquiry is complete.' " Id., at 254 (quoting Rubin v.United States, 449 U. S. 424, 430 (1981)). Section 2000e-
2(m) unambiguously states that a plaintiff need only "demon-strat[e]" that an employer used a forbidden consideration
with respect to "any employment practice." On its face, thestatute does not mention, much less require, that a plaintiff

539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

99Cite as: 539 U. S. 90 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
make a heightened showing through direct evidence. In-deed, petitioner concedes as much. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.

Moreover, Congress explicitly defined the term "demon-strates" in the 1991 Act, leaving little doubt that no special
evidentiary showing is required. Title VII defines the term" `demonstrates' " as to "mee[t] the burdens of production and
persuasion." $ 2000e(m). If Congress intended the term
" `demonstrates' " to require that the "burdens of productionand persuasion" be met by direct evidence or some other

heightened showing, it could have made that intent clear byincluding language to that effect in $ 2000e(m). Its failure
to do so is significant, for Congress has been unequivocal
when imposing heightened proof requirements in other circumstances, including in other provisions of Title 42. See,
e. g., 8 U. S. C. $ 1158(a)(2)(B) (stating that an asylum application may not be filed unless an alien "demonstrates by clear
and convincing evidence" that the application was filed
within one year of the alien's arrival in the United States);
42 U. S. C. $ 5851(b)(3)(D) (providing that "[r]elief may not be
ordered" against an employer in retaliation cases involving
whistleblowers under the Atomic Energy Act where the employer is able to "demonstrat[e] by clear and convincing
evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of such behavior" (emphasis
added)); cf. Price Waterhouse, 490 U. S., at 253 (plurality
opinion) ("Only rarely have we required clear and convincing
proof where the action defended against seeks only conventional relief ").

In addition, Title VII's silence with respect to the type of
evidence required in mixed-motive cases also suggests that
we should not depart from the "[c]onventional rul[e] of civil
litigation [that] generally appl[ies] in Title VII cases." Ibid.
That rule requires a plaintiff to prove his case "by a preponderance of the evidence," ibid., using "direct or circumstantial evidence," Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,
460 U. S. 711, 714, n. 3 (1983). We have often acknowledged

539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
100 DESERT PALACE, INC. v. COSTA

Opinion of the Court
the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.For instance, in

Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products,
Inc., 530 U. S. 133 (2000), we recognized that evidence that adefendant's explanation for an employment practice is "unworthy of credence" is "one form of circumstantial evidencethat is probative of intentional discrimination."

Id., at 147
(emphasis added). The reason for treating circumstantial
and direct evidence alike is both clear and deep rooted: "Cir-cumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be

more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evi-dence."

Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500,
508, n. 17 (1957).

The adequacy of circumstantial evidence also extends beyond civil cases; we have never questioned the sufficiency of
circumstantial evidence in support of a criminal conviction,
even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.
See Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, 140 (1954)
(observing that, in criminal cases, circumstantial evidence
is "intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence").
And juries are routinely instructed that "[t]he law makes
no distinction between the weight or value to be given to
either direct or circumstantial evidence." 1A K. O'Malley,
J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions,
Criminal $ 12.04 (5th ed. 2000); see also 4 L. Sand, J. Siffert,
W. Loughlin, S. Reiss, & N. Batterman, Modern Federal Jury
Instructions || 74.01 (2002) (model instruction 74-2). It is
not surprising, therefore, that neither petitioner nor its
amici curiae can point to any other circumstance in which
we have restricted a litigant to the presentation of direct
evidence absent some affirmative directive in a statute. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 13.

Finally, the use of the term "demonstrates" in other provisions of Title VII tends to show further that $ 2000e-2(m)
does not incorporate a direct evidence requirement. See,
e. g., 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). For
instance, $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) requires an employer to "demon539US1 Unit: $U68 [05-04-05 20:17:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
strat[e] that [it] would have taken the same action in theabsence of the impermissible motivating factor" in order

to take advantage of the partial affirmative defense. Dueto the similarity in structure between that provision and

$ 2000e-2(m), it would be logical to assume that the term"demonstrates" would carry the same meaning with respect
to both provisions. But when pressed at oral argumentabout whether direct evidence is required before the partial
affirmative defense can be invoked, petitioner did not "agreethat . . . the defendant or the employer has any heightened
standard" to satisfy. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Absent some con-gressional indication to the contrary, we decline to give the
same term in the same Act a different meaning dependingon whether the rights of the plaintiff or the defendant are at
issue. See Commissioner v. Lundy, 516 U. S. 235, 250 (1996)("The interrelationship and close proximity of these provisions of the statute `presents a classic case for application ofthe "normal rule of statutory construction that identical
words used in different parts of the same act are intendedto have the same meaning" ' " (quoting Sullivan v. Stroop,
496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990))).For the reasons stated above, we agree with the Court
of Appeals that no heightened showing is required under$ 2000e-2(m).

In order to obtain an instruction under $ 2000e-2(m), aplaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence,that "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice." Because directevidence of discrimination is not required in mixed-motive

3 Of course, in light of our conclusion that direct evidence is not required
under $ 2000e-2(m), we need not address the second question on which we

cases under Title VII?" Pet. for Cert. i.

cases, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Dis-trict Court did not abuse its discretion in giving a mixedmotive instruction to the jury. Accordingly, the judgmentof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion. In my view, prior to the CivilRights Act of 1991, the evidentiary rule we developed to

shift the burden of persuasion in mixed-motive cases wasappropriately applied only where a disparate treatment
plaintiff "demonstrated by direct evidence that an illegiti-mate factor played a substantial role" in an adverse employment decision. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S.228, 275 (1989) (O

'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).This showing triggered "the deterrent purpose of the statute" and permitted a reasonable factfinder to conclude that"absent further explanation, the employer's discriminatory
motivation `caused' the employment decision." Id., at 265.As the Court's opinion explains, in the Civil Rights Act of
1991, Congress codified a new evidentiary rule for mixed-motive cases arising under Title VII. Ante, at 98-101.
I therefore agree with the Court that the District Court didnot abuse its discretion in giving a mixed-motive instruction
to the jury.

FITZGERALD, TREASURER OF IOWA v. RACINGASSOCIATION OF CENTRAL IOWA

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of iowa
No. 02-695. Argued April 29, 2003--Decided June 9, 2003
An Iowa law that, among other things, authorized racetracks to operate

slot machines and imposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine
adjusted revenues, with a top rate that started at 20 percent and would
automatically rise over time to 36 percent, left a 20 percent tax rate
on riverboat slot machine adjusted revenues in place. Respondents,
racetracks and a dog owners' association, filed a state-court suit challenging the law on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate
difference violated the Equal Protection Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14,

$ 1. The District Court upheld the statute, but the Iowa Supreme
Court reversed.

Held:

1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the state court's judgment,
which does not rest independently upon state law. The state court's
opinion says that Iowa courts should apply the same analysis in considering either state or federal equal protection claims. In such circumstances, this Court considers a state-court decision as resting upon
federal grounds sufficient to support jurisdiction. P. 106.

2. Iowa's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause. A law, such as Iowa's, which distinguishes for tax purposes among revenues obtained within a State by two enterprises conducting business in the State, is subject to rational-basis review. See
Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12. The Iowa law, like most laws,
might predominantly serve one general objective, e. g., rescuing racetracks from economic distress, while containing subsidiary provisions
that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as
well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves
the general objective when seen as a whole. And this law, seen as a
whole, does what the state court says it seeks to do, namely, advance
the racetracks' economic interests. A rational legislator might believe
that the law's grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically--even if its simultaneous
imposition of a tax on revenues means less help than respondents might
like--and the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help

with their tax laws and how much help those laws should provide.
Once one realizes that not every provision in a single law must share a
single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the difference in tax rates here. Though harmful to the racetracks, it is helpful to the riverboats, which were also facing financial peril. This is not a case where the facts preclude any plausible
inference that the reason for the different tax rates is to help the riverboat industry. Cf. Nordlinger, supra, at 16. Allegheny Pittsburgh

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
Iowa taxes adjusted revenues from slot machines on ex-cursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20 percent. Iowa

Code $ 99F.11 (2003). Iowa law provides for a maximum taxrate of 36 percent on adjusted revenues from slot machines
at racetracks. $$ 99F.4A(6), 99F.11. The Iowa SupremeCourt held that this 20 percent/36 percent difference in tax
rates violates the Federal Constitution's Equal ProtectionClause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. 648 N. W. 2d 555 (2002). We disagree and reverse the Iowa Supreme Court's determination.

I
Before 1989, Iowa permitted only one form of gambling--parimutuel betting at racetracks--the proceeds of which it

taxed at a six percent rate. Iowa Code $ 99D.15 (1984). In1989, it authorized other forms of gambling, including slot
machines and other gambling games on riverboats, though itlimited bets to $5 and losses to $200 per excursion. 1989
Iowa Acts ch. 67, $$ 3, 9(2); Iowa Code $ 99F.3 (1996). Iowataxed adjusted revenues from slot machine gambling at
graduated rates, with a top rate of 20 percent. 1989 IowaActs ch. 67, $ 11; Iowa Code $ 99F.11 (1996).

In 1994, Iowa enacted a law that, among other things, re-moved the riverboat gambling $5/$200 bet/loss limits, 1994
Iowa Acts ch. 1021, $ 19, authorized racetracks to operateslot machines, $ 13; Iowa Code $$ 99F.1(9), 99F.4A (1996), and
imposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine ad-justed revenues with a top rate that started at 20 percent
and would automatically rise over time to 36 percent, 1994Iowa Acts ch. 1021, $ 25; Iowa Code $ 99F.11 (1996). The Act
did not alter the tax rate on riverboat slot machine adjustedrevenues, thereby leaving the existing 20 percent rate in
place. Ibid.Respondents, a group of racetracks and an association of
dog owners, brought this lawsuit in state court challengingthe 1994 legislation on the ground that the 20 percent/36 per539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
106 FITZGERALD v. RACING ASSN. OF CENTRAL IOWA

Opinion of the Court
cent tax rate difference that it created violated the FederalConstitution's Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. The

State District Court upheld the statute. The Iowa SupremeCourt disagreed and, by a 4-to-3 vote, reversed the District
Court. The majority wrote that the "differential tax com-pletely defeats the alleged purpose" of the statute, namely,
"to help the racetracks recover from economic distress," thatthere could "be no rational reason for this differential tax,"
and that the Equal Protection Clause consequently forbidsits imposition. 648 N. W. 2d, at 560-562. We granted certiorari to review this determination.

II
Respondents initially claim that the Iowa Supreme Court'sdecision rests independently upon state law. And they

argue that this state-law holding bars review of the federalissue. We disagree. The Iowa Supreme Court's opinion,
after setting forth the language of both State and FederalEqual Protection Clauses, says that "Iowa courts are to
`apply the same analysis in considering the state equal pro-tection claims as . . . in considering the federal equal protection claim.' " Id., at 558. We have previously held that, insuch circumstances, we shall consider a state-court decision
as resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support thisCourt's jurisdiction. See

Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S.582, 588, n. 4 (1990) (no adequate and independent state

ground where the court says that state and federal constitu-tional protections are " `identical' "). Cf.

Michigan v. Long,463 U. S. 1032, 1041-1042 (1983) ( jurisdiction exists where

federal cases are not "being used only for the purpose ofguidance" and instead are "compel[ling] the result"). We
therefore find that this Court has jurisdiction to review theIowa Supreme Court's determination.

III
We here consider whether a difference in state tax ratesviolates the Fourteenth Amendment's mandate that "[n]o

539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

107Cite as: 539 U. S. 103 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
State shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protectionof the laws," $ 1. The law in question does not distinguish

on the basis of, for example, race or gender. See, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); United States v. Virginia,
518 U. S. 515 (1996). It does not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state businesses. See,

e. g., Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985). Neither does it
favor a State's long-time residents at the expense of resi-dents who have more recently arrived from other States.

Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612(1985). Rather, the law distinguishes for tax purposes
among revenues obtained within the State of Iowa by twoenterprises, each of which does business in the State.
Where that is so, the law is subject to rational-basis review:

"[T]he Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as
there is a plausible policy reason for the classification,the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to betrue by the governmental decisionmaker, and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenu-ated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational."
Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992) (citationsomitted).

See also id., at 11 (rational-basis review "is especially defer-ential in the context of classifications made by complex tax
laws"); Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522,527 (1959) (the Equal Protection Clause requires States,
when enacting tax laws, to "proceed upon a rational ba-sis" and not to "resort to a classification that is palpably
arbitrary").

The Iowa Supreme Court found that the 20 percent/36
percent tax rate differential failed to meet this standard
because, in its view, that difference "frustrated" what it
saw as the law's basic objective, namely, rescuing the racetracks from economic distress. 648 N. W. 2d, at 561. And

539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 FITZGERALD v. RACING ASSN. OF CENTRAL IOWA

Opinion of the Court
no rational person, it believed, could claim the contrary. Id.,at 561-562.

The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, thatthe Iowa law, like most laws, might predominantly serve one
general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while contain-ing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable
(perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a
law that balances objectives but still serves the general ob-jective when seen as a whole. See

Railroad Retirement Bd.
v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 181 (1980) (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment) (legislation is often the "product of multiple and

somewhat inconsistent purposes that led to certain compromises"). After all, if every subsidiary provision in a law designed to help racetracks had to help those racetracks and
nothing more, then (since any tax rate hurts the racetracks
when compared with a lower rate) there could be no taxation
of the racetracks at all.

Neither could the Iowa Supreme Court deny that the 1994
legislation, seen as a whole, can rationally be understood to
do what that court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the
racetracks' economic interests. Its grant to the racetracks
of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree--even if its simultaneous
imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenues means
that the law provides less help than respondents might like.
At least a rational legislator might so believe. And the
Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority
(within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish
to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws
ought to provide. "The `task of classifying persons for . . .
benefits . . . inevitably requires that some persons who have
an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be
placed on different sides of the line,' and the fact the line
might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter
for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration." Id., at

Nordlinger, supra, at 17-18.
Once one realizes that not every provision in a law mustshare a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differ-ential here at issue. That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents
concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respond-ents 8. See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557. These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin. Each re-flects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.
And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the
riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the
economic development of river communities or to promote
riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats
to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.
See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76-84, 86. Alternatively, they may have
wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously
been taxed at the 20 percent rate. All these objectives are
rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further
and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates. See Allied Stores, supra, at 528; Nordlinger, supra, at 12. See
also Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88 (1940) (imposing
burden on respondents to "negative every conceivable basis"
that might support different treatment).

Respondents argue that Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.
Commission of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), holds to
the contrary. Brief for Respondents 21. In that case, the
Court held that substantial differences in the level of property tax assessments that West Virginia imposed upon similar properties violated the Federal Equal Protection Clause.
But the Court later stated, when it upheld in Nordlinger
a California statute creating similar differences in property
taxes, that "an obvious and critical factual difference be539US1 Unit: $U69 [05-03-05 19:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tween this case and Allegheny Pittsburgh is the absence ofany indication in Allegheny Pittsburgh that the policies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme could conceiv-ably have been the purpose for the . . . unequal assessment."
505 U. S., at 14-15. The Court in Nordlinger added that"Allegheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the facts
precluded any plausible inference that the reason for theunequal assessment practice was to achieve the benefits of
an acquisition-value tax scheme." Id., at 16-17, and n. 7.Here, "the facts" do not "preclud[e]" an inference that the
reason for the different tax rates was to help the riverboatindustry or the river communities.

Id., at 16.

IV
We conclude that there is "a plausible policy reason for theclassification," that the legislature "rationally may have . . .

considered . . . true" the related justifying "legislative facts,"and that the "relationship of the classification to its goal is
not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary orirrational." Id., at 11. Consequently the State's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal ProtectionClause. The Iowa Supreme Court's judgment to the contrary is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

VIRGINIA v. HICKS
certiorari to the supreme court of virginia

No. 02-371. Argued April 30, 2003--Decided June 16, 2003
The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA), a political

subdivision of Virginia, owns and operates Whitcomb Court, a lowincome housing development. In 1997, the Richmond City Council conveyed Whitcomb Court's streets to the RRHA in an effort to combat
crime and drug dealing by nonresidents. In accordance with the terms
of conveyance, the RRHA enacted a policy authorizing the Richmond
police to serve notice on any person lacking "a legitimate business or
social purpose" for being on the premises and to arrest for trespassing
any person who remains or returns after having been so notified. The
RRHA gave respondent Hicks, a nonresident, written notice barring
him from Whitcomb Court. Subsequently, he trespassed there and was
arrested and convicted. At trial, he claimed that RRHA's policy was,
among other things, unconstitutionally overbroad. The Virginia Court
of Appeals vacated his conviction. In affirming, the Virginia Supreme
Court found the policy unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the
First Amendment because an unwritten rule that leafleting and demonstrating require advance permission vested too much discretion in Whitcomb Court's manager.

Held: The RRHA's trespass policy is not facially invalid under the First

Amendment's overbreadth doctrine. Pp. 118-124.

(a) Under that doctrine, a showing that a law punishes a "substantial"
amount of protected free speech, "in relation to the statute's plainly
legitimate sweep," Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615, suffices
to invalidate all enforcement of that law "until and unless a limiting
construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression," id.,
at 613. Only substantial overbreadth supports such facial invalidation,
since there are significant social costs in blocking a law's application to
constitutionally unprotected conduct. Pp. 118-120.

(b) This Court has jurisdiction to review the First Amendment merits
question here. Virginia's actual injury in fact--the inability to prosecute Hicks for trespass--is sufficiently distinct and palpable to confer
Article III standing. Pp. 120-121.

(c) Even assuming the invalidity of the "unwritten" rule for leafleters
and demonstrators, Hicks has not shown that the RRHA policy prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech in relation to its many legit539US1 Unit: $U71 [07-05-05 17:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

imate applications. Both the notice-barment rule and the "legitimate
business or social purpose" rule apply to all persons entering Whitcomb
Court's streets, not just to those seeking to engage in expression. Neither the basis for the barment sanction (a prior trespass) nor its purpose
(preventing future trespasses) implicates the First Amendment. An
overbreadth challenge rarely succeeds against a law or regulation that
is not specifically addressed to speech or conduct necessarily associated
with speech. Any applications of the RRHA's policy that violate
the First Amendment can be remedied through as-applied litigation.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue presented in this case is whether the Richmond
Redevelopment and Housing Authority's trespass policy is
facially invalid under the First Amendment's overbreadth
doctrine.

I

A

The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority
(RRHA) owns and operates a housing development for lowincome residents called Whitcomb Court. Until June 23,
1997, the city of Richmond owned the streets within Whitcomb Court. The city council decided, however, to "privatize" these streets in an effort to combat rampant crime and
drug dealing in Whitcomb Court--much of it committed and
conducted by nonresidents. The council enacted Ordinance
No. 97-181-197, which provided, in part:

" `$ 1. That Carmine Street, Bethel Street, Ambrose
Street, Deforrest Street, the 2100-2300 Block of Sussex
Street and the 2700-2800 Block of Magnolia Street, in
Whitcomb Court . . . be and are hereby closed to public

The city then conveyed these streets by a recorded deedto the RRHA (which is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia). This deed required the RRHA to" `give the appearance that the closed street, particularly at
the entrances, are no longer public streets and that theyare in fact private streets.' " Id., at 95. To this end, the
RRHA posted red-and-white signs on each apartment build-ing--and every 100 feet along the streets--of Whitcomb
Court, which state: " `NO TRESPASSING[.] PRIVATEPROPERTY[.] YOU ARE NOW ENTERING PRIVATE
PROPERTY AND STREETS OWNED BY RRHA. UN-AUTHORIZED PERSONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO ARREST AND PROSECUTION. UNAUTHORIZED VEHI-CLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNERS EXPENSE.' "
Pet. for Cert. 5. The RRHA also enacted a policy authoriz-ing the Richmond police

" `to serve notice, either orally or in writing, to anyperson who is found on Richmond Redevelopment and
Housing Authority property when such person is not aresident, employee, or such person cannot demonstrate
a legitimate business or social purpose for being on thepremises. Such notice shall forbid the person from returning to the property. Finally, Richmond Redevel-opment and Housing Authority authorizes Richmond
Police Department officers to arrest any person fortrespassing after such person, having been duly notified,

Respondent Kevin Hicks, a nonresident of WhitcombCourt, has been convicted on two prior occasions of trespassing there and once of damaging property there. Those con-victions are not at issue in this case. While the propertydamage charge was pending, the RRHA gave Hicks writtennotice barring him from Whitcomb Court, and Hicks signed
this notice in the presence of a police officer.1 Twice afterreceiving this notice Hicks asked for permission to return;
twice the Whitcomb Court housing manager said "no."That did not stop Hicks; in January 1999 he again trespassed
at Whitcomb Court and was arrested and convicted under$ 18.2-119.

At trial, Hicks maintained that the RRHA's policy limitingaccess to Whitcomb Court was both unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. On appeal of his conviction, athree-judge panel of the Court of Appeals of Virginia initially
rejected Hicks' contentions, but the en banc Court of Ap-peals reversed. That court held that the streets of Whitcomb Court were a "traditional public forum," notwithstand-ing the city ordinance declaring them closed, and vacated
Hicks' conviction on the ground that RRHA's policy violatedthe First Amendment. 36 Va. App. 49, 56, 548 S. E. 2d 249,

banc Court of Appeals, but for different reasons. Withoutdeciding whether the streets of Whitcomb Court were a public forum, the Virginia Supreme Court concluded that theRRHA policy was unconstitutionally overbroad. While acknowledging that the policy was "designed to punish activi-ties that are not protected by the First Amendment," 264
Va. 48, 58, 563 S. E. 2d 674, 680 (2002), the court held that"the policy also prohibits speech and conduct that are clearly
protected by the First Amendment," ibid. The court foundthe policy defective because it vested too much discretion in
Whitcomb Court's manager to determine whether an individual's presence at Whitcomb Court is "authorized," allowingher to "prohibit speech that she finds personally distasteful

or offensive even though such speech may be protected bythe First Amendment."

Id., at 60, 563 S. E. 2d, at 680-681.
We granted the Commonwealth's petition for certiorari.537 U. S. 1169 (2003).

Hicks does not contend that he was engaged in constitu-tionally protected conduct when arrested; nor does he challenge the validity of the trespass statute under which he wasconvicted. Instead he claims that the RRHA

policy barring
him from Whitcomb Court is overbroad under the FirstAmendment, and cannot be applied to him--or anyone else.

The First Amendment doctrine of overbreadth is an exception to our normal rule regarding the standards for facialchallenges. See

Members of City Council of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 796 (1984). The show-ing that a law punishes a "substantial" amount of protected

free speech, "judged in relation to the statute's plainly legiti2 As noted, the Virginia Supreme Court held that invalidity of the
RRHA policy entitled Hicks to vacatur of his conviction under the unquestionably valid trespass statute, which Hicks unquestionably violated. We
do not reach the question whether federal law compels this result.

Opinion of the Court
mate sweep," Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615(1973), suffices to invalidate

all enforcement of that law,
"until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalida-tion so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression," id., at 613.See also

Virginia v. Black, 538 U. S. 343, 367 (2003); New
York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769, n. 24 (1982); Dombrowski
v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 491, and n. 7, 497 (1965).We have provided this expansive remedy out of concern

that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may deteror "chill" constitutionally protected speech--especially when
the overbroad statute imposes criminal sanctions. See
Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S.
620, 634 (1980); Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 380
(1977); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963). Many
persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and
sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-bycase litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected
speech, Dombrowski, supra, at 486-487--harming not only
themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an
uninhibited marketplace of ideas. Overbreadth adjudication, by suspending all enforcement of an overinclusive law,
reduces these social costs caused by the withholding of protected speech.

As we noted in Broadrick, however, there comes a point
at which the chilling effect of an overbroad law, significant
though it may be, cannot justify prohibiting all enforcement
of that law--particularly a law that reflects "legitimate state
interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct." 413 U. S., at 615.
For there are substantial social costs created by the overbreadth doctrine when it blocks application of a law to constitutionally unprotected speech, or especially to constitutionally unprotected conduct. To ensure that these costs do not
swallow the social benefits of declaring a law "overbroad,"
we have insisted that a law's application to protected speech

Opinion of the Court
be "substantial," not only in an absolute sense, but also rela-tive to the scope of the law's plainly legitimate applications,

ibid., before applying the "strong medicine" of overbreadthinvalidation, id., at 613.

B
Petitioner asks this Court to impose restrictions on "theuse of overbreadth standing," limiting the availability of facial overbreadth challenges to those whose own conduct in-volved some sort of expressive activity. Brief for Petitioner
13, 24-31. The United States as amicus curiae makes thesame proposal, Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae14-17, and urges that Hicks' facial challenge to the RRHA

trespass policy "should not have been entertained," id., at 10.The problem with these proposals is that we are reviewing
here the decision of a State Supreme Court; our standingrules limit only the

federal courts' jurisdiction over certainclaims. "[S]tate courts are not bound by the limitations of

a case or controversy or other federal rules of justiciabilityeven when they address issues of federal law." ASARCO
Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 617 (1989). Whether Virginia'scourts should have entertained this overbreadth challenge is
entirely a matter of state law.This Court may, however, review the Virginia Supreme
Court's holding that the RRHA policy violates the FirstAmendment. We may examine, in particular, whether the
claimed overbreadth in the RRHA policy is sufficiently "sub-stantial" to produce facial invalidity. These questions involve not standing, but "the determination of [a] FirstAmendment challenge on the merits."

Secretary of State ofMd. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 958-959 (1984).

Because it is the Commonwealth of Virginia, not Hicks, thathas invoked the authority of the federal courts by petitioning
for a writ of certiorari, our jurisdiction to review the FirstAmendment merits question is clear under ASARCO, 490
U. S., at 617-618. The Commonwealth has suffered, as aconsequence of the Virginia Supreme Court's "final judgment

altering tangible legal rights," id., at 619, an actual injury infact--inability to prosecute Hicks for trespass--that is sufficiently "distinct and palpable" to confer standing under Arti-cle III, Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501 (1975). We accordingly proceed to that merits inquiry, leaving for anotherday the question whether our ordinary rule that a litigant
may not rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interestsof third parties, see

Valley Forge Christian College v.Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.,

454 U. S. 464, 474 (1982), would exclude a case such as thisfrom initiation in federal court.

C
The Virginia Supreme Court found that the RRHA policyallowed Gloria S. Rogers, the manager of Whitcomb Court,

to exercise "unfettered discretion" in determining who mayuse the RRHA's property. 264 Va., at 59, 563 S. E. 2d, at
680. Specifically, the court faulted an "unwritten" rule thatpersons wishing to hand out flyers on the sidewalks of Whitcomb Court need to obtain Rogers' permission. Ibid. Thisunwritten portion of the RRHA policy, the court concluded,
unconstitutionally allows Rogers to "prohibit speech that shefinds personally distasteful or offensive." Id., at 60, 563
S. E. 2d, at 681.Hicks, of course, was not arrested for leafleting or demonstrating without permission. He violated the RRHA's written rule that persons who receive a barment notice must notreturn to RRHA property. The Virginia Supreme Court,

based on its objection to the "unwritten" requirement thatdemonstrators and leafleters obtain advance permission, declared the entire RRHA trespass policy overbroad andvoid--including the written rule that those who return after
receiving a barment notice are subject to arrest. Whetherthese provisions are severable is of course a matter of state
law, see Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U. S. 137, 139 (1996) (per
curiam), and the Virginia Supreme Court has implicitly de539US1 Unit: $U71 [07-05-05 17:03:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
122 VIRGINIA v. HICKS

Opinion of the Court
cided that they are not--that all components of the RRHAtrespass policy must stand or fall together. It could not

properly decree that they fall by reason of the overbreadthdoctrine, however, unless the trespass policy, taken as a
whole, is substantially overbroad judged in relation to itsplainly legitimate sweep.

3 See Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615.

The overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrat-ing, "from the text of [the law] and from actual fact," that

substantial overbreadth exists. New York State Club Assn.,
Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U. S. 1, 14 (1988).Hicks has not made such a showing with regard to the

RRHA policy taken as a whole--even assuming, arguendo,the unlawfulness of the policy's "unwritten" rule that demonstrating and leafleting at Whitcomb Court require permis-sion from Gloria Rogers. Consider the "no-return" notice
served on nonresidents who have no "legitimate business orsocial purpose" in Whitcomb Court: Hicks has failed to demonstrate that this notice would even be given to anyone en-gaged in constitutionally protected speech. Gloria Rogers
testified that leafleting and demonstrations are permitted atWhitcomb Court, so long as permission is obtained in advance. App. to Pet. for Cert. 100-102. Thus, "legitimatebusiness or social purpose" evidently includes leafleting and
demonstrating; otherwise, Rogers would lack authority topermit those activities on RRHA property. Hicks has failed
to demonstrate that any First Amendment activity falls out-side the "legitimate business or social purpose[s]" that permit entry. As far as appears, until one receives a barment

3 Contrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, post, at 124 (concurring
opinion), the Supreme Court of Virginia did not focus solely on the "unwritten" element of the RRHA trespass policy "[i]n comparing invalid
applications against valid ones for purposes of the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine." The fact is that its opinion contains no "comparing"
of valid and invalid applications whatever; the proportionality aspect of
our overbreadth doctrine is simply ignored. Since, however, the Virginia
Supreme Court struck down the entire RRHA trespass policy, the question presented here is whether the entire policy is substantially overbroad.

Opinion of the Court
notice, entering for a First Amendment purpose is not atrespass.

As for the written provision authorizing the police to ar-rest those who return to Whitcomb Court after receiving
a barment notice: That certainly does not violate the FirstAmendment as applied to persons whose postnotice entry is
not for the purpose of engaging in constitutionally protected
speech. And Hicks has not even established that it wouldviolate the First Amendment as applied to persons whose

postnotice entry is for that purpose. Even assuming thestreets of Whitcomb Court are a public forum, the noticebarment rule subjects to arrest those who reenter after trespassing and after being warned not to return--regardless of
whether, upon their return, they seek to engage in speech.
Neither the basis for the barment sanction (the prior trespass) nor its purpose (preventing future trespasses) has anything to do with the First Amendment. Punishing its violation by a person who wishes to engage in free speech no
more implicates the First Amendment than would the punishment of a person who has (pursuant to lawful regulation)
been banned from a public park after vandalizing it, and who
ignores the ban in order to take part in a political demonstration. Here, as there, it is Hicks' nonexpressive conduct--
his entry in violation of the notice-barment rule--not his
speech, for which he is punished as a trespasser.

Most importantly, both the notice-barment rule and the
"legitimate business or social purpose" rule apply to all persons who enter the streets of Whitcomb Court, not just to
those who seek to engage in expression. The rules apply to
strollers, loiterers, drug dealers, roller skaters, bird watchers, soccer players, and others not engaged in constitutionally protected conduct--a group that would seemingly far
outnumber First Amendment speakers. Even assuming invalidity of the "unwritten" rule that requires leafleters and
demonstrators to obtain advance permission from Gloria
Rogers, Hicks has not shown, based on the record in this

many legitimate applications. That is not surprising, sincethe overbreadth doctrine's concern with "chilling" protected
speech "attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behaviorthat it forbids the State to sanction moves from `pure speech'
toward conduct." Broadrick, supra, at 615. Rarely, ifever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against a law or
regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or toconduct necessarily associated with speech (such as picketing
or demonstrating). Applications of the RRHA policy thatviolate the First Amendment can still be remedied through
as-applied litigation, but the Virginia Supreme Court shouldnot have used the "strong medicine" of overbreadth to invalidate the entire RRHA trespass policy. Whether respondentmay challenge his conviction on other grounds--and whether
those claims have been properly preserved--are issues weleave open on remand.

For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the VirginiaSupreme Court and remand the case for further proceedings

not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and add this afterword to flagan issue of no consequence here, but one on which a future
case might turn. In comparing invalid applications againstvalid ones for purposes of the First Amendment overbreadth
doctrine, the Supreme Court of Virginia apparently assumedthat the appropriate focus of the analysis was the "unwritten" element of the housing authority's trespass policy, thatis, the requirement that nonresidents distributing literature
or demonstrating on the property obtain prior authorization.

to punish unprotected activities, allowed the housing man-ager to prohibit protected speech "that she finds personally
distasteful or offensive" and "speech that is political or reli-gious in nature"). We, on the other hand, take a broader
view of the relevant law, by looking to the potential applica-tions of the entire trespass policy, written and unwritten.
Ante, at 121-124. It does not matter here, however, whichposition one takes on the appropriate "law" whose overbreadth is to be assessed, for there is no substantial over-breadth either way. Regardless of the scope of the law that
forms the denominator of the fraction here, the numerator ofpotential invalid applications is too small to result in a finding of substantial overbreadth. But in other circumstances,the scope of the law chosen for comparison with invalid applications might decide the case. It might be dispositivewhether, say, a city's speech ordinance for a public park is
analyzed alone or as one element of the combined policiesgoverning expression in public schoolyards, municipal cemeteries, and the city council chamber. Suffice it to say thattoday's decision does not address how to go about identifying

OVERTON, DIRECTOR, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS,

et al. v. BAZZETTA et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-94. Argued March 26, 2003--Decided June 16, 2003
Responding to concerns about prison security problems caused by the increasing number of visitors to Michigan's prisons and about substance
abuse among inmates, the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC)
promulgated new regulations limiting prison visitation. An inmate
may be visited by qualified clergy and attorneys on business and by
persons placed on an approved list, which may include an unlimited number of immediate family members and 10 others; minor children are not
permitted to visit unless they are the children, stepchildren, grandchildren, or siblings of the inmate; if the inmate's parental rights are terminated, the child may not visit; a child visitor must be accompanied by a
family member of the child or inmate or the child's legal guardian; former prisoners are not permitted to visit except that a former prisoner
who is an immediate family member of an inmate may visit if the warden
approves. Prisoners who commit two substance-abuse violations may
receive only clergy and attorneys, but may apply for reinstatement of
visitation privileges after two years. Respondents--prisoners, their
friends, and family members--filed a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action, alleging
that the regulations as they pertain to noncontact visits violate the
First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court

agreed, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. The fact that the regulations bear a rational relation to legitimate
penological interests suffices to sustain them regardless of whether respondents have a constitutional right of association that has survived
incarceration. This Court accords substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining a corrections system's legitimate goals and
determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them. The
regulations satisfy each of four factors used to decide whether a prison
regulation affecting a constitutional right that survives incarceration
withstands constitutional challenge. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78,
89-91. First, the regulations bear a rational relationship to a legitimate penological interest. The restrictions on children's visitation are
related to MDOC's valid interests in maintaining internal security and

539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
protecting child visitors from exposure to sexual or other misconduct or
from accidental injury. They promote internal security, perhaps the
most legitimate penological goal, by reducing the total number of visitors and by limiting disruption caused by children. It is also reasonable
to ensure that the visiting child is accompanied and supervised by adults
charged with protecting the child's best interests. Prohibiting visitation by former inmates bears a self-evident connection to the State's
interest in maintaining prison security and preventing future crime.
Restricting visitation for inmates with two substance-abuse violations
serves the legitimate goal of deterring drug and alcohol use within
prison. Second, respondents have alternative means of exercising their
asserted right of association with those prohibited from visiting. They
can send messages through those who are permitted to visit, and can
communicate by letter and telephone. Visitation alternatives need not
be ideal; they need only be available. Third, accommodating the associational right would have a considerable impact on guards, other inmates,
the allocation of prison resources, and the safety of visitors by causing
a significant reallocation of the prison system's financial resources and
by impairing corrections officers' ability to protect all those inside a
prison's walls. Finally, respondents have suggested no alternatives
that fully accommodate the asserted right while not imposing more than
a de minimis cost to the valid penological goals. Pp. 131-136.

2. The visitation restriction for inmates with two substance-abuse violations is not a cruel and unusual confinement condition violating the
Eighth Amendment. Withdrawing visitation privileges for a limited
period in order to effect prison discipline is not a dramatic departure
from accepted standards for confinement conditions. Nor does the regulation create inhumane prison conditions, deprive inmates of basic necessities or fail to protect their health or safety, or involve the infliction
of pain or injury or deliberate indifference to their risk. Pp. 136-137.

Opinion of the Court

I
The population of Michigan's prisons increased in the early1990's. More inmates brought more visitors, straining the

resources available for prison supervision and control. Inparticular, prison officials found it more difficult to maintain
order during visitation and to prevent smuggling or traffick-ing in drugs. Special problems were encountered with the
increase in visits by children, who are at risk of seeing orhearing harmful conduct during visits and must be supervised with special care in prison visitation facilities.The incidence of substance abuse in the State's prisons also
increased in this period. Drug and alcohol abuse by prison-ers is unlawful and a direct threat to legitimate objectives
of the corrections system, including rehabilitation, the main-tenance of basic order, and the prevention of violence in the
prisons.In response to these concerns, the Michigan Department
of Corrections (MDOC or Department) revised its prison vis-itation policies in 1995, promulgating the regulations here at
issue. One aspect of the Department's approach was to limitthe visitors a prisoner is eligible to receive, in order to decrease the total number of visitors.Under MDOC's regulations, an inmate may receive visits
only from individuals placed on an approved visitor list, ex-cept that qualified members of the clergy and attorneys on
official business may visit without being listed. Mich.
Admin. Code Rule 791.6609(2) (1999); Director's Office Mem.1995-59 (effective date Aug. 25, 1995). The list may include

an unlimited number of members of the prisoner's immedi-ate family and 10 other individuals the prisoner designates,
subject to some restrictions. Rule 791.6609(2). Minorsunder the age of 18 may not be placed on the list unless they
are the children, stepchildren, grandchildren, or siblings ofthe inmate. Rule 791.6609(2)(b); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.

$ 791.268a (West Supp. 2003). If an inmate's parental rights

Opinion of the Court
have been terminated, the child may not be a visitor. Rule791.6609(6)(a) (1999). A child authorized to visit must be

accompanied by an adult who is an immediate family memberof the child or of the inmate or who is the legal guardian
of the child. Rule 791.6609(5); Mich. Dept. of CorrectionsProcedure OP-SLF/STF-05.03.140, p. 9 (effective date Sept.
15, 1999). An inmate may not place a former prisoner on
the visitor list unless the former prisoner is a member of theinmate's immediate family and the warden has given prior

approval. Rule 791.6609(7).The Department's revised policy also sought to control the
widespread use of drugs and alcohol among prisoners. Prisoners who commit multiple substance-abuse violations are
not permitted to receive any visitors except attorneys and
members of the clergy. Rule 791.6609(11)(d). An inmate
subject to this restriction may apply for reinstatement of
visitation privileges after two years. Rule 791.6609(12).
Reinstatement is within the warden's discretion. Ibid.

Respondents are prisoners, their friends, and their family
members. They brought this action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that the restrictions upon visitation violate the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
It was certified as a class action under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 23.

Inmates who are classified as the highest security risks, as
determined by the MDOC, are limited to noncontact visitation. This case does not involve a challenge to the method
for making that determination. By contrast to contact visitation, during which inmates are allowed limited physical
contact with their visitors in a large visitation room, inmates
restricted to noncontact visits must communicate with their
visitors through a glass panel, the inmate and the visitor
being on opposite sides of a booth. In some facilities the
booths are located in or at one side of the same room used
for contact visits. The case before us concerns the regulations as they pertain to noncontact visits.

131Cite as: 539 U. S. 126 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
The United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Michigan agreed with the prisoners that the regulations

pertaining to noncontact visits were invalid. Bazzetta v.McGinnis, 148 F. Supp. 2d 813 (2001). The Sixth Circuit
affirmed, 286 F. 3d 311 (2002), and we granted certiorari, 537U. S. 1043 (2002).

II
The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court thatthe restrictions on noncontact visits are invalid. This was

error. We first consider the contention, accepted by theCourt of Appeals, that the regulations infringe a constitutional right of association.We have said that the Constitution protects "certain kinds
of highly personal relationships," Roberts v. United StatesJaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 618, 619-620 (1984). And outside
the prison context, there is some discussion in our cases ofa right to maintain certain familial relationships, including association among members of an immediate family andassociation between grandchildren and grandparents. See
Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977) (plurality opin-ion); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923).

This is not an appropriate case for further elaboration ofthose matters. The very object of imprisonment is confinement. Many of the liberties and privileges enjoyed byother citizens must be surrendered by the prisoner. An inmate does not retain rights inconsistent with proper incar-ceration. See

Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' LaborUnion, Inc., 433 U. S. 119, 125 (1977); Shaw v. Murphy, 532

U. S. 223, 229 (2001). And, as our cases have established,freedom of association is among the rights least compatible
with incarceration. See Jones, supra, at 125-126; Hewitt v.Helms, 459 U. S. 460 (1983). Some curtailment of that freedom must be expected in the prison context.We do not hold, and we do not imply, that any right to
intimate association is altogether terminated by incarcera-tion or is always irrelevant to claims made by prisoners. We

539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 OVERTON v. BAZZETTA

Opinion of the Court
need not attempt to explore or define the asserted right ofassociation at any length or determine the extent to which

it survives incarceration because the challenged regulationsbear a rational relation to legitimate penological interests.
This suffices to sustain the regulation in question. See
Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987). We have taken a
similar approach in previous cases, such as Pell v. Procunier,
417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974), which we cited with approval in
Turner. In Pell, we found it unnecessary to decide whether
an asserted First Amendment right survived incarceration.Prison administrators had reasonably exercised their judgment as to the appropriate means of furthering penological
goals, and that was the controlling rationale for our decision.
We must accord substantial deference to the professional
judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections
system and for determining the most appropriate means to
accomplish them. See, e. g., Pell, supra, at 826-827; Helms,
supra, at 467; Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 408
(1989); Jones, supra, at 126, 128; Turner, supra, at 85, 89;
Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 588 (1984); Bell v. Wolfish,
441 U. S. 520, 562 (1979). The burden, moreover, is not on
the State to prove the validity of prison regulations but on
the prisoner to disprove it. See Jones, supra, at 128; O'Lone
v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 350 (1987); Shaw, supra,
at 232. Respondents have failed to do so here.

In Turner we held that four factors are relevant in deciding whether a prison regulation affecting a constitutional
right that survives incarceration withstands constitutional
challenge: whether the regulation has a " `valid, rational connection' " to a legitimate governmental interest; whether alternative means are open to inmates to exercise the asserted
right; what impact an accommodation of the right would
have on guards and inmates and prison resources; and
whether there are "ready alternatives" to the regulation.

133Cite as: 539 U. S. 126 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Turning to the restrictions on visitation by children, weconclude that the regulations bear a rational relation to

MDOC's valid interests in maintaining internal security andprotecting child visitors from exposure to sexual or other
misconduct or from accidental injury. The regulations pro-mote internal security, perhaps the most legitimate of penological goals, see, e. g., Pell, supra, at 823, by reducing
the total number of visitors and by limiting the disruptioncaused by children in particular. Protecting children from

harm is also a legitimate goal, see, e. g., Block, supra, at 586-587. The logical connection between this interest and the
regulations is demonstrated by trial testimony that reducing
the number of children allows guards to supervise them better to ensure their safety and to minimize the disruptions
they cause within the visiting areas.

As for the regulation requiring children to be accompanied
by a family member or legal guardian, it is reasonable to
ensure that the visiting child is accompanied and supervised
by those adults charged with protecting the child's best
interests.

Respondents argue that excluding minor nieces and nephews and children as to whom parental rights have been terminated bears no rational relationship to these penological
interests. We reject this contention, and in all events it
would not suffice to invalidate the regulations as to all noncontact visits. To reduce the number of child visitors, a line
must be drawn, and the categories set out by these regulations are reasonable. Visits are allowed between an inmate
and those children closest to him or her--children, grandchildren, and siblings. The prohibition on visitation by children
as to whom the inmate no longer has parental rights is simply a recognition by prison administrators of a status determination made in other official proceedings.

MDOC's regulation prohibiting visitation by former inmates bears a self-evident connection to the State's interest
in maintaining prison security and preventing future crimes.

539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
134 OVERTON v. BAZZETTA

Opinion of the Court
We have recognized that "communication with other felons
is a potential spur to criminal behavior." Turner, supra,
at 91-92.

Finally, the restriction on visitation for inmates with two
substance-abuse violations, a bar which may be removed
after two years, serves the legitimate goal of deterring the
use of drugs and alcohol within the prisons. Drug smuggling and drug use in prison are intractable problems. See,
e. g., Bell, supra, at 559; Block, supra, at 586-587; Hudson v.
Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 527 (1984). Withdrawing visitation
privileges is a proper and even necessary management technique to induce compliance with the rules of inmate behavior,
especially for high-security prisoners who have few other
privileges to lose. In this regard we note that numerous
other States have implemented similar restrictions on visitation privileges to control and deter substance-abuse violations. See Brief for State of Colorado et al. as Amici
Curiae 4-9.

Respondents argue that the regulation bears no rational
connection to preventing substance abuse because it has
been invoked in certain instances where the infractions
were, in respondents' view, minor. Even if we were inclined, though, to substitute our judgment for the conclusions
of prison officials concerning the infractions reached by the
regulations, the individual cases respondents cite are not sufficient to strike down the regulations as to all noncontact
visits. Respondents also contest the 2-year bar and note
that reinstatement of visitation is not automatic even at the
end of two years. We agree the restriction is severe. And
if faced with evidence that MDOC's regulation is treated as
a de facto permanent ban on all visitation for certain inmates, we might reach a different conclusion in a challenge
to a particular application of the regulation. Those issues
are not presented in this case, which challenges the validity
of the restriction on noncontact visits in all instances.

135Cite as: 539 U. S. 126 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Having determined that each of the challenged regulations
bears a rational relationship to a legitimate penological interest, we consider whether inmates have alternative means
of exercising the constitutional right they seek to assert.
Turner, 482 U. S., at 90. Were it shown that no alternative
means of communication existed, though it would not be conclusive, it would be some evidence that the regulations were
unreasonable. That showing, however, cannot be made.
Respondents here do have alternative means of associating
with those prohibited from visiting. As was the case in Pell,
inmates can communicate with those who may not visit by
sending messages through those who are allowed to visit.
417 U. S., at 825. Although this option is not available to
inmates barred all visitation after two violations, they and
other inmates may communicate with persons outside the
prison by letter and telephone. Respondents protest that
letter writing is inadequate for illiterate inmates and for
communications with young children. They say, too, that
phone calls are brief and expensive, so that these alternatives are not sufficient. Alternatives to visitation need not
be ideal, however; they need only be available. Here, the
alternatives are of sufficient utility that they give some support to the regulations, particularly in a context where visitation is limited, not completely withdrawn.

Another relevant consideration is the impact that accommodation of the asserted associational right would have on
guards, other inmates, the allocation of prison resources, and
the safety of visitors. See Turner, supra, at 90; Hudson,
supra, at 526 (visitor safety). Accommodating respondents'
demands would cause a significant reallocation of the prison
system's financial resources and would impair the ability of
corrections officers to protect all who are inside a prison's
walls. When such consequences are present, we are "particularly deferential" to prison administrators' regulatory judgments. Turner, supra, at 90.

539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
136 OVERTON v. BAZZETTA

Opinion of the Court
Finally, we consider whether the presence of ready alter-natives undermines the reasonableness of the regulations.

Turner does not impose a least-restrictive-alternative test,but asks instead whether the prisoner has pointed to some
obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates theasserted right while not imposing more than a de minimis
cost to the valid penological goal. 482 U. S., at 90-91. Re-spondents have not suggested alternatives meeting this high
standard for any of the regulations at issue. We disagreewith respondents' suggestion that allowing visitation by
nieces and nephews or children for whom parental rightshave been terminated is an obvious alternative. Increasing
the number of child visitors in that way surely would havemore than a negligible effect on the goals served by the regulation. As to the limitation on visitation by former in-mates, respondents argue the restriction could be time limited, but we defer to MDOC's judgment that a longerrestriction better serves its interest in preventing the criminal activity that can result from these interactions. Re-spondents suggest the duration of the restriction for inmates
with substance-abuse violations could be shortened or thatit could be applied only for the most serious violations, but
these alternatives do not go so far toward accommodatingthe asserted right with so little cost to penological goals that
they meet Turner's high standard. These considerationscannot justify the decision of the Court of Appeals to invalidate the regulation as to all noncontact visits.

III
Respondents also claim that the restriction on visitationfor inmates with two substance-abuse violations is a cruel

and unusual condition of confinement in violation of theEighth Amendment. The restriction undoubtedly makes
the prisoner's confinement more difficult to bear. But itdoes not, in the circumstances of this case, fall below the
standards mandated by the Eighth Amendment. Much of

137Cite as: 539 U. S. 126 (2003)
Stevens, J., concurring
what we have said already about the withdrawal of privi-leges that incarceration is expected to bring applies here as

well. Michigan, like many other States, uses withdrawal ofvisitation privileges for a limited period as a regular means
of effecting prison discipline. This is not a dramatic depar-ture from accepted standards for conditions of confinement.
Cf. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 485 (1995). Nor doesthe regulation create inhumane prison conditions, deprive inmates of basic necessities, or fail to protect their health orsafety. Nor does it involve the infliction of pain or injury,
or deliberate indifference to the risk that it might occur.See,

e. g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976); Rhodes v.Chapman, 452 U. S. 337 (1981). If the withdrawal of all visitation privileges were permanent or for a much longer pe-riod, or if it were applied in an arbitrary manner to a particular inmate, the case would present different considerations.An individual claim based on indefinite withdrawal of visitation or denial of procedural safeguards, however, would notsupport the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the entire
regulation is invalid. * * *

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

Our decision today is faithful to the principle that "federalcourts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims

of prison inmates." Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987).As we explained in

Turner:

"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prisoninmates from the protections of the Constitution.

Hence, for example, prisoners retain the constitutionalright to petition the government for the redress of
grievances, Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483 (1969); they

are protected against invidious racial discrimination by
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333 (1968); and they
enjoy the protections of due process, Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974); Haines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519
(1972). Because prisoners retain these rights, `[w]hen
a prison regulation or practice offends a fundamental
constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge
their duty to protect constitutional rights.' Procunier
v. Martinez, 416 U. S., at 405-406." Ibid.

It was in the groundbreaking decision in Morrissey v.
Brewer, 408 U. S. 471 (1972), in which we held that parole
revocation is a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that
the Court rejected the view once held by some state courts
that a prison inmate is a mere slave. See United States ex
rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F. 2d 701, 711-713 (CA7 1973).
Under that rejected view, the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment would have marked
the outer limit of the prisoner's constitutional rights. It is
important to emphasize that nothing in the Court's opinion
today signals a resurrection of any such approach in cases of
this kind. See ante, at 131. To the contrary, it remains
true that the "restraints and the punishment which a criminal conviction entails do not place the citizen beyond the ethical tradition that accords respect to the dignity and intrinsic
worth of every individual." 479 F. 2d, at 712.

A

The Court is asked to consider "[w]hether prisoners have
a right to non-contact prison visitation protected by the
First and Fourteenth Amendments." Brief for Petitioners
i. In my view, the question presented, as formulated in the
order granting certiorari, draws attention to the wrong inquiry. Rather than asking in the abstract whether a certain
right "survives" incarceration, ante, at 132, the Court should
ask whether a particular prisoner's lawful sentence took
away a right enjoyed by free persons.

The Court's precedents on the rights of prisoners rest on
the unstated (and erroneous) presumption that the Constitution contains an implicit definition of incarceration. This is
manifestly not the case, and, in my view, States are free to
define and redefine all types of punishment, including imprisonment, to encompass various types of deprivations--provided only that those deprivations are consistent with the
Eighth Amendment. Under this view, the Court's precedents on prisoner "rights" bear some reexamination.

When faced with a prisoner asserting a deprivation of constitutional rights in this context, the Court has asked first
whether the right survives incarceration, Pell v. Procunier,
417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974), and then whether a prison restriction on that right "bear[s] a rational relation to legitimate
penological interests." Ante, at 132 (citing Turner v. Safley,
482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)).

Pell and its progeny do not purport to impose a substantive
limitation on the power of a State to sentence a person convicted of a criminal offense to a deprivation of the right at
issue. For example, in Turner, the Court struck down a prison
regulation that prohibited inmates from marrying absent permission from the superintendent. 482 U. S., at 89, 94-99.
Turner cannot be properly understood, however, as holding
that a State may not sentence those convicted to both impris539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
140 OVERTON v. BAZZETTA

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
onment and the denial of a constitutional right to marry.*The only provision of the Constitution that speaks to the

scope of criminal punishment is the Cruel and UnusualPunishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and

Turner
cited neither that Clause nor the Court's precedents inter-preting it. Prisoners challenging their sentences must, absent an unconstitutional procedural defect, rely solely on the
Eighth Amendment.The proper inquiry, therefore, is whether a sentence validly deprives the prisoner of a constitutional right enjoyedby ordinary, law-abiding persons. Whether a sentence encompasses the extinction of a constitutional right enjoyed byfree persons turns on state law, for it is a State's prerogative
to determine how it will punish violations of its law, and thisCourt awards great deference to such determinations. See,
e. g., Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 824 (1991) ("Underour constitutional system, the primary responsibility for defining crimes against state law [and] fixing punishments for
the commission of these crimes . . . rests with the States");
see also Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11, 24 (2003) (opinion
of O'Connor, J.) ("[O]ur tradition of deferring to state legislatures in making and implementing such important [sentencing] policy decisions is longstanding").

Turner is therefore best thought of as implicitly deciding
that the marriage restriction was not within the scope of
the State's lawfully imposed sentence and that, therefore, the
regulation worked a deprivation of a constitutional right
without sufficient process. Yet, when the resolution of a
federal constitutional issue may be rendered irrelevant by

*A prisoner's sentence is the punishment imposed pursuant to state law.
Sentencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment may, under state law,
carry with it the implied delegation to prison officials to discipline and
otherwise supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated. Thus, restrictions imposed by prison officials may also be a part of the sentence, provided that those officials are not acting ultra vires with respect to the
discretion given them, by implication, in the sentence.

the determination of a predicate state-law question, federalcourts should ordinarily abstain from passing on the federal

issue. Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S.496 (1941). Here, if the prisoners' lawful sentences encompassed the extinction of any right to intimate association asa matter of state law, all that would remain would be respondents' (meritless, see Part II, infra) Eighth Amendmentclaim. Petitioners have not asked this Court to abstain
under Pullman, and the issue of Pullman abstention wasnot considered below. As a result, petitioners have, in this
case, submitted to the sort of guesswork about the meaningof prison sentences that is the hallmark of the

Turner in-quiry. Here, furthermore, Pullman abstention seems unnecessary because respondents make no effort to show thatthe sentences imposed on them did not extinguish the right
they now seek to enforce. And for good reason.It is highly doubtful that, while sentencing each respondent to imprisonment, the State of Michigan intended to per-mit him to have any right of access to visitors. Such access
seems entirely inconsistent with Michigan's goal of segregat-ing a criminal from society, see

Morrissey v. Brewer, 408U. S. 471, 482 (1972) (incarceration by design intrudes on the

freedom "to be with family and friends and to form the otherenduring attachments of normal life"); cf. Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S. 238 (1983) (upholding incarceration severalhours of flight away from home).

B
Though the question whether the State of Michigan in-tended to confer upon respondents a right to receive visitors

is ultimately for the State itself to answer, it must nonethe-less be confronted in this case. The Court's Turner analysis
strongly suggests that the asserted rights were extinguishedby the State of Michigan in incarcerating respondents. Restrictions that are rationally connected to the running of aprison, that are designed to avoid adverse impacts on guards,

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
inmates, or prison resources, that cannot be replaced by"ready alternatives," and that leave inmates with alternative

means of accomplishing what the restrictions prohibit, arepresumptively included within a sentence of imprisonment.
Moreover, the history of incarceration as punishment sup-ports the view that the sentences imposed on respondents
terminated any rights of intimate association. From the
time prisons began to be used as places where criminalsserved out their sentences, they were administered much in

the way Michigan administers them today.Incarceration in the 18th century in both England and the
Colonies was virtually nonexistent as a form of punishment.
L. Friedman, Crime and Punishment in American History 48
(1993) (hereinafter Friedman) ("From our standpoint, what
is most obviously missing, as a punishment [in the colonial system of corrections], is imprisonment"). Colonial jails
had a very limited function of housing debtors and holding

prisoners who were awaiting trial. See id., at 49. These
institutions were generally characterized by "[d]isorder and
neglect." McGowen, The Well-Ordered Prison: England,
1780-1865, in The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice
of Punishment in Western Society 79 (N. Morris & D. Rothman eds. 1995) (hereinafter McGowen). It is not therefore
surprising that these jails were quite permeable. A debtor
could come and go as he pleased, as long as he remained
within a certain area (" `prison bounds' ") and returned to jail
to sleep. Friedman 49. Moreover, a prisoner with connections could get food and clothing from the outside, id., at 50;
see also W. Lewis, From Newgate to Dannemora: The Rise
of the Penitentiary in New York, 1796-1848, p. 49 (1965)
(hereinafter Lewis) ("Many visitors brought the felons such
items of contraband as rum, tools, money, and unauthorized
messages"). In sum, "[t]here was little evidence of authority," McGowen 79, uniformity, and discipline.

Prison as it is known today and its part in the penitentiary
system were "basically a nineteenth-century invention."

Friedman 48. During that time, the prison became the cen-terpiece of correctional theory, while whipping, a traditional

form of punishment in colonial times, fell into disrepute.The industrialization produced rapid growth, population mobility, and large cities with no well-defined community; asa result, public punishments resulting in stigma and shame
wielded little power, as such methods were effective only in
small closed communities. Id., at 77.The rise of the penitentiary and confinement as punishment was accompanied by the debate about the Auburn andPennsylvania systems, both of which imposed isolation from
fellow prisoners and the outside. D. Rothman, The Discovery of the Asylum 82 (1971) (hereinafter Rothman) ("As both
schemes placed maximum emphasis on preventing the prisoners from communicating with anyone else, the point of dispute was whether convicts should work silently in large
groups or individually within solitary cells"); id., at 95. Although there were several justifications for such isolation,
they all centered around the belief in the necessity of constructing a special setting for the "deviant" (i. e., criminal),
where he would be placed in an environment targeted at rehabilitation, far removed from the corrupting influence of his
family and community. Id., at 71; A. Hirsch, The Rise of the
Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America 17,
19, 23 (1992); cf. Friedman 77 (describing the changing attitudes toward the origin of crime). Indeed, every feature of
the design of a penitentiary--external appearance, internal
arrangement, and daily routine--were aimed at achieving
that goal. Rothman 79-80; see also id., at 83.

Whatever the motives for establishing the penitentiary as
the means of combating crime, confinement became standardized in the period between 1780 and 1865. McGowen 79.
Prisons were turned into islands of "undeviating regularity,"
Lewis 122, with little connection to the outside, McGowen
108. Inside the prisons, there were only prisoners and jailers; the difference between the two groups was conspicu539US1 Unit: $U72 [05-04-05 20:19:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ously obvious. Id., at 79. Prisoners' lives were carefully
regulated, including the contacts with the outside. They
were permitted virtually no visitors; even their letters were
censored. Any contact that might resemble normal sociability among prisoners or with the outside world became a target for controls and prohibitions. Id., at 108.

To the extent that some prisons allowed visitors, it was
not for the benefit of those confined, but rather to their detriment. Many prisons offered tours in order to increase revenues. During such tours, visitors could freely stare at prisoners, while prisoners had to obey regulations categorically
forbidding them to so much as look at a visitor. Lewis 124.
In addition to the general "burden on the convict's spirit" in
the form of "the galling knowledge that he was in all his
humiliation subject to the frequent gaze of visitors, some of
whom might be former friends or neighbors," presence of
women visitors made the circumstances "almost unendurable," prompting a prison physician to complain about allowing women in. Ibid.

Although by the 1840's some institutions relaxed their
rules against correspondence and visitations, the restrictions
continued to be severe. For example, Sing Sing allowed
convicts to send one letter every six months, provided it was
penned by the chaplain and censored by the warden. Each
prisoner was permitted to have one visit from his relatives
during his sentence, provided it was properly supervised.
No reading materials of any kind, except a Bible, were allowed inside. S. Christianson, With Liberty for Some: 500
Years of Imprisonment in America 145 (1998). With such
stringent regimentation of prisoners' lives, the prison "had
assumed an unmistakable appearance," McGowen 79, one
which did not envision any entitlement to visitation.

Although any State is free to alter its definition of incarceration to include the retention of constitutional rights
previously enjoyed, it appears that Michigan sentenced

respondents against the backdrop of this conception ofimprisonment.

II
In my view, for the reasons given in Hudson v. McMillian,503 U. S. 1, 18-19 (1992) (

Thomas, J., dissenting), regula-tions pertaining to visitations are not punishment within

the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. Consequently, re-spondents' Eighth Amendment challenge must fail.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION v. BEAUMONT

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 02-403. Argued March 25, 2003--Decided June 16, 2003
A corporation is prohibited from making "a contribution or expenditure in

connection with" certain federal elections, 2 U. S. C. $ 441b(a), but not
from establishing, administering, and soliciting contributions to a separate fund to be used for political purposes, $ 441b(b)(2)(C). Such a PAC
(so called after the political action committee that runs it) is free to
make contributions and other expenditures in connection with federal
elections. Respondents, a nonprofit advocacy corporation known as
North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., and others (collectively NCRL), sued
petitioner Federal Election Commission (FEC), challenging the constitutionality of $ 441b and its implementing regulations as applied to
NCRL. As relevant here, the District Court granted NCRL summary
judgment as to the ban on direct contributions, and the Fourth Circuit
affirmed.

Held: Applying the direct contribution prohibition to nonprofit advocacy

corporations is consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 152-163.

(a) An attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate political
contributions goes against the current of a century of congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially deleterious influences on federal
elections. Since 1907, federal law has barred such direct corporate contributions. Much of the subsequent congressional attention to corporate political activity has been meant to strengthen the original, core
prohibition on such contributions. Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197. As in 1907, current law
focuses on the corporate structure's special characteristics that threaten
the integrity of the political process. Id., at 209. In barring corporate
earnings from turning into political "war chests," the ban was and is
intended to "preven[t] corruption or the appearance of corruption."
Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action
Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 496-497. The ban also protects individuals who
have paid money into a corporation or union for other purposes from
having their money used to support political candidates to whom they
may be opposed, National Right to Work, supra, at 208, and hedges

against use of corporations as conduits for circumventing "valid contribution limits," Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 456, and n. 18. Pp. 152-156.

(b) National Right to Work all but decided against NCRL's position
that $ 441b's ban on direct contributions is unconstitutional as applied to
nonprofit advocacy corporations. There, this Court upheld the part of

$ 441b restricting a nonstock corporation to its membership when soliciting PAC contributions, concluding that the congressional judgment to
regulate corporate political involvement warrants considerable deference and reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers that corporations pose to the electoral process. 459 U. S., at 207-211. It would be
hard to read this conclusion, except on the practical understanding that
the corporation's capacity to make contributions was legitimately limited to indirect donations within the scope allowed to PACs. And the
Court specifically rejected the argument made here, that deference to
congressional judgments about corporate contribution limits turns on
details of corporate form or the affluence of particular corporations.
National Right to Work has repeatedly been read as approving $ 441b's
prohibition on direct contributions, even by nonprofit corporations without great financial resources. Equal significance must be accorded to
Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479
U. S. 238, on which NCRL and the Fourth Circuit have relied. In holding $ 441b's prohibition on independent expenditures unconstitutional as
applied to a nonprofit advocacy corporation, the Court there distinguished National Right to Work on the ground that it addressed regulation of contributions, not expenditures. Pp. 156-159.

(c) This Court could not hold for NCRL without recasting its understanding of the risks of harm posed by corporate political contributions,
of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent
deference owed to legislative judgments on what to do about them.
NCRL's efforts do not unsettle existing law on these points. Its argument that Massachusetts Citizens for Life-type corporations pose no
potential threat to the political system is rejected. Concern about the
corrupting potential underlying the corporate ban may be implicated by
advocacy corporations, which, like their for-profit counterparts, benefit
from state-created advantages and may be able to amass substantial
political war chests. Also rejected is NCRL's argument that the application of the ban on direct contributions should be subject to strict scrutiny because $ 441b bars, rather than limits, contributions based on their
source. When reviewing political financial restrictions, the level of
scrutiny is based on the importance of the political activity at issue to
effective speech or political association, and restrictions on political

Syllabus
contributions have long been treated as marginal speech restrictions
subject to relatively complaisant First Amendment review because contributions lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression.
Thus, a contribution limit passes muster if it is closely drawn to match
a sufficiently important interest. The time to consider the difference
between a ban and a limit is when applying scrutiny at the level selected, not in selecting the standard of review itself. But even NCRL's
argument that $ 441b is not closely drawn rests on the false premise that
the provision is a complete ban. In fact, the provision allows corporate
political participation through PACs. And this Court does not think
that regulatory burdens on PACs, including restrictions on their ability
to solicit funds, renders a PAC unconstitutional as an advocacy corporation's sole avenue for making political contributions. See National
Right to Work, supra, at 201-202. Pp. 159-163.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Since 1907, federal law has barred corporations from contributing directly to candidates for federal office. We hold
that applying the prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment.

I
The current statute makes it "unlawful . . . for any corporation whatever . . . to make a contribution or expenditure in
connection with" certain federal elections, 90 Stat. 490, as
renumbered and amended, 2 U. S. C. $ 441b(a), "contribution
or expenditure" each being defined to include "anything of
value," $ 441b(b)(2). The prohibition does not, however, forbid "the establishment, administration, and solicitation of
contributions to a separate segregated fund to be utilized for
political purposes." $ 441b(b)(2)(C); see $ 431(4)(B). Such a
PAC (so called after the political action committee that runs
it) may be wholly controlled by the sponsoring corporation,
whose employees and stockholders or members generally
may be solicited for contributions. See $$ 441b(b)(4)(B)-(C);
Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work
Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 200, n. 4 (1982). While federal law
requires PACs to register and disclose their activities,

$$ 432-434; see Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 253-254 (1986),
the law leaves them free to make contributions as well as
other expenditures in connection with federal elections,

$$ 114.2(b), 114.10 (2003), but only so far as they applyto NCRL. The corporation is organized under the laws of
North Carolina to provide counseling to pregnant womenand to urge alternatives to abortion, and as a nonprofit

advocacy corporation it is exempted from federal taxationby $ 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C.

$ 501(c)(4).1 It has no shareholders and, although it receivessome donations from traditional business corporations, it is
"overwhelmingly funded by private contributions from indi-viduals." App. 14. NCRL has made contributions and expenditures in connection with state elections, but not federal,owing to 2 U. S. C. $ 441b. Instead, it has established a PAC,
the North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., Political Action Com-mittee, which has contributed to federal candidates. See
North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Bartlett, 168 F. 3d 705,709 (CA4 1999), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 1153 (2000).

The District Court granted summary judgment to NCRLand held $ 441b unconstitutional as applied to the corporation, both as to direct contributions and independent expend-itures. 137 F. Supp. 2d 648 (EDNC 2000). A divided Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, 278 F. 3d 261(2002), relying primarily on Massachusetts Citizens for Life,
in which this Court held it unconstitutional to apply the stat-ute to independent expenditures by Massachusetts Citizens
for Life, Inc., a nonprofit advocacy corporation in some re1 Section 501(c)(4)(A) grants exemption to "[c]ivic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion
of social welfare, . . . the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to
charitable, educational, or recreational purposes." An organization "may
carry on lawful political activities and remain exempt under section
501(c)(4) as long as it is primarily engaged in activities that promote social
welfare." Rev. Rul. 81-95, 1981-1 Cum. Bull. 332. Unlike contributions
to $ 501(c)(3) organizations, donations to those recognized under $ 501(c)(4)
are not tax deductible. See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of
Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 543 (1983).

spects like NCRL. The Court of Appeals ruled, first, thatthe prohibition on independent expenditures may not be

applied to NCRL. Although the panel acknowledged thatMassachusetts Citizens for Life, unlike NCRL, had a formal
policy against accepting corporate donations, see Massachu-setts Citizens for Life, supra, at 263-264 (describing this feature of the organization as "essential to our holding"), it nev-ertheless treated NCRL as materially indistinguishable from
Massachusetts Citizens for Life.To the point for present purposes, the Court of Appeals
went on to hold the ban on direct contributions likewise un-constitutional as applied to NCRL. While the majority of
the divided court recognized that regulation of campaigncontributions has received greater deference under First
Amendment cases than regulation of independent expendi-tures, 278 F. 3d, at 274 (citing

Nixon v. Shrink MissouriGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 386-388 (2000)), it held the

ban on direct contributions unjustified as applied to "[Massachusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporations," which itthought "pose[d] no risk of `unfair deployment of wealth for

political purposes.' " 278 F. 3d, at 275 (quoting Massachu-setts Citizens for Life, supra, at 259). The Court of Appeals
reasoned that "[t]he rationale utilized by the Court in [Mas-sachusetts Citizens for Life] to declare prohibitions on independent expenditures unconstitutional as applied to [the ad-vocacy corporation involved there] is equally applicable in
the context of direct contributions." 278 F. 3d, at 275.Judge Gregory dissented from the others on this point, since
he saw no way to square their conclusion with this Court'sreasoning in National Right to Work. 278 F. 3d, at 282.

After the Fourth Circuit divided 7 to 4 in denying rehear-ing en banc, the FEC petitioned for certiorari solely as to
the constitutionality of the ban on direct contributions.2 Be2 We thus have no occasion to say whether the Court of Appeals correctly held NCRL entitled to the so-called "Massachusetts Citizens for
Life exception" to the statute's ban on independent expenditures.

A

Any attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate
political contributions goes against the current of a century
of congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially
"deleterious influences on federal elections," which we have
canvassed a number of times before. United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 585 (1957); see id., at 570-584;
see also National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 208-209; Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 402-412 (1972); United
States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 113-115 (1948). The current
law grew out of a "popular feeling" in the late 19th century
"that aggregated capital unduly influenced politics, an influence not stopping short of corruption." Automobile Workers, supra, at 570. A demand for congressional action gathered force in the campaign of 1904, which made a national
issue of the political leverage exerted through corporate contributions, and after the election and new revelations of corporate political overreaching, President Theodore Roosevelt
made banning corporate political contributions a legislative
priority. R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts: The
Making of Federal Campaign Finance Law 1-8 (1988); see
Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 571-575. Although some
congressional proposals would have "prohibited political contributions by [only] certain classes of corporations," id., at
573, the momentum was "for elections `free from the power
of money,' " id., at 575 (citation omitted), and Congress acted
on the President's call for an outright ban, not with half
measures, but with the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864.

xvii, banned "any corporation whatever" from making"a money contribution in connection with" federal elections,

34 Stat. 864-865.Since 1907, there has been continual congressional attention to corporate political activity, sometimes resulting in re-finement of the law, sometimes in overhaul.

3 One feature,

however, has stayed intact throughout this "careful legisla-tive adjustment of the federal electoral laws,"

NationalRight to Work, supra, at 209, and much of the periodic

amendment was meant to strengthen the original, core pro-hibition on direct corporate contributions. The Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, for example, broadened theban on contributions to include "anything of value," and
criminalized the act of receiving a contribution to match thecriminality of making one. Ch. 368, $$ 302, 313, 43 Stat.
1070, 1074. So, in another instance, the 1947 Labor Manage-ment Relations Act drew labor unions permanently within
the law's reach and invigorated the earlier prohibition to in-clude "expenditure[s]" as well. Ch. 120, $ 304, 61 Stat. 159;
see Pipefitters, supra, at 402.Today, as in 1907, the law focuses on the "special characteristics of the corporate structure" that threaten the integrityof the political process.

154 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. BEAUMONT

Opinion of the Court
"State law grants corporations special advantages--such
as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets--
that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy
their resources in ways that maximize the return on
their shareholders' investments. These state-created
advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also permit them
to use `resources amassed in the economic marketplace'
to obtain `an unfair advantage in the political marketplace.' " 494 U. S., at 658-659 (quoting Massachusetts
Citizens for Life, supra, at 257).

Hence, the public interest in "restrict[ing] the influence of
political war chests funneled through the corporate form."
National Conservative Political Action Comm., supra, at
500-501; see National Right to Work, supra, at 207 ("[S]ubstantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form of organization
should not be converted into political `war chests' which
could be used to incur political debts from legislators").

As these excerpts from recent opinions show, not only has
the original ban on direct corporate contributions endured,
but so have the original rationales for the law. In barring corporate earnings from conversion into political "war
chests," the ban was and is intended to "preven[t] corruption
or the appearance of corruption." National Conservative
Political Action Comm., supra, at 496-497; see also First
Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 788, n. 26
(1978) ("The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption] has never been doubted"). But the ban
has always done further duty in protecting "the individuals
who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates from having that
money used to support political candidates to whom they
may be opposed." National Right to Work, supra, at 208;

Opinion of the Court
see CIO, 335 U. S., at 113; see also Austin, supra, at 673-678(Brennan, J., concurring).

Quite aside from war-chest corruption and the interests ofcontributors and owners, however, another reason for regulating corporate electoral involvement has emerged with re-strictions on individual contributions, and recent cases have
recognized that restricting contributions by various organizations hedges against their use as conduits for "circum-vention of [valid] contribution limits."

Federal Election
Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,533 U. S. 431, 456, and n. 18 (2001); see

Austin, supra, at 664.
To the degree that a corporation could contribute to political
candidates, the individuals "who created it, who own it, or
whom it employs," Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.
King, 533 U. S. 158, 163 (2001), could exceed the bounds
imposed on their own contributions by diverting money
through the corporation, cf. Colorado Republican, 533 U. S.,
at 446-447. As we said on the subject of limiting coordinated expenditures by political parties, experience "demonstrates how candidates, donors, and parties test the limits
of the current law, and it shows beyond serious doubt how
contribution limits would be eroded if inducement to circumvent them were enhanced." Id., at 457.

In sum, our cases on campaign finance regulation represent respect for the "legislative judgment that the special
characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation." National Right to Work, supra,
at 209-210. And we have understood that such deference
to legislative choice is warranted particularly when Congress
regulates campaign contributions, carrying as they do a plain
threat to political integrity and a plain warrant to counter
the appearance and reality of corruption and the misuse of
corporate advantages. See, e. g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.
1, 26-28, 47 (1976) (per curiam). As we said in Colorado
Republican, "limits on contributions are more clearly justified by a link to political corruption than limits on other

Opinion of the Court
kinds of . . . political spending are (corruption being under-stood not only as quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue

influence on an officeholder's judgment, and the appearanceof such influence)." 533 U. S., at 440-441 (citation omitted).

B
That historical prologue would discourage any broadsideattack on corporate campaign finance regulation or regulation of corporate contributions, and NCRL accordingly ques-tions $ 441b only to the extent the law places nonprofit advocacy corporations like itself under the general ban on directcontributions. But not even this more focused challenge can
claim a blank slate, for Judge Gregory rightly said in hisdissent that our explanation in

National Right to Work allbut decided the issue against NCRL's position.

National Right to Work addressed the provision of $ 441brestricting a nonstock corporation to its membership when
soliciting contributions to its PAC,4 and we consideredwhether a nonprofit advocacy corporation without members
of the usual sort could be held to violate the law by solicitinga donation to its PAC from any individual who had at one
time contributed to the corporation. See 459 U. S., at 199-200. We sustained the FEC's position that a fund drive as
broad as this went beyond the solicitation of "members" per-mitted by $ 441b, and we invoked the history distilled above
in holding that the statutory restriction was no infringementon those First Amendment associational rights closely akin
to speech. Id., at 206-209. We concluded that the congres-sional judgment to regulate corporate political involvement

4 Section 441b(b)(4)(A) bars a corporation from soliciting contributions
to a PAC established by the corporation, except from stockholders or other
specified categories of persons. Section 441b(b)(4)(C), the specific provision at issue in National Right to Work, provides, in relevant part, that

$ 441b(b)(4)(A) "shall not prevent a . . . corporation without capital stock
. . . from soliciting contributions to [a PAC established by the corporation]
from members of such . . . corporation."

Opinion of the Court
"warrants considerable deference" and "reflects a permissi-ble assessment of the dangers posed by [corporations] to the

electoral process." Id., at 207-211.It would be hard to read our conclusion in

National Right
to Work, that the PAC solicitation restrictions were constitu-tional, except on the practical understanding that the corporation's capacity to make contributions was legitimately limited to indirect donations within the scope allowed to PACs.See,

e. g., id., at 208 (reviewing both "the statutory prohibitions and exceptions"). In fact, we specifically rejected theargument made here, that deference to congressional judgments about proper limits on corporate contributions turns
on details of corporate form or the affluence of particular
corporations. In the same breath, we remarked on the
broad applicability of $ 441b to "corporations and labor
unions without great financial resources, as well as those
more fortunately situated," and made a point of refusing to
"second-guess a legislative determination as to the need for
prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared."
Id., at 210.

Later cases have repeatedly acknowledged, without questioning, the reading of National Right to Work as generally
approving the $ 441b prohibition on direct contributions,
even by nonprofit corporations "without great financial resources." Ibid. In National Conservative Political Action Committee, for example, we not only spoke of National
Right to Work as consistent with "the well-established constitutional validity of legislative regulation of corporate contributions to candidates for public office," but went on to reaffirm that the Court in that case had "rightly concluded that
Congress might include, along with labor unions and corporations traditionally prohibited from making contributions to
political candidates, membership corporations, though contributions by the latter might not exhibit all of the evil that
contributions by traditional economically organized corporations exhibit." 470 U. S., at 495, 500; see id., at 500 (describ539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
158 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. BEAUMONT

Opinion of the Court
ing National Right to Work as giving "proper deference toa congressional determination of the need for a prophylactic

rule"). Relying again on National Right to Work, we madea similar point in

Austin when we sustained Michigan's ban
on direct corporate contributions, even though the ban "in-clude[d] within its scope closely held corporations that do

not possess vast reservoirs of capital." 494 U. S., at 661.
"Although some closely held corporations, just as somepublicly held ones, may not have accumulated significant

amounts of wealth, they receive from the State the specialbenefits conferred by the corporate structure and present
the potential for distorting the political process. This potential for distortion justifies [the state law's] general applicability to all corporations." Ibid.

But National Right to Work does not stand alone in its
bearing on the issue here, and equal significance must be
accorded to Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the very case
upon which NCRL and the Court of Appeals have placed
principal reliance. There, we held the prohibition on independent expenditures under $ 441b unconstitutional as
applied to a nonprofit advocacy corporation. While the
majority explained generally that the "potential for unfair
deployment of wealth for political purposes" fell short of justifying a ban on expenditures by groups like Massachusetts
Citizens for Life that "do not pose that danger of corruption," the majority's response to the dissent pointed to a different resolution of the present case. 479 U. S., at 259.
The Chief Justice's dissenting opinion noted that Massachusetts Citizens for Life "was not unlike" the corporation
at issue in National Right to Work, which he read as supporting the ban on independent expenditures. 479 U. S., at
269. Without disagreeing about the similarity of the two
organizations, the majority nonetheless distinguished National Right to Work on the ground of its addressing regulation of contributions, not expenditures. See 479 U. S., at
259-260 ("[R]estrictions on contributions require less com539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
pelling justification than restrictions on independent spend-ing"). "In light of the historical role of contributions in the

corruption of the electoral process, the need for a broad pro-phylactic rule [against contributions] was thus sufficient in
[National Right to Work]." Id., at 260.

C
The upshot is that, although we have never squarely heldagainst NCRL's position here, we could not hold for it without recasting our understanding of the risks of harm posedby corporate political contributions, of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent deferenceowed to legislative judgments on what to do about them.
NCRL's efforts, however, fail to unsettle existing law on anyof these points.

First, NCRL argues that on a class-wide basis "[Massa-chusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporations pose no potential of threat to the political system," so that the governmen-tal interest in combating corruption is as weak as the Court
held it to be in relation to the particular corporation consid-ered in

Massachusetts Citizens for Life. Brief for Re-spondents 19. But this generalization does not hold up.

For present purposes, we will assume advocacy corporationsare generally different from traditional business corporations in the improbability that contributions they mightmake would end up supporting causes that some of their
members would not approve. See Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, supra, at 260-262.

5 But concern about the corrupt5 That said, this concern is not wholly inapplicable to advocacy corporations, as "persons may desire that an organization use their contributions
to further a certain cause, but may not want the organization to use their
money to urge support for or opposition to political candidates solely on
the basis of that cause." Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U. S., at
261. In any event, we have never intimated that the risk of corruption
alone is insufficient to support regulation of political contributions. See,
e. g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 658-659
(1990); Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459

Opinion of the Court
ing potential underlying the corporate ban may indeed beimplicated by advocacy corporations. They, like their forprofit counterparts, benefit from significant "state-createdadvantages," Austin, supra, at 659, and may well be able to
amass substantial "political `war chests,' " National Right toWork, 459 U. S., at 207. Not all corporations that qualify
for favorable tax treatment under $ 501(c)(4) of the InternalRevenue Code lack substantial resources, and the category
covers some of the Nation's most politically powerful organi-zations, including the AARP, the National Rifle Association,
and the Sierra Club.6 Nonprofit advocacy corporations are,moreover, no less susceptible than traditional business companies to misuse as conduits for circumventing the contribu-tion limits imposed on individuals. Cf.

Austin, supra, at 664(noting that a nonprofit corporation is capable of "serv[ing] as a conduit for corporate political spending").7
U. S. 197, 208 (1982); cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528
U. S. 377, 388-389 (2000).

6 See http://www.aarp.org/press/disclosure.html (as visited June 12, 2003)

(available in Clerk of Court's case file) (AARP); http://www.give.org/
reports/index.asp (as visited June 12, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court's
case file) (National Rifle Association and Sierra Club). These examples
answer NCRL's argument that the Massachusetts Citizens for Life exception is "self-limiting." See Brief for Respondents 27 ("If [a Massachusetts
Citizens for Life]-type corporation begins generating or receiving substantial business income or business corporation contributions, by definition, it
automatically is no longer [a Massachusetts Citizens for Life]-type corporation" (citing Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life,
Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 263-264 (1986))). The nonprofit advocacy corporations
mentioned (one of which has, in fact, been granted "[Massachusetts Citizens
for Life]-type" status by a Court of Appeals, see, e. g., FEC v. National Rifle
Assn., 254 F. 3d 173, 192 (CADC 2001)) show that "political `war chests' " may
be amassed simply from members' contributions. 459 U. S., at 207.

7 NCRL suggests that the Government's interest in combating circumvention of the campaign finance laws would be sufficiently met by allowing
limited contributions subject to the earmarking rule of $ 441a(a)(8), which
provides that "contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise
directed through an intermediate or conduit to [a] candidate" are treated
as contributions to the candidate (thus triggering the disclosure require539US1 Unit: $U73 [07-05-05 17:06:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

161Cite as: 539 U. S. 146 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Second, NCRL argues that application of the ban on itscontributions should be subject to a strict level of scrutiny,

on the ground that $ 441b does not merely limit contribu-tions, but bans them on the basis of their source. Brief for
Respondents 14-16. This argument, however, overlooks thebasic premise we have followed in setting First Amendment
standards for reviewing political financial restrictions: thelevel of scrutiny is based on the importance of the "political
activity at issue" to effective speech or political association.
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, 479 U. S., at 259; see Colo-rado Republican, 533 U. S., at 440-442, and nn. 6-7; Nixon,

528 U. S., at 386-388. Going back to Buckley v. Valeo, 424U. S. 1 (1976), restrictions on political contributions have
been treated as merely "marginal" speech restrictions sub-ject to relatively complaisant review under the First Amendment, because contributions lie closer to the edges than tothe core of political expression. See Colorado Republican,
supra, at 440.8 "While contributions may result in politicalexpression if spent by a candidate or an association . . . , the
transformation of contributions into political debate involves
ments of $ 434(b)(3)(A)). Brief for Respondents 31. We rejected this
precise argument, however, in Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431 (2001), where we concluded that it "ignores the practical difficulty of identifying and directly
combating circumvention under actual political conditions." Id., at 462.
"The earmarking provision . . . would reach only the most clumsy attempts
to pass contributions through to candidates. To treat the earmarking
provision as the outer limit of acceptable tailoring would disarm any serious effort to limit [circumvention]." Ibid.

8 Within the realm of contributions generally, corporate contributions

are furthest from the core of political expression, since corporations' First
Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from
those of their members, see, e. g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,
357 U. S. 449, 458-459 (1958), and of the public in receiving information,
see, e. g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 777 (1978).
A ban on direct corporate contributions leaves individual members of corporations free to make their own contributions, and deprives the public of
little or no material information.

Opinion of the Court
speech by someone other than the contributor." Buckley,
supra, at 20-21. This is the reason that instead of requiring
contribution regulations to be narrowly tailored to serve acompelling governmental interest, "a contribution limit involving `significant interference' with associational rights"passes muster if it satisfies the lesser demand of being
" `closely drawn' to match a `sufficiently important interest.' "
Nixon, supra, at 387-388 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 25);cf.

Austin, 494 U. S., at 657; Buckley, supra, at 44-45.9
Indeed, this recognition that degree of scrutiny turns onthe nature of the activity regulated is the only practical way

to square two leading cases: National Right to Work ap-proved strict solicitation limits on a PAC organized to make
contributions, see 459 U. S., at 201-202, whereas Massachusetts Citizens for Life applied a compelling interest test to
invalidate the ban on an advocacy corporation's expendituresin light of PAC regulatory burdens, see 479 U. S., at 252-255;

see also id., at 265-266 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Each case
involved $ 441b, after all, and the same "ban" on the same
corporate "sources" of political activity applied in both cases.

It is not that the difference between a ban and a limit is
to be ignored; it is just that the time to consider it is when
applying scrutiny at the level selected, not in selecting the
standard of review itself. But even when NCRL urges precisely that, and asserts that $ 441b is not sufficiently "closely
drawn," the claim still rests on a false premise, for NCRL is
simply wrong in characterizing $ 441b as a complete ban.
As we have said before, the section "permits some participation of unions and corporations in the federal electoral proc9 Judicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal
with a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchanged
throughout a century of "careful legislative adjustment." National Right
to Work, supra, at 209; cf. Nixon, supra, at 391 ("The quantum of empirical
evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised").

ess by allowing them to establish and pay the administrativeexpenses of [PACs]." National Right to Work, supra, at

201; see also Austin, supra, at 660; Massachusetts Citizensfor Life, supra, at 252. The PAC option allows corporate
political participation without the temptation to use corpo-rate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds with
the sentiments of some shareholders or members, and it letsthe Government regulate campaign activity through registration and disclosure, see $$ 432-434, without jeopardizingthe associational rights of advocacy organizations' members,
see NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 462(1958) (holding that "[c]ompelled disclosure of membership
in an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs"may violate the First Amendment).

NCRL cannot prevail, then, simply by arguing that a banon an advocacy corporation's direct contributions is bad tailoring. NCRL would have to demonstrate that the law vio-lated the First Amendment in allowing contributions to be
made only through its PAC and subject to a PAC's adminis-trative burdens. But a unanimous Court in National Right
to Work did not think the regulatory burdens on PACs, in-cluding restrictions on their ability to solicit funds, rendered
a PAC unconstitutional as an advocacy corporation's soleavenue for making political contributions. See 459 U. S., at
201-202. There is no reason to think the burden on advo-cacy corporations is any greater today, or to reach a different
conclusion here. III

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

My position, expressed in dissenting opinions in previouscases, has been that the Court erred in sustaining certain

paig n finance context and misapprehended basic FirstAmendment principles in doing so. See Nixon v. Shrink

Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 409 (2000) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 699 (1990) (Kennedy, J., dissenting);Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal

Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 626 (1996) (Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). I adhere to
this view, and so can give no weight to those authorities inthe instant case.

That said, it must be acknowledged that Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479U. S. 238 (1986) (MCFL), contains language supporting the

Court's holding here that corporate contributions can be reg-ulated more closely than corporate expenditures. The language upon which the Court relies tends to reconcile thetension between the approach in MCFL and the Court's earlier decision in Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right
to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197 (1982).Were we presented with a case in which the distinction

between contributions and expenditures under the wholescheme of campaign finance regulation were under review,
I might join Justice Thomas' dissenting opinion. TheCourt does not undertake that comprehensive examination
here, however. And since there is language in MCFL thatsupports today's holding, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

I continue to believe that campaign finance laws are subject to strict scrutiny. Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431,

condition had worsened. Sell subsequently asked the Magistrate to reconsider his competence to stand trial for fraud and attempted murder.
The Magistrate had him examined at a United States Medical Center
for Federal Prisoners (Medical Center), found him mentally incompetent
to stand trial, and ordered his hospitalization to determine whether he
would attain the capacity to allow his trial to proceed. While there,
Sell refused the staff's recommendation to take antipsychotic medication. Medical Center authorities decided to allow involuntary medication, which Sell challenged in court. The Magistrate authorized forced
administration of antipsychotic drugs, finding that Sell was a danger to
himself and others, that medication was the only way to render him less
dangerous, that any serious side effects could be ameliorated, that the
benefits to Sell outweighed the risks, and that the drugs were substantially likely to return Sell to competence. In affirming, the District
Court found the Magistrate's dangerousness finding clearly erroneous
but concluded that medication was the only viable hope of rendering
Sell competent to stand trial and was necessary to serve the Government's interest in obtaining an adjudication of his guilt or innocence.
The Eighth Circuit affirmed. Focusing solely on the fraud charges, it
found that the Government had an essential interest in bringing Sell to
trial, that the treatment was medically appropriate, and that the medical
evidence indicated a reasonable probability that Sell would fairly be able
to participate in his trial.

Held:

1. The Eighth Circuit had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The District Court's pretrial order was an appealable "collateral order" within
the exceptions to the rule that only final judgments are appealable.
The order conclusively determines the disputed question whether Sell
has a legal right to avoid forced medication. Coopers & Lybrand v.
Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468. It also resolves an important issue, for
involuntary medical treatment raises questions of clear constitutional
importance. Ibid. And the issue is effectively unreviewable on appeal

Syllabus
from a final judgment, ibid., since, by the time of trial, Sell will have
undergone forced medication--the very harm that he seeks to avoid and
which cannot be undone by an acquittal. Pp. 175-177.

2. Under the framework of Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, and
Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, the Constitution permits the Government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to render a mentally ill defendant competent to stand trial on serious criminal charges
if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to
have side effects that may undermine the trial's fairness, and, taking
account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests. Pp. 177-183.

(a) This standard will permit forced medication solely for trial competence purposes in certain instances. But these instances may be
rare, because the standard says or fairly implies the following: First, a
court must find that important governmental interests are at stake.
The Government's interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of
a serious crime is important. However, courts must consider each
case's facts in evaluating this interest because special circumstances
may lessen its importance, e. g., a defendant's refusal to take drugs may
mean lengthy confinement in an institution, which would diminish the
risks of freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious
crime. In addition to its substantial interest in timely prosecution, the
Government has a concomitant interest in assuring a defendant a fair
trial. Second, the court must conclude that forced medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests. It must find that
medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to
stand trial and substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant's ability to assist counsel in conducting a defense. Third, the court must conclude that involuntary
medication is necessary to further those interests and find that alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the
same results. Fourth, the court must conclude that administering the
drugs is medically appropriate. Pp. 177-181.

(b) The court applying these standards is trying to determine
whether forced medication is necessary to further the Government's interest in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial. If a court
authorizes medication on an alternative ground, such as dangerousness,
the need to consider authorization on trial competence grounds will
likely disappear. There are often strong reasons for a court to consider
alternative grounds first. For one thing, the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render an individual nondangerous is usually
more objective and manageable than the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render a defendant competent. For another,

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
168 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
courts typically address involuntary medical treatment as a civil matter.
If a court decides that medication cannot be authorized on alternative
grounds, its findings will help to inform expert opinion and judicial decisionmaking in respect to a request to administer drugs for trial competence purposes. Pp. 181-183.

3. The Eighth Circuit erred in approving forced medication solely
to render Sell competent to stand trial. Because that court and the
District Court held the Magistrate's dangerousness finding clearly erroneous, this Court assumes that Sell was not dangerous. And on that
hypothetical assumption, the Eighth Circuit erred in reaching its conclusion. For one thing, the Magistrate did not find forced medication
legally justified on trial competence grounds alone. Moreover, the experts at the Magistrate's hearing focused mainly on dangerousness.
The failure to focus on trial competence could well have mattered, for
this Court cannot tell whether the medication's side effects were likely
to undermine the fairness of Sell's trial, a question not necessarily relevant when dangerousness is primarily at issue. Finally, the lower
courts did not consider that Sell has been confined at the Medical Center
for a long time, and that his refusal to be medicated might result in
further lengthy confinement. Those factors, the first because a defendant may receive credit toward a sentence for time served and the second
because it reduces the likelihood of the defendant's committing future
crimes, moderate the importance of the governmental interest in prosecution. The Government may pursue its forced medication request on
the grounds discussed in this Court's opinion but should do so based
on current circumstances, since Sell's condition may have changed over
time. Pp. 183-186.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether the Constitution per-mits the Government to administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily to a mentally ill criminal defendant--in order torender that defendant competent to stand trial for serious,
but nonviolent, crimes. We conclude that the Constitutionallows the Government to administer those drugs, even
against the defendant's will, in limited circumstances, i. e.,upon satisfaction of conditions that we shall describe. Because the Court of Appeals did not find that the requisitecircumstances existed in this case, we vacate its judgment.

Opinion of the Court
was again hospitalized and subsequently released. On vari-ous occasions, he complained that public officials, for example, a State Governor and a police chief, were trying to killhim.

Id., at 4. In April 1997, he told law enforcement personnel that he "spoke to God last night," and that "God toldme every [Federal Bureau of Investigation] person I kill, a

soul will be saved." Id., at 1.

In May 1997, the Government charged Sell with submit-ting fictitious insurance claims for payment. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 1035(a)(2). A Federal Magistrate Judge (Magistrate),after ordering a psychiatric examination, found Sell "currently competent," but noted that Sell might experience
"a psychotic episode" in the future. App. 321. The Magistrate released Sell on bail. A grand jury later produced a
superseding indictment charging Sell and his wife with 56
counts of mail fraud, 6 counts of Medicaid fraud, and 1 count
of money laundering. Id., at 12-22.

In early 1998, the Government claimed that Sell had
sought to intimidate a witness. The Magistrate held a bail
revocation hearing. Sell's behavior at his initial appearance
was, in the judge's words, " `totally out of control,' " involving
"screaming and shouting," the use of "personal insults" and
"racial epithets," and spitting "in the judge's face." Id., at
322. A psychiatrist reported that Sell could not sleep because he expected the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
to " `come busting through the door,' " and concluded that
Sell's condition had worsened. Ibid. After considering

that report and other testimony, the Magistrate revoked
Sell's bail.

In April 1998, the grand jury issued a new indictment
charging Sell with attempting to murder the FBI agent who
had arrested him and a former employee who planned to testify against him in the fraud case. Id., at 23-29. The attempted murder and fraud cases were joined for trial.

In early 1999, Sell asked the Magistrate to reconsider his
competence to stand trial. The Magistrate sent Sell to the

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (MedicalCenter) at Springfield, Missouri, for examination. Subsequently the Magistrate found that Sell was "mentally incom-petent to stand trial." Id., at 323. He ordered Sell to "be
hospitalized for treatment" at the Medical Center for up tofour months, "to determine whether there was a substantial
probability that [Sell] would attain the capacity to allow histrial to proceed."

Ibid.Two months later, Medical Center staff recommended that

Sell take antipsychotic medication. Sell refused to do so.The staff sought permission to administer the medication
against Sell's will. That effort is the subject of the presentproceedings.

B
We here review the last of five hierarchically orderedlower court and Medical Center determinations. First, in

June 1999, Medical Center staff sought permission from in-stitutional authorities to administer antipsychotic drugs to
Sell involuntarily. A reviewing psychiatrist held a hearingand considered Sell's prior history; Sell's current persecutional beliefs (for example, that Government officials weretrying to suppress his knowledge about events in Waco,
Texas, and had sent him to Alaska to silence him); staff medi-cal opinions (for example, that "Sell's symptoms point to a
diagnosis of Delusional Disorder but . . . there well may bean underlying Schizophrenic Process"); staff medical concerns (for example, about "the persistence of Dr. Sell's beliefthat the Courts, FBI, and federal government in general are
against him"); an outside medical expert's opinion (that Sellsuffered only from delusional disorder, which, in that expert's view, "medication rarely helps"); and Sell's own views,as well as those of other laypersons who know him (to the
effect that he did not suffer from a serious mental illness).Id., at 147-150.

The reviewing psychiatrist then authorized involuntaryadministration of the drugs, both (1) because Sell was "men539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
172 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
tally ill and dangerous, and medication is necessary to treatthe mental illness," and (2) so that Sell would "become competent for trial." Id., at 145. The reviewing psychiatristadded that he considered Sell "dangerous based on threats
and delusions if outside, but not necessarily in[side] prison"and that Sell was "[a]ble to function" in prison in the "open
population." Id., at 144.

Second, the Medical Center administratively reviewed thedetermination of its reviewing psychiatrist. A Bureau of

Prisons official considered the evidence that had been pre-sented at the initial hearing, referred to Sell's delusions,
noted differences of professional opinion as to proper classification and treatment, and concluded that antipsychotic
medication represents the medical intervention "most likely"
to "ameliorate" Sell's symptoms; that other "less restrictive
interventions" are "unlikely" to work; and that Sell's "pervasive belief " that he was "being targeted for nefarious
actions by various governmental . . . parties," along with
the "current charges of conspiracy to commit murder," made
Sell "a potential risk to the safety of one or more others
in the community." Id., at 154-155. The reviewing official "upheld" the "hearing officer's decision that [Sell] would
benefit from the utilization of anti-psychotic medication."
Id., at 157.

Third, in July 1999, Sell filed a court motion contesting the
Medical Center's right involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs. In September 1999, the Magistrate who had
ordered Sell sent to the Medical Center held a hearing. The
evidence introduced at the hearing for the most part replicated the evidence introduced at the administrative hearing,
with two exceptions. First, the witnesses explored the
question of the medication's effectiveness more thoroughly.
Second, Medical Center doctors testified about an incident that took place at the Medical Center after the
administrative proceedings were completed. In July 1999,
Sell had approached one of the Medical Center's nurses, sug539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

173Cite as: 539 U. S. 166 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
gested that he was in love with her, criticized her for havingnothing to do with him, and, when told that his behavior was

inappropriate, added " `I can't help it.' " Id., at 168-170, 325.He subsequently made remarks or acted in ways indicating
that this kind of conduct would continue. The Medical Cen-ter doctors testified that, given Sell's prior behavior, diagnosis, and current beliefs, boundary-breaching incidents of this
sort were not harmless and, when coupled with Sell's inabil-ity or unwillingness to desist, indicated that he was a safety

risk even within the institution. They added that he hadbeen moved to a locked cell.

In August 2000, the Magistrate found that "the government has made a substantial and very strong showing that
Dr. Sell is a danger to himself and others at the institution
in which he is currently incarcerated"; that "the government
has shown that anti-psychotic medication is the only way to
render him less dangerous"; that newer drugs and/or changing drugs will "ameliorat[e]" any "serious side effects"; that
"the benefits to Dr. Sell . . . far outweigh any risks"; and
that "there is a substantial probability that" the drugs will
"retur[n]" Sell "to competency." Id., at 333-334. The Magistrate concluded that "the government has shown in as
strong a manner as possible, that anti-psychotic medications
are the only way to render the defendant not dangerous and
competent to stand trial." Id., at 335. The Magistrate issued an order authorizing the involuntary administration of
antipsychotic drugs to Sell, id., at 331, but stayed that order
to allow Sell to appeal the matter to the Federal District
Court, id., at 337.

Fourth, the District Court reviewed the record and, in
April 2001, issued an opinion. The court addressed the
Magistrate's finding "that defendant presents a danger to
himself or others sufficient" to warrant involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs. Id., at 349. After noting
that Sell subsequently had "been returned to an open ward,"
the District Court held the Magistrate's "dangerousness"

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
finding "clearly erroneous." Id., at 349, and n. 5. The courtlimited its determination to Sell's "dangerousness

at this
time to himself and to those around him in his institutional
context." Id., at 349 (emphasis in original).

Nonetheless, the District Court affirmed the Magistrate'sorder permitting Sell's involuntary medication. The court

wrote that "anti-psychotic drugs are medically appropriate,"
that "they represent the only viable hope of rendering de-fendant competent to stand trial," and that "administration

of such drugs appears necessary to serve the government'scompelling interest in obtaining an adjudication of defendant's guilt or innocence of numerous and serious charges"
(including fraud and attempted murder). Id., at 354. The
court added that it was "premature" to consider whether
"the effects of medication might prejudice [Sell's] defense
at trial." Id., at 351, 352. The Government and Sell both
appealed.

Fifth, in March 2002, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. 282 F. 3d 560
(CA8). The majority affirmed the District Court's determination that Sell was not dangerous. The majority noted
that, according to the District Court, Sell's behavior at the
Medical Center "amounted at most to an `inappropriate familiarity and even infatuation' with a nurse." Id., at 565.
The Court of Appeals agreed, "[u]pon review," that "the evidence does not support a finding that Sell posed a danger to
himself or others at the Medical Center." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court's
order requiring medication in order to render Sell competent
to stand trial. Focusing solely on the serious fraud charges,
the panel majority concluded that the "government has an
essential interest in bringing a defendant to trial." Id., at
568. It added that the District Court "correctly concluded
that there were no less intrusive means." Ibid. After reviewing the conflicting views of the experts, id., at 568-571,
the panel majority found antipsychotic drug treatment "med539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

175Cite as: 539 U. S. 166 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
ically appropriate" for Sell, id., at 571. It added that the
"medical evidence presented indicated a reasonable probability that Sell will fairly be able to participate in his trial."
Id., at 572. One member of the panel dissented primarily
on the ground that the fraud and money laundering charges
were "not serious enough to warrant the forced medication
of the defendant." Id., at 574 (opinion of Bye, J.).

We granted certiorari to determine whether the Eighth
Circuit "erred in rejecting" Sell's argument that "allowing the government to administer antipsychotic medication
against his will solely to render him competent to stand trial
for non-violent offenses," Brief for Petitioner i, violated
the Constitution--in effect by improperly depriving Sell of
an important "liberty" that the Constitution guarantees,
Amdt. 5.

II

We first examine whether the Eighth Circuit had jurisdiction to decide Sell's appeal. The District Court's judgment,
from which Sell had appealed, was a pretrial order. That
judgment affirmed a Magistrate's order requiring Sell involuntarily to receive medication. The Magistrate entered
that order pursuant to an earlier delegation from the District
Court of legal authority to conduct pretrial proceedings.
App. 340; see 28 U. S. C. $ 636(b)(1)(A). The order embodied
legal conclusions related to the Medical Center's administrative efforts to medicate Sell; these efforts grew out of Sell's
provisional commitment; and that provisional commitment
took place pursuant to an earlier Magistrate's order seeking a medical determination about Sell's future competence
to stand trial. Cf. Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
(reviewing, as part of criminal proceeding, trial court's denial of defendant's motion to discontinue medication); Stack
v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1951) (district court's denial of defendant's motion to reduce bail is part of criminal proceeding
and is not reviewable in separate habeas action).

176 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
How was it possible for Sell to appeal from such an order?The law normally requires a defendant to wait until the end

of the trial to obtain appellate review of a pretrial order.The relevant jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, authorizes federal courts of appeals to review "final decisions ofthe district courts." (Emphasis added.) And the term
"final decision" normally refers to a final judgment, such as
a judgment of guilt, that terminates a criminal proceeding.Nonetheless, there are exceptions to this rule. The Court

has held that a preliminary or interim decision is appealableas a "collateral order" when it (1) "conclusively determine[s]
the disputed question," (2) "resolve[s] an important issue
completely separate from the merits of the action," and (3) is
"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978).
And this District Court order does appear to fall within the
"collateral order" exception.

The order (1) "conclusively determine[s] the disputed question," namely, whether Sell has a legal right to avoid forced
medication. Ibid. The order also (2) "resolve[s] an important issue," for, as this Court's cases make clear, involuntary
medical treatment raises questions of clear constitutional importance. Ibid. See Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753, 759
(1985) ("A compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's
body . . . implicates expectations of privacy and security" of
great magnitude); see also Riggins, supra, at 133-134; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278-279
(1990); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 221-222 (1990).
At the same time, the basic issue--whether Sell must undergo medication against his will--is "completely separate
from the merits of the action," i. e., whether Sell is guilty or
innocent of the crimes charged. Coopers & Lybrand, 437
U. S., at 468. The issue is wholly separate as well from
questions concerning trial procedures. Finally, the issue is
(3) "effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." Ibid. By the time of trial Sell will have undergone

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

177Cite as: 539 U. S. 166 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
forced medication--the very harm that he seeks to avoid.
He cannot undo that harm even if he is acquitted. Indeed,
if he is acquitted, there will be no appeal through which he
might obtain review. Cf. Stack, supra, at 6-7 (permitting
appeal of order setting high bail as "collateral order").
These considerations, particularly those involving the severity of the intrusion and corresponding importance of

the constitutional issue, readily distinguish Sell's case from
the examples raised by the dissent. See post, at 191-192
(opinion of Scalia, J.).

We add that the question presented here, whether Sell has
a legal right to avoid forced medication, perhaps in part because medication may make a trial unfair, differs from the
question whether forced medication did make a trial unfair.
The first question focuses upon the right to avoid administration of the drugs. What may happen at trial is relevant, but
only as a prediction. See infra, at 181. The second question focuses upon the right to a fair trial. It asks what did
happen as a result of having administered the medication.
An ordinary appeal comes too late for a defendant to enforce
the first right; an ordinary appeal permits vindication of
the second.

We conclude that the District Court order from which Sell
appealed was an appealable "collateral order." The Eighth
Circuit had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. And we consequently have jurisdiction to decide the question presented,
whether involuntary medication violates Sell's constitutional rights.

III

We turn now to the basic question presented: Does forced
administration of antipsychotic drugs to render Sell competent to stand trial unconstitutionally deprive him of his "liberty" to reject medical treatment? U. S. Const., Amdt. 5
(Federal Government may not "depriv[e]" any person of "liberty . . . without due process of law"). Two prior prece539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
178 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
dents, Harper, supra, and Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127(1992), set forth the framework for determining the legal

answer.In

Harper, this Court recognized that an individual has
a "significant" constitutionally protected "liberty interest"in "avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic

drugs." 494 U. S., at 221. The Court considered a state
law authorizing forced administration of those drugs "to in-mates who are . . . gravely disabled or represent a significant

danger to themselves or others." Id., at 226. The Statehad established "by a medical finding" that Harper, a mentally ill prison inmate, had "a mental disorder . . . which
is likely to cause harm if not treated." Id., at 222. The
treatment decision had been made "by a psychiatrist," it had
been approved by "a reviewing psychiatrist," and it "ordered" medication only because that was "in the prisoner's
medical interests, given the legitimate needs of his institutional confinement." Ibid.

The Court found that the State's interest in administering
medication was "legitima[te]" and "importan[t]," id., at 225;
and it held that "the Due Process Clause permits the State
to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness
with antipsychotic drugs against his will, if the inmate is
dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the
inmate's medical interest," id., at 227. The Court concluded
that, in the circumstances, the state law authorizing involuntary treatment amounted to a constitutionally permissible
"accommodation between an inmate's liberty interest in
avoiding the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs and
the State's interests in providing appropriate medical treatment to reduce the danger that an inmate suffering from
a serious mental disorder represents to himself or others."
Id., at 236.

In Riggins, the Court repeated that an individual has a
constitutionally protected liberty "interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs"--an interest

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

179Cite as: 539 U. S. 166 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
that only an "essential" or "overriding" state interest mightovercome. 504 U. S., at 134, 135. The Court suggested

that, in principle, forced medication in order to render a de-fendant competent to stand trial for murder was constitutionally permissible. The Court, citing Harper, noted thatthe State "would have satisfied due process if the prosecution
had demonstrated . . . that treatment with antipsychotic
medication was medically appropriate and, considering lessintrusive alternatives, essential for the sake of Riggins'

own
safety or the safety of others." 504 U. S., at 135 (emphasisadded). And it said that the State "

[s]imilarly . . . might
have been able to justify medically appropriate, involuntary
treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not
obtain an adjudication of Riggins' guilt or innocence" of the
murder charge "by using less intrusive means." Ibid. (emphasis added). Because the trial court had permitted forced
medication of Riggins without taking account of his "liberty
interest," with a consequent possibility of trial prejudice, the
Court reversed Riggins' conviction and remanded for further
proceedings. Id., at 137-138. Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment, emphasized that antipsychotic drugs
might have side effects that would interfere with the defendant's ability to receive a fair trial. Id., at 145 (finding
forced medication likely justified only where State shows
drugs would not significantly affect defendant's "behavior
and demeanor").

These two cases, Harper and Riggins, indicate that the
Constitution permits the Government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial, but only if the treatment is
medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side
effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial, and,
taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related
interests.

180 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
This standard will permit involuntary administration ofdrugs solely for trial competence purposes in certain instances. But those instances may be rare. That is becausethe standard says or fairly implies the following:

First, a court must find that important governmental in-terests are at stake. The Government's interest in bringing
to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important.
That is so whether the offense is a serious crime against theperson or a serious crime against property. In both instances the Government seeks to protect through applicationof the criminal law the basic human need for security. See
Riggins, supra, at 135-136 (" `[P]ower to bring an accused to
trial is fundamental to a scheme of "ordered liberty" and
prerequisite to social justice and peace' " (quoting Illinois v.
Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 347 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring))).

Courts, however, must consider the facts of the individual
case in evaluating the Government's interest in prosecution.
Special circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest. The defendant's failure to take drugs voluntarily, for
example, may mean lengthy confinement in an institution for
the mentally ill--and that would diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has
committed a serious crime. We do not mean to suggest that
civil commitment is a substitute for a criminal trial. The
Government has a substantial interest in timely prosecution.
And it may be difficult or impossible to try a defendant who
regains competence after years of commitment during which
memories may fade and evidence may be lost. The potential
for future confinement affects, but does not totally undermine, the strength of the need for prosecution. The same is
true of the possibility that the defendant has already been
confined for a significant amount of time (for which he would
receive credit toward any sentence ultimately imposed, see
18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b)). Moreover, the Government has a concomitant, constitutionally essential interest in assuring that
the defendant's trial is a fair one.

Opinion of the Court
Second, the court must conclude that involuntary medica-tion will

significantly further those concomitant state interests. It must find that administration of the drugs is sub-stantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand

trial. At the same time, it must find that administration ofthe drugs is substantially unlikely to have side effects that
will interfere significantly with the defendant's ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense, thereby renderingthe trial unfair. See

Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142-145 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).Third, the court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests. The court must
find that any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results. Cf. Brief
for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae
10-14 (nondrug therapies may be effective in restoring psychotic defendants to competence); but cf. Brief for American
Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 13-22 (alternative treatments for psychosis commonly not as effective
as medication). And the court must consider less intrusive
means for administering the drugs, e. g., a court order to the
defendant backed by the contempt power, before considering
more intrusive methods.

Fourth, as we have said, the court must conclude that administration of the drugs is medically appropriate, i. e., in
the patient's best medical interest in light of his medical
condition. The specific kinds of drugs at issue may matter
here as elsewhere. Different kinds of antipsychotic drugs
may produce different side effects and enjoy different levels
of success.

We emphasize that the court applying these standards is
seeking to determine whether involuntary administration of
drugs is necessary significantly to further a particular governmental interest, namely, the interest in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial. A court need not consider
whether to allow forced medication for that kind of purpose,

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
182 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
if forced medication is warranted for a different purpose,such as the purposes set out in

Harper related to the individual's dangerousness, or purposes related to the individual'sown interests where refusal to take drugs puts his health

gravely at risk. 494 U. S., at 225-226. There are oftenstrong reasons for a court to determine whether forced administration of drugs can be justified on these alternative
grounds before turning to the trial competence question.For one thing, the inquiry into whether medication is permissible, say, to render an individual nondangerous is usuallymore "objective and manageable" than the inquiry into
whether medication is permissible to render a defendant
competent. Riggins, supra, at 140 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The medical experts may find it easier
to provide an informed opinion about whether, given the
risk of side effects, particular drugs are medically appropriate and necessary to control a patient's potentially dangerous behavior (or to avoid serious harm to the patient himself) than to try to balance harms and benefits related to
the more quintessentially legal questions of trial fairness
and competence.

For another thing, courts typically address involuntary
medical treatment as a civil matter, and justify it on these
alternative, Harper-type grounds. Every State provides
avenues through which, for example, a doctor or institution
can seek appointment of a guardian with the power to make
a decision authorizing medication--when in the best interests of a patient who lacks the mental competence to make
such a decision. E. g., Ala. Code $$ 26-2A-102(a), 26-2A-
105, 26-2A-108 (West 1992); Alaska Stat. $$ 13.26.105(a),
13.26.116(b) (2002); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 14-5303, 14-5312
(West 1995); Ark. Code Ann. $$ 28-65-205, 28-65-301 (1987).
And courts, in civil proceedings, may authorize involuntary
medication where the patient's failure to accept treatment
threatens injury to the patient or others. See, e. g., 28 CFR

$ 549.43 (2002); cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 4246.

Opinion of the Court
If a court authorizes medication on these alternativegrounds, the need to consider authorization on trial competence grounds will likely disappear. Even if a court decidesmedication cannot be authorized on the alternative grounds,
the findings underlying such a decision will help to informexpert opinion and judicial decisionmaking in respect to a
request to administer drugs for trial competence purposes.At the least, they will facilitate direct medical and legal focus
upon such questions as: Why is it medically appropriate forc-ibly to administer antipsychotic drugs to an individual who
(1) is not dangerous and (2) is competent to make up his ownmind about treatment? Can bringing such an individual to
trial alone justify in whole (or at least in significant part)administration of a drug that may have adverse side effects,
including side effects that may to some extent impair a de-fense at trial? We consequently believe that a court, asked
to approve forced administration of drugs for purposes ofrendering a defendant competent to stand trial, should ordinarily determine whether the Government seeks, or has firstsought, permission for forced administration of drugs on
these other Harper-type grounds; and, if not, why not.When a court must nonetheless reach the trial competence
question, the factors discussed above, supra, at 180-181,should help it make the ultimate constitutionally required
judgment. Has the Government, in light of the efficacy, theside effects, the possible alternatives, and the medical appropriateness of a particular course of antipsychotic drug treat-ment, shown a need for that treatment sufficiently important
to overcome the individual's protected interest in refusing it?See Harper, supra, at 221-223; Riggins, supra, at 134-135.

IV
The Medical Center and the Magistrate in this case, apply-ing standards roughly comparable to those set forth here

and in Harper, approved forced medication substantially, ifnot primarily, upon grounds of Sell's dangerousness to oth539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
184 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ers. But the District Court and the Eighth Circuit took a
different approach. The District Court found "clearly erroneous" the Magistrate's conclusion regarding dangerousness,
and the Court of Appeals agreed. Both courts approved
forced medication solely in order to render Sell competent to
stand trial.

We shall assume that the Court of Appeals' conclusion
about Sell's dangerousness was correct. But we make that
assumption only because the Government did not contest,
and the parties have not argued, that particular matter. If
anything, the record before us, described in Part I, suggests
the contrary.

The Court of Appeals apparently agreed with the District
Court that "Sell's inappropriate behavior . . . amounted at
most to an `inappropriate familiarity and even infatuation'
with a nurse." 282 F. 3d, at 565. That being so, it also
agreed that "the evidence does not support a finding that
Sell posed a danger to himself or others at the Medical
Center." Ibid. The Court of Appeals, however, did not
discuss the potential differences (described by a psychiatrist
testifying before the Magistrate) between ordinary "overfamiliarity" and the same conduct engaged in persistently by
a patient with Sell's behavioral history and mental illness.
Nor did it explain why those differences should be minimized
in light of the fact that the testifying psychiatrists concluded
that Sell was dangerous, while Sell's own expert denied, not
Sell's dangerousness, but the efficacy of the drugs proposed
for treatment.

The District Court's opinion, while more thorough, places
weight upon the Medical Center's decision, taken after the
Magistrate's hearing, to return Sell to the general prison
population. It does not explain whether that return reflected an improvement in Sell's condition or whether the
Medical Center saw it as permanent rather than temporary.
Cf. Harper, supra, at 227, and n. 10 (indicating that physical

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

185Cite as: 539 U. S. 166 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
restraints and seclusion often not acceptable substitutes for
medication).

Regardless, as we have said, we must assume that Sell was
not dangerous. And on that hypothetical assumption, we
find that the Court of Appeals was wrong to approve forced
medication solely to render Sell competent to stand trial.
For one thing, the Magistrate's opinion makes clear that he
did not find forced medication legally justified on trial competence grounds alone. Rather, the Magistrate concluded
that Sell was dangerous, and he wrote that forced medication
was "the only way to render the defendant not dangerous
and competent to stand trial." App. 335 (emphasis added).

Moreover, the record of the hearing before the Magistrate
shows that the experts themselves focused mainly upon
the dangerousness issue. Consequently the experts did not
pose important questions--questions, for example, about
trial-related side effects and risks--the answers to which
could have helped determine whether forced medication was
warranted on trial competence grounds alone. Rather, the
Medical Center's experts conceded that their proposed medications had "significant" side effects and that "there has
to be a cost benefit analysis." Id., at 185 (testimony of
Dr. DeMier); id., at 236 (testimony of Dr. Wolfson). And in
making their "cost-benefit" judgments, they primarily took
into account Sell's dangerousness, not the need to bring him
to trial.

The failure to focus upon trial competence could well have
mattered. Whether a particular drug will tend to sedate a
defendant, interfere with communication with counsel, prevent rapid reaction to trial developments, or diminish the
ability to express emotions are matters important in determining the permissibility of medication to restore competence, Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142-145 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), but not necessarily relevant when
dangerousness is primarily at issue. We cannot tell whether

539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
186 SELL v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
the side effects of antipsychotic medication were likely toundermine the fairness of a trial in Sell's case.

Finally, the lower courts did not consider that Sell has al-ready been confined at the Medical Center for a long period
of time, and that his refusal to take antipsychotic drugsmight result in further lengthy confinement. Those factors,
the first because a defendant ordinarily receives credit to-ward a sentence for time served, 18 U. S. C. $ 3585(b), and the
second because it reduces the likelihood of the defendant'scommitting future crimes, moderate--though they do not
eliminate--the importance of the governmental interest inprosecution. See

supra, at 180.

V
For these reasons, we believe that the present orders au-thorizing forced administration of antipsychotic drugs cannot

stand. The Government may pursue its request for forcedmedication on the grounds discussed in this opinion, including grounds related to the danger Sell poses to himself orothers. Since Sell's medical condition may have changed
over time, the Government should do so on the basis of cur-rent circumstances.

The judgment of the Eighth Circuit is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The District Court never entered a final judgment in thiscase, which should have led the Court of Appeals to wonder

whether it had any business entertaining petitioner's appeal.Instead, without so much as acknowledging that Congress
has limited court-of-appeals jurisdiction to "appeals from allfinal decisions of the district courts of the United States,"
28 U. S. C. $ 1291 (emphasis added), and appeals from certainspecified interlocutory orders, see $ 1292, the Court of Ap539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

peals proceeded to the merits of Sell's interlocutory appeal.282 F. 3d 560 (CA8 2002). Perhaps this failure to discuss

jurisdiction was attributable to the United States' refusal tocontest the point there (as it has refused here, see Brief for
United States 10, n. 5), or to the panel's unexpressed agree-ment with the conclusion reached by other Courts of Appeals, that pretrial forced-medication orders are appealableunder the "collateral order doctrine," see,

e. g., United Statesv. Morgan, 193 F. 3d 252, 258-259 (CA4 1999); United States

v. Brandon, 158 F. 3d 947, 950-951 (CA6 1998). But thisCourt's cases do not authorize appeal from the District
Court's April 4, 2001, order, which was neither a "final deci-sion" under $ 1291 nor part of the class of specified interlocutory orders in $ 1292. We therefore lack jurisdiction, and Iwould vacate the Court of Appeals' decision and remand with
instructions to dismiss. I

After petitioner's indictment, a Magistrate Judge foundthat petitioner was incompetent to stand trial because he
was unable to understand the nature and consequences ofthe proceedings against him and to assist in his defense. As
required by 18 U. S. C. $ 4241(d), the Magistrate Judge com-mitted petitioner to the custody of the Attorney General, and
petitioner was hospitalized to determine whether there wasa substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he
would attain the capacity to stand trial. On June 9, 1999, areviewing psychiatrist determined, after a $ 549.43 administrative hearing,1 that petitioner should be required to take

1 Title 28 CFR $ 549.43 (2002) provides the standards and procedures
used to determine whether a person in the custody of the Attorney General may be involuntarily medicated. Before that can be done, a reviewing psychiatrist must determine that it is "necessary in order to attempt
to make the inmate competent for trial or is necessary because the inmate
is dangerous to self or others, is gravely disabled, or is unable to function
in the open population of a mental health referral center or a regular
prison," $ 549.43(a)(5).

antipsychotic medication, finding the medication necessary torender petitioner competent for trial and medically appropriate to treat his mental illness. Petitioner's administra-tive appeal from that decision

2 was denied with a written

statement of reasons.At that point the Government possessed the requisite

authority to administer forced medication. Petitioner re-sponded, not by appealing to the courts the $ 549.43 administrative determination, see 5 U. S. C. $ 702, but by movingin the District Court overseeing his criminal prosecution for
a hearing regarding the appropriateness of his medication.A Magistrate Judge granted the motion and held a hearing.
The Government then requested from the Magistrate Judgean order authorizing the involuntary medication of petitioner, which the Magistrate Judge entered.3 On April 4,2001, the District Court affirmed this Magistrate Judge's
order, and it is from this order that petitioner appealed tothe Eighth Circuit.

II

A
Petitioner and the United States maintain that 28 U. S. C.$ 1291, which permits the courts of appeals to review "all

2 Section 549.43(a)(6) provides: "The inmate . . . may submit an appeal to
the institution mental health division administrator regarding the decision
within 24 hours of the decision and . . . the administrator shall review the
decision within 24 hours of the inmate's appeal."

3 It is not apparent why this order was necessary, since the Government

had already received authorization to medicate petitioner pursuant to

$ 549.43. If the Magistrate Judge had denied the Government's motion
(or if this Court were to reverse the Magistrate Judge's order) the Bureau
of Prisons' administrative decision ordering petitioner's forcible medication would remain in place. Which is to suggest that, in addition to the
jurisdictional defect of interlocutoriness to which my opinion is addressed,
there may be no jurisdiction because, at the time this suit was filed, petitioner failed to meet the "remediability" requirement of Article III standing. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83 (1998).
The Court of Appeals should address this jurisdictional issue on remand.

final decisions of the district courts of the United States"(emphasis added), allowed the Court of Appeals to review

the District Court's April 4, 2001, order. We have described$ 1291, however, as a "final judgment rule," Flanagan v.
United States, 465 U. S. 259, 263 (1984), which "[i]n a criminalcase . . . prohibits appellate review until conviction and
imposition of sentence," ibid. (emphasis added). See also
Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656-657 (1977). Wehave invented

4 a narrow exception to this statutory command: the so-called "collateral order" doctrine, which per-mits appeal of district court orders that (1) "conclusively determine the disputed question," (2) "resolve an importantissue completely separate from the merits of the action," and
(3) are "effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judg-ment." Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468
(1978). But the District Court's April 4, 2001, order fails tosatisfy the third requirement of this test.

Our decision in Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127 (1992),demonstrates that the District Court's April 4, 2001, order
is reviewable on appeal from conviction and sentence. Thedefendant in

Riggins had been involuntarily medicated whilea pretrial detainee, and he argued, on appeal from his murder conviction, that the State of Nevada had contravenedthe substantive-due-process standards set forth in Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990). Rather than holdingthat review of this claim was not possible on appeal from a
criminal conviction, the Riggins Court held that forced medi-cation of a criminal defendant that fails to comply with
Harper creates an unacceptable risk of trial error and enti-tles the defendant to automatic vacatur of his conviction.
504 U. S., at 135-138. The Court is therefore wrong to saythat "[a]n ordinary appeal comes too late for a defendant to
enforce" this right, ante, at 177, and appellate review of anysubstantive-due-process challenge to the District Court's

4 I use the term "invented" advisedly. The statutory text provides no
basis.

April 4, 2001, order must wait until after conviction and sen-tence have been imposed.

5

It is true that, if petitioner must wait until final judgmentto appeal, he will not receive the

type of remedy he would
prefer--a predeprivation injunction rather than the postdep-rivation vacatur of conviction provided by

Riggins. But
that ground for interlocutory appeal is emphatically rejected
by our cases. See, e. g., Flanagan, supra (disallowing inter-locutory appeal of an order disqualifying defense counsel);

United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U. S. 263(1982)

(per curiam) (disallowing interlocutory appeal of an
order denying motion to dismiss indictment on grounds ofprosecutorial vindictiveness);

Carroll v. United States, 354
U. S. 394 (1957) (disallowing interlocutory appeal of an orderdenying motion to suppress evidence).

We have until today interpreted the collateral-order ex-ception to $ 1291 " `with the

utmost strictness' " in criminal
cases. Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U. S.
794, 799 (1989) (emphasis added). In the 54 years since we
invented the exception, see Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial
Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), we have found only three
types of prejudgment orders in criminal cases appealable:
denials of motions to reduce bail, Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1
(1951), denials of motions to dismiss on double-jeopardy
grounds, Abney, supra, and denials of motions to dismiss
under the Speech or Debate Clause, Helstoski v. Meanor, 442
U. S. 500 (1979). The first of these exceptions was justified
on the ground that the denial of a motion to reduce bail becomes moot (and thus effectively unreviewable) on appeal

5 To be sure, the order here is unreviewable after final judgment if the
defendant is acquitted. But the "unreviewability" leg of our collateralorder doctrine--which, as it is framed, requires that the interlocutory
order be "effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,"
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978) (emphasis
added)--is not satisfied by the possibility that the aggrieved party will
have no occasion to appeal.

from conviction. See Flanagan, supra, at 266. As Rigginsdemonstrates, that is not the case here. The interlocutory

appeals in Abney and Helstoski were justified on the groundthat it was appropriate to interrupt the trial when the precise right asserted was the right not to be tried. See Abney,supra, at 660-661; Helstoski, supra, at 507-508. Petitioner
does not assert a right not to be tried, but a right not tobe

medicated. B

Today's narrow holding will allow criminal defendants inpetitioner's position to engage in opportunistic behavior.
They can, for example, voluntarily take their medicationuntil halfway through trial, then abruptly refuse and demand
an interlocutory appeal from the order that medication con-tinue on a compulsory basis. This sort of concern for the
disruption of criminal proceedings--strangely missing fromthe Court's discussion today--is what has led us to state
many times that we interpret the collateral-order exceptionnarrowly in criminal cases. See Midland Asphalt Corp.,
supra, at 799; Flanagan, 465 U. S., at 264.But the adverse effects of today's narrow holding are as
nothing compared to the adverse effects of the new rule oflaw that underlies the holding. The Court's opinion announces that appellate jurisdiction is proper because reviewafter conviction and sentence will come only after "Sell will
have undergone forced medication--the very harm that heseeks to avoid."

Ante, at 176-177. This analysis effects abreathtaking expansion of appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory orders. If it is applied faithfully (and some appel-late panels will be eager to apply it faithfully), any criminal
defendant who asserts that a trial court order will, if imple-mented, cause an immediate violation of his constitutional
(or perhaps even statutory?) rights may immediately appeal.He is empowered to hold up the trial for months by claiming
that review after final judgment "would come too late" toprevent the violation. A trial-court order requiring the de539US1 Unit: $U74 [05-03-05 21:40:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
fendant to wear an electronic bracelet could be attacked asan immediate infringement of the constitutional right to

"bodily integrity"; an order refusing to allow the defendantto wear a T-shirt that says "Black Power" in front of the
jury could be attacked as an immediate violation of FirstAmendment rights; and an order compelling testimony could
be attacked as an immediate denial of Fifth Amendment
rights. All these orders would be immediately appealable.
Flanagan and Carroll, which held that appellate review
of orders that might infringe a defendant's constitutionallyprotected rights

still had to wait until final judgment,
are seemingly overruled. The narrow gate of entry to the
collateral-order doctrine--hitherto traversable by only (1)
orders unreviewable on appeal from judgment and (2) orders
denying an asserted right not to be tried--has been generously widened.

The Court dismisses these concerns in a single sentence
immediately following its assertion that the order here
meets the three Cohen-exception requirements of (1) conclusively determining the disputed question (correct); (2) resolving an important issue separate from the merits of the
action (correct); and (3) being unreviewable on appeal (quite
plainly incorrect). That sentence reads as follows: "These
considerations, particularly those involving the severity of
the intrusion and corresponding importance of the constitutional issue, readily distinguish Sell's case from the examples
raised by the dissent." Ante, at 177. That is a brand new
consideration put forward in rebuttal, not at all discussed in
the body of the Court's analysis, which relies on the ground
that (contrary to my contention) this order is not reviewable
on appeal. The Court's last-minute addition must mean
that it is revising the Cohen test, to dispense with the third
requirement (unreviewable on appeal) only when the important separate issue in question involves a "severe intrusion"
and hence an "important constitutional issue." Of course
I welcome this narrowing of a misguided revision--but I still

would not favor the revision, not only because it is a noveltywith no basis in our prior opinions, but also because of the

uncertainty, and the obvious opportunity for gamesmanship,that the revision-as-narrowed produces. If, however, I did
make this more limited addition to the textually unsupportedCohen doctrine, I would at least do so in an undisguised
fashion. * * *

Petitioner could have obtained pre-trial review of the$ 549.43 medication order by filing suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 551 et seq., or even by filinga

Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.388 (1971), action, which is available to federal pretrial detainees challenging the conditions of their confinement, see,e. g., Lyons v. United States Marshals, 840 F. 2d 202 (CA3
1987). In such a suit, he could have obtained immediate ap-pellate review of denial of relief.

6 But if he chooses to challenge his forced medication in the context of a criminal trial,he must abide by the limitations attached to such a challenge--which prevent him from stopping the proceedings intheir tracks. Petitioner's mistaken litigation strategy, and
this Court's desire to decide an interesting constitutionalissue, do not justify a disregard of the limits that Congress
has imposed on courts of appeals' (and our own) jurisdiction.We should vacate the judgment here, and remand the case
to the Court of Appeals with instructions to dismiss.

6 Petitioner points out that there are disadvantages to such an approach--for example, lack of constitutional entitlement to appointed counsel in a Bivens action. That does not entitle him or us to disregard the
limits on appellate jurisdiction.

appeal from the united states district court for theeastern district of pennsylvania

No. 02-361. Argued March 5, 2003--Decided June 23, 2003
Two forms of federal assistance help public libraries provide patrons with

Internet access: discounted rates under the E-rate program and grants
under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). Upon discovering that library patrons, including minors, regularly search the
Internet for pornography and expose others to pornographic images by
leaving them displayed on Internet terminals or printed at library printers, Congress enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA),
which forbids public libraries to receive federal assistance for Internet
access unless they install software to block obscene or pornographic
images and to prevent minors from accessing material harmful to them.
Appellees, a group of libraries, patrons, Web site publishers, and related
parties, sued the Government, challenging the constitutionality of
CIPA's filtering provisions. Ruling that CIPA is facially unconstitutional and enjoining the Government from withholding federal assistance for failure to comply with CIPA, the District Court held, inter alia,
that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Spending Clause
because any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will
necessarily violate the First Amendment; that the CIPA filtering software constitutes a content-based restriction on access to a public forum
that is subject to strict scrutiny; and that, although the Government has
a compelling interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child
pornography, or material harmful to minors, the use of software filters
is not narrowly tailored to further that interest.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
201 F. Supp. 2d 401, reversed.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justice O'Connor, Justice
Scalia, and Justice Thomas, concluded:

1. Because public libraries' use of Internet filtering software does not
violate their patrons' First Amendment rights, CIPA does not induce

spending power. Congress has wide latitude to attach conditions to the

210. To determine whether libraries would violate the First Amendment by employing the CIPA filtering software, the Court must first
examine their societal role. To fulfill their traditional missions of facilitating learning and cultural enrichment, public libraries must have
broad discretion to decide what material to provide to their patrons.
This Court has held in two analogous contexts that the Government
has broad discretion to make content-based judgments in deciding what
private speech to make available to the public. Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 672-674; National Endowment
for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 585-586. Just as forum analysis and
heightened judicial scrutiny were incompatible with the role of public
television stations in the former case and the role of the National Endowment for the Arts in the latter, so are they incompatible with the
broad discretion that public libraries must have to consider content in
making collection decisions. Thus, the public forum principles on which
the District Court relied are out of place in the context of this case.
Internet access in public libraries is neither a "traditional" nor a "designated" public forum. See, e. g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &
Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802-803. Unlike the "Student Activity
Fund" at issue in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,
515 U. S. 819, 834, Internet terminals are not acquired by a library in
order to create a public forum for Web publishers to express themselves.
Rather, a library provides such access for the same reasons it offers
other library resources: to facilitate research, learning, and recreational
pursuits by furnishing materials of requisite and appropriate quality.
The fact that a library reviews and affirmatively chooses to acquire
every book in its collection, but does not review every Web site that
it makes available, is not a constitutionally relevant distinction. The
decisions by most libraries to exclude pornography from their print collections are not subjected to heightened scrutiny; it would make little
sense to treat libraries' judgments to block online pornography any differently. Moreover, because of the vast quantity of material on the Internet and the rapid pace at which it changes, libraries cannot possibly
segregate, item by item, all the Internet material that is appropriate for
inclusion from all that is not. While a library could limit its Internet
collection to just those sites it found worthwhile, it could do so only at
the cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that
it lacks the capacity to review. Given that tradeoff, it is entirely reasonable for public libraries to reject that approach and instead exclude certain categories of content, without making individualized judgments
that everything made available has requisite and appropriate quality.
Concerns over filtering software's tendency to erroneously "overblock"
access to constitutionally protected speech that falls outside the catego539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ries software users intend to block are dispelled by the ease with which
patrons may have the filtering software disabled. Pp. 203-209.

2. CIPA does not impose an unconstitutional condition on libraries
that receive E-rate and LSTA subsidies by requiring them, as a condition on that receipt, to surrender their First Amendment right to provide the public with access to constitutionally protected speech. Assuming that appellees may assert an "unconstitutional conditions" claim,
that claim would fail on the merits. When the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program, it is entitled to broadly define that program's limits. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 194. As in
Rust, the Government here is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is
instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for the purpose for
which they are authorized: helping public libraries fulfill their traditional role of obtaining material of requisite and appropriate quality
for educational and informational purposes. Especially because public
libraries have traditionally excluded pornographic material from their
other collections, Congress could reasonably impose a parallel limitation
on its Internet assistance programs. As the use of filtering software
helps to carry out these programs, it is a permissible condition under
Rust. Appellees mistakenly contend, in reliance on Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 542-543, that CIPA's filtering conditions distort the usual functioning of public libraries. In contrast to the
lawyers who furnished legal aid to the indigent under the program at
issue in Velazquez, public libraries have no role that pits them against
the Government, and there is no assumption, as there was in that case,
that they must be free of any conditions that their benefactors might
attach to the use of donated funds. Pp. 210-214.

Justice Kennedy concluded that if, as the Government represents,
a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software
filter without significant delay on an adult user's request, there is little
to this case. There are substantial Government interests at stake here:
The interest in protecting young library users from material inappropriate for minors is legitimate, and even compelling, as all Members of the
Court appear to agree. Given this interest, and the failure to show that
adult library users' access to the material is burdened in any significant
degree, the statute is not unconstitutional on its face. If some libraries
do not have the capacity to unblock specific Web sites or to disable the
filter or if it is shown that an adult user's election to view constitutionally protected Internet material is burdened in some other substantial
way, that would be the subject for an as-applied challenge, not this facial
challenge. Pp. 214-215.

Justice Breyer agreed that the "public forum" doctrine is inapplicable here and that the statute's filtering software provisions do not vio539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
late the First Amendment, but would reach that ultimate conclusion
through a different approach. Because the statute raises special First
Amendment concerns, he would not require only a "rational basis" for
the statute's restrictions. At the same time, "strict scrutiny" is not
warranted, for such a limiting and rigid test would unreasonably interfere with the discretion inherent in the "selection" of a library's collection. Rather, he would examine the constitutionality of the statute's
restrictions as the Court has examined speech-related restrictions in
other contexts where circumstances call for heightened, but not "strict,"
scrutiny--where, for example, complex, competing constitutional interests are potentially at issue or speech-related harm is potentially justified by unusually strong governmental interests. The key question in
such instances is one of proper fit. The Court has asked whether the
harm to speech-related interests is disproportionate in light of both the
justifications and the potential alternatives. It has considered the legitimacy of the statute's objective, the extent to which the statute will
tend to achieve that objective, whether there are other, less restrictive
ways of achieving that objective, and ultimately whether the statute
works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to that objective.
The statute's restrictions satisfy these constitutional demands. Its objectives--of restricting access to obscenity, child pornography, and material that is comparably harmful to minors--are "legitimate," and
indeed often "compelling." No clearly superior or better fitting alternative to Internet software filters has been presented. Moreover,
the statute contains an important exception that limits the speechrelated harm: It allows libraries to permit any adult patron access to an
"overblocked" Web site or to disable the software filter entirely upon
request. Given the comparatively small burden imposed upon library
patrons seeking legitimate Internet materials, it cannot be said that any
speech-related harm that the statute may cause is disproportionate
when considered in relation to the statute's legitimate objectives.

the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), 114 Stat.2763A-335. Under CIPA, a public library may not receive

federal assistance to provide Internet access unless it installssoftware to block images that constitute obscenity or child
pornography, and to prevent minors from obtaining access tomaterial that is harmful to them. The District Court held
these provisions facially invalid on the ground that they induce public libraries to violate patrons' First Amendmentrights. We now reverse.

To help public libraries provide their patrons with In-ternet access, Congress offers two forms of federal assistance. First, the E-rate program established by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 entitles qualifying libraries to
buy Internet access at a discount. 110 Stat. 71, 47 U. S. C.

$ 254(h)(1)(B). In the year ending June 30, 2002, libraries
received $58.5 million in such discounts. Redacted Joint

the Institute of Museum and Library Services makes grants

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
By connecting to the Internet, public libraries provide pa-trons with a vast amount of valuable information. But there

is also an enormous amount of pornography on the Internet,much of which is easily obtained. 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 419
(ED Pa. 2002). The accessibility of this material has createdserious problems for libraries, which have found that patrons
of all ages, including minors, regularly search for online por-nography.

Id., at 406. Some patrons also expose others topornographic images by leaving them displayed on Internet

terminals or printed at library printers. Id., at 423.Upon discovering these problems, Congress became concerned that the E-rate and LSTA programs were facilitat-ing access to illegal and harmful pornography. S. Rep.
No. 105-226, p. 5 (1998). Congress learned that adults "us[e]library computers to access pornography that is then exposed to staff, passersby, and children," and that "minorsacces[s] child and adult pornography in libraries."

1

But Congress also learned that filtering software thatblocks access to pornographic Web sites could provide a reasonably effective way to prevent such uses of library re-sources.

Id., at 20-26. By 2000, before Congress enactedCIPA, almost 17% of public libraries used such software on

at least some of their Internet terminals, and 7% had filterson all of them. Library Research Center of U. Ill., Survey

set such software to block categories of material, such as"Pornography" or "Violence." 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 428.

When a patron tries to view a site that falls within such acategory, a screen appears indicating that the site is blocked.
Id., at 429. But a filter set to block pornography may some-times block other sites that present neither obscene nor pornographic material, but that nevertheless trigger the filter.
To minimize this problem, a library can set its software toprevent the blocking of material that falls into categories

like "Education," "History," and "Medical." Id., at 428-429.A library may also add or delete specific sites from a blocking
category, id., at 429, and anyone can ask companies that furnish filtering software to unblock particular sites, id., at 430.

Responding to this information, Congress enacted CIPA.
It provides that a library may not receive E-rate or LSTA
assistance unless it has "a policy of Internet safety for minors that includes the operation of a technology protection
measure . . . that protects against access" by all persons to
"visual depictions" that constitute "obscen[ity]" or "child pornography," and that protects against access by minors to
"visual depictions" that are "harmful to minors." 20 U. S. C.

$$ 9134(f )(1)(A)(i) and (B)(i); 47 U. S. C. $$ 254(h)(6)(B)(i) and
(C)(i). The statute defines a "[t]echnology protection measure" as "a specific technology that blocks or filters Internet
access to material covered by" CIPA. $ 254(h)(7)(I). CIPA
also permits the library to "disable" the filter "to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes." 20
U. S. C. $ 9134(f )(3); 47 U. S. C. $ 254(h)(6)(D). Under the Erate program, disabling is permitted "during use by an
adult." $ 254(h)(6)(D). Under the LSTA program, disabling is permitted during use by any person. 20 U. S. C.

sued the United States and the Government agencies andofficials responsible for administering the E-rate and LSTA

programs in District Court, challenging the constitutionalityof CIPA's filtering provisions. A three-judge District Court
convened pursuant to $ 1741(a) of CIPA, 114 Stat. 2763A-351,note following 20 U. S. C. $ 7001.

After a trial, the District Court ruled that CIPA was facially unconstitutional and enjoined the relevant agenciesand officials from withholding federal assistance for failure

to comply with CIPA. The District Court held that Con-gress had exceeded its authority under the Spending Clause,
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, because, in the court's view,
"any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will
necessarily violate the First Amendment." 201 F. Supp. 2d,
at 453. The court acknowledged that "generally the First
Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about
which print materials to acquire for their collections to only
rational [basis] review." Id., at 462. But it distinguished
libraries' decisions to make certain Internet material inaccessible. "The central difference," the court stated, "is that
by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the
library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number
of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to
speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional
judgment, determines to be particularly valuable." Ibid.
Reasoning that "the provision of Internet access within a
public library . . . is for use by the public . . . for expressive
activity," the court analyzed such access as a "designated
public forum." Id., at 457 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted). The District Court also likened Internet
access in libraries to "traditional public fora . . . such as sidewalks and parks" because it "promotes First Amendment
values in an analogous manner." Id., at 466.

Based on both of these grounds, the court held that the
filtering software contemplated by CIPA was a content539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
based restriction on access to a public forum, and was there-fore subject to strict scrutiny. Ibid. Applying this standard, the District Court held that, although the Governmenthas a compelling interest "in preventing the dissemination of
obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, mate-rial harmful to minors," id., at 471, the use of software filters
is not narrowly tailored to further those interests, id., at 479.We noted probable jurisdiction, 537 U. S. 1017 (2002), and

Amendment by employing the filtering software that CIPArequires,

2 we must first examine the role of libraries in our

society.Public libraries pursue the worthy missions of facilitating

learning and cultural enrichment. Appellee ALA's LibraryBill of Rights states that libraries should provide "[b]ooks

2 Justice Stevens misapprehends the analysis we must perform to determine whether CIPA exceeds Congress' authority under the Spending
Clause. He asks and answers whether it is constitutional for Congress
to "impose [CIPA's filtering] requirement" on public libraries, instead of
"allowing local decisionmakers to tailor their responses to local problems."
Post, at 220 (dissenting opinion). But under our well-established Spending Clause precedent, that is not the proper inquiry. Rather, as the District Court correctly recognized, 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 453 (ED Pa. 2002),
we must ask whether the condition that Congress requires "would . . . be
unconstitutional" if performed by the library itself. Dole, 483 U. S.,
at 210.

CIPA does not directly regulate private conduct; rather, Congress has
exercised its Spending Power by specifying conditions on the receipt of
federal funds. Therefore, Dole provides the appropriate framework for
assessing CIPA's constitutionality.

serves." 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 420 (internal quotation marks
omitted). To fulfill their traditional missions, public libraries must have broad discretion to decide what material to
provide to their patrons. Although they seek to provide a
wide array of information, their goal has never been to provide "universal coverage." Id., at 421. Instead, public libraries seek to provide materials "that would be of the
greatest direct benefit or interest to the community." Ibid.
To this end, libraries collect only those materials deemed to
have "requisite and appropriate quality." Ibid. See W.
Katz, Collection Development: The Selection of Materials for
Libraries 6 (1980) ("The librarian's responsibility . . . is to
separate out the gold from the garbage, not to preserve everything"); F. Drury, Book Selection xi (1930) ("[I]t is the
aim of the selector to give the public, not everything it
wants, but the best that it will read or use to advantage");
App. 636 (Rebuttal Expert Report of Donald G. Davis, Jr.)
("A hypothetical collection of everything that has been produced is not only of dubious value, but actually detrimental to users trying to find what they want to find and really
need").

We have held in two analogous contexts that the government has broad discretion to make content-based judgments
in deciding what private speech to make available to the public. In Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U. S.
666, 672-673 (1998), we held that public forum principles do
not generally apply to a public television station's editorial
judgments regarding the private speech it presents to its
viewers. "[B]road rights of access for outside speakers
would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that
stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their
journalistic purpose and statutory obligations." Id., at 673.
Recognizing a broad right of public access "would [also] risk
implicating the courts in judgments that should be left to
the exercise of journalistic discretion." Id., at 674.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Similarly, in National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524U. S. 569 (1998), we upheld an art funding program that required the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to usecontent-based criteria in making funding decisions. We explained that "[a]ny content-based considerations that may betaken into account in the grant-making process are a consequence of the nature of arts funding." Id., at 585. In particular, "[t]he very assumption of the NEA is that grantswill be awarded according to the `artistic worth of competing

applicants,' and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable."
Ibid. (some internal quotation marks omitted). We expressly declined to apply forum analysis, reasoning that it
would conflict with "NEA's mandate . . . to make esthetic
judgments, and the inherently content-based `excellence'
threshold for NEA support." Id., at 586.

The principles underlying Forbes and Finley also apply to
a public library's exercise of judgment in selecting the material it provides to its patrons. Just as forum analysis and
heightened judicial scrutiny are incompatible with the role
of public television stations and the role of the NEA, they
are also incompatible with the discretion that public libraries
must have to fulfill their traditional missions. Public library
staffs necessarily consider content in making collection decisions and enjoy broad discretion in making them.

The public forum principles on which the District Court
relied, 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 457-470, are out of place in the
context of this case. Internet access in public libraries is
neither a "traditional" nor a "designated" public forum. See
Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473
U. S. 788, 802 (1985) (describing types of forums). First, this
resource--which did not exist until quite recently--has not
"immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public
and, time out of mind, . . . been used for purposes of assembly,
communication of thoughts between citizens, and discussing
public questions." International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 679 (1992) (internal quo539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tation marks omitted). We have "rejected the view thattraditional public forum status extends beyond its historic

confines." Forbes, supra, at 678. The doctrines surround-ing traditional public forums may not be extended to situations where such history is lacking.Nor does Internet access in a public library satisfy our
definition of a "designated public forum." To create such a
forum, the government must make an affirmative choice toopen up its property for use as a public forum.

Cornelius,
supra, at 802-803; Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). "The government does
not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse." Cornelius, supra,
at 802. The District Court likened public libraries' Internet
terminals to the forum at issue in Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). 201 F. Supp.
2d, at 465. In Rosenberger, we considered the "Student Activity Fund" established by the University of Virginia that
subsidized all manner of student publications except those
based on religion. We held that the fund had created a limited public forum by giving public money to student groups
who wished to publish, and therefore could not discriminate
on the basis of viewpoint.

The situation here is very different. A public library does
not acquire Internet terminals in order to create a public
forum for Web publishers to express themselves, any more
than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for
the authors of books to speak. It provides Internet access,
not to "encourage a diversity of views from private speakers," Rosenberger, supra, at 834, but for the same reasons it
offers other library resources: to facilitate research, learning,
and recreational pursuits by furnishing materials of requisite
and appropriate quality. See Cornelius, supra, at 805 (noting, in upholding limits on participation in the Combined
Federal Campaign (CFC), that "[t]he Government did not

create the CFC for purposes of providing a forum for expres-sive activity"). As Congress recognized, "[t]he Internet is

simply another method for making information available ina school or library." S. Rep. No. 106-141, p. 7 (1999). It is
"no more than a technological extension of the book stack."Ibid.

The District Court disagreed because, whereas a libraryreviews and affirmatively chooses to acquire every book in

its collection, it does not review every Web site that it makesavailable. 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 462-463. Based on this distinction, the court reasoned that a public library enjoys lessdiscretion in deciding which Internet materials to make

3 Even if appellees had proffered more persuasive evidence that public
libraries intended to create a forum for speech by connecting to the Internet, we would hesitate to import "the public forum doctrine . . . wholesale into" the context of the Internet. Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 749 (1996) (opinion of
Breyer, J.). "[W]e are wary of the notion that a partial analogy in one
context, for which we have developed doctrines, can compel a full range
of decisions in such a new and changing area." Ibid.

The dissents agree with the District Court that less restrictive alternatives to filtering software would suffice to meet Congress' goals. Post, at
223 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (quoting 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 410); post, at 234
(opinion of Souter, J.) (quoting 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 422-427). But we
require the Government to employ the least restrictive means only when
the forum is a public one and strict scrutiny applies. For the reasons
stated above, see supra, at 205-208, such is not the case here. In deciding
not to collect pornographic material from the Internet, a public library
need not satisfy a court that it has pursued the least restrictive means of
implementing that decision.

In any case, the suggested alternatives have their own drawbacks.
Close monitoring of computer users would be far more intrusive than the
use of filtering software, and would risk transforming the role of a librarian from a professional to whom patrons turn for assistance into a compliance officer whom many patrons might wish to avoid. Moving terminals
to places where their displays cannot easily be seen by other patrons, or
installing privacy screens or recessed monitors, would not address a library's interest in preventing patrons from deliberately using its computers to view online pornography. To the contrary, these alternatives would
make it easier for patrons to do so.

available than in making book selections. Ibid. We do not
find this distinction constitutionally relevant. A library's
failure to make quality-based judgments about all the material it furnishes from the Web does not somehow taint the
judgments it does make. A library's need to exercise judgment in making collection decisions depends on its traditional role in identifying suitable and worthwhile material;
it is no less entitled to play that role when it collects material
from the Internet than when it collects material from any
other source. Most libraries already exclude pornography
from their print collections because they deem it inappropriate for inclusion. We do not subject these decisions
to heightened scrutiny; it would make little sense to treat
libraries' judgments to block online pornography any differently, when these judgments are made for just the same
reason.

Moreover, because of the vast quantity of material on the
Internet and the rapid pace at which it changes, libraries
cannot possibly segregate, item by item, all the Internet material that is appropriate for inclusion from all that is not.
While a library could limit its Internet collection to just
those sites it found worthwhile, it could do so only at the
cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that it lacks the capacity to review. Given that tradeoff,
it is entirely reasonable for public libraries to reject that
approach and instead exclude certain categories of content,
without making individualized judgments that everything
they do make available has requisite and appropriate quality.

Like the District Court, the dissents fault the tendency of
filtering software to "overblock"--that is, to erroneously
block access to constitutionally protected speech that falls
outside the categories that software users intend to block.
See post, at 221-222 (opinion of Stevens, J.); post, at 233-234
(opinion of Souter, J.). Due to the software's limitations,
"[m]any erroneously blocked [Web] pages contain content

that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, andthat no rational person could conclude matches the filtering

companies' category definitions, such as `pornography' or`sex.' " 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 449. Assuming that such erroneous blocking presents constitutional difficulties, any suchconcerns are dispelled by the ease with which patrons may
have the filtering software disabled. When a patron en-counters a blocked site, he need only ask a librarian to unblock it or (at least in the case of adults) disable the filter.As the District Court found, libraries have the capacity to
permanently unblock any erroneously blocked site, id., at429, and the Solicitor General stated at oral argument that
a "library may . . . eliminate the filtering with respect tospecific sites . . . at the request of a patron," Tr. of Oral Arg.
4. With respect to adults, CIPA also expressly authorizeslibrary officials to "disable" a filter altogether "to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes." 20U. S. C. $ 9134(f )(3) (disabling permitted for both adults and
minors); 47 U. S. C. $ 254(h)(6)(D) (disabling permitted foradults). The Solicitor General confirmed that a "librarian
can, in response to a request from a patron, unblock the fil-tering mechanism altogether," Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, and further explained that a patron would not "have to explain . . .why he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering
to be disabled," id., at 4. The District Court viewed un-blocking and disabling as inadequate because some patrons
may be too embarrassed to request them. 201 F. Supp. 2d,at 411. But the Constitution does not guarantee the right
to acquire information at a public library without any riskof embarrassment.

210 UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSN., INC.

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Appellees urge us to affirm the District Court's judgmenton the alternative ground that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance. Underthis doctrine, "the government `may not deny a benefit to a
person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected. . . freedom of speech' even if he has no entitlement to that
benefit." Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr,518 U. S. 668, 674 (1996) (quoting

Perry v. Sindermann, 408U. S. 593, 597 (1972)). Appellees argue that CIPA imposes

an unconstitutional condition on libraries that receive E-rateand LSTA subsidies by requiring them, as a condition on
their receipt of federal funds, to surrender their FirstAmendment right to provide the public with access to constitutionally protected speech. The Government counters thatthis claim fails because Government entities do not have
First Amendment rights. See Columbia Broadcasting Sys-tem, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94,

Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 814 (2000); and Reno v. American Civil Liberties
Union, 521 U. S. 844, 875 (1997)); see post, at 237-238 (opinion of Souter,
J.). But these cases are inapposite because they addressed Congress' direct regulation of private conduct, not exercises of its Spending Power.

The dissents also argue that because some library patrons would not
make specific unblocking requests, the interest of authors of blocked Internet material "in reaching the widest possible audience would be
abridged." Post, at 225 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see post, at 242-243, n. 8
(opinion of Souter, J.). But this mistakes a public library's purpose for
acquiring Internet terminals: A library does so to provide its patrons with
materials of requisite and appropriate quality, not to create a public forum
for Web publishers to express themselves. See supra, at 206-208.

Justice Stevens further argues that, because some libraries' procedures will make it difficult for patrons to have blocked material unblocked,
CIPA "will create a significant prior restraint on adult access to protected
speech." Post, at 225. But this argument, which the District Court did
not address, mistakenly extends prior restraint doctrine to the context of
public libraries' collection decisions. A library's decision to use filtering
software is a collection decision, not a restraint on private speech. Contrary to Justice Stevens' belief, a public library does not have an obligation to add material to its collection simply because the material is constitutionally protected.

that appellees may assert an "unconstitutional conditions"claim, this claim would fail on the merits. Within broad limits, "when the Government appropriates public funds to es-tablish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that
program." Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 194 (1991). InRust, Congress had appropriated federal funding for family
planning services and forbidden the use of such funds in pro-grams that provided abortion counseling.

Id., at 178. Re-cipients of these funds challenged this restriction, arguing

that it impermissibly conditioned the receipt of a benefit onthe relinquishment of their constitutional right to engage in
abortion counseling. Id., at 196. We rejected that claim,recognizing that "the Government [was] not denying a benefit to anyone, but [was] instead simply insisting that publicfunds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized." Ibid.The same is true here. The E-rate and LSTA programs

may certainly insist that these "public funds be spent for thepurposes for which they were authorized." Ibid. Especially because public libraries have traditionally excludedpornographic material from their other collections, Congress
could reasonably impose a parallel limitation on its Internetassistance programs. As the use of filtering software helps
to carry out these programs, it is a permissible conditionunder

Rust.
Justice Stevens asserts the premise that "[a] federalstatute penalizing a library for failing to install filtering software on every one of its Internet-accessible computers wouldunquestionably violate [the First] Amendment."

Post, at226. See also post, at 230-231. But--assuming again that

public libraries have First Amendment rights--CIPA doesnot "penalize" libraries that choose not to install such software, or deny them the right to provide their patrons withunfiltered Internet access. Rather, CIPA simply reflects
Congress' decision not to subsidize their doing so. To theextent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access, they are
free to do so without federal assistance. " `A refusal to fundprotected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the
imposition of a "penalty" on that activity.' " Rust, supra, at193 (quoting

Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 317, n. 19(1980)). " `[A] legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.' "Rust, supra, at 193 (quoting Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549 (1983)).6

6 These holdings, which Justice Stevens ignores, also make clear that

his reliance on Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62 (1990),
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976), and Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S.

in those cases involved true penalties, such as denial of a promotion or
outright discharge from employment, not nonsubsidies.

Appellees mistakenly contend, in reliance on Legal Serv-ices Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533 (2001), that

CIPA's filtering conditions "[d]istor[t] the [u]sual [f]unction-ing of [p]ublic [l]ibraries." Brief for Appellees ALA et al.
40 (citing Velazquez, supra, at 543); Brief for Appellees Mult-nomah et al. 47-48 (same). In Velazquez, the Court concluded that a Government program of furnishing legal aid tothe indigent differed from the program in

Rust "[i]n th[e]vital respect" that the role of lawyers who represent clients

in welfare disputes is to advocate against the Government,and there was thus an assumption that counsel would be free
of state control. 531 U. S., at 542-543. The Court con-cluded that the restriction on advocacy in such welfare disputes would distort the usual functioning of the legal pro-fession and the federal and state courts before which the
lawyers appeared. Public libraries, by contrast, have nocomparable role that pits them against the Government, and
there is no comparable assumption that they must be free ofany conditions that their benefactors might attach to the use
of donated funds or other assistance.7

7 Relying on Velazquez, Justice Stevens argues mistakenly that Rust
is inapposite because that case "only involved, and only applies to, . . .
situations in which the government seeks to communicate a specific message," post, at 228, and unlike the Title X program in Rust, the E-rate and
LSTA programs "are not designed to foster or transmit any particular
governmental message." Post, at 229. But he misreads our cases discussing Rust, and again misapprehends the purpose of providing Internet terminals in public libraries. Velazquez held only that viewpointbased restrictions are improper " `when the [government] does not itself
speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends
funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.' " 531

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Because public libraries' use of Internet filtering softwaredoes not violate their patrons' First Amendment rights,

CIPA does not induce libraries to violate the Constitution,and is a valid exercise of Congress' spending power. Nor
does CIPA impose an unconstitutional condition on publiclibraries. Therefore, the judgment of the District Court for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is

Reversed.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
If, on the request of an adult user, a librarian will unblockfiltered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay, there is little to this case. The Govern-ment represents this is indeed the fact. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11;
ante, at 209 (plurality opinion).The District Court, in its "Preliminary Statement," did say
that "the unblocking may take days, and may be unavailable,especially in branch libraries, which are often less well
staffed than main libraries." 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 411 (EDPa. 2002). See also post, at 232-233 (

Souter, J., dissenting).That statement, however, does not appear to be a specific

finding. It was not the basis for the District Court's deci-sion in any event, as the court assumed that "the disabling
provisions permit public libraries to allow a patron access toany speech that is constitutionally protected with respect to
that patron." 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 485-486.

open exchange of ideas"); Rosenberger, supra, at 830, 834 ("The [Student
Activities Fund] is a forum"; "[T]he University . . . expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers"). Indeed, this very
distinction led us to state in Southworth that that case did not implicate
our unconstitutional conditions jurisprudence. 529 U. S., at 229 ("The
case we decide here . . . does not raise the issue of the government's right
. . . to use its own funds to advance a particular message"). As we have
stated above, supra, at 206-208, public libraries do not install Internet
terminals to provide a forum for Web publishers to express themselves,
but rather to provide patrons with online material of requisite and appropriate quality.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
If some libraries do not have the capacity to unblock spe-cific Web sites or to disable the filter or if it is shown that an

adult user's election to view constitutionally protected In-ternet material is burdened in some other substantial way,
that would be the subject for an as-applied challenge, notthe facial challenge made in this case. See

post, at 219-220
(Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).

There are, of course, substantial Government interests atstake here. The interest in protecting young library users

from material inappropriate for minors is legitimate, andeven compelling, as all Members of the Court appear to
agree. Given this interest, and the failure to show that theability of adult library users to have access to the material
is burdened in any significant degree, the statute is not un-constitutional on its face. For these reasons, I concur in the
judgment of the Court.

Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.
The Children's Internet Protection Act (Act) sets conditions for the receipt of certain Government subsidies by
public libraries. Those conditions require the libraries toinstall on their Internet-accessible computers technology,

say, filtering software, that will help prevent computer usersfrom gaining Internet access to child pornography, obscenity, or material comparably harmful to minors. 20 U. S. C.$$ 9134(f )(1)(A)(i) and (B)(i); 47 U. S. C. $$ 254(h)(6)(B)(i) and
(C)(i). The technology, in its current form, does not function
perfectly, for to some extent it also screens out constitutionally protected materials that fall outside the scope of the
statute (i. e., "overblocks") and fails to prevent access to
some materials that the statute deems harmful (i. e., "underblocks"). See 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 448-449 (ED Pa. 2002);
ante, at 208-209 (plurality opinion). In determining

whether the statute's conditions consequently violate the
First Amendment, the plurality first finds the "public forum"
doctrine inapplicable, ante, at 205-208, and then holds that
the statutory provisions are constitutional. I agree with

216 UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSN., INC.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
both determinations. But I reach the plurality's ultimate
conclusion in a different way.

In ascertaining whether the statutory provisions are constitutional, I would apply a form of heightened scrutiny, examining the statutory requirements in question with special
care. The Act directly restricts the public's receipt of information. See Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 564 (1969)
("[T]he Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas"); Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,
521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997). And it does so through limitations
imposed by outside bodies (here Congress) upon two critically important sources of information--the Internet as accessed via public libraries. See ante, at 200, 203-204 (plurality opinion); post, at 225-226 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
Board of Ed., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26
v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 915 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)
(describing public libraries as places "designed for freewheeling inquiry"). See also Reno, supra, at 853, 868 (describing
the Internet as a "vast democratic" medium and the World
Wide Web, in part, as "comparable, from the readers' viewpoint, to . . . a vast library"); Ashcroft v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564, 566 (2002). For that reason,
we should not examine the statute's constitutionality as if it
raised no special First Amendment concern--as if, like tax or
economic regulation, the First Amendment demanded only a
"rational basis" for imposing a restriction. Nor should we
accept the Government's suggestion that a presumption in
favor of the statute's constitutionality applies. See, e. g., 201
F. Supp. 2d, at 409; Brief for United States 21-24.

At the same time, in my view, the First Amendment does
not here demand application of the most limiting constitutional approach--that of "strict scrutiny." The statutory restriction in question is, in essence, a kind of "selection" restriction (a kind of editing). It affects the kinds and
amount of materials that the library can present to its pa539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

217Cite as: 539 U. S. 194 (2003)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
trons. See ante, at 204, 207-208 (plurality opinion). Andlibraries often properly engage in the selection of materials,

either as a matter of necessity (i. e., due to the scarcity ofresources) or by design (

i. e., in accordance with collection
development policies). See, e. g., 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 408-409,421, 462;

ante, at 204, 208 (plurality opinion). To apply
"strict scrutiny" to the "selection" of a library's collection
(whether carried out by public libraries themselves or byother community bodies with a traditional legal right to engage in that function) would unreasonably interfere with thediscretion necessary to create, maintain, or select a library's
"collection" (broadly defined to include all the information
the library makes available). Cf. Miami Herald Publishing
Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 256-258 (1974) (protecting
newspaper's exercise of editorial control and judgment).
That is to say, "strict scrutiny" implies too limiting and rigid
a test for me to believe that the First Amendment requires
it in this context.

Instead, I would examine the constitutionality of the Act's
restrictions here as the Court has examined speech-related
restrictions in other contexts where circumstances call for
heightened, but not "strict," scrutiny--where, for example,
complex, competing constitutional interests are potentially
at issue or speech-related harm is potentially justified by
unusually strong governmental interests. Typically the key
question in such instances is one of proper fit. See, e. g.,
Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.
469 (1989); Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 740-747 (1996) (plurality
opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S.
180, 227 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in part); Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 389-390 (1969).

In such cases the Court has asked whether the harm to
speech-related interests is disproportionate in light of both
the justifications and the potential alternatives. It has considered the legitimacy of the statute's objective, the extent

218 UNITED STATES v. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSN., INC.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
to which the statute will tend to achieve that objective,whether there are other, less restrictive ways of achieving

that objective, and ultimately whether the statute worksspeech-related harm that, in relation to that objective, is out
of proportion. In Fox, supra, at 480, for example, theCourt stated:

"What our decisions require is a `fit' between the legisla-ture's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those
ends--a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reason-able; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the in-terest served; that employs not necessarily the least
restrictive means but, as we have put it in the other
contexts . . . , a means narrowly tailored to achieve thedesired objective." (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)
Cf., e. g., Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 564 (1980); United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968); Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984). This approach does not substitute a form of "balancing" for less
flexible, though more speech-protective, forms of "strictscrutiny." Rather, it

supplements the latter with an approach that is more flexible but nonetheless provides thelegislature with less than ordinary leeway in light of the

fact that constitutionally protected expression is at issue.Cf.

Fox, supra, at 480-481; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 769-773 (1976).

The Act's restrictions satisfy these constitutional demands.
The Act seeks to restrict access to obscenity, child pornography, and, in respect to access by minors, material that
is comparably harmful. These objectives are "legitimate,"
and indeed often "compelling." See, e. g., Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 18 (1973) (interest in prohibiting access to

539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
obscene material is "legitimate"); Reno, 521 U. S., at 869-870(interest in "shielding" minors from exposure to indecent

material is " `compelling' "); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.747, 756-757 (1982) (same). As the District Court found,
software filters "provide a relatively cheap and effective"means of furthering these goals. 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 448.
Due to present technological limitations, however, the software filters both "overblock," screening out some perfectlylegitimate material, and "underblock," allowing some obscene material to escape detection by the filter. Id., at 448-449. See

ante, at 208-209 (plurality opinion). But no one
has presented any clearly superior or better fitting alternatives. See ante, at 207, n. 3 (plurality opinion).

At the same time, the Act contains an important exception
that limits the speech-related harm that "overblocking"
might cause. As the plurality points out, the Act allows
libraries to permit any adult patron access to an "overblocked" Web site; the adult patron need only ask a librarian
to unblock the specific Web site or, alternatively, ask the
librarian, "Please disable the entire filter." See ante, at 209;

The Act does impose upon the patron the burden of making this request. But it is difficult to see how that burden
(or any delay associated with compliance) could prove more
onerous than traditional library practices associated with
segregating library materials in, say, closed stacks, or with
interlibrary lending practices that require patrons to make
requests that are not anonymous and to wait while the librarian obtains the desired materials from elsewhere. Perhaps local library rules or practices could further restrict the
ability of patrons to obtain "overblocked" Internet material.

not now considering any such local practices. We here consider only a facial challenge to the Act itself.

Given the comparatively small burden that the Act imposes upon the library patron seeking legitimate Internet
materials, I cannot say that any speech-related harm that
the Act may cause is disproportionate when considered in
relation to the Act's legitimate objectives. I therefore agree
with the plurality that the statute does not violate the First
Amendment, and I concur in the judgment.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
"To fulfill their traditional missions, public libraries must
have broad discretion to decide what material to provide
their patrons." Ante, at 204. Accordingly, I agree with the
plurality that it is neither inappropriate nor unconstitutional
for a local library to experiment with filtering software as a
means of curtailing children's access to Internet Web sites
displaying sexually explicit images. I also agree with the
plurality that the 7% of public libraries that decided to use
such software on all of their Internet terminals in 2000 did
not act unlawfully. Ante, at 200. Whether it is constitutional for the Congress of the United States to impose that
requirement on the other 93%, however, raises a vastly different question. Rather than allowing local decisionmakers
to tailor their responses to local problems, the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) operates as a blunt nationwide
restraint on adult access to "an enormous amount of valuable information" that individual librarians cannot possibly
review. Ante, at 208. Most of that information is constitutionally protected speech. In my view, this restraint is
unconstitutional.

The unchallenged findings of fact made by the District
Court reveal fundamental defects in the filtering software
that is now available or that will be available in the foreseeable future. Because the software relies on key words or
phrases to block undesirable sites, it does not have the capacity to exclude a precisely defined category of images. As
the District Court explained:

"[T]he search engines that software companies use for
harvesting are able to search text only, not images.
This is of critical importance, because CIPA, by its
own terms, covers only `visual depictions.' 20 U. S. C.

$ 9134(f )(1)(A)(i); 47 U. S. C. $ 254(h)(5)(B)(i). Image
recognition technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in the near future. None
of the filtering software companies deposed in this case
employs image recognition technology when harvesting
or categorizing URLs. Due to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of image recognition technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be harvested using a search
engine. This problem is complicated by the fact that
Web site publishers may use image files rather than text
to represent words, i. e., they may use a file that computers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a
printed word, rather than regular text, making automated review of their textual content impossible. For
example, if the Playboy Web site displays its name using
a logo rather than regular text, a search engine would
not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Given the quantity and ever-changing character of Web sitesoffering free sexually explicit material,

1 it is inevitable that

a substantial amount of such material will never be blocked.Because of this "underblocking," the statute will provide

parents with a false sense of security without really solvingthe problem that motivated its enactment. Conversely, the
software's reliance on words to identify undesirable sitesnecessarily results in the blocking of thousands of pages that
"contain content that is completely innocuous for both adultsand minors, and that no rational person could conclude
matches the filtering companies' category definitions, suchas `pornography' or `sex.' "

Id., at 449. In my judgment,a statutory blunderbuss that mandates this vast amount of

"overblocking" abridges the freedom of speech protected bythe First Amendment.

The effect of the overblocking is the functional equivalentof a host of individual decisions excluding hundreds of thousands of individual constitutionally protected messages fromInternet terminals located in public libraries throughout
the Nation. Neither the interest in suppressing unlawfulspeech nor the interest in protecting children from access to
harmful materials justifies this overly broad restriction onadult access to protected speech. "The Government may
not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlaw-ful speech."

explicit content is relatively small. Recent estimates indicate that no
more than 1-2% of the content on the Web is pornographic or sexually
explicit. However, the absolute number of Web sites offering free sexually explicit material is extremely large, approximately 100,000 sites."

Although CIPA does not permit any experimentation, theDistrict Court expressly found that a variety of alternatives

less restrictive are available at the local level:

"[L]ess restrictive alternatives exist that further thegovernment's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and materialharmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being
unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually ex-plicit content. To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography,public libraries may enforce Internet use policies that
make clear to patrons that the library's Internet termi-nals may not be used to access illegal speech. Libraries
may then impose penalties on patrons who violate thesepolicies, ranging from a warning to notification of law
enforcement, in the appropriate case. Less restrictivealternatives to filtering that further libraries' interest in
preventing minors from exposure to visual depictionsthat are harmful to minors include requiring parental
consent to or presence during unfiltered access, or re-stricting minors' unfiltered access to terminals within
view of library staff. Finally, optional filtering, privacyscreens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered
Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less re-strictive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons
from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit con-tent on the Internet." 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 410.

Those findings are consistent with scholarly comment on theissue arguing that local decisions tailored to local circumstances are more appropriate than a mandate from Condren does not suffice to support a blanket ban if the protection can be
accomplished by a less restrictive alternative"); Reno v. American Civil
Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 875 (1997) ("[T]he governmental interest

gress.3 The plurality does not reject any of those findings.Instead, "[a]ssuming that such erroneous blocking presents

constitutional difficulties," it relies on the Solicitor General'sassurance that the statute permits individual librarians to
disable filtering mechanisms whenever a patron so requests.Ante, at 209. In my judgment, that assurance does not cure
the constitutional infirmity in the statute.Until a blocked site or group of sites is unblocked, a patron
is unlikely to know what is being hidden and thereforewhether there is any point in asking for the filter to be removed. It is as though the statute required a significantpart of every library's reading materials to be kept in unmarked, locked rooms or cabinets, which could be openedonly in response to specific requests. Some curious readers
would in time obtain access to the hidden materials, but

3 "Indeed, federal or state mandates in this area are unnecessary and
unwise. Locally designed solutions are likely to best meet local circumstances. Local decision makers and library boards, responding to local
concerns and the prevalence of the problem in their own libraries, should
decide if minors' Internet access requires filters. They are the persons
in the best position to judge local community standards for what is and is
not obscene, as required by the Miller [v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973)]
test. Indeed, one nationwide solution is not needed, as the problems are
local and, to some extent, uniquely so. Libraries in rural communities,
for instance, have reported much less of a problem than libraries in urban
areas. A library in a rural community with only one or two computers
with Internet access may find that even the limited filtering advocated
here provides little or no additional benefit. Further, by allowing the
nation's public libraries to develop their own approaches, they may be able
to develop a better understanding of what methods work well and what
methods add little or nothing, or are even counter-productive. Imposing
a mandatory nationwide solution may well impede developing truly effective approaches that do not violate the First Amendment. The federal
and state governments can best assist this effort by providing libraries
with sufficient funding to experiment with a variety of constitutionally
permissible approaches." Laughlin, Sex, Lies, and Library Cards: The

many would not. Inevitably, the interest of the authors ofthose works in reaching the widest possible audience would

be abridged. Moreover, because the procedures that differ-ent libraries are likely to adopt to respond to unblocking requests will no doubt vary, it is impossible to measure theaggregate effect of the statute on patrons' access to blocked
sites. Unless we assume that the statute is a mere symbolicgesture, we must conclude that it will create a significant
prior restraint on adult access to protected speech. A lawthat prohibits reading without official consent, like a law that
prohibits speaking without consent, "constitutes a dramaticdeparture from our national heritage and constitutional tradition." Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 166 (2002).

II
The plurality incorrectly argues that the statute does notimpose "an unconstitutional condition on public libraries."

Ante, at 214. On the contrary, it impermissibly conditionsthe receipt of Government funding on the restriction of significant First Amendment rights.The plurality explains the "worthy missions" of the public
library in facilitating "learning and cultural enrichment."Ante, at 203. It then asserts that in order to fulfill these
missions, "libraries must have broad discretion to decidewhat material to provide to their patrons." Ante, at 204.
Thus the selection decision is the province of the librarians,a province into which we have hesitated to enter:

"A library's need to exercise judgment in making collec-tion decisions depends on its traditional role in identifying suitable and worthwhile material; it is no less enti-tled to play that role when it collects material from the
Internet than when it collects material from any othersource. Most libraries already exclude pornography
from their print collections because they deem it inap-propriate for inclusion. We do not subject these deci539US1 Unit: $U75 [05-03-05 22:10:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sions to heightened scrutiny; it would make little senseto treat libraries' judgments to block online pornography any differently, when these judgments are made forjust the same reason." Ante, at 208.

As the plurality recognizes, we have always assumed thatlibraries have discretion when making decisions regarding
what to include in, and exclude from, their collections. Thatdiscretion is comparable to the " `business of a university . . .
to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach,what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be
admitted to study.' " Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S.234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (citation
omitted).4 As the District Court found, one of the centralpurposes of a library is to provide information for educational purposes: " `Books and other library resources shouldbe provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment
of all people of the community the library serves.' " 201F. Supp. 2d, at 420 (quoting the American Library Association's Library Bill of Rights). Given our Nation's deep com-mitment "to safeguarding academic freedom" and to the "robust exchange of ideas," Keyishian v. Board of Regents of
Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967), a library'sexercise of judgment with respect to its collection is entitled

to First Amendment protection.A federal statute penalizing a library for failing to install
filtering software on every one of its Internet-accessiblecomputers would unquestionably violate that Amendment.
Cf. Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844(1997). I think it equally clear that the First Amendment
protects libraries from being denied funds for refusing to

comply with an identical rule. An abridgment of speech bymeans of a threatened denial of benefits can be just as pernicious as an abridgment by means of a threatened penalty.Our cases holding that government employment may not
be conditioned on the surrender of rights protected by theFirst Amendment illustrate the point. It has long been settled that "Congress could not `enact a regulation providing
that no Republican, Jew or Negro shall be appointed to fed-eral office, or that no federal employee shall attend Mass

or take any active part in missionary work.' " Wiemanv.

Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 191-192 (1952). Neither discharges, as in Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, 350-351 (1976),
nor refusals to hire or promote, as in Rutan v. Republican
Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 66-67 (1990), are immune from
First Amendment scrutiny. Our precedents firmly rejecting "Justice Holmes' famous dictum, that a policeman `may
have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman,' " Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S. 668, 674 (1996), draw no
distinction between the penalty of discharge from one's job
and the withholding of the benefit of a new job. The abridgment of First Amendment rights is equally unconstitutional
in either context. See Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404
(1963) ("Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the
same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as
would a fine . . . . It is too late in the day to doubt that the
liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the
denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege").

The issue in this case does not involve governmental attempts to control the speech or views of its employees. It
involves the use of its treasury to impose controls on an important medium of expression. In an analogous situation,
we specifically held that when "the Government seeks to use
an existing medium of expression and to control it, in a class
of cases, in ways which distort its usual functioning," the
distorting restriction must be struck down under the First

Amendment. Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531
U. S. 533, 543 (2001).5 The question, then, is whether requiring the filtering software on all Internet-accessible computers distorts that medium. As I have discussed above, the
over- and underblocking of the software does just that.

The plurality argues that the controversial decision in
Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991), requires rejection of
appellees' unconstitutional conditions claim. See ante, at
211-212. But, as subsequent cases have explained, Rust
only involved, and only applies to, instances of governmental
speech--that is, situations in which the government seeks to
communicate a specific message.6 The discounts under the
E-rate program and funding under the Library Services and
Technology Act (LSTA) program involved in this case do not
subsidize any message favored by the Government. As
Congress made clear, these programs were designed "[t]o
help public libraries provide their patrons with Internet access," which in turn "provide[s] patrons with a vast amount
of valuable information." Ante, at 199, 200. These programs thus are designed to provide access, particularly for

individuals in low-income communities, see 47 U. S. C.

$ 254(h)(1), to a vast amount and wide variety of private

5 Contrary to the plurality's narrow reading, Velazquez is not limited to
instances in which the recipient of Government funds might be "pit[ted]"
against the Government. See ante, at 213. To the contrary, we assessed
the issue in Velazquez by turning to, and harmonizing it with, our prior
unconstitutional condition cases in the First Amendment context. See
531 U. S., at 543-544.

6 See id., at 541 (distinguishing Rust on the ground that "the counseling

activities of the doctors . . . amounted to governmental speech"); Board of
Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 229 (2000)
(unlike Rust, "the issue of the government's right . . . to use its own funds
to advance a particular message" was not presented); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 834 (1995) (Rust is inapplicable where the government "does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal
of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity
of views from private speakers").

speech. They are not designed to foster or transmit anyparticular governmental message.

Even if we were to construe the passage of CIPA as modi-fying the E-rate and LSTA programs such that they now
convey a governmental message that no " `visual depictions'that are `obscene,' `child pornography,' or in the case of minors, `harmful to minors,' " 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 407, should be
expressed or viewed, the use of filtering software does notpromote that message. As described above, all filtering

software erroneously blocks access to a substantial numberof Web sites that contain constitutionally protected speech
on a wide variety of topics. See id., at 446-447 (describing
erroneous blocking of speech on churches and religious
groups, on politics and government, on health issues, on education and careers, on sports, and on travel). Moreover,
there are "frequent instances of underblocking," id., at 448,
that is, instances in which filtering software did not prevent
access to Web sites with depictions that fall within what
CIPA seeks to block access to. In short, the message conveyed by the use of filtering software is not that all speech
except that which is prohibited by CIPA is supported by the
Government, but rather that all speech that gets through the
software is supported by the Government. And the items
that get through the software include some visual depictions
that are obscene, some that are child pornography, and some
that are harmful to minors, while at the same time the software blocks an enormous amount of speech that is not sexually explicit and certainly does not meet CIPA's definitions
of prohibited content. As such, since the message conveyed
is far from the message the Government purports to promote--indeed, the material permitted past the filtering software does not seem to have any coherent message--Rust
is inapposite.

The plurality's reliance on National Endowment for Arts
v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569 (1998), is also misplaced. That case
involved a challenge to a statute setting forth the criteria

used by a federal panel of experts administering a federalgrant program. Unlike this case, the Federal Government

was not seeking to impose restrictions on the administrationof a nonfederal program. As explained supra, at 228, Rust
would appear to permit restrictions on a federal programsuch as the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) arts
grant program at issue in Finley.Further, like a library, the NEA experts in

Finley had agreat deal of discretion to make judgments as to what projects to fund. But unlike this case, Finley did not involve achallenge by the NEA to a governmental restriction on its
ability to award grants. Instead, the respondents were per-formance artists who had applied for NEA grants but were
denied funding. See 524 U. S., at 577. If this were a casein which library patrons had challenged a library's decision
to install and use filtering software, it would be in the sameposture as Finley. Because it is not, Finley does not control
this case.Also unlike

Finley, the Government does not merely seekto control a library's discretion with respect to computers

purchased with Government funds or those computers withGovernment-discounted Internet access. CIPA requires libraries to install filtering software on every computer withInternet access if the library receives

any discount from the
E-rate program or any funds from the LSTA program.7 See20 U. S. C. $ 9134(f )(1); 47 U. S. C. $$ 254(h)(6)(B) and (C). If

a library has 10 computers paid for by nonfederal funds andhas Internet service for those computers also paid for by
nonfederal funds, the library may choose not to put filtering
software on any of those 10 computers. Or a library maydecide to put filtering software on the 5 computers in its

as in Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549

they acquired without federal assistance.

children's section. Or a library in an elementary schoolmight choose to put filters on every single one of its 10 computers. But under this statute, if a library attempts to pro-vide Internet service for even one computer through an Erate discount, that library must put filtering software on allof its computers with Internet access, not just the one computer with E-rate discount.This Court should not permit federal funds to be used to
enforce this kind of broad restriction of First Amendmentrights, particularly when such a restriction is unnecessary to
accomplish Congress' stated goal. See supra, at 223 (dis-cussing less restrictive alternatives). The abridgment of
speech is equally obnoxious whether a rule like this one isenforced by a threat of penalties or by a threat to withhold
a benefit.I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.

I agree in the main with Justice Stevens, ante, at 225-230 and this page (dissenting opinion), that the blocking requirements of the Children's Internet Protection Act, 20U. S. C. $$ 9134(f)(1)(A)(i) and (B)(i); 47 U. S. C. $$ 254(h)

access to the Internet. I also agree with the library appel-lees on a further reason to hold the blocking rule invalid in

the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech if the librar-ies took that action entirely on their own. I respectfully

ings on the Internet otherwise available to them there, andif the only First Amendment interests raised here were

those of children, I would uphold application of the Act. Wehave said that the governmental interest in "shielding" children from exposure to indecent material is "compelling,"
Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 869-
870 (1997), and I do not think that the awkwardness a child
might feel on asking for an unblocked terminal is any suchburden as to affect constitutionality.

Nor would I dissent if I agreed with the majority of mycolleagues, see

ante, at 208-209 (plurality opinion); ante, at
219 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); ante, at 214 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), that an adult library patron could, consistently with the Act, obtain an unblocked
terminal simply for the asking. I realize the Solicitor General represented this to be the Government's policy, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 11, and if that policy were communicated to every affected library as unequivocally as it was
stated to us at argument, local librarians might be able to
indulge the unblocking requests of adult patrons to the point
of taking the curse off the statute for all practical purposes.
But the Federal Communications Commission, in its order
implementing the Act, pointedly declined to set a federal policy on when unblocking by local libraries would be appropriate under the statute. See In re Federal-State Joint
Board on Universal Service: Children's Internet Protection

We leave such determinations to the local communities,
whom we believe to be most knowledgeable about the varying circumstances of schools or libraries within those communities"). Moreover, the District Court expressly found that

cially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffedthan main libraries." 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 411 (ED Pa.

2002); see id., at 487-488 (same).In any event, we are here to review a statute, and the
unblocking provisions simply cannot be construed, even forconstitutional avoidance purposes, to say that a library must
unblock upon adult request, no conditions imposed and noquestions asked. First, the statute says only that a library
"may" unblock, not that it must. 20 U. S. C. $ 9134(f)(3); see47 U. S. C. $ 254(h)(6)(D). In addition, it allows unblocking
only for "bona fide research or other lawful purposes," 20U. S. C. $ 9134(f )(3); see 47 U. S. C. $ 254(h)(6)(D), and if the
"lawful purposes" criterion means anything that would notsubsume and render the "bona fide research" criterion
superfluous, it must impose some limit on eligibility forunblocking, see,

e. g., Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992) ("[C]ourts should disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous").There is therefore necessarily some restriction, which is
surely made more onerous by the uncertainty of its termsand the generosity of its discretion to library staffs in deciding who gets complete Internet access and who does not.Cf.

Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123,130 (1992) (noting that the First Amendment bars licensing

schemes that grant unduly broad discretion to licensing offi-cials, given the potential for such discretion to "becom[e] a

adult examination, and a substantial quantity of text and pic-tures harmful to no one. As the plurality concedes, see

ante, at 208-209, this is the inevitable consequence of theindiscriminate behavior of current filtering mechanisms,
which screen out material to an extent known only by themanufacturers of the blocking software, see 201 F. Supp. 2d,
at 408 ("The category lists maintained by the blocking programs are considered to be proprietary information, andhence are unavailable to customers or the general public for

review, so that public libraries that select categories whenimplementing filtering software do not really know what
they are blocking").

We likewise have to examine the statute on the understanding that the restrictions on adult Internet access have
no justification in the object of protecting children. Children could be restricted to blocked terminals, leaving other

unblocked terminals in areas restricted to adults and
screened from casual glances. And, of course, the statute
could simply have provided for unblocking at adult request,
with no questions asked. The statute could, in other words,
have protected children without blocking access for adults
or subjecting adults to anything more than minimal inconvenience, just the way (the record shows) many librarians
had been dealing with obscenity and indecency before imposition of the federal conditions. See id., at 422-427. Instead, the Government's funding conditions engage in overkill to a degree illustrated by their refusal to trust even a
library's staff with an unblocked terminal, one to which the
adult public itself has no access. See id., at 413 (quoting 16
FCC Rcd., at 8196, || 30).

The question for me, then, is whether a local library could
itself constitutionally impose these restrictions on the content otherwise available to an adult patron through an Internet connection, at a library terminal provided for public
use. The answer is no. A library that chose to block an
adult's Internet access to material harmful to children (and

Souter, J., dissenting
whatever else the undiscriminating filter might interrupt)would be imposing a content-based restriction on communication of material in the library's control that an adult couldotherwise lawfully see. This would simply be censorship.
True, the censorship would not necessarily extend to everyadult, for an intending Internet user might convince a librarian that he was a true researcher or had a "lawful purpose"to obtain everything the library's terminal could provide.
But as to those who did not qualify for discretionary un-blocking, the censorship would be complete and, like all censorship by an agency of the Government, presumptively in-valid owing to strict scrutiny in implementing the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment. "The policy of theFirst Amendment favors dissemination of information and
opinion, and the guarantees of freedom of speech and presswere not designed to prevent the censorship of the press
merely, but any action of the government by means of whichit might prevent such free and general discussion of public
matters as seems absolutely essential." Bigelow v. Vir-ginia, 421 U. S. 809, 829 (1975) (internal quotation marks and
brackets omitted). II

The Court's plurality does not treat blocking affectingadults as censorship, but chooses to describe a library's act
in filtering content as simply an instance of the kind of selec-tion from available material that every library (save, perhaps, the Library of Congress) must perform. Ante, at 208("A library's need to exercise judgment in making collection
decisions depends on its traditional role in identifying suit-able and worthwhile material; it is no less entitled to play
that role when it collects material from the Internet thanwhen it collects material from any other source"). But this
position does not hold up.2

2 Among other things, the plurality's reasoning ignores the widespread
utilization of interlibrary loan systems. See 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, 421 (ED
Pa. 2002). With interlibrary loan, virtually any book, say, is effectively

Public libraries are indeed selective in what they acquireto place in their stacks, as they must be. There is only so

much money and so much shelf space, and the necessity tochoose some material and reject the rest justifies the effort
to be selective with an eye to demand, quality, and the objectof maintaining the library as a place of civilized enquiry by
widely different sorts of people. Selectivity is thus neces-sary and complex, and these two characteristics explain why
review of a library's selection decisions must be limited: thedecisions are made all the time, and only in extreme cases
could one expect particular choices to reveal impermissiblereasons (reasons even the plurality would consider to be illegitimate), like excluding books because their authors areDemocrats or their critiques of organized Christianity are
unsympathetic. See Board of Ed., Island Trees Union FreeSchool Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 870-871 (1982)
(plurality opinion). Review for rational basis is probablythe most that any court could conduct, owing to the myriad
particular selections that might be attacked by someone, andthe difficulty of untangling the play of factors behind a particular decision.At every significant point, however, the Internet blocking here defies comparison to the process of acquisition.Whereas traditional scarcity of money and space require a
library to make choices about what to acquire, and the choiceto be made is whether or not to spend the money to acquire
something, blocking is the subject of a choice made after themoney for Internet access has been spent or committed.

made available to a library's patrons. If, therefore, a librarian refused to
get a book from interlibrary loan for an adult patron on the ground that
the patron's "purpose" in seeking the book was not acceptable, the librarian could find no justification in the fact that libraries have traditionally
"collect[ed] only those materials deemed to have `requisite and appropriate
quality.' " Ante, at 204. In any event, in the ensuing analysis, I assume
for the sake of argument that we are in a world without interlibrary loan.

Since it makes no difference to the cost of Internet access
whether an adult calls up material harmful for children or
the Articles of Confederation, blocking (on facts like these)
is not necessitated by scarcity of either money or space.3 In
the instance of the Internet, what the library acquires is
electronic access, and the choice to block is a choice to limit
access that has already been acquired. Thus, deciding
against buying a book means there is no book (unless a loan
can be obtained), but blocking the Internet is merely blocking access purchased in its entirety and subject to unblocking
if the librarian agrees. The proper analogy therefore is not
to passing up a book that might have been bought; it is either
to buying a book and then keeping it from adults lacking an
acceptable "purpose," or to buying an encyclopedia and then
cutting out pages with anything thought to be unsuitable for
all adults.

B

The plurality claims to find support for its conclusions in
the "traditional missio[n]" of the public library. Ante, at
205; see also ante, at 219 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (considering "traditional library practices"). The plurality thus argues, in effect, that the traditional responsibility of public libraries has called for denying adult access to
certain books, or bowdlerizing the content of what the libraries let adults see. But, in fact, the plurality's conception of
a public library's mission has been rejected by the libraries
themselves. And no library that chose to block adult access
in the way mandated by the Act could claim that the history
of public library practice in this country furnished an implicit

3 Of course, a library that allowed its patrons to use computers for any
purposes might feel the need to purchase more computers to satisfy what
would presumably be greater demand, see Brief for Appellants 23, but the
answer to that problem would be to limit the number of unblocked terminals or the hours in which they could be used. In any event, the rationale
for blocking has no reference whatever to scarcity.

gloss on First Amendment standards, allowing for blockingout anything unsuitable for adults.

Institutional history of public libraries in America dis-closes an evolution toward a general rule, now firmly rooted,
that any adult entitled to use the library has access to anyof its holdings.

4 To be sure, this freedom of choice was apparently not within the inspiration for the mid-19th-centurydevelopment of public libraries, see J. Shera, Foundations of

the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Move-ment in New England, 1629-1855, p. 107 (1949), and in the
infancy of their development a "[m]oral censorship" of read-ing material was assumed, E. Geller, Forbidden Books in
American Public Libraries, 1876-1939, p. 12 (1984). Buteven in the early 20th century, the legitimacy of the librarian's authority as moral arbiter was coming into question.See,

e. g., Belden, President's Address: Looking Forward, 20Bull. Am. Libr. Assn. 273, 274 (1926) ("The true public library must stand for the intellectual freedom of access tothe printed word"). And the practices of European fascism
fueled the reaction against library censorship. See M. Har-ris, History of Libraries in the Western World 248 (4th ed.
1995). The upshot was a growing understanding that a li-brarian's job was to guarantee that "all people had access to
all ideas," Geller, supra, at 156, and by the end of the 1930s,librarians' "basic position in opposition to censorship [had]
emerged," Krug & Harvey, ALA and Intellectual Freedom:A Historical Overview, in Intellectual Freedom Manual,
pp. xi, xv (American Library Association 1974) (hereinafterIntellectual Freedom Manual); see also Darling, Access, Intellectual Freedom and Libraries, 27 Library Trends 315-316 (1979).

4 That is, libraries do not refuse materials to adult patrons on account of
their content. Of course, libraries commonly limit access on contentneutral grounds to, say, rare or especially valuable materials. Such practices raise no First Amendment concerns, because they have nothing to
do with suppressing ideas.

By the time McCarthyism began its assaults, appelleeAmerican Library Association (ALA) had developed a Library Bill of Rights against censorship, Library Bill ofRights, in Intellectual Freedom Manual, pt. 1, p. 7, and an
Intellectual Freedom Committee to maintain the positionthat beyond enforcing existing laws against obscenity, "there
is no place in our society for extra-legal efforts to coerce thetaste of others, to confine adults to the reading matter
deemed suitable for adolescents, or to inhibit the efforts ofwriters to achieve artistic expression." Freedom to Read,
in id., pt. 2, at 8; see also Krug & Harvey, in id., at xv. So
far as I have been able to tell, this statement expressed theprevailing ideal in public library administration after World

War II, and it seems fair to say as a general rule that librar-ies by then had ceased to deny requesting adults access to
any materials in their collections. The adult might, indeed,have had to make a specific request, for the literature and
published surveys from the period show a variety of restric-tions on the circulation of library holdings, including placement of materials apart from open stacks, and availability
only upon specific request.5 But aside from the isolated sug-gestion, see,

e. g., Born, Public Libraries and Intellectual
Freedom, in id., pt. 3, at 4, 9, I have not been able to findfrom this period any record of a library barring access to

materials in its collection on a basis other than a reader'sage. It seems to have been out of the question for a library
to refuse a book in its collection to a requesting adult patron,or to presume to evaluate the basis for a particular request.

This take on the postwar years is confirmed by evidenceof the dog that did not bark. During the second half of the

20th century, the ALA issued a series of policy statements,since dubbed Interpretations of the Library Bill of Rights,

see id., pt. 1, at 13, commenting on library administration andpointing to particular practices the ALA opposed. Thus, for
example, in response to pressure by the Sons of the Ameri-can Revolution on New Jersey libraries to place labels on
materials "advocat[ing] or favor[ing] communism," the ALAin 1957 adopted a "Statement on Labeling," opposing it as "a
censor's tool." Id., pt. 1, at 18-19. Again, 10 years later,the ALA even adopted a statement against any restriction
on access to library materials by minors. It acknowledgedthat age restrictions were common across the Nation in
"a variety of forms, including, among others, restricted read-ing rooms for adult use only, library cards limiting circulation
of some materials to adults only, closed collections for adultuse only, and interlibrary loan for adult use only."

Id., pt. 1,at 16. Nevertheless, the ALA opposed all such limitations,

saying that "only the parent . . . may restrict his children--and only

his children--from access to library materials andservices." Id., pt. 1, at 17.

And in 1973, the ALA adopted a policy opposing the prac-tice already mentioned, of keeping certain books off the open
shelves, available only on specific request. See id., pt. 1,at 42. The statement conceded that " `closed shelf,' `locked
case,' `adults only,' or `restricted shelf ' collections" were"common to many libraries in the United States." Id., pt. 1,
at 43. The ALA nonetheless came out against it, in theseterms: "While the limitation differs from direct censorship
activities, such as removal of library materials or refusal topurchase certain publications, it nonetheless constitutes censorship, albeit a subtle form." Ibid.6Amidst these and other ALA statements from the latter
half of the 20th century, however, one subject is missing.

There is not a word about barring requesting adults fromany materials in a library's collection, or about limiting an

adult's access based on evaluation of his purposes in seekingmaterials. If such a practice had survived into the latter
half of the 20th century, one would surely find a statementabout it from the ALA, which had become the nemesis of
anything sounding like censorship of library holdings, asshown by the history just sampled.

7 The silence bespeaks

an American public library that gives any adult patron anymaterial at hand, and a history without support for the plurality's reading of the First Amendment as tolerating a pub-lic library's censorship of its collection against adult enquiry.

C
Thus, there is no preacquisition scarcity rationale to savelibrary Internet blocking from treatment as censorship, and

no support for it in the historical development of librarypractice. To these two reasons to treat blocking differently
from a decision declining to buy a book, a third must beadded. Quite simply, we can smell a rat when a library
blocks material already in its control, just as we do when alibrary removes books from its shelves for reasons having
nothing to do with wear and tear, obsolescence, or lack ofdemand. Content-based blocking and removal tell us something that mere absence from the shelves does not.I have already spoken about two features of acquisition
decisions that make them poor candidates for effective judi-cial review. The first is their complexity, the number of legitimate considerations that may go into them, not all point-ing one way, providing cover for any illegitimate reason that
managed to sneak in. A librarian should consider likely de-mand, scholarly or esthetic quality, alternative purchases,

7 Thus, it is not surprising that, with the emergence of the circumstances
giving rise to this case, the ALA has adopted statements opposing restrictions on access to adult patrons, specific to electronic media like the Internet. See id., at 150-153, 176-179, 180-187.

relative cost, and so on. The second reason the judiciarymust be shy about reviewing acquisition decisions is the

sheer volume of them, and thus the number that might drawfire. Courts cannot review the administration of every library with a constituent disgruntled that the library fails tobuy exactly what he wants to read.

After a library has acquired material in the first place,however, the variety of possible reasons that might legitimately support an initial rejection are no longer in play.Removal of books or selective blocking by controversial subject matter is not a function of limited resources and lesslikely than a selection decision to reflect an assessment of
esthetic or scholarly merit. Removal (and blocking) deci-sions being so often obviously correlated with content, they
tend to show up for just what they are, and because suchdecisions tend to be few, courts can examine them without
facing a deluge. The difference between choices to keep outand choices to throw out is thus enormous, a perception that
underlay the good sense of the plurality's conclusion inBoard of Ed., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26
v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853 (1982), that removing classics from aschool library in response to pressure from parents and
school board members violates the Speech Clause.

III
There is no good reason, then, to treat blocking of adultenquiry as anything different from the censorship it presumptively is. For this reason, I would hold in accordancewith conventional strict scrutiny that a library's practice of
blocking would violate an adult patron's First and Four-teenth Amendment right to be free of Internet censorship,
when unjustified (as here) by any legitimate interest inscreening children from harmful material.

8 On that ground,

8 I assume, although there is no occasion here to decide, that the originators of the material blocked by the Internet filters could object to the wall
between them and any adult audience they might attract, although they

the Act's blocking requirement in its current breadth callsfor unconstitutional action by a library recipient, and is itself unconstitutional.

would be unlikely plaintiffs, given that their private audience would be
unaffected by the library's action, and many of them might have no more
idea that a library is blocking their work than the library does. It is for
this reason that I rely on the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of
adult library patrons, who would experience the more acute injury by
being denied a look at anything the software identified as apt to harm a
child (and whatever else got blocked along with it). In practical terms, if
libraries and the National Government are going to be kept from engaging
in unjustifiable adult censorship, there is no alternative to recognizing a
viewer's or reader's right to be free of paternalistic censorship as at least
an adjunct of the core right of the speaker. The plurality in Board of Ed.,
Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853 (1982),
saw this and recognized the right of students using a school library to
object to the removal of disfavored books from the shelves, id., at 865-868
(opinion of Brennan, J.). By the same token, we should recognize an analogous right on the part of a library's adult Internet users, who may be
among the 10% of American Internet users whose access comes solely
through library terminals, see 201 F. Supp. 2d, at 422. There should
therefore be no question that censorship by blocking produces real injury
sufficient to support a suit for redress by patrons whose access is denied.

GRATZ et al. v. BOLLINGER et al.
certiorari before judgment to the united statescourt of appeals for the sixth circuit

No. 02-516. Argued April 1, 2003--Decided June 23, 2003
Petitioners Gratz and Hamacher, both of whom are Michigan residents

and Caucasian, applied for admission to the University of Michigan's
(University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) in 1995
and 1997, respectively. Although the LSA considered Gratz to be well
qualified and Hamacher to be within the qualified range, both were denied early admission and were ultimately denied admission. In order
to promote consistency in the review of the many applications received,
the University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) uses written guidelines for each academic year. The guidelines have changed a
number of times during the period relevant to this litigation. The OUA
considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including
high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, leadership, and race.
During all relevant periods, the University has considered AfricanAmericans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be "underrepresented
minorities," and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually
every qualified applicant from these groups. The current guidelines
use a selection method under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group is automatically awarded 20
points of the 100 needed to guarantee admission.

Petitioners filed this class action alleging that the University's use
of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U. S. C. $ 1981. They sought compensatory
and punitive damages for past violations, declaratory relief finding that
respondents violated their rights to nondiscriminatory treatment, an injunction prohibiting respondents from continuing to discriminate on the
basis of race, and an order requiring the LSA to offer Hamacher admission as a transfer student. The District Court granted petitioners' motion to certify a class consisting of individuals who applied for and were
denied admission to the LSA for academic year 1995 and forward and
who are members of racial or ethnic groups that respondents treated
less favorably on the basis of race. Hamacher, whose claim was found
to challenge racial discrimination on a classwide basis, was designated
as the class representative. On cross-motions for summary judgment,
respondents relied on Justice Powell's principal opinion in Regents of

Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 317, which expressed the view that
the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases
serve a compelling government interest. Respondents contended that
the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result
from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its
program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The court agreed
with respondents as to the LSA's current admissions guidelines and
granted them summary judgment in that respect. However, the court
also found that the LSA's admissions guidelines for 1995 through 1998
operated as the functional equivalent of a quota running afoul of Justice
Powell's Bakke opinion, and thus granted petitioners summary judgment with respect to respondents' admissions programs for those years.
While interlocutory appeals were pending in the Sixth Circuit, that
court issued an opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, p. 306, upholding
the admissions program used by the University's Law School. This
Court granted certiorari in both cases, even though the Sixth Circuit
had not yet rendered judgment in this one.

Held:

1. Petitioners have standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief.
The Court rejects Justice Stevens' contention that, because Hamacher did not actually apply for admission as a transfer student, his
future injury claim is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real
and immediate. The "injury in fact" necessary to establish standing in
this type of case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the
imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.
Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v.
Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666. In the face of such a barrier, to establish standing, a party need only demonstrate that it is able and ready
to perform and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so
on an equal basis. Ibid. In bringing his equal protection challenge
against the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions, Hamacher alleged that the University had denied him the opportunity to
compete for admission on an equal basis. Hamacher was denied admission to the University as a freshman applicant even though an underrepresented minority applicant with his qualifications would have been admitted. After being denied admission, Hamacher demonstrated that he
was "able and ready" to apply as a transfer student should the University cease to use race in undergraduate admissions. He therefore has
standing to seek prospective relief with respect to the University's continued use of race. Also rejected is Justice Stevens' contention that
such use in undergraduate transfer admissions differs from the University's use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions, so that Hamacher lacks standing to represent absent class members challenging
the latter. Each year the OUA produces a document setting forth

Syllabus
guidelines for those seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman
and transfer applicants. The transfer applicant guidelines specifically
cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants. In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a
transfer applicant will contribute to diversity are identical to those used
to evaluate freshman applicants. The only difference is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and "virtually" all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while "generally" all
minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright.
While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis,
it clearly has no effect on petitioners' standing to challenge the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest justifying its consideration of the race
of its undergraduate applicants. See General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 159; Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, distinguished. The District Court's carefully considered decision to certify
this class action is correct. Cf. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.
463, 469. Hamacher's personal stake, in view of both his past injury
and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain the action. Pp. 260-268.

2. Because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted
interest in diversity, the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause.
For the reasons set forth in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 327-333, the
Court has today rejected petitioners' argument that diversity cannot
constitute a compelling state interest. However, the Court finds that
the University's current policy, which automatically distributes 20
points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every
single "underrepresented minority" applicant solely because of race, is
not narrowly tailored to achieve educational diversity. In Bakke, Justice Powell explained his view that it would be permissible for a university to employ an admissions program in which "race or ethnic background may be deemed a `plus' in a particular applicant's file." 438
U. S., at 317. He emphasized, however, the importance of considering
each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities
that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability
to contribute to the unique setting of higher education. The admissions
program Justice Powell described did not contemplate that any single
characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. See id., at 315. The current LSA policy does not provide the individualized consideration Justice Powell contemplated. The only consideration that accompanies the 20-point
automatic distribution to all applicants from underrepresented minorities is a factual review to determine whether an individual is a member

Syllabus
of one of these minority groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell's example, where the race of a "particular black applicant" could be considered without being decisive, see id., at 317, the LSA's 20-point distribution has the effect of making "the factor of race . . . decisive" for
virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant, ibid. The fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicant's file being flagged for individualized consideration only emphasizes
the flaws of the University's system as a whole when compared to that
described by Justice Powell. The record does not reveal precisely how
many applications are flagged, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the LSA's program. Also,
this individualized review is only provided after admissions counselors
automatically distribute the University's version of a "plus" that makes
race a decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant. The Court rejects respondents' contention that the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for the LSA to use the admissions
system upheld today in Grutter. The fact that the implementation of a
program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system. See, e. g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,
488 U. S. 469, 508. Nothing in Justice Powell's Bakke opinion signaled
that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve
diversity without regard to the limits imposed by strict scrutiny.

I
A
Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both ap-plied for admission to the University of Michigan's (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) asresidents of the State of Michigan. Both petitioners are
Caucasian. Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of1995, was notified in January of that year that a final decision
regarding her admission had been delayed until April. Thisdelay was based upon the University's determination that,
although Gratz was " `well qualified,' " she was " `less compet-itive than the students who ha[d] been admitted on first review.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a. Gratz was notified inApril that the LSA was unable to offer her admission. She
enrolled in the University of Michigan at Dearborn, fromwhich she graduated in the spring of 1999.

Hamacher applied for admission to the LSA for the fall of1997. A final decision as to his application was also postponed because, though his " `academic credentials [were]in the qualified range, they [were] not at the level needed
for first review admission.' " Ibid. Hamacher's applicationwas subsequently denied in April 1997, and he enrolled at

252 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
In October 1997, Gratz and Hamacher filed a lawsuit inthe United States District Court for the Eastern District

of Michigan against the University, the LSA,2 James Duder-stadt, and Lee Bollinger.

3 Petitioners' complaint was a

class-action suit alleging "violations and threatened viola-tions of the rights of the plaintiffs and the class they represent to equal protection of the laws under the FourteenthAmendment . . . , and for racial discrimination in violation
of 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981, 1983 and 2000d et seq." App. 33.Petitioners sought,

inter alia, compensatory and punitivedamages for past violations, declaratory relief finding that

respondents violated petitioners' "rights to nondiscrimina-tory treatment," an injunction prohibiting respondents from
"continuing to discriminate on the basis of race in violationof the Fourteenth Amendment," and an order requiring the
LSA to offer Hamacher admission as a transfer student.4Id., at 40.

The District Court granted petitioners' motion for classcertification after determining that a class action was appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).The certified class consisted of "those individuals who applied for and were not granted admission to the College of

2 The University of Michigan Board of Regents was subsequently named
as the proper defendant in place of the University and the LSA. See
id., at 17.

3 Duderstadt was the president of the University during the time that

Gratz's application was under consideration. He has been sued in his individual capacity. Bollinger was the president of the University when Hamacher applied for admission. He was originally sued in both his individual and official capacities, but he is no longer the president of the
University. Id., at 35.

4 A group of African-American and Latino students who applied for, or

intended to apply for, admission to the University, as well as the Citizens
for Affirmative Action's Preservation, a nonprofit organization in Michigan, sought to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24.
See App. 13-14. The District Court originally denied this request, see
id., at 14-15, but the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision. See Gratz v.
Bollinger, 188 F. 3d 394 (1999).

The University has changed its admissions guidelines anumber of times during the period relevant to this litigation,

and we summarize the most significant of these changesbriefly. The University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) oversees the LSA admissions process.6 Inorder to promote consistency in the review of the large number of applications received, the OUA uses written guide-lines for each academic year. Admissions counselors make
admissions decisions in accordance with these guidelines.OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions
decisions, including high school grades, standardized testscores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography,
alumni relationships, and leadership. OUA also considersrace. During all periods relevant to this litigation, the Uni5 The District Court decided also to consider petitioners' request for
injunctive and declaratory relief during the liability phase of the proceedings. App. 71.

6 Our description is taken, in large part, from the "Joint Proposed Summary of Undisputed Facts Regarding Admissions Process" filed by the
parties in the District Court. App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a-117a.

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG
254 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
versity has considered African-Americans, Hispanics, and
Native Americans to be "underrepresented minorities," and
it is undisputed that the University admits "virtually every
qualified . . . applicant" from these groups. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 111a.

During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with what
were referred to as the "SCUGA" factors. These factors included the quality of an applicant's high school (S), the
strength of an applicant's high school curriculum (C), an applicant's unusual circumstances (U), an applicant's geographical residence (G), and an applicant's alumni relationships (A).
After these scores were combined to produce an applicant's
"GPA 2" score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of "Guidelines" tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges
on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic
Aptitude Test (ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis.
Each table was divided into cells that included one or more
courses of action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay
for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.

In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and
ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status.7 For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratz's GPA 2 score
and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application. An in-state or out-ofstate minority applicant with Gratz's scores would have
fallen within a cell calling for admission.

7 In 1995, counselors used four such tables for different groups of applicants: (1) in-state, nonminority applicants; (2) out-of-state, nonminority applicants; (3) in-state, minority applicants; and (4) out-of-state, minority applicants. In 1996, only two tables were used, one for in-state applicants
and one for out-of-state applicants. But each cell on these two tables
contained separate courses of action for minority applicants and nonminority applicants whose GPA 2 scores and ACT/SAT scores placed them in
that cell.

255Cite as: 539 U. S. 244 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure.Specifically, the formula for calculating an applicant's GPA 2

score was restructured to include additional point valuesunder the "U" category in the SCUGA factors. Under this
new system, applicants could receive points for underrepre-sented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or attendance at a high school with a predominantly underrepresented minority population, or underrepresentation in theunit to which the student was applying (for example, men

who sought to pursue a career in nursing). Under the 1997procedures, Hamacher's GPA 2 score and ACT score placed
him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final admissions decision. An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would
generally have been admitted.

Beginning with the 1998 academic year, the OUA dispensed with the Guidelines tables and the SCUGA point system in favor of a "selection index," on which an applicant
could score a maximum of 150 points. This index was divided linearly into ranges generally calling for admissions
dispositions as follows: 100-150 (admit); 95-99 (admit or postpone); 90-94 (postpone or admit); 75-89 (delay or postpone);
74 and below (delay or reject).

Each application received points based on high school
grade point average, standardized test scores, academic quality of an applicant's high school, strength or weakness of high
school curriculum, in-state residency, alumni relationship,
personal essay, and personal achievement or leadership. Of
particular significance here, under a "miscellaneous" category, an applicant was entitled to 20 points based upon his
or her membership in an underrepresented racial or ethnic
minority group. The University explained that the " `development of the selection index for admissions in 1998 changed
only the mechanics, not the substance, of how race and ethnicity [were] considered in admissions.' " App. to Pet. for
Cert. 116a.

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG
256 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
In all application years from 1995 to 1998, the guidelinesprovided that qualified applicants from underrepresented minority groups be admitted as soon as possible in light of theUniversity's belief that such applicants were more likely to
enroll if promptly notified of their admission. Also from1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit consideration of certain ap-plications submitted later in the academic year through the
use of "protected seats." Specific groups--including ath-letes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minorities--were "protected categories" eligible forthese seats. A committee called the Enrollment Working
Group (EWG) projected how many applicants from each ofthese protected categories the University was likely to receive after a given date and then paced admissions decisionsto permit full consideration of expected applications from
these groups. If this space was not filled by qualified candi-dates from the designated groups toward the end of the admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candi-dates remaining in the applicant pool, including those on the
waiting list.During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index,
under which every applicant from an underrepresented racialor ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points. Starting
in 1999, however, the University established an AdmissionsReview Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of
consideration for some applications. Under the new system,counselors may, in their discretion, "flag" an application for
the ARC to review after determining that the applicant (1) isacademically prepared to succeed at the University,

8 (2) has

achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possessesa quality or characteristic important to the University's com8 LSA applicants who are Michigan residents must accumulate 80 points
from the selection index criteria to be flagged, while out-of-state applicants need to accumulate 75 points to be eligible for such consideration.
See App. 257.

position of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique
life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented
race, ethnicity, or geography. After reviewing "flagged" applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or
deny each applicant.

C

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment
with respect to liability. Petitioners asserted that the LSA's
use of race as a factor in admissions violates Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d, and
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Respondents relied on Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of
Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), to respond to
petitioners' arguments. As discussed in greater detail in
the Court's opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 323-325,
Justice Powell, in Bakke, expressed the view that the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases
serve a compelling government interest. See 438 U. S., at
317. Respondents contended that the LSA has just such
an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that
its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.
Respondent-intervenors asserted that the LSA had a compelling interest in remedying the University's past and current discrimination against minorities.9

9 The District Court considered and rejected respondent-intervenors' arguments in a supplemental opinion and order. See 135 F. Supp. 2d 790
(ED Mich. 2001). The court explained that respondent-intervenors "failed
to present any evidence that the discrimination alleged by them, or the
continuing effects of such discrimination, was the real justification for the
LSA's race-conscious admissions programs." Id., at 795. We agree, and
to the extent respondent-intervenors reassert this justification, a justification the University has never asserted throughout the course of this
litigation, we affirm the District Court's disposition of the issue.

258 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
The District Court began its analysis by reviewing thisCourt's decision in

Bakke. See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 817 (ED
Mich. 2000). Although the court acknowledged that no de-cision from this Court since

Bakke has explicitly accepted
the diversity rationale discussed by Justice Powell, see 122F. Supp. 2d, at 820-821, it also concluded that this Court had

not, in the years since Bakke, ruled out such a justification
for the use of race, 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 820-821. The DistrictCourt concluded that respondents and their

amici curiae had
presented "solid evidence" that a racially and ethnically di-verse student body produces significant educational benefits

such that achieving such a student body constitutes a compelling governmental interest. See id., at 822-824.

The court next considered whether the LSA's admissions
guidelines were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.
See id., at 824. Again relying on Justice Powell's opinion in
Bakke, the District Court determined that the admissions
program the LSA began using in 1999 is a narrowly tailored
means of achieving the University's interest in the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse
student body. See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 827. The court emphasized that the LSA's current program does not utilize
rigid quotas or seek to admit a predetermined number of
minority students. See ibid. The award of 20 points for
membership in an underrepresented minority group, in the
District Court's view, was not the functional equivalent of a
quota because minority candidates were not insulated from
review by virtue of those points. See id., at 828. Likewise,
the court rejected the assertion that the LSA's program
operates like the two-track system Justice Powell found objectionable in Bakke on the grounds that LSA applicants
are not competing for different groups of seats. See 122
F. Supp. 2d, at 828-829. The court also dismissed petitioners' assertion that the LSA's current system is nothing more
than a means by which to achieve racial balancing. See id.,
at 831. The court explained that the LSA does not seek to

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

259Cite as: 539 U. S. 244 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
achieve a certain proportion of minority students, let alonea proportion that represents the community. See ibid.

The District Court found the admissions guidelines theLSA used from 1995 through 1998 to be more problematic.
In the court's view, the University's prior practice of "pro-tecting" or "reserving" seats for underrepresented minority applicants effectively kept nonprotected applicants fromcompeting for those slots. See

id., at 832. This system, thecourt concluded, operated as the functional equivalent of a

quota and ran afoul of Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke.10See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 832.

Based on these findings, the court granted petitioners' mo-tion for summary judgment with respect to the LSA's admissions programs in existence from 1995 through 1998, andrespondents' motion with respect to the LSA's admissions
programs for 1999 and 2000. See id., at 833. Accordingly,the District Court denied petitioners' request for injunctive
relief. See id., at 814.The District Court issued an order consistent with its rulings and certified two questions for interlocutory appeal tothe Sixth Circuit pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b). Both parties appealed aspects of the District Court's rulings, and theCourt of Appeals heard the case en banc on the same day as
Grutter v. Bollinger. The Sixth Circuit later issued an opin-ion in

Grutter, upholding the admissions program used bythe University of Michigan Law School, and the petitioner in

that case sought a writ of certiorari from this Court. Peti-tioners asked this Court to grant certiorari in this case as

10 The District Court determined that respondents Bollinger and Duderstadt, who were sued in their individual capacities under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, were entitled to summary judgment based on the doctrine of qualified immunity. See 122 F. Supp. 2d, at 833-834. Petitioners
have not asked this Court to review this aspect of the District Court's
decision. The District Court denied the Board of Regents' motion for
summary judgment with respect to petitioners' Title VI claim on Eleventh
Amendment immunity grounds. See id., at 834-836. Respondents have
not asked this Court to review this aspect of the District Court's decision.

well, despite the fact that the Court of Appeals had not yetrendered a judgment, so that this Court could address the

Hamacher did not "actually appl[y] for admission as a trans-fer student[,] [h]is claim of future injury is at best `conjectural or hypothetical' rather than `real and immediate.' "Post, at 285 (dissenting opinion). But whether Hamacher
"actually applied" for admission as a transfer student is not

determinative of his ability to seek injunctive relief in thiscase. If Hamacher had submitted a transfer application and

been rejected, he would still need to allege an intent to applyagain in order to seek prospective relief. If

Justice Stevens means that because Hamacher did not apply to trans-fer, he must never really have intended to do so, that conclusion directly conflicts with the finding of fact entered bythe District Court that Hamacher "intends to transfer to
the University of Michigan when defendants cease the use ofrace as an admissions preference." App. 67.

It is well established that intent may be relevant to stand-ing in an equal protection challenge. In

Clements v. Fash-ing, 457 U. S. 957 (1982), for example, we considered a challenge to a provision of the Texas Constitution requiring theimmediate resignation of certain state officeholders upon
their announcement of candidacy for another office. We con-cluded that the plaintiff officeholders had Article III standing because they had alleged that they would have announced their candidacy for other offices were it not for the"automatic resignation" provision they were challenging.

Id., at 962; accord, Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346, 361-362,n. 23 (1970) (plaintiff who did not own property had standing
to challenge property ownership requirement for member-ship on school board even though there was no evidence that
plaintiff had applied and been rejected); Quinn v. Millsap,491 U. S. 95, 103, n. 8 (1989) (plaintiffs who did not own property had standing to challenge property ownership require-ment for membership on government board even though
they lacked standing to challenge the requirement "as ap-plied"). Likewise, in

Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associ-ated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S.

656 (1993), we considered whether an association challengingan ordinance that gave preferential treatment to certain

District Court "[r]equir[e] the LSA College to offer [him] admission as a
transfer student." App. 40.

Opinion of the Court
minority-owned businesses in the award of city contracts
needed to show that one of its members would have received
a contract absent the ordinance in order to establish standing. In finding that no such showing was necessary, we explained that "[t]he `injury in fact' in an equal protection case
of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from
the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to
obtain the benefit. . . . And in the context of a challenge to a
set-aside program, the `injury in fact' is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss
of contract." Id., at 666. We concluded that in the face of
such a barrier, "[t]o establish standing . . . , a party challenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville's need only demonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and that
a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal
basis." Ibid.

In bringing his equal protection challenge against the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions, Hamacher
alleged that the University had denied him the opportunity
to compete for admission on an equal basis. When Hamacher applied to the University as a freshman applicant,
he was denied admission even though an underrepresented
minority applicant with his qualifications would have been
admitted. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 115a. After being
denied admission, Hamacher demonstrated that he was
"able and ready" to apply as a transfer student should the
University cease to use race in undergraduate admissions.
He therefore has standing to seek prospective relief with
respect to the University's continued use of race in undergraduate admissions.

Justice Stevens raises a second argument as to standing. He contends that the University's use of race in undergraduate transfer admissions differs from its use of race in
undergraduate freshman admissions, and that therefore Hamacher lacks standing to represent absent class members
challenging the latter. Post, at 286-287 (dissenting opinion).

Opinion of the Court
As an initial matter, there is a question whether the rele-vance of this variation, if any, is a matter of Article III standing at all or whether it goes to the propriety of class certifi-cation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).
The parties have not briefed the question of standing versusadequacy, however, and we need not resolve the question
today: Regardless of whether the requirement is deemed oneof adequacy or standing, it is clearly satisfied in this case.

15

From the time petitioners filed their original complaintthrough their brief on the merits in this Court, they have

consistently challenged the University's use of race in under-graduate admissions and its asserted justification of promoting "diversity." See, e. g., App. 38; Brief for Petitioners 13.Consistent with this challenge, petitioners requested injunctive relief prohibiting respondents "from continuing to dis-criminate on the basis of race." App. 40. They sought to
certify a class consisting of all individuals who were notmembers of an underrepresented minority group who either
had applied for admission to the LSA and been rejected orwho intended to apply for admission to the LSA, for all academic years from 1995 forward. Id., at 35-36. The DistrictCourt determined that the proposed class satisfied the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, includ-ing the requirements of numerosity, commonality, and typicality. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a); App. 70. The courtfurther concluded that Hamacher was an adequate repre15 Although we do not resolve here whether such an inquiry in this case
is appropriately addressed under the rubric of standing or adequacy, we
note that there is tension in our prior cases in this regard. See, e. g.,
Burns, Standing and Mootness in Class Actions: A Search for Consistency,
22 U. C. D. L. Rev. 1239, 1240-1241 (1989); General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 149 (1982) (Mexican-American plaintiff alleging that he was passed over for a promotion because of race was not an
adequate representative to "maintain a class action on behalf of MexicanAmerican applicants" who were not hired by the same employer); Blum
v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991 (1982) (class representatives who had been transferred to lower levels of medical care lacked standing to challenge transfers to higher levels of care).

id., at 61-
69, and found "the record utterly devoid of the presence of. . . antagonism between the interests of . . . Hamacher, and

the members of the class which [he] seek[s] to represent," id.,at 61. Finally, the District Court concluded that petitioners'
claim was appropriate for class treatment because the University's " `practice of racial discrimination pervasively ap-plied on a classwide basis.' "

Id., at 67. The court certified the class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure23(b)(2), and designated Hamacher as the class representative. App. 70.

Justice Stevens cites Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991
(1982), in arguing that the District Court erred. Post, at
289. In Blum, we considered a class-action suit brought
by Medicaid beneficiaries. The named representatives in
Blum challenged decisions by the State's Medicaid Utilization Review Committee (URC) to transfer them to lower levels of care without, in their view, sufficient procedural safeguards. After a class was certified, the plaintiffs obtained
an order expanding class certification to include challenges
to URC decisions to transfer patients to higher levels of care
as well. The defendants argued that the named representatives could not represent absent class members challenging
transfers to higher levels of care because they had not been
threatened with such transfers. We agreed. We noted that
"[n]othing in the record . . . suggests that any of the individual respondents have been either transferred to more intensive care or threatened with such transfers." 457 U. S., at
1001. And we found that transfers to lower levels of care
involved a number of fundamentally different concerns than
did transfers to higher ones. Id., at 1001-1002 (noting, for
example, that transfers to lower levels of care implicated
beneficiaries' property interests given the concomitant decrease in Medicaid benefits, while transfers to higher levels
of care did not).

Opinion of the Court
In the present case, the University's use of race in under-graduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of racein undergraduate freshman admissions. Respondents challenged Hamacher's standing at the certification stage, but
never did so on the grounds that the University's use of race
in undergraduate transfer admissions involves a different set
of concerns than does its use of race in freshman admissions.Respondents' failure to allege any such difference is simply

consistent with the fact that no such difference exists. Eachyear the OUA produces a document entitled "COLLEGE OF
LITERATURE, SCIENCE AND THE ARTS GUIDELINES FOR ALL TERMS," which sets forth guidelines
for all individuals seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman applicants, transfer applicants, international
student applicants, and the like. See, e. g., 2 App. in
No. 01-1333 etc. (CA6), pp. 507-542. The guidelines used to
evaluate transfer applicants specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants. In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a
transfer applicant will contribute to the University's stated
goal of diversity are identical to that used to evaluate freshman applicants. For example, in 1997, when the class was
certified and the District Court found that Hamacher had
standing to represent the class, the transfer guidelines contained a separate section entitled "CONTRIBUTION TO A
DIVERSE STUDENT BODY." 2 id., at 531. This section
explained that any transfer applicant who could "contribut[e] to a diverse student body" should "generally be admitted" even with substantially lower qualifications than
those required of other transfer applicants. Ibid. (emphasis
added). To determine whether a transfer applicant was capable of "contribut[ing] to a diverse student body," admissions counselors were instructed to determine whether that
transfer applicant met the "criteria as defined in Section IV
of the `U' category of [the] SCUGA" factors used to assess

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG
266 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
freshman applicants. Ibid. Section IV of the "U" category,entitled "Contribution to a Diverse Class," explained that

"[t]he University is committed to a rich educational experi-ence for its students. A diverse, as opposed to a homogenous, student population enhances the educational experi-ence for all students. To insure a diverse class, significant
weight will be given in the admissions process to indicators
of students contribution to a diverse class." 1 id., at 432.These indicators, used in evaluating freshman and transfer

applicants alike, list being a member of an underrepresentedminority group as establishing an applicant's contribution to
diversity. See 3 id., at 1133-1134, 1153-1154. Indeed, the
only difference between the University's use of race in considering freshman and transfer applicants is that all under-represented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points

and "virtually" all who are minimally qualified are admitted,while "generally" all minimally qualified minority transfer
applicants are admitted outright. While this differencemight be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly
has no effect on petitioners' standing to challenge the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions and itsassertion that diversity is a compelling state interest that

justifies its consideration of the race of its undergraduateapplicants.

16

16 Because the University's guidelines concededly use race in evaluating
both freshman and transfer applications, and because petitioners have
challenged any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions,
the transfer admissions policy is very much before this Court. Although
petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer policy,
as counsel for petitioners repeatedly explained, the transfer policy is before this Court in that petitioners challenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 ("[T]he [transfer] policy is essentially the same with
respect to the consideration of race"); id., at 5 ("The transfer policy considers race"); id., at 6 (same); id., at 7 ("[T]he transfer policy and the [freshman] admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that

Opinion of the Court
Particularly instructive here is our statement in GeneralTelephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147 (1982),

that "[i]f [defendant-employer] used a biased testing proce-dure to evaluate both applicants for employment and incumbent employees, a class action on behalf of every applicantor employee who might have been prejudiced by the test
clearly would satisfy the . . . requirements of Rule 23(a)."
Id., at 159, n. 15 (emphasis added). Here, the District Courtfound that the sole rationale the University had provided for

any of its race-based preferences in undergraduate admis-sions was the interest in "the educational benefits that result
from having a diverse student body." App. to Pet. for Cert.8a. And petitioners argue that an interest in "diversity" is
not a compelling state interest that is ever capable of justify-ing the use of race in undergraduate admissions. See,

e. g.,
Brief for Petitioners 11-13. In sum, the same set of con-cerns is implicated by the University's use of race in evaluating all undergraduate admissions applications under theguidelines.

17 We therefore agree with the District Court's

they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory"); id., at 7-8 ("[T]he University considers race for a purpose to
achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck
down as a rationale, then the [result] would be [the] same with respect to
the transfer policy as with respect to the [freshman] admissions policy,
Your Honor").

17 Indeed, as the litigation history of this case demonstrates, "the classaction device save[d] the resources of both the courts and the parties by
permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion." Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,
701 (1979). This case was therefore quite unlike General Telephone Co.
of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147 (1982), in which we found that the
named representative, who had been passed over for a promotion, was not
an adequate representative for absent class members who were never
hired in the first instance. As we explained, the plaintiff's "evidentiary
approaches to the individual and class claims were entirely different. He
attempted to sustain his individual claim by proving intentional discrimination. He tried to prove the class claims through statistical evidence of

carefully considered decision to certify this class-action chal-lenge to the University's consideration of race in undergraduate admissions. See App. 67 (" `It is a singular policy . . .applied on a classwide basis' "); cf. Coopers & Lybrand v.
Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469 (1978) ("[T]he class determinationgenerally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the
factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff 's cause ofaction" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, classaction treatment was particularly important in this case be-cause "the claims of the individual students run the risk of
becoming moot" and the "[t]he class action vehicle . . . pro-vides a mechanism for ensuring that a justiciable claim is
before the Court." App. 69. Thus, we think it clear thatHamacher's personal stake, in view of both his past injury
and the potential injury he faced at the time of certifica-tion, demonstrates that he may maintain this class-action
challenge to the University's use of race in undergraduateadmissions.

Petitioners argue, first and foremost, that the University'suse of race in undergraduate admissions violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, they contend that thisCourt has only sanctioned the use of racial classifications to
remedy identified discrimination, a justification on which re-spondents have never relied. Brief for Petitioners 15-16.
Petitioners further argue that "diversity as a basis foremploying racial preferences is simply too open-ended, illdefined, and indefinite to constitute a compelling interest ca-pable of supporting narrowly-tailored means."

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners alternatively argue that even if the University's interest in diversity can constitute a compelling state
interest, the District Court erroneously concluded that the
University's use of race in its current freshman admissions
policy is narrowly tailored to achieve such an interest. Petitioners argue that the guidelines the University began using
in 1999 do not "remotely resemble the kind of consideration
of race and ethnicity that Justice Powell endorsed in Bakke."
Brief for Petitioners 18. Respondents reply that the University's current admissions program is narrowly tailored
and avoids the problems of the Medical School of the University of California at Davis program (U. C. Davis) rejected
by Justice Powell.18 They claim that their program "hews
closely" to both the admissions program described by Justice
Powell as well as the Harvard College admissions program
that he endorsed. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 32.
Specifically, respondents contend that the LSA's policy provides the individualized consideration that "Justice Powell
considered a hallmark of a constitutionally appropriate admissions program." Id., at 35. For the reasons set out
below, we do not agree.

18 U. C. Davis set aside 16 of the 100 seats available in its first year
medical school program for "economically and/or educationally disadvantaged" applicants who were also members of designated "minority groups"
as defined by the university. "To the extent that there existed a pool of
at least minimally qualified minority applicants to fill the 16 special admissions seats, white applicants could compete only for 84 seats in the entering class, rather than the 100 open to minority applicants." Regents of
Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 274, 289 (1978) (principal opinion).
Justice Powell found that the program employed an impermissible twotrack system that "disregard[ed] . . . individual rights as guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment." Id., at 320. He reached this conclusion
even though the university argued that "the reservation of a specified
number of seats in each class for individuals from the preferred ethnic
groups" was "the only effective means of serving the interest of diversity."
Id., at 315. Justice Powell concluded that such arguments misunderstood
the very nature of the diversity he found to be compelling. See ibid.

270 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
It is by now well established that "all racial classificationsreviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be

strictly scrutinized." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a,515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995). This " `standard of review . . . is
not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited bya particular classification.' "

Ibid. (quoting Richmond v.
J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 494 (1989) (plurality opinion)).
Thus, "any person, of whatever race, has the right to demandthat any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequaltreatment under the strictest of judicial scrutiny."

Adarand, 515 U. S., at 224.

To withstand our strict scrutiny analysis, respondents
must demonstrate that the University's use of race in its current admissions program employs "narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests." Id.,
at 227. Because "[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between
justification and classification," Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448
U. S. 448, 537 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting), our review of
whether such requirements have been met must entail " `a
most searching examination.' " Adarand, supra, at 223
(quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 273
(1986) (plurality opinion of Powell, J.)). We find that the
University's policy, which automatically distributes 20 points,
or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to
every single "underrepresented minority" applicant solely
because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity that respondents claim justifies
their program.

In Bakke, Justice Powell reiterated that "[p]referring
members of any one group for no reason other than race or
ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake." 438 U. S.,
at 307. He then explained, however, that in his view it
would be permissible for a university to employ an admissions program in which "race or ethnic background may be

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
deemed a `plus' in a particular applicant's file." Id., at 317.He explained that such a program might allow for "[t]he file

of a particular black applicant [to] be examined for his poten-tial contribution to diversity without the factor of race being
decisive when compared, for example, with that of an appli-cant identified as an Italian-American if the latter is thought
to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial educational pluralism." Ibid. Such a system, in Justice Powell'sview, would be "flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications ofeach applicant."

Ibid.
Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke emphasized the importance of considering each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses,
and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability to contribute
to the unique setting of higher education. The admissions
program Justice Powell described, however, did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a
specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. See id., at 315. See also Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.
FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 618 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting)
(concluding that the Federal Communications Commission's
policy, which "embodie[d] the related notions . . . that a particular applicant, by virtue of race or ethnicity alone, is more
valued than other applicants because [the applicant is] `likely
to provide [a] distinct perspective,' " "impermissibly value[d]
individuals" based on a presumption that "persons think in
a manner associated with their race"). Instead, under the
approach Justice Powell described, each characteristic of a
particular applicant was to be considered in assessing the
applicant's entire application.

The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration. The LSA's policy automatically distributes 20 points to every single applicant from an "underrepresented minority" group, as defined by the University. The
only consideration that accompanies this distribution of

272 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
points is a factual review of an application to determinewhether an individual is a member of one of these minority

groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell's example, wherethe race of a "particular black applicant" could be considered
without being decisive, see Bakke, 438 U. S., at 317, theLSA's automatic distribution of 20 points has the effect of
making "the factor of race . . . decisive" for virtually every
minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.
Ibid.19

Also instructive in our consideration of the LSA's systemis the example provided in the description of the Harvard

College Admissions Program, which Justice Powell both discussed in, and attached to, his opinion in Bakke. The example was included to "illustrate the kind of significance
attached to race" under the Harvard College program. Id.,
at 324. It provided as follows:

"The Admissions Committee, with only a few places left
to fill, might find itself forced to choose between A, the
child of a successful black physician in an academic community with promise of superior academic performance,
and B, a black who grew up in an inner-city ghetto of
semi-literate parents whose academic achievement was
lower but who had demonstrated energy and leadership
as well as an apparently-abiding interest in black power.
If a good number of black students much like A but few
like B had already been admitted, the Committee might
prefer B; and vice versa. If C, a white student with
extraordinary artistic talent, were also seeking one of
the remaining places, his unique quality might give him
an edge over both A and B. Thus, the critical criteria
are often individual qualities or experience not depend19 Justice Souter recognizes that the LSA's use of race is decisive in
practice, but he attempts to avoid that fact through unsupported speculation about the self-selection of minorities in the applicant pool. See post,
at 296 (dissenting opinion).

Opinion of the Court
ent upon race but sometimes associated with it." Ibid.(emphasis added).

This example further demonstrates the problematic natureof the LSA's admissions system. Even if student C's "extraordinary artistic talent" rivaled that of Monet or Picasso,the applicant would receive, at most, five points under the
LSA's system. See App. 234-235. At the same time, everysingle underrepresented minority applicant, including students A and B, would automatically receive 20 points for sub-mitting an application. Clearly, the LSA's system does not
offer applicants the individualized selection process de-scribed in Harvard's example. Instead of considering how
the differing backgrounds, experiences, and characteristicsof students A, B, and C might benefit the University, admissions counselors reviewing LSA applications would simplyaward both A and B 20 points because their applications indicate that they are African-American, and student C wouldreceive up to 5 points for his "extraordinary talent."

20

Respondents emphasize the fact that the LSA has createdthe possibility of an applicant's file being flagged for individualized consideration by the ARC. We think that the flag-ging program only emphasizes the flaws of the University's
system as a whole when compared to that described by Jus-tice Powell. Again, students A, B, and C illustrate the
point. First, student A would never be flagged. This is be-cause, as the University has conceded, the effect of automatically awarding 20 points is that virtually every qualified un-derrepresented minority applicant is admitted. Student A,
an applicant "with promise of superior academic perform-ance," would certainly fit this description. Thus, the result
of the automatic distribution of 20 points is that the Univer20 Justice Souter is therefore wrong when he contends that "applicants to the undergraduate college are [not] denied individualized consideration. " Post, at 295. As Justice O'Connor explains in her
concurrence, the LSA's program "ensures that the diversity contributions
of applicants cannot be individually assessed." Post, at 279.

539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG
274 GRATZ v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
sity would never consider student A's individual background,
experiences, and characteristics to assess his individual
"potential contribution to diversity," Bakke, supra, at 317.
Instead, every applicant like student A would simply be
admitted.

It is possible that students B and C would be flagged and
considered as individuals. This assumes that student B was
not already admitted because of the automatic 20-point distribution, and that student C could muster at least 70 additional points. But the fact that the "review committee can
look at the applications individually and ignore the points,"
once an application is flagged, Tr. of Oral Arg. 42, is of little
comfort under our strict scrutiny analysis. The record does
not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for
this individualized consideration, but it is undisputed that
such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the
operation of the LSA's admissions program. See App. to
Pet. for Cert. 117a ("The ARC reviews only a portion of all
of the applications. The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the
EWG").21 Additionally, this individualized review is only
provided after admissions counselors automatically distribute the University's version of a "plus" that makes race a
decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.

21 Justice Souter is mistaken in his assertion that the Court "take[s]
it upon itself to apply a newly-formulated legal standard to an undeveloped
record." Post, at 297, n. 3. He ignores the fact that respondents have
told us all that is necessary to decide this case. As explained above, respondents concede that only a portion of the applications are reviewed by
the ARC and that the "bulk of admissions decisions" are based on the
point system. It should be readily apparent that the availability of this
review, which comes after the automatic distribution of points, is far more
limited than the individualized review given to the "large middle group of
applicants" discussed by Justice Powell and described by the Harvard plan
in Bakke. 438 U. S., at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Opinion of the Court
Respondents contend that "[t]he volume of applications
and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for [LSA] to use the . . . admissions system" upheld
by the Court today in Grutter. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 6, n. 8. But the fact that the implementation of
a program capable of providing individualized consideration
might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system. See J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 508 (citing Frontiero v. Richardson,
411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.)
(rejecting " `administrative convenience' " as a determinant
of constitutionality in the face of a suspect classification)).
Nothing in Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke signaled that a
university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve
the stated goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by our strict scrutiny analysis.

We conclude, therefore, that because the University's use
of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted compelling
interest in diversity, the admissions policy violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.22 We further find that the admissions policy also violates Title VI and

22 Justice Ginsburg in her dissent observes that "[o]ne can reasonably
anticipate . . . that colleges and universities will seek to maintain their
minority enrollment . . . whether or not they can do so in full candor
through adoption of affirmative action plans of the kind here at issue."
Post, at 304. She goes on to say that "[i]f honesty is the best policy, surely
Michigan's accurately described, fully disclosed College affirmative action
program is preferable to achieving similar numbers through winks, nods,
and disguises." Post, at 305. These observations are remarkable for two
reasons. First, they suggest that universities--to whose academic judgment we are told in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 328, we should defer--
will pursue their affirmative-action programs whether or not they violate
the United States Constitution. Second, they recommend that these violations should be dealt with, not by requiring the universities to obey the
Constitution, but by changing the Constitution so that it conforms to the
conduct of the universities.

Unlike the law school admissions policy the Court upholds
today in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, p. 306, the procedures
employed by the University of Michigan's (University) Office
of Undergraduate Admissions do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants. Cf. Regents of Univ.
of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978) (principal opinion of
Powell, J.). The law school considers the various diversity
qualifications of each applicant, including race, on a case-bycase basis. See Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 337-339. By
contrast, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions relies on
the selection index to assign every underrepresented minority applicant the same, automatic 20-point bonus without
consideration of the particular background, experiences, or

23 We have explained that discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment committed by an institution
that accepts federal funds also constitutes a violation of Title VI. See
Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 281 (2001); United States v. Fordice,
505 U. S. 717, 732, n. 7 (1992); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 293
(1985). Likewise, with respect to $ 1981, we have explained that the provision was "meant, by its broad terms, to proscribe discrimination in the
making or enforcement of contracts against, or in favor of, any race." McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U. S. 273, 295-296 (1976). Furthermore, we have explained that a contract for educational services is a
"contract" for purposes of $ 1981. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160,
172 (1976). Finally, purposeful discrimination that violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will also violate $ 1981.

qualities of each individual applicant. Cf. ante, at 271-272,273. And this mechanized selection index score, by and

large, automatically determines the admissions decision foreach applicant. The selection index thus precludes admissions counselors from conducting the type of individualizedconsideration the Court's opinion in

Grutter, post, at 334, requires: consideration of each applicant's individualized qualifications, including the contribution each individual's race orethnic identity will make to the diversity of the student body,

taking into account diversity within and among all racial andethnic groups. Cf.

ante, at 272-273 (citing Bakke, supra,
at 324).On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District

Court held that the admissions policy the University insti-tuted in 1999 and continues to use today passed constitutional muster. See 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 827 (ED Mich. 2000).In their proposed summary of undisputed facts, the parties
jointly stipulated to the admission policy's mechanics. App.to Pet. for Cert. 116a-118a. When the University receives
an application for admission to its incoming class, an admissions counselor turns to a Selection Index Worksheet to cal-culate the applicant's selection index score out of 150 maximum possible points--a procedure the University began
using in 1998. App. 256. Applicants with a score of over
100 are automatically admitted; applicants with scores of 95
to 99 are categorized as "admit or postpone"; applicants with
90-94 points are postponed or admitted; applicants with
75-89 points are delayed or postponed; and applicants with
74 points or fewer are delayed or rejected. The Office of
Undergraduate Admissions extends offers of admission on a
rolling basis and acts upon the applications it has received
through periodic "[m]ass [a]ction[s]." Ibid.

In calculating an applicant's selection index score, counselors assign numerical values to a broad range of academic
factors, as well as to other variables the University considers
important to assembling a diverse student body, including
race. Up to 110 points can be assigned for academic per539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

O'Connor, J., concurring
formance, and up to 40 points can be assigned for the other,nonacademic factors. Michigan residents, for example, receive 10 points, and children of alumni receive 4. Counsel-ors may assign an outstanding essay up to 3 points and may
award up to 5 points for an applicant's personal achievement,leadership, or public service. Most importantly for this
case, an applicant automatically receives a 20 point bonus if
he or she possesses any one of the following "miscellaneous"factors: membership in an underrepresented minority group;

attendance at a predominantly minority or disadvantagedhigh school; or recruitment for athletics.

In 1999, the University added another layer of review to
its admissions process. After an admissions counselor has
tabulated an applicant's selection index score, he or she may
"flag" an application for further consideration by an Admissions Review Committee, which is composed of members
of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Office of
the Provost. App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a. The review committee meets periodically to discuss the files of "flagged" applicants not already admitted based on the selection index
parameters. App. 275. After discussing each flagged application, the committee decides whether to admit, defer, or
deny the applicant. Ibid.

Counselors may flag an applicant for review by the committee if he or she is academically prepared, has a selection
index score of at least 75 (for non-Michigan residents) or 80
(for Michigan residents), and possesses one of several qualities valued by the University. These qualities include "high
class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circumstances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage,
and under-represented race, ethnicity, or geography." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 117a. Counselors also have the discretion
to flag an application if, notwithstanding a high selection
index score, something in the applicant's file suggests that
the applicant may not be suitable for admission. App. 274.
Finally, in "rare circumstances," an admissions counselor

may flag an applicant with a selection index score below thedesignated levels if the counselor has reason to believe from

reading the entire file that the score does not reflect the ap-plicant's true promise. Ibid.

II
Although the Office of Undergraduate Admissions doesassign 20 points to some "soft" variables other than race,

the points available for other diversity contributions, suchas leadership and service, personal achievement, and geographic diversity, are capped at much lower levels. Eventhe most outstanding national high school leader could never
receive more than five points for his or her accomplish-ments--a mere quarter of the points automatically assigned
to an underrepresented minority solely based on the fact ofhis or her race. Of course, as Justice Powell made clear in
Bakke, a university need not "necessarily accor[d]" all diver-sity factors "the same weight," 438 U. S., at 317, and the
"weight attributed to a particular quality may vary fromyear to year depending upon the `mix' both of the student
body and the applicants for the incoming class," id., at 317-318. But the selection index, by setting up automatic, predetermined point allocations for the soft variables, ensuresthat the diversity contributions of applicants cannot be individually assessed. This policy stands in sharp contrast tothe law school's admissions plan, which enables admissions
officers to make nuanced judgments with respect to the con-tributions each applicant is likely to make to the diversity of
the incoming class. See Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 337("[T]he Law School's race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to stu-dent body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside
race in admissions decisions").The only potential source of individualized consideration
appears to be the Admissions Review Committee. The evi-dence in the record, however, reveals very little about how

O'Connor, J., concurring
the review committee actually functions. And what evidence there is indicates that the committee is a kind of afterthought, rather than an integral component of a system of
individualized review. As the Court points out, it is undisputed that the " `[committee] reviews only a portion of all of
the applications. The bulk of admissions decisions are executed based on selection index score parameters set by the
[Enrollment Working Group].' " Ante, at 274 (quoting App.
to Pet. for Cert. 117a). Review by the committee thus represents a necessarily limited exception to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions' general reliance on the selection
index. Indeed, the record does not reveal how many applications admissions counselors send to the review committee
each year, and the University has not pointed to evidence
demonstrating that a meaningful percentage of applicants
receives this level of discretionary review. In addition, eligibility for consideration by the committee is itself based on
automatic cutoff levels determined with reference to selection index scores. And there is no evidence of how the decisions are actually made--what type of individualized consideration is or is not used. Given these circumstances, the
addition of the Admissions Review Committee to the admissions process cannot offset the apparent absence of individualized consideration from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions' general practices.

For these reasons, the record before us does not support
the conclusion that the University's admissions program for
its College of Literature, Science, and the Arts--to the extent that it considers race--provides the necessary individualized consideration. The University, of course, remains
free to modify its system so that it does so. Cf. Grutter v.
Bollinger, post, p. 306. But the current system, as I understand it, is a nonindividualized, mechanical one. As a result,
I join the Court's opinion reversing the decision of the District Court.

I join the Court's opinion because I believe it correctlyapplies our precedents, including today's decision in

Grutterv. Bollinger, post, p. 306. For similar reasons to those given

in my separate opinion in that case, see post, p. 349 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part), however, I would
hold that a State's use of racial discrimination in higher edu-cation admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal
Protection Clause.I make only one further observation. The University of
Michigan's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts(LSA) admissions policy that the Court today invalidates
does not suffer from the additional constitutional defect ofallowing racial "discriminat[ion] among [the] groups" included within its definition of underrepresented minorities,
Grutter, post, at 336 (opinion of the Court); post, at 374(

Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),because it awards all underrepresented minorities the same

racial preference. The LSA policy falls, however, becauseit does not sufficiently allow for the consideration of nonracial distinctions among underrepresented minority ap-plicants. Under today's decisions, a university may not
racially discriminate between the groups constituting thecritical mass. See post, at 374-375; Grutter, post, at 329-
330 (opinion of the Court) (stating that such "racial balancing. . . is patently unconstitutional"). An admissions policy,
however, must allow for consideration of these nonracial dis-tinctions among applicants on both sides of the single permitted racial classification. See ante, at 272-273 (opinion of theCourt);

Petitioners seek forward-looking relief enjoining the Uni-versity of Michigan from continuing to use its current raceconscious freshman admissions policy. Yet unlike the plain-tiff in

Grutter v. Bollinger, post, p. 306,1 the petitioners inthis case had already enrolled at other schools before they

filed their class-action complaint in this case. Neither peti-tioner was in the process of reapplying to Michigan through
the freshman admissions process at the time this suit wasfiled, and neither has done so since. There is a total absence
of evidence that either petitioner would receive any benefitfrom the prospective relief sought by their lawyer. While
some unidentified members of the class may very well havestanding to seek prospective relief, it is clear that neither
petitioner does. Our precedents therefore require dismissalof the action.

Petitioner Jennifer Gratz applied in 1994 for admission tothe University of Michigan's (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as an undergraduate forthe 1995-1996 freshman class. After the University delayed
action on her application and then placed her name on anextended waiting list, Gratz decided to attend the University
of Michigan at Dearborn instead; she graduated in 1999.

Barbara Grutter alleged in her complaint that she "has not attended any
other law school" and that she "still desires to attend the Law School and
become a lawyer." App. in No. 02-241, p. 30.

Petitioner Patrick Hamacher applied for admission to LSAas an undergraduate for the 1997-1998 freshman class.

After the University postponed decision on his applicationand then placed his name on an extended waiting list, he
attended Michigan State University, graduating in 2001. Inthe complaint that petitioners filed on October 14, 1997, Hamacher alleged that "[h]e intends to apply to transfer [to the
University of Michigan] if the discriminatory admissions sys-tem described herein is eliminated." App. 34.

At the class certification stage, petitioners sought to haveHamacher represent a class pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).2 See App. 71, n. 3. In response,Michigan contended that "Hamacher lacks standing to represent a class seeking declaratory and injunctive relief." Id.,at 63. Michigan submitted that Hamacher suffered " `no
threat of imminent future injury' " given that he had alreadyenrolled at another undergraduate institution.

3 Id., at 64.

The District Court rejected Michigan's contention, conclud-ing that Hamacher had standing to seek injunctive relief because the complaint alleged that he intended to apply to
Michigan as a transfer student. See id., at 67 ("To the ex-tent that plaintiff Hamacher reapplies to the University of

Michigan, he will again face the same `harm' in that race willcontinue to be a factor in admissions"). The District Court,
accordingly, certified Hamacher as the sole class representa-tive and limited the claims of the class to injunctive and declaratory relief. See id., at 70-71.In subsequent proceedings, the District Court held that
the 1995-1998 admissions system, which was in effect when
both petitioners' applications were denied, was unlawful but

2 Petitioners did not seek to have Gratz represent the class pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). See App. 71, n. 3.

3 In arguing that Hamacher lacked standing, Michigan also asserted that

Hamacher "would need to achieve a 3.0 grade point average to attempt to
transfer to the University of Michigan." Id., at 64, n. 2. The District
Court rejected this argument, concluding that "Hamacher's present
grades are not a factor to be considered at this time." Id., at 67.

that Michigan's new 1999-2000 admissions system was law-ful. When petitioners sought certiorari from this Court,

Michigan did not cross-petition for review of the DistrictCourt's judgment concerning the admissions policies that
Michigan had in place when Gratz and Hamacher applied foradmission in 1994 and 1996 respectively. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 5, n. 7. Accordingly, we have be-fore us only that portion of the District Court's judgment
that upheld Michigan's new freshman admissions policy.

II
Both Hamacher and Gratz, of course, have standing to seekdamages as compensation for the alleged wrongful denial

of their respective applications under Michigan's old fresh-man admissions system. However, like the plaintiff in Los
Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95 (1983), who had standing torecover damages caused by "chokeholds" administered by
the police in the past but had no standing to seek injunctiverelief preventing future chokeholds, petitioners' past injuries
do not give them standing to obtain injunctive relief toprotect third parties from similar harms. See

id., at 102(" `[P]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show

a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . .if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects' " (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 495-496(1974))). To seek forward-looking, injunctive relief, petitioners must show that they face an imminent threat of fu-ture injury. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen

~ a, 515U. S. 200, 210-211 (1995). This they cannot do given that

when this suit was filed, neither faced an impending threatof future injury based on Michigan's new freshman admissions policy.4

4 In responding to questions about petitioners' standing at oral argument, petitioners' counsel alluded to the fact that Michigan might continually change the details of its admissions policy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Even though there is not a scintilla of evidence that the
freshman admissions program now being administered by respondents will ever have any impact on either Hamacher or
Gratz, petitioners nonetheless argue that Hamacher has a
personal stake in this suit because at the time the complaint
was filed, Hamacher intended to apply to transfer to Michigan once certain admission policy changes occurred.5 See
App. 34; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. Petitioners' attempt
to base Hamacher's standing in this suit on a hypothetical
transfer application fails for several reasons. First, there is
no evidence that Hamacher ever actually applied for admission as a transfer student at Michigan. His claim of future
injury is at best "conjectural or hypothetical" rather than
"real and immediate." O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S., at 494

reason why petitioners cannot establish standing to seek prospective relief. Rather, the reason they lack standing to seek forward-looking relief
is that when this suit was filed, neither faced a " `real and immediate
threat' " of future injury under Michigan's freshman admissions policy
given that they had both already enrolled at other institutions. Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 210-211 (1995) (quoting Los
Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 105 (1983)). Their decision to obtain a
college education elsewhere distinguishes this case from Allan Bakke's
single-minded pursuit of a medical education from the University of California at Davis. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265
(1978); cf. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam).

5 Hamacher clearly can no longer claim an intent to transfer into Michigan's undergraduate program given that he graduated from college in
2001. However, this fact alone is not necessarily fatal to the instant class
action because we have recognized that, if a named class representative
has standing at the time a suit is initiated, class actions may proceed in
some instances following mootness of the named class representative's
claim. See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 402 (1975) (holding that the
requisite Article III "case or controversy" may exist "between a named
defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff,
even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot"); Franks
v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747 (1976). The problem in this case is
that neither Gratz nor Hamacher had standing to assert a forward-looking,
injunctive claim in federal court at the time this suit was initiated.

Stevens, J., dissenting
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).

Second, as petitioners' counsel conceded at oral argument,the transfer policy is not before this Court and was not addressed by the District Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5 (ad-mitting that "[t]he transfer admissions policy itself is not before you--the Court"). Unlike the University's freshman
policy, which is detailed at great length in the Joint Appendixfiled with this Court, the specifics of the transfer policy are

conspicuously missing from the Joint Appendix filed withthis Court. Furthermore, the transfer policy is not discussed anywhere in the parties' briefs. Nor is it ever
even referenced in the District Court's Dec. 13, 2000, opinion
that upheld Michigan's new freshman admissions policy and
struck down Michigan's old policy. Nonetheless, evidence
filed with the District Court by Michigan demonstrates that
the criteria used to evaluate transfer applications at Michigan differ significantly from the criteria used to evaluate
freshman undergraduate applications. Of special significance, Michigan's 2000 freshman admissions policy, for example, provides for 20 points to be added to the selection index
scores of minority applicants. See ante, at 271. In contrast, Michigan does not use points in its transfer policy;
some applicants, including minority and socioeconomically
disadvantaged applicants, "will generally be admitted" if
they possess certain qualifications, including a 2.5 undergraduate grade point average (GPA), sophomore standing,
and a 3.0 high school GPA. 10 Record 16 (Exh. C). Because of these differences, Hamacher cannot base his right
to complain about the freshman admissions policy on his hypothetical injury under a wholly separate transfer policy.
For "[i]f the right to complain of one administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of all
administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect could bring the whole structure of state administration
before the courts for review." Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343,

been subject to injurious conduct of one kind [does not] pos-sess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating

conduct of another kind, although similar").6Third, the differences between the freshman and the
transfer admissions policies make it extremely unlikely, at
best, that an injunction requiring respondents to modify thefreshman admissions program would have any impact on

Michigan's transfer policy. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.737, 751 (1984) ("[R]elief from the injury must be `likely' to
follow from a favorable decision"); Schlesinger v. Reservists
Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 222 (1974) ("[T]he
discrete factual context within which the concrete injury oc-curred or is threatened insures the framing of relief no

broader than required by the precise facts to which thecourt's ruling would be applied"). This is especially true in
light of petitioners' unequivocal disavowal of any request for
equitable relief that would totally preclude the use of race in
the processing of all admissions applications. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 14-15.

The majority asserts that petitioners "have challenged
any use of race by the University in undergraduate admissions"--freshman and transfer alike. Ante, at 266, n. 16

both private and public universities, petitioners' counsel
stated: "Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that
we're arguing for here today. We are not suggesting an ab6 Under the majority's view of standing, there would be no end to Hamacher's ability to challenge any use of race by the University in a variety
of programs. For if Hamacher's right to complain about the transfer policy gives him standing to challenge the freshman policy, presumably his
ability to complain about the transfer policy likewise would enable him to
challenge Michigan's law school admissions policy, as well as any other
race-based admissions policy used by Michigan.

may be other reasons. I think they would have to be extraordinary and rare. . . ." Id., at 15. Consistent with
these statements, petitioners' briefs filed with this Court attack the University's asserted interest in "diversity" but acknowledge that race could be considered for remedial reasons. See, e. g., Brief for Petitioners 16-17.

Because Michigan's transfer policy was not challenged by
petitioners and is not before this Court, see supra, at 286,
we do not know whether Michigan would defend its transfer
policy on diversity grounds, or whether it might try to justify
its transfer policy on other grounds, such as a remedial interest. Petitioners' counsel was therefore incorrect in asserting at oral argument that if the University's asserted interest in "diversity" were to be "struck down as a rationale,
then the law would be [the] same with respect to the transfer
policy as with respect to the original [freshman admissions]
policy." Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8. And the majority is likewise
mistaken in assuming that "the University's use of race in
undergraduate transfer admissions does not implicate a significantly different set of concerns than does its use of race
in undergraduate freshman admissions." Ante, at 265. Because the transfer policy has never been the subject of this
suit, we simply do not know (1) whether Michigan would defend its transfer policy on "diversity" grounds or some other
grounds, or (2) how the absence of a point system in the
transfer policy might impact a narrow tailoring analysis of
that policy.

At bottom, petitioners' interest in obtaining an injunctionfor the benefit of younger third parties is comparable to that

Blum included patients who wanted a hearing before beingtransferred to facilities where they would receive more intensive care. The class representatives, however, were inthe category of patients threatened with a transfer to less
intensive care facilities. In explaining why the named classrepresentatives could not base their standing to sue on the
injury suffered by other members of the class, we stated:

"Respondents suggest that members of the class theyrepresent have been transferred to higher levels of care

as a result of [utilization review committee] decisions.Respondents, however, `must allege and show that they
personally have been injured, not that injury has beensuffered by other, unidentified members of the class to
which they belong and which they purport to represent.'Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 502 (1975). Unless these
individuals `can thus demonstrate the requisite case orcontroversy between themselves personally and [petitioners], "none may seek relief on behalf of himself orany other member of the class." O'Shea v. Littleton,
414 U. S. 488, 494 (1974).' Ibid." 457 U. S., at 1001,n. 13.

Much like the class representatives in Blum, Hamacher--the sole class representative in this case--cannot meet Article III's threshold personal-stake requirement. While un-identified members of the class he represents may well have
standing to challenge Michigan's current freshman admis-sions policy, Hamacher cannot base his standing to sue on
injuries suffered by other members of the class.

have standing to litigate on behalf of themselves. Accord-ingly, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins asto Part II, dissenting.
I agree with Justice Stevens that Patrick Hamacher hasno standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief against a
freshman admissions policy that will never cause him anyharm. I write separately to note that even the Court's new
gloss on the law of standing should not permit it to reach theissue it decides today. And because a majority of the Court
has chosen to address the merits, I also add a word to saythat even if the merits were reachable, I would dissent from
the Court's judgment. I

The Court's finding of Article III standing rests on twopropositions: first, that both the University of Michigan's undergraduate college's transfer policy and its freshman admis-sions policy seek to achieve student body diversity through
the "use of race," ante, at 261-263, 265-269, and second, thatHamacher has standing to challenge the transfer policy on
the grounds that diversity can never be a "compelling stateinterest" justifying the use of race in any admissions decision, freshman or transfer, ante, at 269. The Court con-cludes that, because Hamacher's argument, if successful,
would seal the fate of both policies, his standing to challengethe transfer policy also allows him to attack the freshman
admissions policy. Ante, at 266, n. 16 ("[P]etitioners chal-lenged any use of race by the University to promote diversity, including through the transfer policy"); ante, at 267,n. 16 (" `[T]he University considers race for a purpose to
achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and ifthat is struck down as a rationale, then the [result] would be
[the] same with respect to the transfer policy as with respectto the [freshman] admissions policy, Your Honor' " (quoting
Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8)). I agree with Justice Stevens's cri539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Souter, J., dissenting
tique that the Court thus ignores the basic principle of Article III standing that a plaintiff cannot challenge a government program that does not apply to him. See ante, at
286-287, and n. 6 (dissenting opinion).1

But even on the Court's indulgent standing theory, the decision should not go beyond a recognition that diversity can
serve as a compelling state interest justifying race-conscious
decisions in education. Ante, at 268 (citing Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 327-333). Since, as the Court says, "petitioners did not raise a narrow tailoring challenge to the transfer
policy," ante, at 266, n. 16, our decision in Grutter is fatal to
Hamacher's sole attack upon the transfer policy, which is the
only policy before this Court that he claims aggrieved him.
Hamacher's challenge to that policy having failed, his standing is presumably spent. The further question whether

the freshman admissions plan is narrowly tailored to achieving student body diversity remains legally irrelevant to
Hamacher and should await a plaintiff who is actually hurt
by it.2

1 The Court's holding arguably exposes a weakness in the rule of Blum
v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991 (1982), that Article III standing may not be
satisfied by the unnamed members of a duly certified class. But no party
has invited us to reconsider Blum, and I follow Justice Stevens in approaching the case on the assumption that Blum is settled law.

2 For that matter, as the Court suggests, narrow tailoring challenges

against the two policies could well have different outcomes. Ante, at 266.
The record on the decisionmaking process for transfer applicants is understandably thin, given that petitioners never raised a narrow tailoring challenge against it. Most importantly, however, the transfer policy does not
use a points-based "selection index" to evaluate transfer applicants, but
rather considers race as one of many factors in making the general determination whether the applicant would make a " `contribution to a diverse
student body.' " Ante, at 265 (quoting 2 App. in No. 01-1333 etc. (CA6),
p. 531 (capitalization omitted)). This limited glimpse into the transfer policy at least permits the inference that the university engages in a "holistic
review" of transfer applications consistent with the program upheld today
in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 337.

II
The cases now contain two pointers toward the line between the valid and the unconstitutional in race-conscious
admissions schemes. Grutter reaffirms the permissibility of
individualized consideration of race to achieve a diversity of
students, at least where race is not assigned a preordained
value in all cases. On the other hand, Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978),
rules out a racial quota or set-aside, in which race is the sole
fact of eligibility for certain places in a class. Although the
freshman admissions system here is subject to argument on
the merits, I think it is closer to what Grutter approves than
to what Bakke condemns, and should not be held unconstitutional on the current record.

The record does not describe a system with a quota like
the one struck down in Bakke, which "insulate[d]" all nonminority candidates from competition from certain seats.
Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.); see also Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 496 (1989) (plurality
opinion) (stating that Bakke invalidated "a plan that completely eliminated nonminorities from consideration for a
specified percentage of opportunities"). The Bakke plan "focused solely on ethnic diversity" and effectively told nonminority applicants that "[n]o matter how strong their qualifications, quantitative and extracurricular, including their own
potential for contribution to educational diversity, they are
never afforded the chance to compete with applicants from
the preferred groups for the [set-aside] special admissions
seats." Bakke, supra, at 315, 319 (opinion of Powell, J.) (emphasis in original).

The plan here, in contrast, lets all applicants compete for
all places and values an applicant's offering for any place not
only on grounds of race, but on grades, test scores, strength
of high school, quality of course of study, residence, alumni
relationships, leadership, personal character, socioeconomic

disadvantage, athletic ability, and quality of a personal essay.
Ante, at 255. A nonminority applicant who scores highly in
these other categories can readily garner a selection indexexceeding that of a minority applicant who gets the 20-point

bonus. Cf. Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara
Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 638 (1987) (upholding a program in which
gender "was but one of numerous factors [taken] into account
in arriving at [a] decision" because "[n]o persons are automat-ically excluded from consideration; all are able to have their

qualifications weighed against those of other applicants" (em-phasis deleted)).

Subject to one qualification to be taken up below, thisscheme of considering, through the selection index system,
all of the characteristics that the college thinks relevant tostudent diversity for every one of the student places to be
filled fits Justice Powell's description of a constitutionally ac-ceptable program: one that considers "all pertinent elements
of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of eachapplicant" and places each element "on the same footing for
consideration, although not necessarily according them the
same weight." Bakke, supra, at 317. In the Court's ownwords, "each characteristic of a particular applicant [is]

considered in assessing the applicant's entire application."
Ante, at 271. An unsuccessful nonminority applicant cannot
complain that he was rejected "simply because he was not
the right color"; an applicant who is rejected because "his
combined qualifications . . . did not outweigh those of the
other applicant" has been given an opportunity to compete
with all other applicants. Bakke, supra, at 318 (opinion of
Powell, J.).

The one qualification to this description of the admissions
process is that membership in an underrepresented minority
is given a weight of 20 points on the 150-point scale. On the
face of things, however, this assignment of specific points
does not set race apart from all other weighted considerations. Nonminority students may receive 20 points for athletic ability, socioeconomic disadvantage, attendance at a so539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Souter, J., dissenting
cioeconomically disadvantaged or predominantly minorityhigh school, or at the Provost's discretion; they may also receive 10 points for being residents of Michigan, 6 for resi-dence in an underrepresented Michigan county, 5 for leadership and service, and so on.The Court nonetheless finds fault with a scheme that
"automatically" distributes 20 points to minority applicants
because "[t]he only consideration that accompanies this dis-tribution of points is a factual review of an application to

determine whether an individual is a member of one of theseminority groups."

Ante, at 271-272. The objection goes to
the use of points to quantify and compare characteristics, orto the number of points awarded due to race, but on either

reading the objection is mistaken.The very nature of a college's permissible practice of
awarding value to racial diversity means that race must beconsidered in a way that increases some applicants' chances
for admission. Since college admission is not left entirely toinarticulate intuition, it is hard to see what is inappropriate
in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic,
whether it be reasoning ability, writing style, running speed,or minority race. Justice Powell's plus factors necessarily

are assigned some values. The college simply does by a
numbered scale what the law school accomplishes in its "holistic review," Grutter, post, at 337; the distinction does not
imply that applicants to the undergraduate college are denied individualized consideration or a fair chance to compete
on the basis of all the various merits their applications may
disclose.

Nor is it possible to say that the 20 points convert race into
a decisive factor comparable to reserving minority places as
in Bakke. Of course we can conceive of a point system in
which the "plus" factor given to minority applicants would
be so extreme as to guarantee every minority applicant a
higher rank than every nonminority applicant in the university's admissions system, see 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53 (opinion
of Powell, J.). But petitioners do not have a convincing ar539US1 Unit: $U76 [07-07-05 08:48:20] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Souter, J., dissenting
gument that the freshman admissions system operates thisway. The present record obviously shows that nonminority

applicants may achieve higher selection point totals than mi-nority applicants owing to characteristics other than race,
and the fact that the university admits "virtually every qual-ified under-represented minority applicant," App. to Pet. for
Cert. 111a, may reflect nothing more than the likelihood that
very few qualified minority applicants apply, Brief for Re-spondent Bollinger et al. 39, as well as the possibility that

self-selection results in a strong minority applicant pool. Itsuffices for me, as it did for the District Court, that there
are no Bakke-like set-asides and that consideration of an ap-plicant's whole spectrum of ability is no more ruled out by
giving 20 points for race than by giving the same points forathletic ability or socioeconomic disadvantage.

Any argument that the "tailoring" amounts to a set-aside,then, boils down to the claim that a plus factor of 20 points
makes some observers suspicious, where a factor of 10 pointsmight not. But suspicion does not carry petitioners' ultimate burden of persuasion in this constitutional challenge,
Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 287-288 (1986)(plurality opinion of Powell, J.), and it surely does not warrant condemning the college's admissions scheme on this record. Because the District Court (correctly, in my view) did
not believe that the specific point assignment was constitutionally troubling, it made only limited and general findings
on other characteristics of the university's admissions practice, such as the conduct of individualized review by the Admissions Review Committee. 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 829-830
(ED Mich. 2000). As the Court indicates, we know very little about the actual role of the review committee. Ante, at
274 ("The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged for this individualized consideration [by the
committee]"); see also ante, at 279-280 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("The evidence in the record . . . reveals very little
about how the review committee actually functions"). The
point system cannot operate as a de facto set-aside if the

Souter, J., dissenting
greater admissions process, including review by the committee, results in individualized review sufficient to meet the
Court's standards. Since the record is quiet, if not silent, on
the case-by-case work of the committee, the Court would be
on more defensible ground by vacating and remanding for
evidence about the committee's specific determinations.3

Without knowing more about how the Admissions Review
Committee actually functions, it seems especially unfair to
treat the candor of the admissions plan as an Achilles' heel.
In contrast to the college's forthrightness in saying just what
plus factor it gives for membership in an underrepresented
minority, it is worth considering the character of one alternative thrown up as preferable, because supposedly not based
on race. Drawing on admissions systems used at public universities in California, Florida, and Texas, the United States
contends that Michigan could get student diversity in satisfaction of its compelling interest by guaranteeing admission
to a fixed percentage of the top students from each high
school in Michigan. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Grutter
v. Bollinger, O. T. 2002, No. 02-241, pp. 13-17.

While there is nothing unconstitutional about such a practice, it nonetheless suffers from a serious disadvantage.4 It

3 The Court surmises that the committee does not contribute meaningfully to the university's individualized review of applications. Ante, at
273-274. The Court should not take it upon itself to apply a newly formulated legal standard to an undeveloped record. Given the District Court's
statement that the committee may examine "any number of applicants,
including applicants other than under-represented minority applicants,"
122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 830 (ED Mich. 2000), it is quite possible that further
factual development would reveal the committee to be a "source of individualized consideration" sufficient to satisfy the Court's rule, ante, at 279
(O'Connor, J., concurring). Determination of that issue in the first instance is a job for the District Court, not for this Court on a record that
is admittedly lacking.

4 Of course it might be pointless in the State of Michigan, where minorities are a much smaller fraction of the population than in California, Florida, or Texas. Brief for Respondents Bollinger et al. 48-49.

is the disadvantage of deliberate obfuscation. The "percent-age plans" are just as race conscious as the point scheme

(and fairly so), but they get their racially diverse resultswithout saying directly what they are doing or why they are
doing it. In contrast, Michigan states its purpose directlyand, if this were a doubtful case for me, I would be tempted
to give Michigan an extra point of its own for its frankness.Equal protection cannot become an exercise in which the

may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and
inclusion. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,
316 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Actions designed to
burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not
sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when
entrenched discrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated. See Carter, When Victims Happen To Be Black,
97 Yale L. J. 420, 433-434 (1988) ("[T]o say that two centuries
of struggle for the most basic of civil rights have been mostly
about freedom from racial categorization rather than freedom from racial oppressio[n] is to trivialize the lives and
deaths of those who have suffered under racism. To pretend
. . . that the issue presented in [Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.
Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978)] was the same as the issue in
[Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)] is to
pretend that history never happened and that the present
doesn't exist.").

Our jurisprudence ranks race a "suspect" category, "not
because [race] is inevitably an impermissible classification,
but because it is one which usually, to our national shame,
has been drawn for the purpose of maintaining racial
inequality. " Norwalk Core v. Norwalk Redevelopment
Agency, 395 F. 2d 920, 931-932 (CA2 1968) (footnote omitted).
But where race is considered "for the purpose of achieving
equality," id., at 932, no automatic proscription is in order.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
For, as insightfully explained: "The Constitution is both colorblind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal

protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causesharm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In
that sense, the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitu-tion is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination."
United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Ed., 372 F. 2d 836,876 (CA5 1966) (Wisdom, J.); see Wechsler, The Nationalization of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights, Supp. to 12 Tex. Q.10, 23 (1968) (Brown may be seen as disallowing racial classifications that "impl[y] an invidious assessment" while allow-ing such classifications when "not invidious in implication"
but advanced to "correct inequalities"). Contemporaryhuman rights documents draw just this line; they distinguish
between policies of oppression and measures designed to ac-celerate de facto equality. See Grutter, post, at 344 (

Ginsburg, J., concurring) (citing the United Nations-initiatedConventions on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimi-nation against Women).

The mere assertion of a laudable governmental purpose, ofcourse, should not immunize a race-conscious measure from
careful judicial inspection. See Jefferson County, 372 F. 2d,at 876 ("The criterion is the relevancy of color to a legitimate
governmental purpose."). Close review is needed "to ferretout classifications in reality malign, but masquerading as benign," Adarand, 515 U. S., at 275 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting),and to "ensure that preferences are not so large as to trammel unduly upon the opportunities of others or interfere tooharshly with legitimate expectations of persons in oncepreferred groups," id., at 276.

Justice Souter, I see no constitutional infirmity. Seeante, at 293-298 (dissenting opinion). Like other topranking institutions, the College has many more applicantsfor admission than it can accommodate in an entering class.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a. Every applicant admitted underthe current plan, petitioners do not here dispute, is qualified
to attend the College. Id., at 111a. The racial and ethnicgroups to which the College accords special consideration
(African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native-Americans) his-torically have been relegated to inferior status by law and
social practice; their members continue to experience class-based discrimination to this day, see

supra, at 298-301.There is no suggestion that the College adopted its current

policy in order to limit or decrease enrollment by any particu-lar racial or ethnic group, and no seats are reserved on the
basis of race. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 10;Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42 (in the range between 75 and 100 points,
the review committee may look at applications individuallyand ignore the points). Nor has there been any demonstration that the College's program unduly constricts admissionsopportunities for students who do not receive special consideration based on race. Cf. Liu, The Causation Fallacy: Bakkeand the Basic Arithmetic of Selective Admissions, 100 Mich.
L. Rev. 1045, 1049 (2002) ("In any admissions process whereapplicants greatly outnumber admittees, and where white
applicants greatly outnumber minority applicants, substantialpreferences for minority applicants will not significantly
diminish the odds of admission facing white applicants.").10

10 The United States points to the "percentage plans" used in California,
Florida, and Texas as one example of a "race-neutral alternativ[e]" that
would permit the College to enroll meaningful numbers of minority students. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14; see U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Beyond Percentage Plans: The Challenge of Equal
Opportunity in Higher Education 1 (Nov. 2002), http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/

me disingenuous, for they "unquestionably were adopted with the specific

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The stain of generations of racial oppression is still visiblein our society, see Krieger, 86 Calif. L. Rev., at 1253, and the

determination to hasten its removal remains vital. One canreasonably anticipate, therefore, that colleges and universities will seek to maintain their minority enrollment--andthe networks and opportunities thereby opened to minority
graduates--whether or not they can do so in full candor
through adoption of affirmative action plans of the kind hereat issue. Without recourse to such plans, institutions of

higher education may resort to camouflage. For example,schools may encourage applicants to write of their cultural
traditions in the essays they submit, or to indicate whetherEnglish is their second language. Seeking to improve their
chances for admission, applicants may highlight the minoritygroup associations to which they belong, or the Hispanic surnames of their mothers or grandparents. In turn, teachers'recommendations may emphasize who a student is as much
as what he or she has accomplished. See, e. g., Steinberg,

in the public higher education system." Brief for Respondent Bollinger

http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/affirmativeaction/

tristate.pdf. Percentage plans depend for their effectiveness on continued racial segregation at the secondary school level: They can ensure significant minority enrollment in universities only if the majority-minority
high school population is large enough to guarantee that, in many schools,
most of the students in the top 10% or 20% are minorities. Moreover,
because such plans link college admission to a single criterion--high school
class rank--they create perverse incentives. They encourage parents to
keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage
students from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade
point averages. See Selingo, What States Aren't Saying About the `XPercent Solution,' Chronicle of Higher Education, June 2, 2000, p. A31.
And even if percentage plans could boost the sheer numbers of minority
enrollees at the undergraduate level, they do not touch enrollment in graduate and professional schools.

government officials to respond openly to the continuing importance of
race. See supra, at 301-302. Among constitutionally permissible options, those that candidly disclose their consideration of race seem to me
preferable to those that conceal it.

GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 02-241. Argued April 1, 2003--Decided June 23, 2003
The University of Michigan Law School (Law School), one of the Nation's

top law schools, follows an official admissions policy that seeks to achieve
student body diversity through compliance with Regents of Univ. of Cal.
v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265. Focusing on students' academic ability coupled
with a flexible assessment of their talents, experiences, and potential,
the policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based
on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, an essay describing how the applicant
will contribute to Law School life and diversity, and the applicant's undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admission Test
(LSAT) score. Additionally, officials must look beyond grades and
scores to so-called "soft variables," such as recommenders' enthusiasm,
the quality of the undergraduate institution and the applicant's essay,
and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection. The policy does not define diversity solely in terms of racial and ethnic status
and does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for
"substantial weight," but it does reaffirm the Law School's commitment
to diversity with special reference to the inclusion of African-American,
Hispanic, and Native-American students, who otherwise might not be
represented in the student body in meaningful numbers. By enrolling
a "critical mass" of underrepresented minority students, the policy seeks
to ensure their ability to contribute to the Law School's character and
to the legal profession.

When the Law School denied admission to petitioner Grutter, a white
Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score, she filed this suit,
alleging that respondents had discriminated against her on the basis of
race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U. S. C. $ 1981; that she was rejected because
the Law School uses race as a "predominant" factor, giving applicants
belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of
admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial
groups; and that respondents had no compelling interest to justify that
use of race. The District Court found the Law School's use of race as
an admissions factor unlawful. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that
Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing

539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Syllabus
diversity as a compelling state interest, and that the Law School's use
of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a "potential `plus'
factor" and because the Law School's program was virtually identical to
the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion.

Held: The Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body is not prohibited by the Equal
Protection Clause, Title VI, or $ 1981. Pp. 322-344.

(a) In the landmark Bakke case, this Court reviewed a medical
school's racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats for
members of certain minority groups. The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority. Four Justices
would have upheld the program on the ground that the government
can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial
prejudice. 438 U. S., at 325. Four other Justices would have struck
the program down on statutory grounds. Id., at 408. Justice Powell,
announcing the Court's judgment, provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the program, but also for reversing the state court's injunction against any use of race whatsoever. In a part of his opinion that
was joined by no other Justice, Justice Powell expressed his view that
attaining a diverse student body was the only interest asserted by the
university that survived scrutiny. Id., at 311. Grounding his analysis
in the academic freedom that "long has been viewed as a special concern
of the First Amendment," id., at 312, 314, Justice Powell emphasized
that the " `nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide
exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation."
Id., at 313. However, he also emphasized that "[i]t is not an interest in
simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student
body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,"
that can justify using race. Id., at 315. Rather, "[t]he diversity that
furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of
qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but
a single though important element." Ibid. Since Bakke, Justice Powell's opinion has been the touchstone for constitutional analysis of raceconscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across
the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice
Powell's views. Courts, however, have struggled to discern whether
Justice Powell's diversity rationale is binding precedent. The Court
finds it unnecessary to decide this issue because the Court endorses
Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state
interest in the context of university admissions. Pp. 322-325.

Syllabus
(b) All government racial classifications must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 227. But not all such uses are invalidated by strict
scrutiny. Race-based action necessary to further a compelling governmental interest does not violate the Equal Protection Clause so long as
it is narrowly tailored to further that interest. E. g., Shaw v. Hunt,
517 U. S. 899, 908. Context matters when reviewing such action. See
Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed
to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the
sincerity of the government's reasons for using race in a particular context. Pp. 326-327.

(c) The Court endorses Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in university admissions. The Court defers to the Law School's educational
judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission. The
Court's scrutiny of that interest is no less strict for taking into account
complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the
university's expertise. See, e. g., Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53 (opinion
of Powell, J.). Attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the
Law School's proper institutional mission, and its "good faith" is "presumed" absent "a showing to the contrary." Id., at 318-319. Enrolling
a "critical mass" of minority students simply to assure some specified
percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic
origin would be patently unconstitutional. E. g., id., at 307. But the
Law School defines its critical mass concept by reference to the substantial, important, and laudable educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce, including cross-racial understanding and the breaking down of racial stereotypes. The Law School's claim is further
bolstered by numerous expert studies and reports showing that such
diversity promotes learning outcomes and better prepares students for
an increasingly diverse work force, for society, and for the legal profession. Major American businesses have made clear that the skills
needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed
through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. High-ranking retired officers and civilian military leaders assert that a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to
national security. Moreover, because universities, and in particular,
law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of the
Nation's leaders, Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634, the path to leadership must be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every
race and ethnicity. Thus, the Law School has a compelling interest in
attaining a diverse student body. Pp. 327-333.

(d) The Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a
narrowly tailored plan. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot "insulat[e] each category of applicants with
certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants." Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, it may
consider race or ethnicity only as a " `plus' in a particular applicant's
file"; i. e., it must be "flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements
of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,
and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not
necessarily according them the same weight," id., at 317. It follows
that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial
or ethnic groups or put them on separate admissions tracks. See id.,
at 315-316. The Law School's admissions program, like the Harvard
plan approved by Justice Powell, satisfies these requirements. Moreover, the program is flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is
evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes race or ethnicity
the defining feature of the application. See id., at 317. The Law
School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant
might contribute to a diverse educational environment. There is no
policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection
based on any single "soft" variable. Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 244,
distinguished. Also, the program adequately ensures that all factors
that may contribute to diversity are meaningfully considered alongside
race. Moreover, the Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority
applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. The
Court rejects the argument that the Law School should have used other
race-neutral means to obtain the educational benefits of student body
diversity, e. g., a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis on GPA and
LSAT scores. Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every
conceivable race-neutral alternative or mandate that a university choose
between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial
groups. See, e. g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280,
n. 6. The Court is satisfied that the Law School adequately considered
the available alternatives. The Court is also satisfied that, in the context of individualized consideration of the possible diversity contributions of each applicant, the Law School's race-conscious admissions
program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants. Finally, raceconscious admissions policies must be limited in time. The Court takes
the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find
a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial

preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years
from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to
further the interest approved today. Pp. 333-343.

(e) Because the Law School's use of race in admissions decisions is
not prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause, petitioner's statutory
claims based on Title VI and $ 1981 also fail. See Bakke, supra, at

diverse ways to the well-being of others." App. 110. More
broadly, the Law School seeks "a mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn
from each other." Ibid. In 1992, the dean of the Law
School charged a faculty committee with crafting a written
admissions policy to implement these goals. In particular,
the Law School sought to ensure that its efforts to achieve
student body diversity complied with this Court's most recent ruling on the use of race in university admissions. See

Opinion of the Court
Upon the unanimous adoption of the committee's report bythe Law School faculty, it became the Law School's official

admissions policy.The hallmark of that policy is its focus on academic ability
coupled with a flexible assessment of applicants' talents, ex-periences, and potential "to contribute to the learning of
those around them." App. 111. The policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the in-formation available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing theways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and
diversity of the Law School. Id., at 83-84, 114-121. In reviewing an applicant's file, admissions officials must consider
the applicant's undergraduate grade point average (GPA)
and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score because they
are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success
in law school. Id., at 112. The policy stresses that "no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant
to do well enough to graduate with no serious academic problems." Id., at 111.

The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest
possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law
School. Id., at 113. Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant. Ibid. Rather, the policy requires admissions officials to look beyond grades and test scores to
other criteria that are important to the Law School's educational objectives. Id., at 114. So-called " `soft' variables"
such as "the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of
the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant's
essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course
selection" are all brought to bear in assessing an "applicant's
likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the
institution." Ibid.

The policy aspires to "achieve that diversity which has the
potential to enrich everyone's education and thus make a law
school class stronger than the sum of its parts." Id., at 118.

316 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
The policy does not restrict the types of diversity contri-butions eligible for "substantial weight" in the admissions

process, but instead recognizes "many possible bases for di-versity admissions." Id., at 118, 120. The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School's longstanding commitmentto "one particular type of diversity," that is, "racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of stu-dents from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and NativeAmericans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers." Id.,at 120. By enrolling a " `critical mass' of [underrepresented]
minority students," the Law School seeks to "ensur[e] theirability to make unique contributions to the character of the
Law School." Id., at 120-121.The policy does not define diversity "solely in terms of
racial and ethnic status." Id., at 121. Nor is the policy "in-sensitive to the competition among all students for admission
to the [L]aw [S]chool." Ibid. Rather, the policy seeks toguide admissions officers in "producing classes both diverse
and academically outstanding, classes made up of studentswho promise to continue the tradition of outstanding contribution by Michigan Graduates to the legal profession."Ibid.

Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan residentwho applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 GPA and

161 LSAT score. The Law School initially placed petitioneron a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her application.
In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against
the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan,Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law School from 1987 to 1994,
and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to2002), Jeffrey Lehman (Dean of the Law School), and Dennis

until 1998). Petitioner alleged that respondents discrimi-nated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d; and Rev. Stat. $ 1977, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981.Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a "predominant"
factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minoritygroups "a significantly greater chance of admission than

students with similar credentials from disfavored racialgroups." App. 33-34. Petitioner also alleged that respondents "had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in
the admissions process." Id., at 34. Petitioner requested
compensatory and punitive damages, an order requiring the
Law School to offer her admission, and an injunction prohibiting the Law School from continuing to discriminate on the
basis of race. Id., at 36. Petitioner clearly has standing to
bring this lawsuit. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated
Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656,
666 (1993).

The District Court granted petitioner's motion for class
certification and for bifurcation of the trial into liability and
damages phases. The class was defined as " `all persons who
(A) applied for and were not granted admission to the University of Michigan Law School for the academic years since
(and including) 1995 until the time that judgment is entered
herein; and (B) were members of those racial or ethnic
groups, including Caucasian, that Defendants treated less favorably in considering their applications for admission to the
Law School.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a-192a.

The District Court heard oral argument on the parties'
cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.
Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the
Law School's asserted interest in obtaining the educational
benefits that flow from a diverse student body was compel539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
ling. The District Court also indicated that it would con-duct a bench trial on the extent to which race was a factor

in the Law School's admissions decisions, and whether theLaw School's consideration of race in admissions decisions
constituted a race-based double standard.During the 15-day bench trial, the parties introduced extensive evidence concerning the Law School's use of race in
the admissions process. Dennis Shields, Director of Admis-sions when petitioner applied to the Law School, testified

that he did not direct his staff to admit a particular percent-age or number of minority students, but rather to consider
an applicant's race along with all other factors. Id., at 206a.
Shields testified that at the height of the admissions season,
he would frequently consult the so-called "daily reports" that
kept track of the racial and ethnic composition of the class
(along with other information such as residency status and
gender). Id., at 207a. This was done, Shields testified, to
ensure that a critical mass of underrepresented minority students would be reached so as to realize the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Ibid. Shields stressed, however, that he did not seek to admit any particular number or
percentage of underrepresented minority students. Ibid.

Erica Munzel, who succeeded Shields as Director of Admissions, testified that " `critical mass' " means " `meaningful
numbers' " or " `meaningful representation,' " which she understood to mean a number that encourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom and
not feel isolated. Id., at 208a-209a. Munzel stated there is
no number, percentage, or range of numbers or percentages
that constitute critical mass. Id., at 209a. Munzel also asserted that she must consider the race of applicants because
a critical mass of underrepresented minority students could
not be enrolled if admissions decisions were based primarily
on undergraduate GPAs and LSAT scores. Ibid.

The current Dean of the Law School, Jeffrey Lehman, also
testified. Like the other Law School witnesses, Lehman did

539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

319Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
not quantify critical mass in terms of numbers or percent-ages.

Id., at 211a. He indicated that critical mass means
numbers such that underrepresented minority students donot feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race.

Ibid.
When asked about the extent to which race is considered inadmissions, Lehman testified that it varies from one applicant to another. Ibid. In some cases, according to Lehman's testimony, an applicant's race may play no role, whilein others it may be a " `determinative' " factor.

Ibid.
The District Court heard extensive testimony from Pro-fessor Richard Lempert, who chaired the faculty committee

that drafted the 1992 policy. Lempert emphasized that the
Law School seeks students with diverse interests and backgrounds to enhance classroom discussion and the educational
experience both inside and outside the classroom. Id., at
213a. When asked about the policy's " `commitment to racial
and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion
of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against,' " Lempert explained that this language
did not purport to remedy past discrimination, but rather to
include students who may bring to the Law School a perspective different from that of members of groups which have
not been the victims of such discrimination. Ibid. Lempert acknowledged that other groups, such as Asians and
Jews, have experienced discrimination, but explained they
were not mentioned in the policy because individuals who
are members of those groups were already being admitted
to the Law School in significant numbers. Ibid.

Kent Syverud was the final witness to testify about the
Law School's use of race in admissions decisions. Syverud
was a professor at the Law School when the 1992 admissions
policy was adopted and is now Dean of Vanderbilt Law
School. In addition to his testimony at trial, Syverud
submitted several expert reports on the educational benefits
of diversity. Syverud's testimony indicated that when a
critical mass of underrepresented minority students is pres539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG
320 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
ent, racial stereotypes lose their force because nonminoritystudents learn there is no " `minority viewpoint' " but rather

a variety of viewpoints among minority students. Id., at215a.

In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the LawSchool actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial.
Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioner'sexpert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed "admissions grids" for the years in question (1995-2000). Thesegrids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores.
Dr. Larntz made " `cell-by-cell' " comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically
significant relationship existed between race and admission
rates. He concluded that membership in certain minority
groups " `is an extremely strong factor in the decision for
acceptance,' " and that applicants from these minority groups
" `are given an extremely large allowance for admission' " as
compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored
groups. Id., at 218a-220a. Dr. Larntz conceded, however,
that race is not the predominant factor in the Law School's
admissions calculus. 12 Tr. 11-13 (Feb. 10, 2001).

Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law School's expert, focused
on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the
Law School's admission process. In Dr. Raudenbush's view,
a race-blind admissions system would have a " `very dramatic,' " negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a. He testified that in
2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants
were admitted. Ibid. Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if
race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants
would have been admitted. Ibid. Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have constituted 4
percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual
figure of 14.5 percent. Ibid.

321Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
In the end, the District Court concluded that the LawSchool's use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was

unlawful. Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court de-termined that the Law School's asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because"the attainment of a racially diverse class . . . was not recognized as such by Bakke and it is not a remedy for past discrimination." Id., at 246a. The District Court went on tohold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School

had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that inter-est. The District Court granted petitioner's request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race
as a factor in its admissions decisions. The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.

Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District
Court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The Court of
Appeals first held that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was
binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling
state interest. According to the Court of Appeals, Justice
Powell's opinion with respect to diversity constituted the
controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under
the analysis set forth in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S.
188 (1977). The Court of Appeals also held that the Law
School's use of race was narrowly tailored because race was
merely a "potential `plus' factor" and because the Law
School's program was "virtually identical" to the Harvard
admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell
and appended to his Bakke opinion. 288 F. 3d 732, 746, 749
(CA6 2002).

Four dissenting judges would have held the Law School's
use of race unconstitutional. Three of the dissenters, rejecting the majority's Marks analysis, examined the Law
School's interest in student body diversity on the merits and
concluded it was not compelling. The fourth dissenter, writing separately, found it unnecessary to decide whether diversity was a compelling interest because, like the other dissent539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG
322 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
ers, he believed that the Law School's use of race was notnarrowly tailored to further that interest.

We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1043 (2002), to resolve thedisagreement among the Courts of Appeals on a question
of national importance: Whether diversity is a compellinginterest that can justify the narrowly tailored use of race
in selecting applicants for admission to public universities.Compare

Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996) (Hop-wood I) (holding that diversity is not a compelling state interest), with Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233F. 3d 1188 (CA9 2000) (holding that it is).

II

A

We last addressed the use of race in public higher edu-cation over 25 years ago. In the landmark

Bakke case, wereviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out

of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of cer-tain minority groups. 438 U. S. 265 (1978). The decision
produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded amajority of the Court. Four Justices would have upheld the
program against all attack on the ground that the govern-ment can use race to "remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice." Id., at 325 ( joint opinion ofBrennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring
in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four otherJustices avoided the constitutional question altogether and
struck down the program on statutory grounds. Id., at 408(opinion of

Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewartand
Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dis-senting in part). Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not

only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for re-versing the state court's injunction against any use of race
whatsoever. The only holding for the Court in Bakke wasthat a "State has a substantial interest that legitimately may
be served by a properly devised admissions program involv539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

323Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
ing the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin."
Id., at 320. Thus, we reversed that part of the lower court's
judgment that enjoined the university "from any consider-ation of the race of any applicant."

Ibid.
Since this Court's splintered decision in Bakke, JusticePowell's opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has

served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of raceconscious admissions policies. Public and private universi-ties across the Nation have modeled their own admissions

programs on Justice Powell's views on permissible race-conscious policies. See,

e. g., Brief for Judith Areen et al. as
Amici Curiae 12-13 (law school admissions programs employ "methods designed from and based on Justice Powell's
opinion in Bakke"); Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici
Curiae 27 ("After Bakke, each of the amici (and undoubtedly
other selective colleges and universities as well) reviewed
their admissions procedures in light of Justice Powell's opinion . . . and set sail accordingly"). We therefore discuss Justice Powell's opinion in some detail.

Justice Powell began by stating that "[t]he guarantee of
equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one
individual and something else when applied to a person of
another color. If both are not accorded the same protection,
then it is not equal." Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290. In Justice Powell's view, when governmental decisions "touch upon
an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a
judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on
that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest." Id., at 299. Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powell's scrutiny.

First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in " `reducing the
historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession' " as an unlawful
interest in racial balancing. Id., at 306-307. Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal dis539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG
324 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
crimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties "who bear no
responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered." Id.,
at 310. Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in "increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved," concluding that even if
such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances
the program under review was not "geared to promote that
goal." Id., at 306, 310.

Justice Powell approved the university's use of race to further only one interest: "the attainment of a diverse student
body." Id., at 311. With the important proviso that "constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not
be disregarded," Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the
academic freedom that "long has been viewed as a special
concern of the First Amendment." Id., at 312, 314. Justice
Powell emphasized that nothing less than the " `nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure'
to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation
of many peoples." Id., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board
of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 603
(1967)). In seeking the "right to select those students who
will contribute the most to the `robust exchange of ideas,' "
a university seeks "to achieve a goal that is of paramount
importance in the fulfillment of its mission." 438 U. S., at
313. Both "tradition and experience lend support to the
view that the contribution of diversity is substantial." Ibid.

Justice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in
his view race "is only one element in a range of factors
a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of
a heterogeneous student body." Id., at 314. For Justice
Powell, "[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in
which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect
guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups," that

539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

325Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
can justify the use of race. Id., at 315. Rather, "[t]he diver-sity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses

a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics ofwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important
element." Ibid.In the wake of our fractured decision in

Bakke, courts
have struggled to discern whether Justice Powell's diversity
rationale, set forth in part of the opinion joined by no otherJustice, is nonetheless binding precedent under

Marks. In
that case, we explained that "[w]hen a fragmented Court de-cides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may
be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds." 430
U. S., at 193 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
As the divergent opinions of the lower courts demonstrate,
however, "[t]his test is more easily stated than applied to the
various opinions supporting the result in [Bakke]." Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 745-746 (1994). Compare, e. g., Johnson v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263
F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001) (Justice Powell's diversity rationale
was not the holding of the Court); Hopwood v. Texas, 236
F. 3d 256, 274-275 (CA5 2000) (Hopwood II) (same); Hopwood I, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996) (same), with Smith v. University of Wash. Law School, 233 F. 3d, at 1199 (Justice Powell's opinion, including the diversity rationale, is controlling
under Marks).

We do not find it necessary to decide whether Justice Powell's opinion is binding under Marks. It does not seem "useful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower
courts that have considered it." Nichols v. United States,
supra, at 745-746. More important, for the reasons set out
below, today we endorse Justice Powell's view that student
body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify
the use of race in university admissions.

Opinion of the Court

B
The Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 2. Because theFourteenth Amendment "protect[s]

persons, not groups," all"governmental action based on race--a group classification

long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant andtherefore prohibited--should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protec-tion of the laws has not been infringed." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasisin original; internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
We are a "free people whose institutions are founded uponthe doctrine of equality."

Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11(1967) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It

follows from that principle that "government may treat peo-ple differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515U. S., at 227.

We have held that all racial classifications imposed by gov-ernment "must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny." Ibid. This means that such classifications areconstitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further
compelling governmental interests. "Absent searching ju-dicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures," we have no way to determine what "classifications are`benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simpleracial politics."

Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,493 (1989) (plurality opinion). We apply strict scrutiny to

all racial classifications to " `smoke out' illegitimate uses ofrace by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool." Ibid.Strict scrutiny is not "strict in theory, but fatal in fact."

ernmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not allare invalidated by it. As we have explained, "whenever the

squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution'sguarantee of equal protection." 515 U. S., at 229-230. But
that observation "says nothing about the ultimate validity ofany particular law; that determination is the job of the court
applying strict scrutiny." Id., at 230. When race-based ac-tion is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guaranteeof equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental
action under the Equal Protection Clause. See Gomillionv.

Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344 (1960) (admonishing that,"in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process ofinclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations,
based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gaverise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard
of variant controlling facts"). In Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pen~ a, we made clear that strict scrutiny must take" `relevant differences' into account." 515 U. S., at 228. Indeed, as we explained, that is its "fundamental purpose."Ibid. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide aframework for carefully examining the importance and the
sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental deci-sionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.

A

With these principles in mind, we turn to the questionwhether the Law School's use of race is justified by a compelling state interest. Before this Court, as they have

328 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining "the educational benefits that flow from a diverse
student body." Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. i. In
other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the
context of higher education, a compelling state interest in
student body diversity.

We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law School's
argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implicitly,
by our affirmative-action cases decided since Bakke. It is
true that some language in those opinions might be read to
suggest that remedying past discrimination is the only permissible justification for race-based governmental action.
See, e. g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 493 (plurality opinion) (stating that unless classifications based on race
are "strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact
promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics
of racial hostility"). But we have never held that the only
governmental use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is
remedying past discrimination. Nor, since Bakke, have we
directly addressed the use of race in the context of public
higher education. Today, we hold that the Law School has
a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.

The Law School's educational judgment that such diversity
is essential to its educational mission is one to which we
defer. The Law School's assessment that diversity will, in
fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted
by the Law School is no less strict for taking into account
complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily
within the expertise of the university. Our holding today is
in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference
to a university's academic decisions, within constitutionally
prescribed limits. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing,
474 U. S. 214, 225 (1985); Board of Curators of Univ. of Mo.

Opinion of the Court
v. Horowitz, 435 U. S. 78, 96, n. 6 (1978); Bakke, 438 U. S., at319, n. 53 (opinion of Powell, J.).

We have long recognized that, given the important pur-pose of public education and the expansive freedoms of
speech and thought associated with the university environ-ment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional
tradition. See, e. g., Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195
(1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 (1957); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S.
479, 487 (1960); Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of
State of N. Y., 385 U. S., at 603. In announcing the principle
of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice Powell invoked our cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational
autonomy: "The freedom of a university to make its own
judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body." Bakke, supra, at 312. From this premise, Justice Powell reasoned that by claiming "the right to select
those students who will contribute the most to the `robust
exchange of ideas,' " a university "seek[s] to achieve a goal
that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission." 438 U. S., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., supra, at 603). Our conclusion that the Law School has a compelling interest in a
diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining
a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's
proper institutional mission, and that "good faith" on the
part of a university is "presumed" absent "a showing to the
contrary." 438 U. S., at 318-319.

As part of its goal of "assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse," the
Law School seeks to "enroll a `critical mass' of minority students." Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 13. The Law
School's interest is not simply "to assure within its student
body some specified percentage of a particular group merely
because of its race or ethnic origin." Bakke, 438 U. S., at

307 (opinion of Powell, J.). That would amount to outrightracial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.

Ibid.;
Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992) ("Racial balanceis not to be achieved for its own sake");

Richmond v. J. A.
Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 507. Rather, the Law School's con-cept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce.

These benefits are substantial. As the District Court em-phasized, the Law School's admissions policy promotes

"cross-racial understanding," helps to break down racial ste-reotypes, and "enables [students] to better understand persons of different races." App. to Pet. for Cert. 246a. These
benefits are "important and laudable," because "classroom
discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting" when the students have "the greatest
possible variety of backgrounds." Id., at 246a, 244a.

The Law School's claim of a compelling interest is further
bolstered by its amici, who point to the educational benefits
that flow from student body diversity. In addition to the
expert studies and reports entered into evidence at trial, numerous studies show that student body diversity promotes
learning outcomes, and "better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals." Brief for American Educational Research Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3; see,
e. g., W. Bowen & D. Bok, The Shape of the River (1998);

Action (G. Orfield & M. Kurlaender eds. 2001); Compelling
Interest: Examining the Evidence on Racial Dynamics in
Colleges and Universities (M. Chang, D. Witt, J. Jones, & K.
Hakuta eds. 2003).

These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in
today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures,
ideas, and viewpoints. Brief for 3M et al. as Amici Curiae

5; Brief for General Motors Corp. as Amicus Curiae 3-4.What is more, high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United States military assert that, "[b]ased on[their] decades of experience," a "highly qualified, racially
diverse officer corps . . . is essential to the military's abilityto fulfill its principle mission to provide national security."
Brief for Julius W. Becton, Jr., et al. as Amici Curiae 5. The
primary sources for the Nation's officer corps are the serviceacademies and the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC),

the latter comprising students already admitted to partic-ipating colleges and universities.

Ibid. At present, "the
military cannot achieve an officer corps that is both highly
qualified and racially diverse unless the service academies
and the ROTC used limited race-conscious recruiting and admissions policies." Ibid. (emphasis in original). To fulfill
its mission, the military "must be selective in admissions for
training and education for the officer corps, and it must train
and educate a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps
in a racially diverse educational setting." Id., at 29 (emphasis in original). We agree that "[i]t requires only a small
step from this analysis to conclude that our country's other
most selective institutions must remain both diverse and selective." Ibid.

We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of preparing students for work and citizenship, describing education as pivotal to "sustaining our political and
cultural heritage" with a fundamental role in maintaining the
fabric of society. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 221 (1982).
This Court has long recognized that "education . . . is the
very foundation of good citizenship." Brown v. Board of
Education, 347 U. S. 483, 493 (1954). For this reason, the
diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United States, as
amicus curiae, affirms that "[e]nsuring that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American

Opinion of the Court
society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective." Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 13. And, "[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context of
higher education." Ibid. Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our
Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is
to be realized.

Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of our Nation's leaders. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634 (1950)
(describing law school as a "proving ground for legal learning and practice"). Individuals with law degrees occupy
roughly half the state governorships, more than half the
seats in the United States Senate, and more than a third of
the seats in the United States House of Representatives.
See Brief for Association of American Law Schools as Amicus Curiae 5-6. The pattern is even more striking when it
comes to highly selective law schools. A handful of these
schools accounts for 25 of the 100 United States Senators, 74
United States Courts of Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of
the more than 600 United States District Court judges.
Id., at 6.

In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the
eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of
every race and ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous
society must have confidence in the openness and integrity
of the educational institutions that provide this training. As
we have recognized, law schools "cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law
interacts." See Sweatt v. Painter, supra, at 634. Access to
legal education (and thus the legal profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and
ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society

333Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
may participate in the educational institutions that providethe training and education necessary to succeed in America.

The Law School does not premise its need for critical masson "any belief that minority students always (or even consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on anyissue." Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 30. To the
contrary, diminishing the force of such stereotypes is both acrucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority stu-dents. Just as growing up in a particular region or having
particular professional experiences is likely to affect an indi-vidual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being
a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which raceunfortunately still matters. The Law School has determined, based on its experience and expertise, that a "criticalmass" of underrepresented minorities is necessary to further
its compelling interest in securing the educational benefitsof a diverse student body.

B
Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial dis-tinctions is permissible to further a compelling state interest,

government is still "constrained in how it may pursue thatend: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government's]
asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framedto accomplish that purpose."

Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899,908 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

The purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensurethat "the means chosen `fit' th[e] compelling goal so closely
that there is little or no possibility that the motive for theclassification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype."
Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 493 (pluralityopinion).

Since Bakke, we have had no occasion to define the con-tours of the narrow-tailoring inquiry with respect to raceconscious university admissions programs. That inquiry

334 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
must be calibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the useof race to achieve student body diversity in public higher

education. Contrary to Justice Kennedy's assertions, wedo not "abando[n] strict scrutiny," see

post, at 394 (dissenting
opinion). Rather, as we have already explained, supra, at327, we adhere to

Adarand's teaching that the very purpose of strict scrutiny is to take such "relevant differences
into account." 515 U. S., at 228 (internal quotation marksomitted).

To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions pro-gram cannot use a quota system--it cannot "insulat[e] each
category of applicants with certain desired qualifications
from competition with all other applicants." Bakke, 438
U. S., at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, a university
may consider race or ethnicity only as a " `plus' in a particular
applicant's file," without "insulat[ing] the individual from
comparison with all other candidates for the available seats."
Id., at 317. In other words, an admissions program must be
"flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,
and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight."
Ibid.

We find that the Law School's admissions program bears
the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell
made clear in Bakke, truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonmechanical way. It
follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish
quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members
of those groups on separate admissions tracks. See id., at
315-316. Nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition
for admission. Ibid. Universities can, however, consider
race or ethnicity more flexibly as a "plus" factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant. Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
We are satisfied that the Law School's admissions pro-gram, like the Harvard plan described by Justice Powell,

does not operate as a quota. Properly understood, a "quota"is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of
opportunities are "reserved exclusively for certain minoritygroups."

Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., supra, at 496 (plurality opinion). Quotas " `impose a fixed number or percentage which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded,' "
Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 495 (1986)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),and "insulate the individual from comparison with all other

candidates for the available seats," Bakke, supra, at 317
(opinion of Powell, J.). In contrast, "a permissible goal . . .
require[s] only a good-faith effort . . . to come within a range
demarcated by the goal itself," Sheet Metal Workers v.
EEOC, supra, at 495, and permits consideration of race as a
"plus" factor in any given case while still ensuring that each
candidate "compete[s] with all other qualified applicants,"
Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480
U. S. 616, 638 (1987).

Justice Powell's distinction between the medical school's
rigid 16-seat quota and Harvard's flexible use of race as a
"plus" factor is instructive. Harvard certainly had minimum goals for minority enrollment, even if it had no specific
number firmly in mind. See Bakke, supra, at 323 (opinion
of Powell, J.) ("10 or 20 black students could not begin to
bring to their classmates and to each other the variety of
points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the
United States"). What is more, Justice Powell flatly rejected the argument that Harvard's program was "the functional equivalent of a quota" merely because it had some
" `plus' " for race, or gave greater "weight" to race than to
some other factors, in order to achieve student body diversity. 438 U. S., at 317-318.

The Law School's goal of attaining a critical mass of underrepresented minority students does not transform its pro539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG
336 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
gram into a quota. As the Harvard plan described by Jus-tice Powell recognized, there is of course "some relationship

between numbers and achieving the benefits to be derivedfrom a diverse student body, and between numbers and
providing a reasonable environment for those students ad-mitted."

Id., at 323. "[S]ome attention to numbers," without more, does not transform a flexible admissions system
into a rigid quota. Ibid. Nor, as Justice Kennedy posits,does the Law School's consultation of the "daily reports,"

which keep track of the racial and ethnic composition of theclass (as well as of residency and gender), "sugges[t] there
was no further attempt at individual review save for race
itself " during the final stages of the admissions process.
See post, at 392 (dissenting opinion). To the contrary, the
Law School's admissions officers testified without contradiction that they never gave race any more or less weight based
on the information contained in these reports. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 43, n. 70 (citing App. in Nos. 01-1447
and 01-1516 (CA6), p. 7336). Moreover, as Justice Kennedy concedes, see post, at 390, between 1993 and 1998, the
number of African-American, Latino, and Native-American
students in each class at the Law School varied from 13.5 to
20.1 percent, a range inconsistent with a quota.

The Chief Justice believes that the Law School's policy
conceals an attempt to achieve racial balancing, and cites admissions data to contend that the Law School discriminates
among different groups within the critical mass. Post, at
380-386 (dissenting opinion). But, as The Chief Justice
concedes, the number of underrepresented minority students
who ultimately enroll in the Law School differs substantially
from their representation in the applicant pool and varies
considerably for each group from year to year. See post, at
385 (dissenting opinion).

That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement of
individualized consideration. When using race as a "plus"

539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

337Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
factor in university admissions, a university's admissionsprogram must remain flexible enough to ensure that each

applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way thatmakes an applicant's race or ethnicity the defining feature of
his or her application. The importance of this individualizedconsideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions
program is paramount. See Bakke, 438 U. S., at 318, n. 52
(opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the "denial . . . of th[e]right to individualized consideration" as the "principal evil"

of the medical school's admissions program).Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized,
holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a
diverse educational environment. The Law School affords
this individualized consideration to applicants of all races.
There is no policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic
acceptance or rejection based on any single "soft" variable.
Unlike the program at issue in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante,
p. 244, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined
diversity "bonuses" based on race or ethnicity. See ante, at
271-272 (distinguishing a race-conscious admissions program
that automatically awards 20 points based on race from the
Harvard plan, which considered race but "did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a
specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity"). Like the Harvard plan, the Law School's admissions
policy "is flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements
of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each
applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same
weight." Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.).

We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell
referenced in Bakke, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may
contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions. With re539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG
338 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Opinion of the Court
spect to the use of race itself, all underrepresented minoritystudents admitted by the Law School have been deemed

qualified. By virtue of our Nation's struggle with racial in-equality, such students are both likely to have experiences
of particular importance to the Law School's mission, andless likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria
that ignore those experiences. See App. 120.

The Law School does not, however, limit in any way thebroad range of qualities and experiences that may be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity. Tothe contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear "[t]here are many
possible bases for diversity admissions," and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad,
are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers
in other fields. Id., at 118-119. The Law School seriously
considers each "applicant's promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a particular strength, attainment, or characteristic--e. g., an unusual intellectual achievement, employment experience, nonacademic performance, or
personal background." Id., at 83-84. All applicants have
the opportunity to highlight their own potential diversity
contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the
ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and
diversity of the Law School.

What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial
weight to diversity factors besides race. The Law School
frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and
test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants
(and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. See
Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 10; App. 121-122. This
shows that the Law School seriously weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority applicants as well. By this

539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

339Cite as: 539 U. S. 306 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a
diverse student body. Justice Kennedy speculates that
"race is likely outcome determinative for many members of
minority groups" who do not fall within the upper range of
LSAT scores and grades. Post, at 389 (dissenting opinion).
But the same could be said of the Harvard plan discussed
approvingly by Justice Powell in Bakke, and indeed of any
plan that uses race as one of many factors. See 438 U. S.,
at 316 (" `When the Committee on Admissions reviews the
large middle group of applicants who are "admissible" and
deemed capable of doing good work in their courses, the race
of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor' ").

Petitioner and the United States argue that the Law
School's plan is not narrowly tailored because race-neutral
means exist to obtain the educational benefits of student
body diversity that the Law School seeks. We disagree.
Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative. Nor does it require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational
opportunities to members of all racial groups. See Wygant
v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (alternatives must serve the interest " `about as well' "); Richmond
v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S., at 509-510 (plurality opinion)
(city had a "whole array of race-neutral" alternatives because
changing requirements "would have [had] little detrimental
effect on the city's interests"). Narrow tailoring does, however, require serious, good faith consideration of workable
race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the
university seeks. See id., at 507 (set-aside plan not narrowly tailored where "there does not appear to have been
any consideration of the use of race-neutral means"); Wygant
v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., supra, at 280, n. 6 (narrow tailoring

Opinion of the Court
"require[s] consideration" of "lawful alternative and less re-strictive means").

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law Schoolsufficiently considered workable race-neutral alternatives.
The District Court took the Law School to task for failing toconsider race-neutral alternatives such as "using a lottery
system" or "decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on
undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores." App. to Pet. forCert. 251a. But these alternatives would require a dramatic

sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted stu-dents, or both.

The Law School's current admissions program considersrace as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble a
student body that is diverse in ways broader than race. Be-cause a lottery would make that kind of nuanced judgment
impossible, it would effectively sacrifice all other educationalvalues, not to mention every other kind of diversity. So too
with the suggestion that the Law School simply lower admis-sions standards for all students, a drastic remedy that would
require the Law School to become a much different institution and sacrifice a vital component of its educationalmission. The United States advocates "percentage plans,"

recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in
Texas, Florida, and California, to guarantee admission to all
students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high
school in the State. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-18. The United States does not, however, explain
how such plans could work for graduate and professional
schools. Moreover, even assuming such plans are raceneutral, they may preclude the university from conducting
the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse, but diverse along
all the qualities valued by the university. We are satisfied
that the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass
without forcing the Law School to abandon the academic
selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

Opinion of the Court
We acknowledge that "there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself." Bakke,
438 U. S., at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.). Narrow tailoring,
therefore, requires that a race-conscious admissions program
not unduly harm members of any racial group. Even remedial race-based governmental action generally "remains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the
least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for
the benefit." Id., at 308. To be narrowly tailored, a raceconscious admissions program must not "unduly burden individuals who are not members of the favored racial and ethnic
groups." Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547,
630 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

We are satisfied that the Law School's admissions program
does not. Because the Law School considers "all pertinent
elements of diversity," it can (and does) select nonminority
applicants who have greater potential to enhance student
body diversity over underrepresented minority applicants.
See Bakke, supra, at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.). As Justice
Powell recognized in Bakke, so long as a race-conscious admissions program uses race as a "plus" factor in the context
of individualized consideration, a rejected applicant

"will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for
that seat simply because he was not the right color or
had the wrong surname. . . . His qualifications would
have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he
would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment
under the Fourteenth Amendment." 438 U. S., at 318.

We agree that, in the context of its individualized inquiry
into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the
Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not
unduly harm nonminority applicants.

We are mindful, however, that "[a] core purpose of the
Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race." Palmore v. Si539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:29] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
doti, 466 U. S. 429, 432 (1984). Accordingly, race-conscious
admissions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling
their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be
employed no more broadly than the interest demands. Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences
would offend this fundamental equal protection principle.
We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all governmental use of
race must have a logical end point. The Law School, too,
concedes that all "race-conscious programs must have reasonable durational limits." Brief for Respondent Bollinger
et al. 32.

In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether
racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body
diversity. Universities in California, Florida, and Washington State, where racial preferences in admissions are prohibited by state law, are currently engaged in experimenting
with a wide variety of alternative approaches. Universities
in other States can and should draw on the most promising
aspects of these race-neutral alternatives as they develop.
Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[T]he States may perform their role
as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best solution is far from clear").

The requirement that all race-conscious admissions programs have a termination point "assure[s] all citizens that
the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial
and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in
the service of the goal of equality itself." Richmond v. J. A.

Opinion of the Court
58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May- June 1977) ("It would be
a sad day indeed, were America to become a quota-ridden
society, with each identifiable minority assigned proportional
representation in every desirable walk of life. But that is
not the rationale for programs of preferential treatment; the
acid test of their justification will be their efficacy in eliminating the need for any racial or ethnic preferences at all").

We take the Law School at its word that it would "like
nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula" and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 34; Bakke, supra, at 317-318 (opinion of Powell,
J.) (presuming good faith of university officials in the absence
of a showing to the contrary). It has been 25 years since
Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an
interest in student body diversity in the context of public
higher education. Since that time, the number of minority
applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43. We expect that 25 years
from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.

In summary, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit
the Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions
decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the
educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.
Consequently, petitioner's statutory claims based on Title VI
and 42 U. S. C. $ 1981 also fail. See Bakke, supra, at 287
(opinion of Powell, J.) ("Title VI . . . proscribe[s] only those
racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection
Clause or the Fifth Amendment"); General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389-391
(1982) (the prohibition against discrimination in $ 1981 is coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause). The judgment

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
concurring.

The Court's observation that race-conscious programs
"must have a logical end point," ante, at 342, accords withthe international understanding of the office of affirmative

action. The International Convention on the Elimination ofAll Forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified by the United
States in 1994, see State Dept., Treaties in Force 422-423(June 1996), endorses "special and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain ra-cial groups or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose
of guaranteeing them the full and equal enjoyment of human
rights and fundamental freedoms." Annex to G. A. Res.
2106, 20 U. N. GAOR, 20th Sess., Res. Supp. (No. 14), p. 47,
U. N. Doc. A/6014, Art. 2(2) (1965). But such measures, the
Convention instructs, "shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for
different racial groups after the objectives for which they
were taken have been achieved." Ibid.; see also Art. 1(4)
(similarly providing for temporally limited affirmative action); Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Annex to G. A. Res. 34/180, 34
U. N. GAOR, 34th Sess., Res. Supp. (No. 46), p. 194, U. N.
Doc. A/34/46, Art. 4(1) (1979) (authorizing "temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality" that
"shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved").

The Court further observes that "[i]t has been 25 years
since Justice Powell [in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,
438 U. S. 265 (1978)] first approved the use of race to further
an interest in student body diversity in the context of public

time, however, the law could not fairly be described as "set-tled," and in some regions of the Nation, overtly raceconscious admissions policies have been proscribed. See
Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932 (CA5 1996); cf. Wessmann v.
Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 (CA1 1998); Tuttle v. Arlington Cty.
School Bd., 195 F. 3d 698 (CA4 1999); Johnson v. Board of
Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F. 3d 1234 (CA11 2001). Moreover, it was only 25 years before Bakke that this Court de-clared public school segregation unconstitutional, a declaration that, after prolonged resistance, yielded an end to alaw-enforced racial caste system, itself the legacy of centuries of slavery. See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.
483 (1954); cf. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958).

It is well documented that conscious and unconscious race
bias, even rank discrimination based on race, remain alive in
our land, impeding realization of our highest values and
ideals. See, e. g., Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, at 298-301 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen~ a,

2001 show that 71.6% of African-American children and
76.3% of Hispanic children attended a school in which minorities made up a majority of the student body. See E. Frankenberg, C. Lee, & G. Orfield, A Multiracial Society with

current reality that many minority students encounter markedly inadequate and unequal educational opportunities. Despite these inequalities, some minority students are able to
meet the high threshold requirements set for admission to
the country's finest undergraduate and graduate educational
institutions. As lower school education in minority communities improves, an increase in the number of such students
may be anticipated. From today's vantage point, one may
hope, but not firmly forecast, that over the next generation's

equal opportunity will make it safe to sunset affirmative

"critical mass" justification for its discrimination by racechallenges even the most gullible mind. The admissions statistics show it to be a sham to cover a scheme of raciallyproportionate admissions.

I also join Parts I through VII of Justice Thomas's opin-ion.* I find particularly unanswerable his central point:
that the allegedly "compelling state interest" at issue hereis not the incremental "educational benefit" that emanates
from the fabled "critical mass" of minority students, butrather Michigan's interest in maintaining a "prestige" law
school whose normal admissions standards disproportion-ately exclude blacks and other minorities. If that is a compelling state interest, everything is.I add the following: The "educational benefit" that the University of Michigan seeks to achieve by racial discriminationconsists, according to the Court, of " `cross-racial understanding,' " ante, at 330, and " `better prepar[ation of] students foran increasingly diverse workforce and society,' "

learned by, for it cannot be "taught" in the usual sense) peo-ple three feet shorter and 20 years younger than the fullgrown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, ininstitutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school

sity of Michigan Law School to use racial discrimination forthe purpose of putting together a "critical mass" that will

convey generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship,surely it is no less appropriate--indeed,

particularly appropriate--for the civil service system of the State of Michiganto do so. There, also, those exposed to "critical masses" of

certain races will presumably become better Americans, better Michiganders, better civil servants. And surely privateemployers cannot be criticized--indeed, should be praised--

if they also "teach" good citizenship to their adult employeesthrough a patriotic, all-American system of racial discrimination in hiring. The nonminority individuals who are deprived of a legal education, a civil service job, or any job at
all by reason of their skin color will surely understand.

Unlike a clear constitutional holding that racial preferences in state educational institutions are impermissible, or
even a clear anticonstitutional holding that racial preferences
in state educational institutions are OK, today's GrutterGratz split double header seems perversely designed to prolong the controversy and the litigation. Some future lawsuits will presumably focus on whether the discriminatory
scheme in question contains enough evaluation of the applicant "as an individual," ante, at 337, and sufficiently avoids
"separate admissions tracks," ante, at 334, to fall under
Grutter rather than Gratz. Some will focus on whether a
university has gone beyond the bounds of a " `good-faith effort' " and has so zealously pursued its "critical mass" as to
make it an unconstitutional de facto quota system, rather
than merely " `a permissible goal.' " Ante, at 335 (quoting

Other lawsuits may focus on whether, in the particular setting at issue, any educational benefits flow from racial diversity. (That issue was not contested in Grutter; and while
the opinion accords "a degree of deference to a university's
academic decisions," ante, at 328, "deference does not imply

Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003).) Still other suits may
challenge the bona fides of the institution's expressed commitment to the educational benefits of diversity that immunize the discriminatory scheme in Grutter. (Tempting targets, one would suppose, will be those universities that talk
the talk of multiculturalism and racial diversity in the courts
but walk the walk of tribalism and racial segregation on their
campuses--through minority-only student organizations,
separate minority housing opportunities, separate minority
student centers, even separate minority-only graduation ceremonies.) And still other suits may claim that the institution's racial preferences have gone below or above the mystical Grutter-approved "critical mass." Finally, litigation can
be expected on behalf of minority groups intentionally short
changed in the institution's composition of its generic minority "critical mass." I do not look forward to any of these
cases. The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no
exception.

the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with

. . . And if the negro cannot stand on his own legs, lethim fall also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand
on his own legs! Let him alone! . . . [Y]our interferenceis doing him positive injury." What the Black Man
Wants: An Address Delivered in Boston, Massachusetts,on 26 January 1865, reprinted in 4 The Frederick Douglass Papers 59, 68 (J. Blassingame & J. McKivigan eds.1991) (emphasis in original).

Like Douglass, I believe blacks can achieve in every avenueof American life without the meddling of university administrators. Because I wish to see all students succeed what-ever their color, I share, in some respect, the sympathies of
those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced bythe University of Michigan Law School (Law School). The
Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devo-tion to the status quo in admissions policies when such devotion ripens into racial discrimination. Nor does the Consti-tution countenance the unprecedented deference the Court
gives to the Law School, an approach inconsistent with thevery concept of "strict scrutiny."

No one would argue that a university could set up a lowergeneral admissions standard and then impose heightened requirements only on black applicants. Similarly, a universitymay not maintain a high admissions standard and grant exemptions to favored races. The Law School, of its ownchoosing, and for its own purposes, maintains an exclusionary admissions system that it knows produces racially dis-proportionate results. Racial discrimination is not a permissible solution to the self-inflicted wounds of this elitistadmissions policy.

The majority upholds the Law School's racial discrimina-tion not by interpreting the people's Constitution, but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti. Neverthe-less, I concur in part in the Court's opinion. First, I agree
with the Court insofar as its decision, which approves of only

one racial classification, confirms that further use of race in
admissions remains unlawful. Second, I agree with the
Court's holding that racial discrimination in higher education
admissions will be illegal in 25 years. See ante, at 343 (stating that racial discrimination will no longer be narrowly tailored, or "necessary to further" a compelling state interest,
in 25 years). I respectfully dissent from the remainder of
the Court's opinion and the judgment, however, because I
believe that the Law School's current use of race violates the
Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution means the
same thing today as it will in 300 months.

I
The majority agrees that the Law School's racial discrimination should be subjected to strict scrutiny. Ante, at 326.
Before applying that standard to this case, I will briefly revisit the Court's treatment of racial classifications.

The strict scrutiny standard that the Court purports to
apply in this case was first enunciated in Korematsu v.
United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944). There the Court held
that "[p]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the
existence of [racial discrimination]; racial antagonism never
can." Id., at 216. This standard of "pressing public necessity" has more frequently been termed "compelling governmental interest," 1 see, e. g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.
Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 299 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). A
majority of the Court has validated only two circumstances
where "pressing public necessity" or a "compelling state interest" can possibly justify racial discrimination by state
actors. First, the lesson of Korematsu is that national security constitutes a "pressing public necessity," though the
government's use of race to advance that objective must be
narrowly tailored. Second, the Court has recognized as a
compelling state interest a government's effort to remedy

1 Throughout I will use the two phrases interchangeably.

past discrimination for which it is responsible. Richmond
v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 504 (1989).

The contours of "pressing public necessity" can be further
discerned from those interests the Court has rejected as
bases for racial discrimination. For example, Wygant v.
Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), found unconstitutional a collective-bargaining agreement between a school
board and a teachers' union that favored certain minority
races. The school board defended the policy on the grounds
that minority teachers provided "role models" for minority
students and that a racially "diverse" faculty would improve
the education of all students. See Brief for Respondents,
O. T. 1984, No. 84-1340, pp. 27-28; 476 U. S., at 315 (Stevens,
J., dissenting) ("[A]n integrated faculty will be able to provide benefits to the student body that could not be provided
by an all-white, or nearly all-white, faculty"). Nevertheless,
the Court found that the use of race violated the Equal Protection Clause, deeming both asserted state interests insufficiently compelling. Id., at 275-276 (plurality opinion); id.,
at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment) ("None of the interests asserted by the [school board] . . . justify this racially
discriminatory layoff policy").2

An even greater governmental interest involves the sensitive role of courts in child custody determinations. In
Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429 (1984), the Court held that
even the best interests of a child did not constitute a compelling state interest that would allow a state court to award
custody to the father because the mother was in a mixed-race
marriage. Id., at 433 (finding the interest "substantial" but

2 The Court's refusal to address Wygant's rejection of a state interest
virtually indistinguishable from that presented by the Law School is perplexing. If the Court defers to the Law School's judgment that a racially
mixed student body confers educational benefits to all, then why would
the Wygant Court not defer to the school board's judgment with respect
to the benefits a racially mixed faculty confers?

Opinion of Thomas, J.
holding the custody decision could not be based on the race
of the mother's new husband).

Finally, the Court has rejected an interest in remedying
general societal discrimination as a justification for race
discrimination. See Wygant, supra, at 276 (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 496-498 (plurality opinion); id., at
520-521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). "Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for
imposing a racially classified remedy" because a "court could
uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past,
and timeless in their ability to affect the future." Wygant,
supra, at 276 (plurality opinion). But see Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 298 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

Where the Court has accepted only national security, and
rejected even the best interests of a child, as a justification
for racial discrimination, I conclude that only those measures
the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy,
or to prevent violence, will constitute a "pressing public necessity." Cf. Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968)
(per curiam) (Black, J., concurring) (indicating that protecting prisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored
racial discrimination); Croson, supra, at 521 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("At least where state or local action
is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of
imminent danger to life and limb . . . can justify [racial
discrimination]").

The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not
only because those classifications can harm favored races or
are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every
time the government places citizens on racial registers and
makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits,
it demeans us all. "Purchased at the price of immeasurable
human suffering, the equal protection principle reflects our
Nation's understanding that such classifications ultimately
have a destructive impact on the individual and our society."

II
Unlike the majority, I seek to define with precision theinterest being asserted by the Law School before determining whether that interest is so compelling as to justify racialdiscrimination. The Law School maintains that it wishes
to obtain "educational benefits that flow from student bodydiversity," Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 14. This
statement must be evaluated carefully, because it impliesthat both "diversity" and "educational benefits" are components of the Law School's compelling state interest. Ad-ditionally, the Law School's refusal to entertain certain
changes in its admissions process and status indicates thatthe compelling state interest it seeks to validate is actually
broader than might appear at first glance.Undoubtedly there are other ways to "better" the education of law students aside from ensuring that the studentbody contains a "critical mass" of underrepresented minority
students. Attaining "diversity," whatever it means,3 is the

3 "[D]iversity," for all of its devotees, is more a fashionable catchphrase
than it is a useful term, especially when something as serious as racial
discrimination is at issue. Because the Equal Protection Clause renders
the color of one's skin constitutionally irrelevant to the Law School's mission, I refer to the Law School's interest as an "aesthetic." That is, the
Law School wants to have a certain appearance, from the shape of the
desks and tables in its classrooms to the color of the students sitting at
them.

I also use the term "aesthetic" because I believe it underlines the ineffectiveness of racially discriminatory admissions in actually helping those
who are truly underprivileged. Cf. Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268, 283 (1979)
(noting that suspect classifications are especially impermissible when "the
choice made by the State appears to redound . . . to the benefit of those
without need for special solicitude"). It must be remembered that the
Law School's racial discrimination does nothing for those too poor or uneducated to participate in elite higher education and therefore presents only
an illusory solution to the challenges facing our Nation.

mechanism by which the Law School obtains educational
benefits, not an end of itself. The Law School, however, apparently believes that only a racially mixed student body can
lead to the educational benefits it seeks. How, then, is the
Law School's interest in these allegedly unique educational
"benefits" not simply the forbidden interest in "racial balancing," ante, at 330, that the majority expressly rejects?

A distinction between these two ideas (unique educational
benefits based on racial aesthetics and race for its own sake)
is purely sophistic--so much so that the majority uses them
interchangeably. Compare ante, at 328 ("[T]he Law School
has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student
body"), with ante, at 333 (referring to the "compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student
body" (emphasis added)). The Law School's argument, as
facile as it is, can only be understood in one way: Classroom
aesthetics yields educational benefits, racially discriminatory
admissions policies are required to achieve the right racial
mix, and therefore the policies are required to achieve the
educational benefits. It is the educational benefits that are
the end, or allegedly compelling state interest, not "diversity." But see ante, at 332 (citing the need for "openness
and integrity of the educational institutions that provide
[legal] training" without reference to any consequential educational benefits).

One must also consider the Law School's refusal to entertain changes to its current admissions system that might
produce the same educational benefits. The Law School adamantly disclaims any race-neutral alternative that would
reduce "academic selectivity," which would in turn "require
the Law School to become a very different institution, and
to sacrifice a core part of its educational mission." Brief for
Respondent Bollinger et al. 33-36. In other words, the Law
School seeks to improve marginally the education it offers

without sacrificing too much of its exclusivity and elite
status.4

The proffered interest that the majority vindicates today,
then, is not simply "diversity." Instead the Court upholds
the use of racial discrimination as a tool to advance the Law
School's interest in offering a marginally superior education
while maintaining an elite institution. Unless each constituent part of this state interest is of pressing public necessity,
the Law School's use of race is unconstitutional. I find each
of them to fall far short of this standard.

A

A close reading of the Court's opinion reveals that all of
its legal work is done through one conclusory statement: The
Law School has a "compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body." Ante, at 333.
No serious effort is made to explain how these benefits fit
with the state interests the Court has recognized (or rejected) as compelling, see Part I, supra, or to place any theoretical constraints on an enterprising court's desire to discover still more justifications for racial discrimination. In
the absence of any explanation, one might expect the Court
to fall back on the judicial policy of stare decisis. But the
Court eschews even this weak defense of its holding, shunning an analysis of the extent to which Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978),

4 The Law School believes both that the educational benefits of a racially
engineered student body are large and that adjusting its overall admissions standards to achieve the same racial mix would require it to sacrifice
its elite status. If the Law School is correct that the educational benefits
of "diversity" are so great, then achieving them by altering admissions
standards should not compromise its elite status. The Law School's reluctance to do this suggests that the educational benefits it alleges are not
significant or do not exist at all.

is binding, ante, at 325, in favor of an unfounded wholesaleadoption of it.

Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke and the Court's decisiontoday rest on the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualized so that a goal, suchas classroom aesthetics, can be compelling in one context but
not in another. This "we know it when we see it" approachto evaluating state interests is not capable of judicial application. Today, the Court insists on radically expanding therange of permissible uses of race to something as trivial (by
comparison) as the assembling of a law school class. I canonly presume that the majority's failure to justify its decision
by reference to any principle arises from the absence of anysuch principle. See Part VI,

infra.

B
Under the proper standard, there is no pressing public ne-cessity in maintaining a public law school at all and, it follows, certainly not an elite law school. Likewise, marginalimprovements in legal education do not qualify as a compelling state interest. 1

While legal education at a public university may be goodpolicy or otherwise laudable, it is obviously not a pressing
public necessity when the correct legal standard is applied.Additionally, circumstantial evidence as to whether a state
activity is of pressing public necessity can be obtained byasking whether all States feel compelled to engage in that
activity. Evidence that States, in general, engage in a cer-tain activity by no means demonstrates that the activity constitutes a pressing public necessity, given the expansive roleof government in today's society. The fact that some fraction of the States reject a particular enterprise, however,creates a presumption that the enterprise itself is not a compelling state interest. In this sense, the absence of a public,American Bar Association (ABA) accredited, law school in

Alaska, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, andRhode Island, see ABA-LSAC Official Guide to ABAApproved Law Schools (W. Margolis, B. Gordon, J. Pus-karz, & D. Rosenlieb eds. 2004) (hereinafter ABA-LSAC
Guide), provides further evidence that Michigan's mainte-nance of the Law School does not constitute a compelling
state interest. 2

As the foregoing makes clear, Michigan has no compellinginterest in having a law school at all, much less an elite one.
Still, even assuming that a State may, under appropriate cir-cumstances, demonstrate a cognizable interest in having an
elite law school, Michigan has failed to do so here.This Court has limited the scope of equal protection review to interests and activities that occur within that State'sjurisdiction. The Court held in

Missouri ex rel. Gaines v.Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938), that Missouri could not satisfy

the demands of "separate but equal" by paying for legaltraining of blacks at neighboring state law schools, while
maintaining a segregated law school within the State. Theequal protection

"obligation is imposed by the Constitution upon theStates severally as governmental entities,--each responsible for its own laws establishing the rights andduties of persons within its borders. It is an obligation
the burden of which cannot be cast by one State uponanother, and no State can be excused from performance
by what another State may do or fail to do. That sepa-rate responsibility of each State within its own sphere
is of the essence of statehood maintained under our dualsystem."

Id., at 350 (emphasis added).

The Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by the Court inGaines, does not permit States to justify racial discrimination on the basis of what the rest of the Nation "may do orfail to do." The only interests that can satisfy the Equal

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Protection Clause's demands are those found w ithin aState's jurisdiction.

The only cognizable state interests vindicated by operat-ing a public law school are, therefore, the education of that
State's citizens and the training of that State's lawyers.James Campbell's address at the opening of the Law Department at the University of Michigan on October 3, 1859,
makes this clear:

"It not only concerns the State that every one shouldhave all reasonable facilities for preparing himself for

any honest position in life to which he may aspire, butit also concerns

the community that the Law should be
taught and understood. . . . There is not an office in the
State in which serious legal inquiries may not frequentlyarise. . . . In all these matters, public and private rights

are constantly involved and discussed, and ignorance ofthe Law has frequently led to results deplorable and
alarming. . . . [I]n the history of this State, in more thanone instance, that ignorance has led to unlawful violence,
and the shedding of innocent blood." E. Brown, LegalEducation at Michigan 1859-1959, pp. 404-406 (1959)
(emphasis added).
The Law School today, however, does precious little training of those attorneys who will serve the citizens of Michi-gan. In 2002, graduates of the Law School made up less

than 6% of applicants to the Michigan bar, Michigan LawyersWeekly, available at http://www.michiganlawyersweekly.com/
barpassers0202.cfm,barpassers0702 .cfm (all Internet materi-als as visited June 13, 2003, and available in Clerk of Court's

nearly 30% of all law students graduating in Michigan.
Ibid. Less than 16% of the Law School's graduating class
elects to stay in Michigan after law school. ABA-LSAC
Guide 427. Thus, while a mere 27% of the Law School's
2002 entering class is from Michigan, see University of

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Michigan Law School Website, available at http://www.law.
umich.edu/prospectivestudents/Admissions/ index.htm, only
half of these, it appears, will stay in Michigan.

In sum, the Law School trains few Michigan residents and
overwhelmingly serves students, who, as lawyers, leave the
State of Michigan. By contrast, Michigan's other public law
school, Wayne State University Law School, sends 88% of its
graduates on to serve the people of Michigan. ABA-LSAC
Guide 775. It does not take a social scientist to conclude
that it is precisely the Law School's status as an elite institution that causes it to be a waystation for the rest of the
country's lawyers, rather than a training ground for those
who will remain in Michigan. The Law School's decision to
be an elite institution does little to advance the welfare of
the people of Michigan or any cognizable interest of the State
of Michigan.

Again, the fact that few States choose to maintain elite
law schools raises a strong inference that there is nothing
compelling about elite status. Arguably, only the public law
schools of the University of Texas, the University of California, Berkeley (Boalt Hall), and the University of Virginia
maintain the same reputation for excellence as the Law
School.5 Two of these States, Texas and California, are so
large that they could reasonably be expected to provide elite
legal training at a separate law school to students who will,
in fact, stay in the State and provide legal services to its
citizens. And these two schools far outshine the Law School
in producing in-state lawyers. The University of Texas, for
example, sends over three-fourths of its graduates on to
work in the State of Texas, vindicating the State's interest
(compelling or not) in training Texas' lawyers. Id., at 691.

Finally, even if the Law School's racial tinkering producestangible educational benefits, a marginal improvement in

legal education cannot justify racial discrimination where theLaw School has no compelling interest either in its existence
or in its current educational and admissions policies.

IV
The interest in remaining elite and exclusive that the ma-jority thinks so obviously critical requires the use of admissions "standards" that, in turn, create the Law School's"need" to discriminate on the basis of race. The Court validates these admissions standards by concluding that alter-natives that would require "a dramatic sacrifice of . . . the
academic quality of all admitted students," ante, at 340,need not be considered before racial discrimination can be
employed.6 In the majority's view, such methods are notrequired by the "narrow tailoring" prong of strict scrutiny
because that inquiry demands, in this context, that anyrace-neutral alternative work " `about as well.' " Ante, at
339 (quoting Wygant, 476 U. S., at 280, n. 6). The majorityerrs, however, because race-neutral alternatives must only
be "workable," ante, at 339, and do "about as well" in vindi-cating the compelling state interest. The Court never explicitly holds that the Law School's desire to retain the statusquo in "academic selectivity" is itself a compelling state
interest, and, as I have demonstrated, it is not. SeePart III-B, supra. Therefore, the Law School should be
forced to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its ex-clusionary admissions system--it cannot have it both ways.

With the adoption of different admissions methods, suchas accepting all students who meet minimum qualifications,

6 The Court refers to this component of the Law School's compelling
state interest variously as "academic quality," avoiding "sacrifice [of] a
vital component of its educational mission," and "academic selectivity."
Ante, at 340.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-14, theLaw School could achieve its vision of the racially aesthetic

student body without the use of racial discrimination. TheLaw School concedes this, but the Court holds, implicitly and
under the guise of narrow tailoring, that the Law School hasa compelling state interest in doing what it wants to do. I
cannot agree. First, under strict scrutiny, the Law School'sassessment of the benefits of racial discrimination and devotion to the admissions status quo are not entitled to any sortof deference, grounded in the First Amendment or anywhere
else. Second, even if its "academic selectivity" must bemaintained at all costs along with racial discrimination, the
Court ignores the fact that other top law schools have suc-ceeded in meeting their aesthetic demands without racial
discrimination. A

The Court bases its unprecedented deference to the LawSchool--a deference antithetical to strict scrutiny--on an
idea of "educational autonomy" grounded in the FirstAmendment.

Ante, at 329. In my view, there is no basisfor a right of public universities to do what would otherwise

violate the Equal Protection Clause.The constitutionalization of "academic freedom" began
with the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter in Sweezyv.

New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234 (1957). Sweezy, a Marxisteconomist, was investigated by the Attorney General of New

Hampshire on suspicion of being a subversive. The prosecu-tion sought, inter alia, the contents of a lecture Sweezy had
given at the University of New Hampshire. The Court heldthat the investigation violated due process. Id., at 254.

Justice Frankfurter went further, however, reasoning thatthe First Amendment created a right of academic freedom
that prohibited the investigation. Id., at 256-267 (opinionconcurring in result). Much of the rhetoric in Justice Frankfurter's opinion was devoted to the personal right of Sweezyto free speech. See,

e. g., id., at 265 ("For a citizen to be

made to forego even a part of so basic a liberty as his politicalautonomy, the subordinating interest of the State must be

compelling"). Still, claiming that the United States Reports"need not be burdened with proof," Justice Frankfurter also
asserted that a "free society" depends on "free universities"and "[t]his means the exclusion of governmental intervention
in the intellectual life of a university." Id., at 262. According to Justice Frankfurter: "It is the business of a universityto provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere inwhich there prevail `the four essential freedoms' of a university--to determine for itself on academic grounds who may
teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who
may be admitted to study." Id., at 263 (citation omitted).

In my view, "[i]t is the business" of this Court to explain
itself when it cites provisions of the Constitution to invent
new doctrines--including the idea that the First Amendment
authorizes a public university to do what would otherwise
violate the Equal Protection Clause. The majority fails in
its summary effort to prove this point. The only source for
the Court's conclusion that public universities are entitled to
deference even within the confines of strict scrutiny is Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke. Justice Powell, for his part,
relied only on Justice Frankfurter's opinion in Sweezy and
the Court's decision in Keyishian v. Board of Regents of
Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967), to support his
view that the First Amendment somehow protected a public
university's use of race in admissions. Bakke, 438 U. S., at
312. Keyishian provides no answer to the question whether
the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions are relaxed when
applied to public universities. In that case, the Court held
that state statutes and regulations designed to prevent the
"appointment or retention of `subversive' persons in state
employment," 385 U. S., at 592, violated the First Amendment for vagueness. The statutes covered all public employees and were not invalidated only as applied to uni539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG

versity faculty members, although the Court appeared
sympathetic to the notion of academic freedom, calling it a
"special concern of the First Amendment." Id., at 603.
Again, however, the Court did not relax any independent
constitutional restrictions on public universities.

I doubt that when Justice Frankfurter spoke of governmental intrusions into the independence of universities, he
was thinking of the Constitution's ban on racial discrimination. The majority's broad deference to both the Law
School's judgment that racial aesthetics leads to educational
benefits and its stubborn refusal to alter the status quo in
admissions methods finds no basis in the Constitution or decisions of this Court.

The Court's deference to the Law School's conclusion that
its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits will,
if adhered to, have serious collateral consequences. The
Court relies heavily on social science evidence to justify its
deference. See ante, at 330-332; but see also Rothman, Lipset, & Nevitte, Racial Diversity Reconsidered, 151 Public Interest 25 (2003) (finding that the racial mix of a student body
produced by racial discrimination of the type practiced by
the Law School in fact hinders students' perception of academic quality). The Court never acknowledges, however,
the growing evidence that racial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students.
See, e. g., Flowers & Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College
Racial Composition on African American Students After 3
Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669,
674 (1999) (concluding that black students experience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges
(HBCs) and that, even among blacks, "a substantial diversity
moderates the cognitive effects of attending an HBC");

26, 35 (1992) (finding that black students attending HBCsreport higher academic achievement than those attending
predominantly white colleges).At oral argument in Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 244, counsel for respondents stated that "most every single one of [theHBCs] do have diverse student bodies." Tr. of Oral Arg. in
No. 02-516, p. 52. What precisely counsel meant by "di-verse" is indeterminate, but it is reported that in 2000 at
Morehouse College, one of the most distinguished HBCs inthe Nation, only 0.1% of the student body was white, and
only 0.2% was Hispanic. College Admissions Data Hand-book 2002-2003, p. 613 (43d ed. 2002) (hereinafter College
Admissions Data Handbook). And at Mississippi ValleyState University, a public HBC, only 1.1% of the freshman
class in 2001 was white. Id., at 603. If there is a "criticalmass" of whites at these institutions, then "critical mass" is
indeed a very small proportion.The majority grants deference to the Law School's "assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits,"ante, at 328. It follows, therefore, that an HBC's assessment that racial homogeneity will yield educational benefitswould similarly be given deference.

7 An HBC's rejection of

white applicants in order to maintain racial homogeneityseems permissible, therefore, under the majority's view of

the Equal Protection Clause. But see United States v. For-dice, 505 U. S. 717, 748 (1992) (

justification for a concept I thought long and rightly rejected--racial segregation.

Moreover one would think, in light of the Court's decision
in United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996), that before
being given license to use racial discrimination, the Law
School would be required to radically reshape its admissions
process, even to the point of sacrificing some elements of its
character. In Virginia, a majority of the Court, without a
word about academic freedom, accepted the all-male Virginia
Military Institute's (VMI) representation that some changes
in its "adversative" method of education would be required
with the admission of women, id., at 540, but did not defer
to VMI's judgment that these changes would be too great.
Instead, the Court concluded that they were "manageable."
Id., at 551, n. 19. That case involved sex discrimination,
which is subjected to intermediate, not strict, scrutiny. Id.,
at 533; Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976). So in Virginia, where the standard of review dictated that greater
flexibility be granted to VMI's educational policies than the
Law School deserves here, this Court gave no deference.
Apparently where the status quo being defended is that of
the elite establishment--here the Law School--rather than
a less fashionable Southern military institution, the Court
will defer without serious inquiry and without regard to the
applicable legal standard.

C

Virginia is also notable for the fact that the Court relied on the "experience" of formerly single-sex institutions,
such as the service academies, to conclude that admission of
women to VMI would be "manageable." 518 U. S., at 544-
545. Today, however, the majority ignores the "experience"
of those institutions that have been forced to abandon explicit racial discrimination in admissions.

"reputation[s] for excellence," ante, at 339, rivaling the LawSchool's have satisfied their sense of mission without resorting to prohibited racial discrimination.

V
Putting aside the absence of any legal support for the ma-jority's reflexive deference, there is much to be said for the

view that the use of tests and other measures to "predict"academic performance is a poor substitute for a system that
gives every applicant a chance to prove he can succeed inthe study of law. The rallying cry that in the absence of
racial discrimination in admissions there would be a true

or public contracting." See Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson,

9 Given the incredible deference the Law School receives from the Court,

I think it appropriate to indulge in the presumption that Boalt Hall operates without violating California law.

meritocracy ignores the fact that the entire process is poi-soned by numerous exceptions to "merit." For example, in

the national debate on racial discrimination in higher educa-tion admissions, much has been made of the fact that elite
institutions utilize a so-called "legacy" preference to give thechildren of alumni an advantage in admissions. This, and
other, exceptions to a "true" meritocracy give the lie to pro-testations that merit admissions are in fact the order of

the day at the Nation's universities. The Equal ProtectionClause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissionsprocedures. What the Equal Protection Clause does prohibit are classifications made on the basis of race. So whilelegacy preferences can stand under the Constitution, racial
discrimination cannot.10 I will not twist the Constitution toinvalidate legacy preferences or otherwise impose my vision
of higher education admissions on the Nation. The majorityshould similarly stay its impulse to validate faddish racial
discrimination the Constitution clearly forbids.In any event, there is nothing ancient, honorable, or constitutionally protected about "selective" admissions. The Uni-versity of Michigan should be well aware that alternative
methods have historically been used for the admission of stu-dents, for it brought to this country the German certificate
system in the late-19th century. See H. Wechsler, The Qual-ified Student 16-39 (1977) (hereinafter Qualified Student).
Under this system, a secondary school was certified by a uni-versity so that any graduate who completed the course offered by the school was offered admission to the university.The certification regime supplemented, and later virtually
replaced (at least in the Midwest), the prior regime of rigor10 Were this Court to have the courage to forbid the use of racial discrimination in admissions, legacy preferences (and similar practices) might
quickly become less popular--a possibility not lost, I am certain, on the
elites (both individual and institutional) supporting the Law School in
this case.

ous subject-matter entrance examinations. Id., at 57-58.The facially race-neutral "percent plans" now used in Texas,

California, and Florida, see ante, at 340, are in many waysthe descendents of the certificate system.

Certification was replaced by selective admissions in thebeginning of the 20th century, as universities sought to exercise more control over the composition of their student bodies. Since its inception, selective admissions has been thevehicle for racial, ethnic, and religious tinkering and experimentation by university administrators. The initial drivingforce for the relocation of the selective function from the high
school to the universities was the same desire to select racial
winners and losers that the Law School exhibits today. Columbia, Harvard, and others infamously determined that
they had "too many" Jews, just as today the Law School
argues it would have "too many" whites if it could not discriminate in its admissions process. See Qualified Student
155-168 (Columbia); H. Broun & G. Britt, Christians Only: A
Study in Prejudice 53-54 (1931) (Harvard).

Columbia employed intelligence tests precisely because
Jewish applicants, who were predominantly immigrants,
scored worse on such tests. Thus, Columbia could claim
(falsely) that " `[w]e have not eliminated boys because they
were Jews and do not propose to do so. We have honestly
attempted to eliminate the lowest grade of applicant
[through the use of intelligence testing] and it turns out that
a good many of the low grade men are New York City
Jews.' " Letter from Herbert E. Hawkes, dean of Columbia
College, to E. B. Wilson, June 16, 1922 (reprinted in Qualified
Student 160-161). In other words, the tests were adopted
with full knowledge of their disparate impact. Cf. DeFunis
v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 335 (1974) (per curiam) (Douglas,
J., dissenting).

Similarly no modern law school can claim ignorance of the
poor performance of blacks, relatively speaking, on the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT). Nevertheless, law schools

continue to use the test and then attempt to "correct" forblack underperformance by using racial discrimination in admissions so as to obtain their aesthetic student body. TheLaw School's continued adherence to measures it knows
produce racially skewed results is not entitled to deferenceby this Court. See Part IV,

supra. The Law School itself
admits that the test is imperfect, as it must, given that it
regularly admits students who score at or below 150 (thenational median) on the test. See App. 156-203 (showing

that, between 1995 and 2000, the Law School admitted 37students--27 of whom were black; 31 of whom were "underrepresented minorities"--with LSAT scores of 150 or lower).
And the Law School's amici cannot seem to agree on the
fundamental question whether the test itself is useful.
Compare Brief for Law School Admission Council as Amicus
Curiae 12 ("LSAT scores . . . are an effective predictor of
students' performance in law school") with Brief for Harvard
Black Law Students Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27
("Whether [the LSAT] measure[s] objective merit . . . is certainly questionable").

Having decided to use the LSAT, the Law School must
accept the constitutional burdens that come with this decision. The Law School may freely continue to employ the
LSAT and other allegedly merit-based standards in whatever fashion it likes. What the Equal Protection Clause forbids, but the Court today allows, is the use of these standards hand-in-hand with racial discrimination. An infinite
variety of admissions methods are available to the Law
School. Considering all of the radical thinking that has historically occurred at this country's universities, the Law
School's intractable approach toward admissions is striking.

The Court will not even deign to make the Law School
try other methods, however, preferring instead to grant a
25-year license to violate the Constitution. And the same
Court that had the courage to order the desegregation of all
public schools in the South now fears, on the basis of plati539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG

tudes rather than principle, to force the Law School to aban-don a decidedly imperfect admissions regime that provides

the basis for racial discrimination.

VI
The absence of any articulated legal principle supportingthe majority's principal holding suggests another rationale.

I believe what lies beneath the Court's decision today arethe benighted notions that one can tell when racial discrimination benefits (rather than hurts) minority groups, see Adarand, 515 U. S., at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment), and that racial discrimination is

necessary to remedy general societal ills. This Court's prec-edents supposedly settled both issues, but clearly the majority still cannot commit to the principle that racial classifica-tions are

per se harmful and that almost no amount of benefitin the eye of the beholder can justify such classifications.

Putting aside what I take to be the Court's implicit rejec-tion of Adarand's holding that beneficial and burdensome
racial classifications are equally invalid, I must contest thenotion that the Law School's discrimination benefits those
admitted as a result of it. The Court spends considerabletime discussing the impressive display of amicus support for
the Law School in this case from all corners of society.
Ante, at 330-331. But nowhere in any of the filings in thisCourt is any evidence that the purported "beneficiaries" of

this racial discrimination prove themselves by performing at(or even near) the same level as those students who receive
no preferences. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflectionson the Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605-1608
(1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial discrimi-nation in admissions to consider the fact that its "beneficiaries" are underperforming in the classroom).The silence in this case is deafening to those of us who
view higher education's purpose as imparting knowledge andskills to students, rather than a communal, rubber-stamp,

credentialing process. The Law School is not looking forthose students who, despite a lower LSAT score or undergraduate grade point average, will succeed in the study oflaw. The Law School seeks only a facade--it is sufficient
that the class looks right, even if it does not perform right.The Law School tantalizes unprepared students with the
promise of a University of Michigan degree and all of theopportunities that it offers. These overmatched students
take the bait, only to find that they cannot succeed in thecauldron of competition. And this mismatch crisis is not restricted to elite institutions. See T. Sowell, Race and Cul-ture 176-177 (1994) ("Even if most minority students are able
to meet the normal standards at the `average' range of col-leges and universities, the systematic mismatching of minority students begun at the top can mean that such studentsare generally overmatched throughout all levels of higher
education"). Indeed, to cover the tracks of the aestheticists,this cruel farce of racial discrimination must continue--
in selection for the Michigan Law Review, see Universityof Michigan Law School Student Handbook 2002-2003,
pp. 39-40 (noting the presence of a "diversity plan" for ad-mission to the review), and in hiring at law firms and for
judicial clerkships--until the "beneficiaries" are no longertolerated. While these students may graduate with law degrees, there is no evidence that they have received a qualita-tively better legal education (or become better lawyers) than
if they had gone to a less "elite" law school for which theywere better prepared. And the aestheticists will never address the real problems facing "underrepresented minori-ties,"

11 instead continuing their social experiments on other

people's children.

11 For example, there is no recognition by the Law School in this case
that even with their racial discrimination in place, black men are "underrepresented" at the Law School. See ABA-LSAC Guide 426 (reporting
that the Law School has 46 black women and 28 black men). Why does
the Law School not also discriminate in favor of black men over black

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Beyond the harm the Law School's racial discriminationvisits upon its test subjects, no social science has disproved

the notion that this discrimination "engender[s] attitudes ofsuperiority or, alternatively, provoke[s] resentment among
those who believe that they have been wronged by the gov-ernment's use of race." Adarand, 515 U. S., at 241 (

Thomas,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). "These

programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority andmay cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are `entitled' to preferences." Ibid.It is uncontested that each year, the Law School admits a
handful of blacks who would be admitted in the absence ofracial discrimination. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger
et al. 6. Who can differentiate between those who belongand those who do not? The majority of blacks are admitted
to the Law School because of discrimination, and because ofthis policy all are tarred as undeserving. This problem of
stigma does not depend on determinacy as to whether thosestigmatized are actually the "beneficiaries" of racial discrimination. When blacks take positions in the highest placesof government, industry, or academia, it is an open question today whether their skin color played a part in theiradvancement. The question itself is the stigma--because
either racial discrimination did play a role, in which case theperson may be deemed "otherwise unqualified," or it did not,
in which case asking the question itself unfairly marks thoseblacks who would succeed without discrimination. Is this
what the Court means by "visibly open"? Ante, at 332.Finally, the Court's disturbing reference to the importance
of the country's law schools as training grounds meant tocultivate "a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the
citizenry," ibid., through the use of racial discrimination de-serves discussion. As noted earlier, the Court has soundly

women, given this underrepresentation? The answer is, again, that all
the Law School cares about is its own image among know-it-all elites, not
solving real problems like the crisis of black male underperformance.

rejected the remedying of societal discrimination as a justi-fication for governmental use of race. Wygant, 476 U. S., at

276 (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U. S., at 497 (pluralityopinion); id., at 520-521 (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).For those who believe that every racial disproportionality in

our society is caused by some kind of racial discrimination,there can be no distinction between remedying societal discrimination and erasing racial disproportionalities in thecountry's leadership caste. And if the lack of proportional
racial representation among our leaders is not caused by so-cietal discrimination, then "fixing" it is even less of a pressing public necessity.The Court's civics lesson presents yet another example of
judicial selection of a theory of political representation basedon skin color--an endeavor I have previously rejected. See
Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 899 (1994) (Thomas, J., concur-ring in judgment). The majority appears to believe that
broader utopian goals justify the Law School's use of race,but "[t]he Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination
of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy ourtheory as to how society ought to be organized."

DeFunis,416 U. S., at 342 (Douglas, J., dissenting).

VII
As the foregoing makes clear, I believe the Court's opinionto be, in most respects, erroneous. I do, however, find two

points on which I agree. A

First, I note that the issue of unconstitutional racial dis-crimination among the groups the Law School prefers is not
presented in this case, because petitioner has never arguedthat the Law School engages in such a practice, and the Law
School maintains that it does not. See Brief for RespondentBollinger et al. 32, n. 50, and 6-7, n. 7. I join the Court's
opinion insofar as it confirms that this type of racial discrimi-nation remains unlawful.

Ante, at 326-327. Under today's

Opinion of Thomas, J.
decision, it is still the case that racial discrimination that
does not help a university to enroll an unspecified number,
or "critical mass," of underrepresented minority students is
unconstitutional. Thus, the Law School may not discriminate in admissions between similarly situated blacks and
Hispanics, or between whites and Asians. This is so because preferring black to Hispanic applicants, for instance,
does nothing to further the interest recognized by the majority today.12 Indeed, the majority describes such racial balancing as "patently unconstitutional." Ante, at 330. Like
the Court, ante, at 336, I express no opinion as to whether
the Law School's current admissions program runs afoul of
this prohibition.

B

The Court also holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years before it is deemed
no longer narrowly tailored to the Law School's fabricated
compelling state interest. Ante, at 343. While I agree that
in 25 years the practices of the Law School will be illegal,
they are, for the reasons I have given, illegal now. The majority does not and cannot rest its time limitation on any
evidence that the gap in credentials between black and white

12 That interest depends on enrolling a "critical mass" of underrepresented minority students, as the majority repeatedly states. Ante, at 316,
318, 319, 330, 333, 335, 340; cf. ante, at 333 (referring to the unique experience of being a "racial minority," as opposed to being black, or Native
American); ante, at 335-336 (rejecting argument that the Law School
maintains a disguised quota by referring to the total number of enrolled
underrepresented minority students, not specific races). As it relates to
the Law School's racial discrimination, the Court clearly approves of only
one use of race--the distinction between underrepresented minority applicants and those of all other races. A relative preference awarded to a
black applicant over, for example, a similarly situated Native American
applicant, does not lead to the enrollment of even one more underrepresented minority student, but only balances the races within the "critical
mass."

students is shrinking or will be gone in that timeframe.13 Inrecent years there has been virtually no change, for example,

in the proportion of law school applicants with LSAT scoresof 165 and higher who are black.

14 In 1993 blacks constituted 1.1% of law school applicants in that score range,though they represented 11.1% of all applicants. Law

School Admission Council, National Statistical Report (1994)(hereinafter LSAC Statistical Report). In 2000 the comparable numbers were 1.0% and 11.3%. LSAC Statistical Re-port (2001). No one can seriously contend, and the Court
does not, that the racial gap in academic credentials will dis-appear in 25 years. Nor is the Court's holding that racial
discrimination will be unconstitutional in 25 years made con-tingent on the gap closing in that time.

15

13 I agree with Justice Ginsburg that the Court's holding that racial
discrimination in admissions will be illegal in 25 years is not based upon a
"forecast," post, at 346 (concurring opinion). I do not agree with Justice
Ginsburg's characterization of the Court's holding as an expression of
"hope." Ibid.

14 I use a score of 165 as the benchmark here because the Law School

feels it is the relevant score range for applicant consideration (absent race
discrimination). See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 5; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 309a (showing that the median LSAT score for all accepted applicants from 1995-1998 was 168); id., at 310a-311a (showing the median
LSAT score for accepted applicants was 167 for the years 1999 and 2000);
University of Michigan Law School Website, available at http://www.
law.umich.edu/prospectivestudents/Admissions/index.htm (showing that
the median LSAT score for accepted applicants in 2002 was 166).

15 The majority's non sequitur observation that since 1978 the number

of blacks that have scored in these upper ranges on the LSAT has grown,
ante, at 343, says nothing about current trends. First, black participation
in the LSAT until the early 1990's lagged behind black representation
in the general population. For instance, in 1984 only 7.3% of law school
applicants were black, whereas in 2000 11.3% of law school applicants were
black. See LSAC Statistical Reports (1984 and 2000). Today, however,
unless blacks were to begin applying to law school in proportions greater
than their representation in the general population, the growth in absolute
numbers of high scoring blacks should be expected to plateau, and it has.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Indeed, the very existence of racial discrimination of thetype practiced by the Law School may impede the narrowing

of the LSAT testing gap. An applicant's LSAT score canimprove dramatically with preparation, but such preparation
is a cost, and there must be sufficient benefits attached to animproved score to justify additional study. Whites scoring
between 163 and 167 on the LSAT are routinely rejected by
the Law School, and thus whites aspiring to admission at theLaw School have every incentive to improve their score to

levels above that range. See App. 199 (showing that in 2000,209 out of 422 white applicants were rejected in this scoring
range). Blacks, on the other hand, are nearly guaranteedadmission if they score above 155.

Id., at 198 (showing that
63 out of 77 black applicants are accepted with LSAT scoresabove 155). As admission prospects approach certainty,

there is no incentive for the black applicant to continue toprepare for the LSAT once he is reasonably assured of
achieving the requisite score. It is far from certain that theLSAT test-taker's behavior is responsive to the Law School's
admissions policies.16 Nevertheless, the possibility remains
that this racial discrimination will help fulfill the bigot'sprophecy about black underperformance--just as it confirms

the conspiracy theorist's belief that "institutional racism" isat fault for every racial disparity in our society.

I therefore can understand the imposition of a 25-year timelimit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays
to the Law School's educational judgments and refusal to
change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that
point these policies will clearly have failed to " `eliminat[e]

In 1992, 63 black applicants to law school had LSAT scores above 165. In
2000, that number was 65. See LSAC Statistical Reports (1992 and 2000).

16 I use the LSAT as an example, but the same incentive structure is in

place for any admissions criteria, including undergraduate grades, on
which minorities are consistently admitted at thresholds significantly
lower than whites.

the [perceived] need for any racial or ethnic' " discriminationbecause the academic credentials gap will still be there.

Ante, at 343 (quoting Nathanson & Bartnik, The Constitu-tionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants
to Professional Schools, 58 Chicago Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May-June 1977)). The Court defines this time limit in terms of
narrow tailoring, see ante, at 343, but I believe this arisesfrom its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest
vindicated today. Cf. Part II, supra. With these observa-tions, I join the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of
the Court. * * *

For the immediate future, however, the majority hasplaced its

imprimatur on a practice that can only weakenthe principle of equality embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Equal Protection Clause. "Our Constitu-tion is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes
among citizens." Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559(1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). It has been nearly 140 years
since Frederick Douglass asked the intellectual ancestors ofthe Law School to "[d]o nothing with us!" and the Nation
adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. Now we must waitanother 25 years to see this principle of equality vindicated.
I therefore respectfully dissent from the remainder of theCourt's opinion and the judgment.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

I agree with the Court that, "in the limited circumstancewhen drawing racial distinctions is permissible," the government must ensure that its means are narrowly tailored toachieve a compelling state interest. Ante, at 333; see also

mental purpose"). I do not believe, however, that the Uni-versity of Michigan Law School's (Law School) means are

narrowly tailored to the interest it asserts. The Law Schoolclaims it must take the steps it does to achieve a " `critical
mass' " of underrepresented minority students. Brief forRespondent Bollinger et al. 13. But its actual program
bears no relation to this asserted goal. Stripped of its "critical mass" veil, the Law School's program is revealed as anaked effort to achieve racial balancing.

As we have explained many times, " ` "[a]ny preferencebased on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive
a most searching examination." ' " Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 223 (1995) (quoting Wygant v.
Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 273 (1986) (plurality opinion of Powell, J.)). Our cases establish that, in order to withstand this demanding inquiry, respondents must demonstrate
that their methods of using race " `fit' " a compelling state
interest "with greater precision than any alternative means."
Id., at 280, n. 6; Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S.
265, 299 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) ("When [political judgments] touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background,
he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he
is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a
compelling governmental interest").

Before the Court's decision today, we consistently applied
the same strict scrutiny analysis regardless of the government's purported reason for using race and regardless of the
setting in which race was being used. We rejected calls to
use more lenient review in the face of claims that race was
being used in "good faith" because " `[m]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate
its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system.' " Adarand, supra, at 226; Fullilove, supra, at 537

between justification and classification"). We likewise re539US1 Unit: $U77 [07-05-05 18:42:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG

jected calls to apply more lenient review based on the partic-ular setting in which race is being used. Indeed, even in

the specific context of higher education, we emphasized that"constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may
not be disregarded." Bakke, supra, at 314.Although the Court recites the language of our strict scrutiny analysis, its application of that review is unprecedented
in its deference.Respondents' asserted justification for the Law School's

use of race in the admissions process is "obtaining `the edu-cational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.' "
Ante, at 328 (quoting Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al.
i). They contend that a "critical mass" of underrepresented
minorities is necessary to further that interest. Ante, at
330. Respondents and school administrators explain generally that "critical mass" means a sufficient number of underrepresented minority students to achieve several objectives:
To ensure that these minority students do not feel isolated
or like spokespersons for their race; to provide adequate opportunities for the type of interaction upon which the educational benefits of diversity depend; and to challenge all students to think critically and reexamine stereotypes. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 211a; Brief for Respondent Bollinger
et al. 26. These objectives indicate that "critical mass" relates to the size of the student body. Id., at 5 (claiming that
the Law School has enrolled "critical mass," or "enough
minority students to provide meaningful integration of
its classrooms and residence halls"). Respondents further
claim that the Law School is achieving "critical mass." Id.,
at 4 (noting that the Law School's goals have been "greatly
furthered by the presence of . . . a `critical mass' of " minority
students in the student body).

In practice, the Law School's program bears little or no
relation to its asserted goal of achieving "critical mass."
Respondents explain that the Law School seeks to accumulate a "critical mass" of each underrepresented minority

group. See, e. g., id., at 49, n. 79 ("The Law School's . . .current policy . . . provide[s] a special commitment to enrolling a `critical mass' of `Hispanics' "). But the record dem-onstrates that the Law School's admissions practices with
respect to these groups differ dramatically and cannot bedefended under any consistent use of the term "critical
mass."From 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted between 1,130 and 1,310 students. Of those, between 13 and19 were Native American, between 91 and 108 were
African-American, and between 47 and 56 were Hispanic. Ifthe Law School is admitting between 91 and 108 AfricanAmericans in order to achieve "critical mass," thereby pre-venting African-American students from feeling "isolated or
like spokespersons for their race," one would think that anumber of the same order of magnitude would be necessary
to accomplish the same purpose for Hispanics and NativeAmericans. Similarly, even if all of the Native American
applicants admitted in a given year matriculate, which therecord demonstrates is not at all the case,* how can this possibly constitute a "critical mass" of Native Americans in aclass of over 350 students? In order for this pattern of admission to be consistent with the Law School's explanationof "critical mass," one would have to believe that the objectives of "critical mass" offered by respondents are achievedwith only half the number of Hispanics and one-sixth the
number of Native Americans as compared to African-Americans. But respondents offer no race-specific reasons
for such disparities. Instead, they simply emphasize the im-portance of achieving "critical mass," without any explanation of why that concept is applied differently among thethree underrepresented minority groups.

*Indeed, during this 5-year time period, enrollment of Native American
students dropped to as low as three such students. Any assertion that
such a small group constituted a "critical mass" of Native Americans is
simply absurd.

382 GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
These different numbers, moreover, come only as a resultof substantially different treatment among the three underrepresented minority groups, as is apparent in an exampleoffered by the Law School and highlighted by the Court:
The school asserts that it "frequently accepts nonminorityapplicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected." Ante, at 338 (citing Brief for Re-spondent Bollinger et al. 10). Specifically, the Law School

states that "[s]ixty-nine minority applicants were rejectedbetween 1995 and 2000 with at least a 3.5 [Grade Point Average (GPA)] and a [score of] 159 or higher on the [Law School
Admission Test (LSAT)]" while a number of Caucasian and
Asian-American applicants with similar or lower scores were
admitted. Ibid.

Review of the record reveals only 67 such individuals. Of
these 67 individuals, 56 were Hispanic, while only 6 were
African-American, and only 5 were Native American. This
discrepancy reflects a consistent practice. For example, in
2000, 12 Hispanics who scored between a 159-160 on the
LSAT and earned a GPA of 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 2 were admitted. App. 200-201. Meanwhile,
12 African-Americans in the same range of qualifications applied for admission and all 12 were admitted. Id., at 198.
Likewise, that same year, 16 Hispanics who scored between
a 151-153 on the LSAT and earned a 3.00 or higher applied
for admission and only 1 of those applicants was admitted.
Id., at 200-201. Twenty-three similarly qualified AfricanAmericans applied for admission and 14 were admitted.
Id., at 198.

These statistics have a significant bearing on petitioner's
case. Respondents have never offered any race-specific arguments explaining why significantly more individuals from
one underrepresented minority group are needed in order
to achieve "critical mass" or further student body diversity.
They certainly have not explained why Hispanics, who they

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
have said are among "the groups most isolated by racial bar-riers in our country," should have their admission capped out

in this manner. Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 50.True, petitioner is neither Hispanic nor Native American.
But the Law School's disparate admissions practices with re-spect to these minority groups demonstrate that its alleged
goal of "critical mass" is simply a sham. Petitioner may use
these statistics to expose this sham, which is the basis forthe Law School's admission of less qualified underrepresented minorities in preference to her. Surely strict scru-tiny cannot permit these sorts of disparities without at least
some explanation.

Only when the "critical mass" label is discarded does a
likely explanation for these numbers emerge. The Court
states that the Law School's goal of attaining a "critical
mass" of underrepresented minority students is not an interest in merely " `assur[ing] within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its
race or ethnic origin.' " Ante, at 329 (quoting Bakke, 438
U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.)). The Court recognizes
that such an interest "would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional." Ante, at 330.
The Court concludes, however, that the Law School's use of
race in admissions, consistent with Justice Powell's opinion
in Bakke, only pays " `[s]ome attention to numbers.' " Ante,
at 336 (quoting Bakke, supra, at 323).

But the correlation between the percentage of the Law
School's pool of applicants who are members of the three minority groups and the percentage of the admitted applicants
who are members of these same groups is far too precise to
be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying "some
attention to [the] numbers." As the tables below show, from
1995 through 2000 the percentage of admitted applicants who
were members of these minority groups closely tracked the
percentage of individuals in the school's applicant pool who
were from the same groups.

For example, in 1995, when 9.7% of the applicant pool wasAfrican-American, 9.4% of the admitted class was AfricanAmerican. By 2000, only 7.5% of the applicant pool wasAfrican-American, and 7.3% of the admitted class was
African-American. This correlation is striking. Respond-ents themselves emphasize that the number of underrepresented minority students admitted to the Law School would
be significantly smaller if the race of each applicant werenot considered. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a; Brief for

Respondent Bollinger et al. 6 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert.299a). But, as the examples above illustrate, the measure
of the decrease would differ dramatically among the groups.
The tight correlation between the percentage of applicants
and admittees of a given race, therefore, must result from
careful race based planning by the Law School. It suggests
a formula for admission based on the aspirational assumption that all applicants are equally qualified academically,
and therefore that the proportion of each group admitted
should be the same as the proportion of that group in the
applicant pool. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al.
43, n. 70 (discussing admissions officers' use of "periodic
reports" to track "the racial composition of the developing
class").

Not only do respondents fail to explain this phenomenon,
they attempt to obscure it. See id., at 32, n. 50 ("The Law
School's minority enrollment percentages . . . diverged from
the percentages in the applicant pool by as much as 17.7%
from 1995-2000"). But the divergence between the percentages of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool and
in the enrolled classes is not the only relevant comparison.
In fact, it may not be the most relevant comparison. The
Law School cannot precisely control which of its admitted
applicants decide to attend the university. But it can and,
as the numbers demonstrate, clearly does employ racial preferences in extending offers of admission. Indeed, the ostensibly flexible nature of the Law School's admissions program

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
that the Court finds appealing, see ante, at 337-338, appears
to be, in practice, a carefully managed program designed to
ensure proportionate representation of applicants from selected minority groups.

I do not believe that the Constitution gives the Law School
such free rein in the use of race. The Law School has offered no explanation for its actual admissions practices and,
unexplained, we are bound to conclude that the Law School
has managed its admissions program, not to achieve a "critical mass," but to extend offers of admission to members of
selected minority groups in proportion to their statistical
representation in the applicant pool. But this is precisely
the type of racial balancing that the Court itself calls "patently unconstitutional." Ante, at 330.

Finally, I believe that the Law School's program fails strict
scrutiny because it is devoid of any reasonably precise time
limit on the Law School's use of race in admissions. We
have emphasized that we will consider "the planned duration
of the remedy" in determining whether a race-conscious program is constitutional. Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 510 (Powell,
J., concurring); see also United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S.
149, 171 (1987) ("In determining whether race-conscious remedies are appropriate, we look to several factors, including
the . . . duration of the relief "). Our previous cases have
required some limit on the duration of programs such as this
because discrimination on the basis of race is invidious.

The Court suggests a possible 25-year limitation on the
Law School's current program. See ante, at 343. Respondents, on the other hand, remain more ambiguous, explaining that "[t]he Law School of course recognizes that raceconscious programs must have reasonable durational limits,
and the Sixth Circuit properly found such a limit in the Law
School's resolve to cease considering race when genuine
race-neutral alternatives become available." Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 32. These discussions of a time

limit are the vaguest of assurances. In truth, they permitthe Law School's use of racial preferences on a seemingly

permanent basis. Thus, an important component of strictscrutiny--that a program be limited in time--is casually
subverted.The Court, in an unprecedented display of deference under
our strict scrutiny analysis, upholds the Law School's program despite its obvious flaws. We have said that when itcomes to the use of race, the connection between the ends

and the means used to attain them must be precise. Buthere the flaw is deeper than that; it is not merely a question
of "fit" between ends and means. Here the means actuallyused are forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the
Constitution.

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
The separate opinion by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ.
of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 289-291, 315-318 (1978), is
based on the principle that a university admissions program
may take account of race as one, nonpredominant factor in a
system designed to consider each applicant as an individual,
provided the program can meet the test of strict scrutiny
by the judiciary. This is a unitary formulation. If strict
scrutiny is abandoned or manipulated to distort its real and
accepted meaning, the Court lacks authority to approve the
use of race even in this modest, limited way. The opinion
by Justice Powell, in my view, states the correct rule for
resolving this case. The Court, however, does not apply
strict scrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines
both the test and its own controlling precedents.

Justice Powell's approval of the use of race in university admissions reflected a tradition, grounded in the First
Amendment, of acknowledging a university's conception of
its educational mission. Id., at 312-314; ante, at 329. Our
precedents provide a basis for the Court's acceptance of a
university's considered judgment that racial diversity among

Kennedy, J., dissenting
students can further its educational task, when supported byempirical evidence.

Ante, at 329-331.
It is unfortunate, however, that the Court takes the firstpart of Justice Powell's rule but abandons the second. Having approved the use of race as a factor in the admissionsprocess, the majority proceeds to nullify the essential safeguard Justice Powell insisted upon as the precondition of the
approval. The safeguard was rigorous judicial review, withstrict scrutiny as the controlling standard.

Bakke, supra, at
291 ("Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherentlysuspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination"). This Court has reaffirmed, subsequent to Bakke, the
absolute necessity of strict scrutiny when the State uses race
as an operative category. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 224 (1995) ("[A]ny person, of whatever
race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification
subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the
strictest judicial scrutiny"); Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,
488 U. S. 469, 493-494 (1989); see id., at 519 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[A]ny racial
preference must face the most rigorous scrutiny by the
courts"). The Court confuses deference to a university's
definition of its educational objective with deference to the
implementation of this goal. In the context of university
admissions the objective of racial diversity can be accepted
based on empirical data known to us, but deference is not to
be given with respect to the methods by which it is pursued.
Preferment by race, when resorted to by the State, can be
the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential to destroy confidence in the Constitution and in the
idea of equality. The majority today refuses to be faithful
to the settled principle of strict review designed to reflect
these concerns.

The Court, in a review that is nothing short of perfunctory,
accepts the University of Michigan Law School's (Law

Kennedy, J., dissenting
School) assurances that its admissions process meets withconstitutional requirements. The majority fails to confront

the reality of how the Law School's admissions policy is im-plemented. The dissenting opinion by

The Chief Justice,
which I join in full, demonstrates beyond question why theconcept of critical mass is a delusion used by the Law School

to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most
instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishablefrom quotas. An effort to achieve racial balance among the

minorities the school seeks to attract is, by the Court's ownadmission, "patently unconstitutional."

Ante, at 330; see
also Bakke, supra, at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). It remains
to point out how critical mass becomes inconsistent with individual consideration in some more specific aspects of the admissions process.

About 80% to 85% of the places in the entering class are
given to applicants in the upper range of Law School Admissions Test scores and grades. An applicant with these credentials likely will be admitted without consideration of race
or ethnicity. With respect to the remaining 15% to 20% of
the seats, race is likely outcome determinative for many
members of minority groups. That is where the competition
becomes tight and where any given applicant's chance of admission is far smaller if he or she lacks minority status. At
this point the numerical concept of critical mass has the real
potential to compromise individual review.

The Law School has not demonstrated how individual consideration is, or can be, preserved at this stage of the application process given the instruction to attain what it calls critical mass. In fact the evidence shows otherwise. There
was little deviation among admitted minority students during the years from 1995 to 1998. The percentage of enrolled
minorities fluctuated only by 0.3%, from 13.5% to 13.8%.
The number of minority students to whom offers were extended varied by just a slightly greater magnitude of 2.2%,
from the high of 15.6% in 1995 to the low of 13.4% in 1998.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The District Court relied on this uncontested fact to drawan inference that the Law School's pursuit of critical mass

mutated into the equivalent of a quota. 137 F. Supp. 2d 821,851 (ED Mich. 2001). Admittedly, there were greater fluctuations among enrolled minorities in the preceding years,1987-1994, by as much as 5% or 6%. The percentage of minority offers, however, at no point fell below 12%, historicallydefined by the Law School as the bottom of its critical mass
range. The greater variance during the earlier years, in anyevent, does not dispel suspicion that the school engaged in
racial balancing. The data would be consistent with an in-ference that the Law School modified its target only twice,
in 1991 (from 13% to 19%), and then again in 1995 (back from20% to 13%). The intervening year, 1993, when the percentage dropped to 14.5%, could be an aberration, caused by theschool's miscalculation as to how many applicants with offers
would accept or by its redefinition, made in April 1992, ofwhich minority groups were entitled to race-based preference. See Brief for Respondent Bollinger et al. 49, n. 79.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
scrutiny requires the Law School to overcome the inference.Whether the objective of critical mass "is described as a

quota or a goal, it is a line drawn on the basis of race andethnic status," and so risks compromising individual assessment. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289 (opinion of Powell, J.). Inthis respect the Law School program compares unfavorably
with the experience of Little Ivy League colleges. Amicus
Amherst College, for example, informs us that the offers itextended to students of African-American background during the period from 1993 to 2002 ranged between 81 and 125out of 950 offers total, resulting in a fluctuation from 24 to
49 matriculated students in a class of about 425. See Brief
for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11. The Law
School insisted upon a much smaller fluctuation, both in the
offers extended and in the students who eventually enrolled,
despite having a comparable class size.

The Law School has the burden of proving, in conformance
with the standard of strict scrutiny, that it did not utilize
race in an unconstitutional way. Adarand Constructors, 515
U. S., at 224. At the very least, the constancy of admitted
minority students and the close correlation between the racial breakdown of admitted minorities and the composition
of the applicant pool, discussed by The Chief Justice, ante,
at 380-386, require the Law School either to produce a convincing explanation or to show it has taken adequate steps
to ensure individual assessment. The Law School does
neither.

The obvious tension between the pursuit of critical mass
and the requirement of individual review increased by the
end of the admissions season. Most of the decisions where
race may decide the outcome are made during this period.
See supra, at 389. The admissions officers consulted the
daily reports which indicated the composition of the incoming class along racial lines. As Dennis Shields, Director of
Admissions from 1991 to 1996, stated, "the further [he] went
into the [admissions] season the more frequently [he] would

Kennedy, J., dissenting
want to look at these [reports] and see the change from day-to-day." These reports would "track exactly where [the

Law School] st[ood] at any given time in assembling theclass," and so would tell the admissions personnel whether
they were short of assembling a critical mass of minoritystudents. Shields generated these reports because the Law
School's admissions policy told him the racial makeup of the
entering class was "something [he] need[ed] to be concernedabout," and so he had "to find a way of tracking what's going

on." Deposition of Dennis Shields in Civ. Action No. 97-75928, pp. 129-130, 141 (ED Mich., Dec. 7, 1998).

The consultation of daily reports during the last stages inthe admissions process suggests there was no further attempt at individual review save for race itself. The admis-sions officers could use the reports to recalibrate the plus
factor given to race depending on how close they were toachieving the Law School's goal of critical mass. The bonus
factor of race would then become divorced from individualreview; it would be premised instead on the numerical objective set by the Law School.

The Law School made no effort to guard against this dan-ger. It provided no guidelines to its admissions personnel

on how to reconcile individual assessment with the directive to admit a critical mass of minority students. The
admissions program could have been structured to eliminate at least some of the risk that the promise of individual evaluation was not being kept. The daily consideration
of racial breakdown of admitted students is not a feature
of affirmative-action programs used by other institutions of

higher learning. The Little Ivy League colleges, for instance, do not keep ongoing tallies of racial or ethnic composition of their entering students. See Brief for Amherst
College et al. as Amici Curiae 10.

To be constitutional, a university's compelling interest in
a diverse student body must be achieved by a system where
individual assessment is safeguarded through the entire
process. There is no constitutional objection to the goal of

Kennedy, J., dissenting
considering race as one modest factor among many others to
achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure,
through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives
individual consideration and that race does not become a
predominant factor in the admissions decisionmaking. The
Law School failed to comply with this requirement, and by
no means has it carried its burden to show otherwise by the
test of strict scrutiny.

The Court's refusal to apply meaningful strict scrutiny
will lead to serious consequences. By deferring to the law
schools' choice of minority admissions programs, the courts
will lose the talents and resources of the faculties and administrators in devising new and fairer ways to ensure individual
consideration. Constant and rigorous judicial review forces
the law school faculties to undertake their responsibilities as
state employees in this most sensitive of areas with utmost
fidelity to the mandate of the Constitution. Dean Allan
Stillwagon, who directed the Law School's Office of Admissions from 1979 to 1990, explained the difficulties he encountered in defining racial groups entitled to benefit under the
Law School's affirmative action policy. He testified that faculty members were "breathtakingly cynical" in deciding who
would qualify as a member of underrepresented minorities.
An example he offered was faculty debate as to whether Cubans should be counted as Hispanics: One professor objected
on the grounds that Cubans were Republicans. Many academics at other law schools who are "affirmative action's
more forthright defenders readily concede that diversity is
merely the current rationale of convenience for a policy that
they prefer to justify on other grounds." Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. & Pol'y
Rev. 1, 34 (2002) (citing Levinson, Diversity, 2 U. Pa. J. Const.
L. 573, 577-578 (2000); Rubenfeld, Affirmative Action, 107
Yale L. J. 427, 471 (1997)). This is not to suggest the faculty
at Michigan or other law schools do not pursue aspirations
they consider laudable and consistent with our constitutional

traditions. It is but further evidence of the necessity forscrutiny that is real, not feigned, where the corrosive category of race is a factor in decisionmaking. Prospective stu-dents, the courts, and the public can demand that the State
and its law schools prove their process is fair and constitu-tional in every phase of implementation.

It is difficult to assess the Court's pronouncement that
race-conscious admissions programs will be unnecessary 25years from now.

Ante, at 341-343. If it is intended to mitigate the damage the Court does to the concept of strict scru-tiny, neither petitioner nor other rejected law school applicants will find solace in knowing the basic protection put in
place by Justice Powell will be suspended for a full quarter
of a century. Deference is antithetical to strict scrutiny, not
consistent with it.

As to the interpretation that the opinion contains its own
self-destruct mechanism, the majority's abandonment of
strict scrutiny undermines this objective. Were the courts
to apply a searching standard to race-based admissions
schemes, that would force educational institutions to seriously explore race-neutral alternatives. The Court, by contrast, is willing to be satisfied by the Law School's profession
of its own good faith. The majority admits as much: "We
take the Law School at its word that it would `like nothing
better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula' and
will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon
as practicable." Ante, at 343 (quoting Brief for Respondent
Bollinger et al. 34).

If universities are given the latitude to administer programs that are tantamount to quotas, they will have few incentives to make the existing minority admissions schemes
transparent and protective of individual review. The unhappy consequence will be to perpetuate the hostilities that
proper consideration of race is designed to avoid. The perpetuation, of course, would be the worst of all outcomes.
Other programs do exist which will be more effective in

bringing about the harmony and mutual respect among allcitizens that our constitutional tradition has always sought.

They, and not the program under review here, should be themodel, even if the Court defaults by not demanding it.

It is regrettable the Court's important holding allowingracial minorities to have their special circumstances considered in order to improve their educational opportunities isaccompanied by a suspension of the strict scrutiny which was
the predicate of allowing race to be considered in the firstplace. If the Court abdicates its constitutional duty to give
strict scrutiny to the use of race in university admissions, itnegates my authority to approve the use of race in pursuit
of student diversity. The Constitution cannot confer theright to classify on the basis of race even in this special context absent searching judicial review. For these reasons,though I reiterate my approval of giving appropriate consideration to race in this one context, I must dissent in thepresent case.

AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION et al. v.GARAMENDI, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER,

STATE OF CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 02-722. Argued April 23, 2003--Decided June 23, 2003
The Nazi Government of Germany confiscated the value or proceeds of

many Jewish life insurance policies issued before and during the Second
World War. After the war, even a policy that had escaped confiscation
was likely to be dishonored, whether because insurers denied its existence or claimed it had lapsed from unpaid premiums, or because the
German Government would not provide heirs with documentation of the
policyholder's death. Responsibility as between the government and
insurance companies is disputed, but the fact is that the proceeds of
many insurance policies issued to Jews before and during the war were
paid to the Third Reich or never paid at all. These confiscations and
frustrations of claims fell within the subject of reparations, which became a principal object of Allied diplomacy after the war. Ultimately,
the western Allies placed the obligation to provide restitution to victims
of Nazi persecution on the new West German Government, which
enacted restitution laws and signed agreements with other countries for
the compensation of their nationals. Despite a payout of more than 100
billion deutsch marks as of 2000, however, these measures left out many
claimants and certain types of claims. After German reunification,
class actions for restitution poured into United States courts against
companies doing business in Germany during the Nazi era. Protests
by defendant companies and their governments prompted the United
States Government to take action to try to resolve the matter. Negotiations at the national level produced the German Foundation Agreement, in which Germany agreed to establish a foundation funded with
10 billion deutsch marks contributed equally by the German Government and German companies to compensate the companies' victims during the Nazi era. The President agreed that whenever a German company was sued on a Holocaust-era claim in an American court, the
Government would (1) submit a statement that it would be in this country's foreign policy interests for the foundation to be the exclusive forum
and remedy for such claims, and (2) try to get state and local governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive mechanism. As for
insurance claims in particular, both countries agreed that the German

Foundation would work with the International Commission on Holocaust
Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC), a voluntary organization whose mission is to negotiate with European insurers to provide information about
and settlement of unpaid insurance policies, and which has set up procedures to that end. The German agreement has served as a model for
similar agreements with Austria and France.

Meanwhile, California began its own enquiry into the issue, prompting
state legislation designed to force payment by defaulting insurers.
Among other laws, California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act
of 1999 (HVIRA) requires any insurer doing business in the State to
disclose information about all policies sold in Europe between 1920 and
1945 by the company or any one "related" to it upon penalty of loss of
its state business license. After HVIRA was enacted, the State issued
administrative subpoenas against several subsidiaries of European insurance companies participating in the ICHEIC. Immediately, the
Federal Government informed California officials that HVIRA would
damage the ICHEIC, the only effective means to process quickly and
completely unpaid Holocaust era insurance claims, and that HVIRA
would possibly derail the German Foundation Agreement. Nevertheless, the state insurance commissioner announced that he would enforce
HVIRA to its fullest. Petitioner insurance entities then filed this suit
challenging HVIRA's constitutionality. The District Court issued a
preliminary injunction against enforcing HVIRA and later granted petitioners summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding, inter
alia, that HVIRA did not violate the federal foreign affairs power.

Held: California's HVIRA interferes with the President's conduct of the

Nation's foreign policy and is therefore preempted. Pp. 413-429.

(a) There is no question that at some point an exercise of state power
that touches on foreign relations must yield to the National Government's policy or that generally there is executive authority to decide
what that policy should be. In foreign policymaking, the President, not
Congress, has the "lead role." First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Nacional
de Cuba, 406 U. S. 759, 767. Specifically, the President has authority
to make "executive agreements" with other countries, requiring no
ratification by the Senate or approval by Congress. See, e. g., Dames &
Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 679, 682-683. Making such agreements
to settle claims of American nationals against foreign governments is a
particularly longstanding practice. Although the executive agreements
with Germany, Austria, and France at issue differ from past agreements
in that they address claims associated with formerly belligerent states,
but against corporations, not the foreign governments, the distinction
does not matter. Insisting on a sharp line between public and private

acts in defining the legitimate scope of the Executive's international
negotiations would hamstring the President in settling international
controversies. Generally, then, valid executive agreements are fit to
preempt state law, and if the agreements here had expressly preempted
laws like HVIRA, the issue would be straightforward. But since these
agreements include no preemption clause, petitioners' preemption claim
rests on the asserted interference with Presidential foreign policy that
the agreements embody. The principal support for this claim of preemption is Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U. S. 429. In invalidating an Oregon statute, the Zschernig majority relied on statements in previous
cases that are open to the reading that state action with more than
incidental effect on foreign affairs is preempted, even absent any affirmative federal activity in the subject area of the state law, and hence
without any showing of conflict. See, e. g., id., at 432. Justice Harlan,
concurring in the result, disagreed on this point, arguing that its implication of preemption of the entire foreign affairs field was at odds with
other cases suggesting that, absent positive federal action, States may
legislate in areas of their traditional competence even though their statutes may have an incidental effect on foreign relations. Id., at 459.
Whether respect for the executive foreign relations power requires a
categorical choice between the contrasting theories of field and conflict
preemption evident in Zschernig requires no answer here, for even on
Justice Harlan's view, shared by the majority, the likelihood that state
legislation will produce something more than incidental effect in conflict
with the National Government's express foreign policy would require
preemption of the state law. See also United States v. Pink, 315 U. S.
203, 230-231. And since on his view it is legislation within "areas of
. . . traditional competence" that gives a State any claim to prevail, 389
U. S., at 459, it is reasonable to consider the strength of the state interest, judged by standards of traditional practice, when deciding how serious a conflict must be shown before declaring the state law preempted.
Pp. 413-420.

(b) There is a sufficiently clear conflict between HVIRA and the President's foreign policy, as expressed both in the executive agreements
with Germany, Austria, and France, and in statements by high-level
Executive Branch officials, to require preemption here even without any
consideration of the State's interest. The account of negotiations toward those agreements shows that the consistent Presidential foreign
policy has been to encourage European governments and companies to
volunteer settlement funds and disclosure of policy information, in preference to litigation or coercive sanctions. California has taken a different tack: HVIRA's economic compulsion to make public disclosure, of far
more information about far more policies than ICHEIC rules require,

employs "a different, state system of economic pressure," and in doing
so undercuts the President's diplomatic discretion and the choice he has
made exercising it. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530
U. S. 363, 376. Whereas the President's authority to provide for settling claims in winding up international hostilities requires flexibility in
wielding "the coercive power of the national economy" as a tool of diplomacy, id., at 377, HVIRA denies this, by making exclusion from a large
sector of the American insurance market the automatic sanction for noncompliance with the State's own disclosure policies. HVIRA thus compromises the President's very capacity to speak for the Nation with one
voice in dealing with other governments to resolve claims arising out of
World War II. Although the HVIRA disclosure requirement's goal of
obtaining compensation for Holocaust victims is also espoused by the
National Government, the fact of a common end hardly neutralizes conflicting means. The express federal policy and the clear conflict raised
by the state statute are alone enough to require state law to yield.
Pp. 420-425.

(c) If any doubt about the clarity of the conflict remained, it would
have to be resolved in the National Government's favor, given the
weakness of the State's interest, when evaluated in terms of traditional
state legislative subject matter, in regulating disclosure of European
Holocaust-era insurance policies in the manner of HVIRA. Even if California's underlying concern for its several thousand Holocaust survivors
is recognized as a powerful one, the same objective dignifies the National Government's interest in devising its chosen mechanism for voluntary settlements, there being approximately 100,000 survivors in the
country, only a small fraction of them in California. As against the
federal responsibility, the humanity underlying the state statute could
not give the State the benefit of any doubt in resolving the conflict with
national policy. Pp. 425-427.

(d) California seeks to use an iron fist where the President has consistently chosen kid gloves. The efficacy of the one approach versus
the other is beside the point, since preemption turns not on the wisdom
of the National Government's policy but on the evidence of conflict.
Here, the evidence is more than sufficient to demonstrate that HVIRA
stands in the way of the President's diplomatic objectives. P. 427.

(e) The Court rejects the State's submission that even if HVIRA does
interfere with Executive Branch foreign policy, Congress authorized
state law of this sort in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the U. S. Holocaust Assets Commission Act of 1998. To begin with, the effect of any
congressional authorization on the preemption enquiry is far from clear,
but in any event neither statute does the job the State ascribes to it.
McCarran-Ferguson's purpose was to limit congressional preemption of

state insurance laws under the commerce power, whether dormant or
exercised, see, e. g., Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U. S. 491, 499-
500, and it cannot plausibly be read to address preemption by executive
conduct in foreign affairs. Nor is HVIRA authorized by the Holocaust
Commission Act, which set up a Presidential Commission to study
Holocaust-era assets that came into the Government's control, $ 3(a)(1),
and directed the Commission to encourage state insurance commissioners to prepare a report on the Holocaust-related claims practices of all
insurance companies doing business in this country after January 30,
1933, $ 3(a)(4)(A). The Commission's focus was limited to assets held
by the Government, and the Act's reference to the state insurance commissioners' report was expressly limited "to the degree the information
is available," $ 3(a)(4)(B), which can hardly be read to condone state
sanctions interfering with federal efforts to resolve claims. Finally,
Congress has done nothing to express disapproval of the President's
policy. Given the President's considerable independent authority in
this area, Congress's silence cannot be equated with disapproval.

Opinion of the Court
ing the value of insurance policies, and in particular policiesof life insurance, a form of savings held by many Jews in

Europe before the Second World War. Early on in the Naziera, loss of livelihood forced Jews to cash in life insurance
policies prematurely, only to have the government seize theproceeds of the repurchase, and many who tried to emigrate
from Germany were forced to liquidate insurance policies topay the steep "flight taxes" and other levies imposed by the
Third Reich to keep Jewish assets from leaving the country.See G. Feldman, Allianz and the German Insurance Business,
1933-1945, pp. 249-262 (2001). Before long, the Reich begansimply seizing the remaining policies outright.

1 In 1941, the

11th Decree of the Reich Citizenship Law declared the con-fiscation of assets (including insurance policies) of Jews deported to the concentration camps, and two years later the13th Decree did the same with respect to property of the
dead, each decree requiring banks and insurance companiesto identify Jewish accounts and transmit the funds to the
Reich treasury. Id., at 264-274. After the war, even a pol-icy that had escaped confiscation was likely to be dishonored,
whether because insurers denied its existence or claimed ithad lapsed from unpaid premiums during the persecution, or
because the government would not provide heirs with docu-mentation of the policyholder's death. See M. Bazyler, Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America'sCourts 117-122 (2003). Responsibility as between the government and insurance companies is disputed, but at the end

1 A vivid precursor of the kind of direct confiscation that would become
widespread by 1941 was the Reich's seizure of property and casualty insurance proceeds in the aftermath of the November 1938 Kristallnacht, in
which Nazi looting and vandalism inflicted damage to Jewish businesses,
homes, and synagogues worth nearly 50 million deutsch marks. Days afterward, a Reich decree mandated that all proceeds of all insurance claims
arising from the damage be paid directly to the state treasury, an obligation ultimately settled by German insurance companies with the Reich at
a mere pittance relative to full value. See Feldman, Allianz and the German Insurance Business, at 190-235.

Opinion of the Court
of the day, the fact is that the value or proceeds of manyinsurance policies issued to Jews before and during the war

were paid to the Reich or never paid at all.These confiscations and frustrations of claims fell within
the subject of reparations, which became a principal objectof Allied diplomacy soon after the war. At the Potsdam
Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union
took reparations for wartime losses by seizing industrialassets from their respective occupation zones, putting into

effect the plan originally envisioned at the Yalta Conferencemonths before. Protocol of Proceedings of the Berlin (Potsdam) Conference, 1945, in 3 Dept. of State, Treaties and
Other International Agreements of the United States of
America 1776-1949, pp. 1207, 1213-1214 (C. Bevans comp.
1969) (hereinafter Bevans); Report of the Crimea (Yalta)
Conference, 1945, in 3 Bevans 1005; Protocol of the Crimea
(Yalta) Conference on the Question of the German Reparation in Kind, 1945, in 3 Bevans 1020. A year later, the
United States was among the parties to an agreement to
share seized assets with other western allies as settlement,
as to each signatory nation, of "all its claims and those of
its nationals against the former German Government and its
Agencies, of a governmental or private nature, arising out of
the war." Agreement on Reparation from Germany, on the
Establishment of Inter-Allied Reparation Agency and Restitution of Monetary Gold, 61 Stat. 3163, Art. 2(A), T. I. A. S.
No. 1655 (hereinafter Paris Agreement).

The effect of the Paris Agreement was curtailed, however,
and attention to reparations intentionally deferred, when the
western Allies moved to end their occupation and reestablish
a sovereign Germany as a buffer against Soviet expansion.
They worried that continued reparations would cripple the
new Federal Republic of Germany economically, and so decided in the London Debt Agreement to put off "[c]onsideration of claims arising out of the second World War by countries which were at war with or were occupied by Germany

German Government and German industry, to await the

in American Courts, 80 Wash. U. L. Q. 795, 813-814, andn. 62 (2002).

In the meantime, the western Allies placed the obligation
to provide restitution to victims of Nazi persecution on the
new West German Government. See Convention on the
Settlement of Matters Arising Out of the War and the Occupation, May 26, 1952, 6 U. S. T. 4411, 4452-4484, as amended

issued several decrees for the return of property confiscated
by the Nazis. See N. Robinson, Restitution Legislation in
Germany: A Survey of Enactments (1949); U. S. Military
Law Nos. 52 and 59 (reprinted in U. S. Military Government
Gazette, Germany, Issue A, p. 24 (June 1, 1946) and Issue G,
p. 1 (Nov. 10, 1947)). West Germany enacted its own restitution laws in 1953 and 1956, see Institute of Jewish Affairs,
The (West German) Federal Compensation Law (BEG) and
its Implementary Regulations (1957), and signed agreements
with 16 countries for the compensation of their nationals,

Clinton and German Chancellor Schro" der in July 2000, in

that whenever a German company was sued on a Holocaustera claim in an American court, the Government of theUnited States would submit a statement that "it would be

in the foreign policy interests of the United States for theFoundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for the
resolution of all asserted claims against German companiesarising from their involvement in the National Socialist era
and World War II." 39 Int'l Legal Materials, at 1303.Though unwilling to guarantee that its foreign policy interests would "in themselves provide an independent legal basisfor dismissal," that being an issue for the courts, the Government agreed to tell courts "that U. S. policy interests favor
dismissal on any valid legal ground." Id., at 1304. On top
of that undertaking, the Government promised to use its
"best efforts, in a manner it considers appropriate," to get
state and local governments to respect the foundation as the
exclusive mechanism. Id., at 1300.2

As for insurance claims specifically, both countries agreed
that the German Foundation would work with the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims

Association of Insurance Commissioners, the organization ofAmerican state insurance commissioners. The job of the

ICHEIC, chaired by former Secretary of State Eagleburger,includes negotiation with European insurers to provide information about unpaid insurance policies issued to Holo-caust victims and settlement of claims brought under them.
It has thus set up procedures for handling demands against
participating insurers, including "a reasonable review . . . ofthe participating companies' files" for production of unpaid

policies, "an investigatory process to determine the currentstatus" of insurance policies for which claims are filed, and
a "claims and valuation process to settle and pay individual claims," employing "relaxed standards of proof." SER

In the pact with the United States, Germany stipulated

by the State of California, as necessary." $ 13801(f).

After HVIRA was enacted, administrative subpoenaswere issued against several subsidiaries of European insurance companies participating in the ICHEIC. See, e. g.,SER 785, 791. Immediately, in November 1999, Deputy
Secretary Eizenstat wrote to the insurance commissioner of
California that although HVIRA "reflects a genuine commitment to justice for Holocaust victims and their families,
it has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one effective
means now at hand to process quickly and completely unpaid
insurance claims from the Holocaust period, the [ICHEIC]."
Id., at 975. The Deputy Secretary said that "actions by California, pursuant to this law, have already threatened to damage the cooperative spirit which the [ICHEIC] requires to
resolve the important issue for Holocaust survivors," and he
also noted that ICHEIC Chairman Eagleburger had expressed his opposition to "sanctions and other pressures
brought by California on companies with whom he is obtaining real cooperation." Id., at 976. The same day, Deputy
Secretary Eizenstat also wrote to California's Governor
making the same points, and stressing that HVIRA would
possibly derail the German Foundation Agreement: "Clearly,
for this deal to work . . . German industry and the German
government need to be assured that they will get `legal
peace,' not just from class-action lawsuits, but from the kind
of legislation represented by the California Victim Insurance
Relief Act." Id., at 970. These expressions of the National
Government's concern proved to be of no consequence, for
the state commissioner announced at an investigatory hearing in December 1999 that he would enforce HVIRA to its

ER 1097. II

After this ultimatum, the petitioners here, several Ameri-can and European insurance companies and the American
Insurance Association (a national trade association), filed suitfor injunctive relief against respondent insurance commissioner of California, challenging the constitutionality ofHVIRA. The District Court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcing the Act, reflecting its probability judg-ment that "HVIRA is unconstitutional based on a violation of the federal foreign affairs power and a violation ofthe Commerce Clause." App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a. On
appeal, the Ninth Circuit rejected these grounds for ques-tioning the Act but left the preliminary injunction in place
until the District Court could consider whether petitionerswere likely to succeed on their due process claim.

GerlingGlobal Reinsurance Corp. of America v. Low, 240 F. 3d 739,

754 (2001).On remand, the District Court addressed two points. Although it held the Act to be within the State's "legislativejurisdiction," as it applied only to insurers licensed to do
business in the State, the District Court granted summaryjudgment to the petitioners on the ground of a procedural
due process violation in "mandating license suspension fornon-performance of what may be impossible tasks without
allowing for a meaningful hearing." Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of America v. Low, 186 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1108,1113 (ED Cal. 2001). In a second appeal, the same panel of

the Ninth Circuit reversed again. While it agreed that theAct was not beyond the State's legislative authority, the
Court of Appeals rejected the conclusion that procedural dueprocess required an opportunity for insurers to raise an impossibility excuse for noncompliance with the law, 296 F. 3d832, 845-848 (2002), and it reaffirmed its prior ruling that

The principal argument for preemption made by petition-ers and the United States as

amicus curiae is that HVIRAinterferes with foreign policy of the Executive Branch, as

expressed principally in the executive agreements with Ger-many, Austria, and France. The major premises of the argument, at least, are beyond dispute. There is, of course, noquestion that at some point an exercise of state power that
touches on foreign relations must yield to the National Gov-ernment's policy, given the "concern for uniformity in this
country's dealings with foreign nations" that animated theConstitution's allocation of the foreign relations power to the
National Government in the first place. Banco Nacional
de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 427, n. 25 (1964); seeCrosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363,

7 Two petitions for certiorari were filed, one by the petitioners in this

case (No. 02-722), and one, raising additional issues, by the Gerling Companies (No. 02-733), which were also appellees below. Our grant of certiorari in No. 02-722 encompassed three of the questions addressed by the
Ninth Circuit: whether HVIRA intrudes on the federal foreign affairs
power, violates the self-executing element of the Foreign Commerce
Clause, or exceeds the State's "legislative jurisdiction." Pet. for Cert.
I. Because we hold that HVIRA is preempted under the foreign affairs
doctrine, we have no reason to address the other questions.

Nor is there any question generally that there is executive
authority to decide what that policy should be. Although
the source of the President's power to act in foreign affairs
does not enjoy any textual detail, the historical gloss on the
"executive Power" vested in Article II of the Constitution
has recognized the President's "vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations." Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 610-611 (1952)
(Frankfurter, J., concurring). While Congress holds express
authority to regulate public and private dealings with other
nations in its war and foreign commerce powers, in foreign
affairs the President has a degree of independent authority
to act. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948) ("The President

At a more specific level, our cases have recognized that the
President has authority to make "executive agreements"with other countries, requiring no ratification by the Senate

or approval by Congress, this power having been exercisedsince the early years of the Republic. See

n. 163 (2d ed. 1996) ("Presidents from Washington to Clinton
have made many thousands of agreements . . . on matters
running the gamut of U. S. foreign relations"). Making executive agreements to settle claims of American nationals
against foreign governments is a particularly longstanding
practice, the first example being as early as 1799, when the
Adams administration settled demands against the Dutch
Government by American citizens who lost their cargo when
Dutch privateers overtook the schooner Wilmington Packet.
See Dames & Moore, supra, at 679-680, and n. 8; 5 Dept. of
State, Treaties and Other International Acts of the United
States 1075, 1078-1079 (H. Miller ed. 1937). Given the fact
that the practice goes back over 200 years, and has received
congressional acquiescence throughout its history, the conclusion "[t]hat the President's control of foreign relations
includes the settlement of claims is indisputable." Pink,

223-225 (opinion of the Court); Belmont, supra, at 330-331;

The executive agreements at issue here do differ in one
respect from those just mentioned insofar as they address

Opinion of the Court
claims associated with formerly belligerent states, butagainst corporations, not the foreign governments. But the

distinction does not matter. Historically, wartime claimsagainst even nominally private entities have become issues
in international diplomacy, and three of the postwar settle-ments dealing with reparations implicating private parties
were made by the Executive alone.8 Acceptance of this his-torical practice is supported by a good pragmatic reason for
depending on executive agreements to settle claims againstforeign corporations associated with wartime experience.
As shown by the history of insurance confiscation mentionedearlier, untangling government policy from private initiative
during wartime is often so hard that diplomatic action set-tling claims against private parties may well be just as essential in the aftermath of hostilities as diplomacy to settleclaims against foreign governments. While a sharp line between public and private acts works for many purposes inthe domestic law, insisting on the same line in defining the
legitimate scope of the Executive's international negotiationswould hamstring the President in settling international controversies. Cf. Pink, supra, at 234-242 (Frankfurter, J.,concurring) (noting the unsoundness of transplanting "judicial subtleties" of domestic law into "the solution of analo-gous problems between friendly nations").

Generally, then, valid executive agreements are fit to pre-empt state law, just as treaties are,

Opinion of the Court
here had expressly preempted laws like HVIRA, the issuewould be straightforward. See Belmont, supra, at 327, 331;

Pink, supra, at 223, 230-231. But petitioners and theUnited States as amicus curiae both have to acknowledge
that the agreements include no preemption clause, and soleave their claim of preemption to rest on asserted interference with the foreign policy those agreements embody. Re-liance is placed on our decision in

Zschernig v. Miller, 389U. S. 429 (1968).

Zschernig dealt with an Oregon probate statute prohibit-ing inheritance by a nonresident alien, absent showings that
the foreign heir would take the property "without confisca-tion" by his home country and that American citizens would
enjoy reciprocal rights of inheritance there. Id., at 430-431.Two decades earlier, Clark v. Allen, 331 U. S. 503 (1947), had
held that a similar California reciprocity law "did not on itsface intrude on the federal domain," Zschernig, supra, at
432, but by the time Zschernig (an East German resident)brought his challenge, it was clear that the Oregon law

in practice had invited "minute inquiries concerning theactual administration of foreign law," 389 U. S., at 435, and
so was providing occasions for state judges to disparage cer-tain foreign regimes, employing the language of the antiCommunism prevalent here at the height of the Cold War,see

id., at 440 (the Oregon law had made "unavoidable judi-cial criticism of nations established on a more authoritarian basis than our own"). Although the Solicitor General,speaking for the State Department, denied that the state
statute "unduly interfere[d] with the United States' conductof foreign relations," id., at 434 (internal quotation marks
omitted), the Court was not deterred from exercising its ownjudgment to invalidate the law as an "intrusion by the State
into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution en-trusts to the President and the Congress,"

id., at 432.

"like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination
to the applicable provisions of the Constitution." Id., at 320.

539US2 Unit: $U78 [07-05-05 18:52:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
418 AMERICAN INS. ASSN. v. GARAMENDI

Opinion of the Court
The Zschernig majority relied on statements in a numberof previous cases open to the reading that state action with

more than incidental effect on foreign affairs is preempted,even absent any affirmative federal activity in the subject
area of the state law, and hence without any showing of con-flict. The Court cited the pronouncement in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 63 (1941), that "[o]ur system of govern-ment is such that the interest of the cities, counties and
states, no less than the interest of the people of the wholenation, imperatively requires that federal power in the field
affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from localinterference." See 389 U. S., at 432;

id., at 442-443 (Stew-art, J., concurring) (setting out the foregoing quotation).

Likewise, Justice Stewart's concurring opinion viewed theOregon statute as intruding "into a domain of exclusively
federal competence." Id., at 442; see also Belmont, 301U. S., at 331 ("[C]omplete power over international affairs is
in the national government and is not and cannot be subjectto any curtailment or interference on the part of the several
states" (citing Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at316

et seq.)).Justice Harlan, joined substantially by Justice White, disagreed with the Zschernig majority on this point, arguingthat its implication of preemption of the entire field of foreign affairs was at odds with some other cases suggestingthat in the absence of positive federal action "the States may
legislate in areas of their traditional competence even thoughtheir statutes may have an incidental effect on foreign relations." 389 U. S., at 459 (opinion concurring in result) (citingcases); see id., at 462 (White, J., dissenting).

389 U. S., at 457. This required overruling the Court's construction of
that treaty in Clark v. Allen, 331 U. S. 503 (1947), which Justice White, in
dissent, declined to do, 389 U. S., at 462.

Opinion of the Court
statute presented no evidence of a "specific interest of theFederal Government which might be interfered with" by the

law. Id., at 459 (opinion concurring in result); see id., at 461(finding "no evidence of adverse effect in the record"). He
would, however, have found preemption in a case of "con-flicting federal policy," see

id., at 458-459, and on this point
the majority and Justices Harlan and White basically agreed:
state laws "must give way if they impair the effective exer-cise of the Nation's foreign policy,"

id., at 440 (opinion of the
Court). See also Pink, 315 U. S., at 230-231 ("[S]tate lawmust yield when it is inconsistent with, or impairs . . . the

superior Federal policy evidenced by a treaty or interna-tional compact or agreement");

id., at 240 (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring) (state law may not be allowed to "interfer[e]with the conduct of our foreign relations by the Executive").

It is a fair question whether respect for the executive for-eign relations power requires a categorical choice between
the contrasting theories of field and conflict preemption evident in the Zschernig opinions,11 but the question requires

11 The two positions can be seen as complementary. If a State were
simply to take a position on a matter of foreign policy with no serious
claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility, field preemption
might be the appropriate doctrine, whether the National Government had
acted and, if it had, without reference to the degree of any conflict, the
principle having been established that the Constitution entrusts foreign
policy exclusively to the National Government. See, e. g., Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 63 (1941). Where, however, a State has acted within
what Justice Harlan called its "traditional competence," 389 U. S., at 459,
but in a way that affects foreign relations, it might make good sense to
require a conflict, of a clarity or substantiality that would vary with the
strength or the traditional importance of the state concern asserted.
Whether the strength of the federal foreign policy interest should itself
be weighed is, of course, a further question. Cf. Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947) (congressional occupation of the field is
not to be presumed "in a field which the States have traditionally occupied"); Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500, 507-508 (1988)
("In an area of uniquely federal interest," "[t]he conflict with federal policy
need not be as sharp as that which must exist for ordinary pre-emption").

420 AMERICAN INS. ASSN. v. GARAMENDI

Opinion of the Court
no answer here. For even on Justice Harlan's view, the like-lihood that state legislation will produce something more

than incidental effect in conflict with express foreign policyof the National Government would require preemption of the
state law. And since on his view it is legislation within"areas of . . . traditional competence" that gives a State any
claim to prevail, 389 U. S., at 459, it would be reasonableto consider the strength of the state interest, judged by
standards of traditional practice, when deciding how seriousa conflict must be shown before declaring the state law preempted. Cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 768-769 (1945) (under negative CommerceClause, "reconciliation of the conflicting claims of state and

national power is to be attained only by some appraisal andaccommodation of the competing demands of the state and
national interests involved"); Henkin, Foreign Affairs andthe United States Constitution, at 164 (suggesting a test that
"balance[s] the state's interest in a regulation against theimpact on U. S. foreign relations"); Maier, Preemption of
State Law: A Recommended Analysis, 83 Am. J. Int'l L. 832,834 (1989) (similar). Judged by these standards, we think
petitioners and the Government have demonstrated a suffi-ciently clear conflict to require finding preemption here.

IV

A

To begin with, resolving Holocaust-era insurance claimsthat may be held by residents of this country is a matter

well within the Executive's responsibility for foreign affairs.Since claims remaining in the aftermath of hostilities may be
"sources of friction" acting as an "impediment to resumptionof friendly relations" between the countries involved, Pink,
supra, at 225, there is a "longstanding practice" of thenational Executive to settle them in discharging its responsibility to maintain the Nation's relationships with othercountries,

Opinion of the Court
restitution for Nazi crimes has in fact been addressed in Ex-ecutive Branch diplomacy and formalized in treaties and executive agreements over the last half century, and althoughresolution of private claims was postponed by the Cold War,
securing private interests is an express object of diplomacytoday, just as it was addressed in agreements soon after the
Second World War. Vindicating victims injured by acts and
omissions of enemy corporations in wartime is thus withinthe traditional subject matter of foreign policy in which national, not state, interests are overriding, and which the Na-tional Government has addressed.

The exercise of the federal executive authority means that
state law must give way where, as here, there is evidence of
clear conflict between the policies adopted by the two. The
foregoing account of negotiations toward the three settlement agreements is enough to illustrate that the consistent
Presidential foreign policy has been to encourage European
governments and companies to volunteer settlement funds in
preference to litigation or coercive sanctions. See also, e. g.,
Hearings on H. R. 2693 before the Subcommittee of Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations of the House Committee on Government
Reform, 107th Cong., 2d Sess., 24 (2002) (statement of Ambassador Randolph M. Bell that it is the "policy of the U. S.
Government" "to resolve matters of Holocaust-era restitution and compensation through dialogue, negotiation, and cooperation"); Hearings on the Status of Insurance Restitution
for Holocaust Victims and the Heirs before the House Committee on Government Reform, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., 77
(2001) (statement of Ambassador J. D. Bindenagel to the
same effect). As for insurance claims in particular, the
national position, expressed unmistakably in the executive
agreements signed by the President with Germany and Austria, has been to encourage European insurers to work with
the ICHEIC to develop acceptable claim procedures, including procedures governing disclosure of policy information.

California has taken a different tack of providing regulatory sanctions to compel disclosure and payment, supplemented by a new cause of action for Holocaust survivors if
the other sanctions should fail. The situation created by the

(2000). HVIRA's economic compulsion to make public disclosure, of far more information about far more policies than
ICHEIC rules require, employs "a different, state system of
economic pressure," and in doing so undercuts the Presi13 The dissent would discount the executive agreements as evidence of
the Government's foreign policy governing disclosure, saying they "do not
refer to state disclosure laws specifically, or even to information disclosure
generally." Post, at 441 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). But this assertion
gives short shrift to the agreements' express endorsement of the
ICHEIC's voluntary mechanism, which encompasses production of policy
information, not just actual payment of unpaid claims. See supra, at 406-
407. The dissent would also dismiss the other Executive Branch expressions of the Government's policy, see supra, at 411, 422, insisting on nothing short of a formal statement by the President himself, see post, at
441-443. But there is no suggestion that these high-level executive officials were not faithfully representing the President's chosen policy, and
there is no apparent reason for adopting the dissent's "nondelegation" rule
to apply within the Executive Branch.

dent's diplomatic discretion and the choice he has made exercising it. Id., at 376. Whereas the President's authority to
provide for settling claims in winding up international hostilities requires flexibility in wielding "the coercive power of
the national economy" as a tool of diplomacy, id., at 377,
HVIRA denies this, by making exclusion from a large sector
of the American insurance market the automatic sanction for
noncompliance with the State's own policies on disclosure.
"Quite simply, if the [California] law is enforceable the President has less to offer and less economic and diplomatic leverage as a consequence." Ibid. (citing Dames & Moore, 453
U. S., at 673). The law thus "compromise[s] the very capacity of the President to speak for the Nation with one voice
in dealing with other governments" to resolve claims against
European companies arising out of World War II. 530 U. S.,
at 381.14

Crosby's facts are replicated again in the way HVIRA
threatens to frustrate the operation of the particular mechanism the President has chosen. The letters from Deputy
Secretary Eizenstat to California officials show well enough
how the portent of further litigation and sanctions has in
fact placed the Government at a disadvantage in obtaining
practical results from persuading "foreign governments and
foreign companies to participate voluntarily in organizations
such as ICHEIC." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15; see also SER 1267, 1272 (Joint Statement with Switzerland noting the "potentially disruptive and counterproductive effects" of laws like HVIRA and promising effort by

14 It is true that the President in this case is acting without express
congressional authority, and thus does not have the "plenitude of Executive authority" that "controll[ed] the issue of preemption" in Crosby v.
National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 376 (2000). But in Crosby
we were careful to note that the President possesses considerable independent constitutional authority to act on behalf of the United States on
international issues, id., at 381, and conflict with the exercise of that authority is a comparably good reason to find preemption of state law.

Opinion of the Court
the United States to call on state legislatures "to refrainfrom taking unwarranted investigative initiatives or from

threatening or actually using sanctions against Swiss insur-ers"). In addition to thwarting the Government's policy of
repose for companies that pay through the ICHEIC, Califor-nia's indiscriminate disclosure provisions place a handicap on
the ICHEIC's effectiveness (and raise a further irritant tothe European allies) by undercutting European privacy protections. See ER 1182, 3131 (opinions of the German Gov-ernment that public disclosure of all European insurance policies "is not permissible" under German privacy law); Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 18 (noting protests fromthe German and Swiss Governments). It is true, of course,

as it is probably true of all elements of HVIRA, that thedisclosure requirement's object of obtaining compensation
for Holocaust victims is a goal espoused by the National Gov-ernment as well. But "[t]he fact of a common end hardly
neutralizes conflicting means," Crosby, supra, at 379, andhere HVIRA is an obstacle to the success of the National
Government's chosen "calibration of force" in dealing withthe Europeans using a voluntary approach, 530 U. S., at 380.

B
The express federal policy and the clear conflict raised bythe state statute are alone enough to require state law to

yield. If any doubt about the clarity of the conflict re-mained, however, it would have to be resolved in the National Government's favor, given the weakness of the State'sinterest, against the backdrop of traditional state legislative subject matter, in regulating disclosure of EuropeanHolocaust-era insurance policies in the manner of HVIRA.

The commissioner would justify HVIRA's ambitious dis-closure requirement as protecting "legitimate consumer protection interests" in knowing which insurers have failed topay insurance claims. Brief for Respondent 1, 42-44. But,
quite unlike a generally applicable "blue sky" law, HVIRA

Opinion of the Court
effectively singles out only policies issued by European companies, in Europe, to European residents, at least 55 years
ago. Cal. Ins. Code Ann. $ 13804(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2003);
see also $ 790.15(a) (mandating license suspension only for
"fail[ure] to pay any valid claim from Holocaust survivors").
Limiting the public disclosure requirement to these policies
raises great doubt that the purpose of the California law is
an evaluation of corporate reliability in contemporary insuring in the State.

Indeed, there is no serious doubt that the state interest
actually underlying HVIRA is concern for the several thousand Holocaust survivors said to be living in the State.

$ 13801(d) (legislative finding that roughly 5,600 documented
Holocaust survivors reside in California). But this fact does
not displace general standards for evaluating a State's claim
to apply its forum law to a particular controversy or transaction, under which the State's claim is not a strong one.
"Even if a plaintiff evidences his desire for forum law by
moving to the forum, we have generally accorded such a
move little or no significance." Phillips Petroleum Co. v.
Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 820 (1985); see Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Hague, 449 U. S. 302, 311 (1981) ("[A] postoccurrence change
of residence to the forum State--standing alone--[i]s insufficient to justify application of forum law").

But should the general standard not be displaced, and the
State's interest recognized as a powerful one, by virtue of
the fact that California seeks to vindicate the claims of Holocaust survivors? The answer lies in recalling that the very
same objective dignifies the interest of the National Government in devising its chosen mechanism for voluntary settlements, there being about 100,000 survivors in the country,
only a small fraction of them in California. ER 870 (press
release of insurance commissioner of California); Bazyler, 34

Opinion of the Court
state statute could not give the State the benefit of anydoubt in resolving the conflict with national policy.

C
The basic fact is that California seeks to use an iron fistwhere the President has consistently chosen kid gloves. We

have heard powerful arguments that the iron fist would workbetter, and it may be that if the matter of compensation were
considered in isolation from all other issues involving the Eu-ropean Allies, the iron fist would be the preferable policy.
But our thoughts on the efficacy of the one approach versusthe other are beside the point, since our business is not to
judge the wisdom of the National Government's policy; dis-satisfaction should be addressed to the President or, perhaps,
Congress. The question relevant to preemption in this caseis conflict, and the evidence here is "more than sufficient
to demonstrate that the state Act stands in the way of [thePresident's] diplomatic objectives."

Crosby, supra, at 386.

V
The State's remaining submission is that even if HVIRAdoes interfere with Executive Branch foreign policy, Congress authorized state law of this sort in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, ch. 20, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1011-1015,
and the more recent U. S. Holocaust Assets Commission Actof 1998 (Holocaust Commission Act), 112 Stat. 611, note following 22 U. S. C. $ 1621. There is, however, no need to con-sider the possible significance for preemption doctrine of tension between an Act of Congress and Presidential foreignpolicy, cf. generally Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S., at 637-638 (Jackson, J., concurring in judgment andopinion of Court), for neither statute does the job the commissioner ascribes to it.The provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act said to be
relevant here specify that "[t]he business of insurance" shallbe recognized as a subject of state regulation, 15 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

$ 1012(a), which will be good against preemption by federal
legislation unless that legislation "specifically relates to the
business of insurance," $ 1012(b); see also $ 1011 (policy behind $ 1012 is that "continued regulation and taxation by the
several States of the business of insurance is in the public
interest" and "silence on the part of the Congress shall not
be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States"). As the text
itself makes clear, the point of McCarran-Ferguson's legislative choice of leaving insurance regulation generally to
the States was to limit congressional preemption under the
commerce power, whether dormant or exercised. Compare
Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 429-430
(1946), with United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters
Assn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944); see Department of Treasury v.
Fabe, 508 U. S. 491, 499-500 (1993). Quite apart, then, from
any doubt whether HVIRA would qualify as regulating
"the business of insurance" given its tangential relation to
present-day insuring in the State, see FTC v. Travelers
Health Assn., 362 U. S. 293, 300-301 (1960) (McCarranFerguson was not intended to allow a State to "regulate activities carried on beyond its own borders"), a federal statute
directed to implied preemption by domestic commerce legislation cannot sensibly be construed to address preemption
by executive conduct in foreign affairs.

Nor does the Holocaust Commissi on Act authorize
HVIRA. That Act set up a Presidential Commission to
"study and develop a historical record of the collection and
disposition" of Holocaust-era assets that "came into the possession or control of the Federal Government." Pub. L.
105-186, $ 3(a)(1), 112 Stat. 612. For this purpose, Congress directed the Commission to "encourage the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners to prepare a report
on the Holocaust-related claims practices of all insurance
companies, both domestic and foreign, doing business in the

any individual life, health, or property-casualty insurance
policy to any individual on any list of Holocaust victims."

$ 3(a)(4)(A), 112 Stat. 613. These provisions are no help to
HVIRA. The Commission's focus was limited to assets in
the possession of the Government, and if anything, the federal Act assumed it was the National Government's responsibility to deal with returning those assets. See $ 3(d), 112
Stat. 614 (President to collect recommendations from the
commission and submit a suggested plan for "legislative, administrative, or other action" to Congress). In any event,
the federal Act's reference to the state insurance commissioners as compiling information was expressly limited
"to the degree the information is available," $ 3(a)(4)(B),
112 Stat. 613, a proviso that can hardly be read to condone
state sanctions interfering with federal efforts to resolve
such claims.

Indeed, it is worth noting that Congress has done nothing
to express disapproval of the President's policy. Legislation
along the lines of HVIRA has been introduced in Congress
repeatedly, but none of the bills has come close to making it
into law. See H. R. 1210, 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003);
S. 972, 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003); H. R. 2693, 107th Cong.,
1st Sess. (2001); H. R. 126, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999).

In sum, Congress has not acted on the matter addressed
here. Given the President's independent authority "in the
areas of foreign policy and national security, . . . congressional silence is not to be equated with congressional disapproval." Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 291 (1981).

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Responding to Holocaust victims' and their descendents'long-frustrated efforts to collect unpaid insurance proceeds,

California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act of 1999(HVIRA), Cal. Ins. Code Ann. $ 13800 et seq. (West Cum.
Supp. 2003), requires insurance companies operating in theState to disclose certain information about insurance policies
they or their affiliates wrote in Europe between 1920 and1945. In recent years, the Executive Branch of the Federal
Government has become more visible in this area, undertak-ing foreign policy initiatives aimed at resolving Holocaustera insurance claims. Although the federal approach differsfrom California's, no executive agreement or other formal
expression of foreign policy disapproves state disclosure lawslike the HVIRA. Absent a clear statement aimed at disclosure requirements by the "one voice" to which courts prop-erly defer in matters of foreign affairs, I would leave intact
California's enactment. I

As the Court observes, ante, at 401-402, and n. 1, the Naziregimentation of inhumanity we characterize as the Holocaust, marked most horrifically by genocide and enslave-ment, also entailed widespread destruction, confiscation, and
theft of property belonging to Jews. For insurance policiesissued in Germany and other countries under Nazi control,
historical evidence bears out, the combined forces of the Ger-man Government and the insurance industry engaged in larcenous takings of gigantic proportions. For example, in-surance policies covered many of the Jewish homes and
businesses destroyed in the state-sponsored pogrom knownas Kristallnacht. By order of the Nazi regime, claims arising out of the officially enabled destruction were made pay-able not to the insured parties, but to the State. M. Bazyler,

concocted by insurers and ministerial officials," insurers sat-isfied property loss claims by paying the State only a fraction

of their full value. G. Feldman, Allianz and the GermanInsurance Business, 1933-1945, p. 227 (2001); see Bazyler,
supra, at 114; App. 27-28 (declaration of Rabbi AbrahamCooper, Assoc. Dean, Simon Wiesenthal Center) ("There is
documentary evidence that the insurance companies paid
only one-half of the Jewish insurance proceeds to the Reichand kept the other half for themselves.").

The Court depicts Allied diplomacy after World War II asaimed in part at settling confiscated and unpaid insurance
claims. Ante, at 403. But the multilateral negotiations
that produced the Potsdam, Yalta, and like accords failed to
achieve any global resolution of such claims. European insurers, encountering no official compulsion, were themselves
scarcely inclined to settle claims; turning claimants away,
they relied on the absence of formal documentation and other
technical infirmities that legions of Holocaust survivors were
in no position to remedy. See, e. g., Hearings on H. R. 2693
before the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations of the
House Committee on Government Reform, 107th Cong., 2d
Sess., 14-15 (2002) (statement of Rep. Waxman) ("Some
survivors were rejected because they could not produce
death certificates for loved ones who perished in Nazi concentration camps. Other insurance companies took advantage of the fact that claimants had no policy documents to
prove their policy existed."). For over five decades, untold
Holocaust-era insurance claims went unpaid. Id., at 38
(statement of Leslie Tick, California Dept. of Insurance).

In the late 1990's, litigation in American courts provided a
spur to action. See Bazyler, supra, at xi; Feldman, supra,
at vii; Neuborne, Preliminary Reflections on Aspects of
Holocaust-Era Litigation in American Courts, 80 Wash.
U. L. Q. 795, 796 (2002). Holocaust survivors and their descendents initiated class-action suits against German and

other European firms seeking compensation for, inter alia,the confiscation of Jewish bank assets, the use of Jewish

slave labor, and the failure to pay Jewish insurance claims.See generally Bazyler,

supra, at 1-171.
In the insurance industry, the litigation propelled a num-ber of European companies to agree on a framework for

resolving unpaid claims outside the courts. This concord
prompted the 1998 creation of the International Commissionon Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC). A voluntary

claims settlement organization, ICHEIC comprises severalEuropean insurers, Jewish and Holocaust survivor organizations, the State of Israel, and this country's National Association of Insurance Commissioners. See S. Eizenstat, Imperfect Justice 266 (2003); Bazyler, supra, at 132.

As the Court observes, ante, at 407, ICHEIC has formulated procedures for the filing, investigation, valuation, and
resolution of Holocaust-era insurance claims. At least until
very recently, however, ICHEIC's progress has been slow
and insecure. See In re Assicurazioni Generali S. p. A. Holocaust Ins. Litig., 228 F. Supp. 2d 348, 358 (SDNY 2002)
(quoting a 2001 press account describing ICHEIC as having
"repeatedly been at the point of collapse since its inception
in 1998"). Initially, ICHEIC's insurance company members
represented little more than one-third of the Holocaust-era
insurance market. See App. 32 (declaration of Leslie Tick,
California Dept. of Insurance) ("The five insurance company
members of the ICHEIC represent approximately 35.5% of
the pre-World War II European insurance market."); Eizenstat, supra, at 268 (despite repeated assurances that all German insurance companies would join ICHEIC, "[t]hey never
have to this day"). Petitioners note that participation in
ICHEIC has expanded in the past year, see Reply Brief 8-9,
but it remains unclear whether ICHEIC does now or will
ever encompass all relevant insurers.

Moreover, ICHEIC has thus far settled only a tiny proportion of the claims it has received. See Eizenstat, supra, at

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
267 ("ICHEIC's administrative failings led to few claims paidand large costs."). Evidence submitted in a series of class

actions filed against Italian insurer Generali indicated thatby November 2001, ICHEIC had resolved only 797 of 77,000
claims. See In re Assicurazioni Generali, 228 F. Supp. 2d,at 357. The latest reports show only modest increases.
See Treaster, Holocaust List Is Unsealed by Insurers, N. Y.Times, Apr. 29, 2003, section A, p. 26, col. 6 ("In more than
four years of operation [ICHEIC] has offered $38.2 million--or just short of the $40 million it had spent on expenses as
of 18 months ago--to 3,006 claimants.").Finally, although ICHEIC has directed its members to
publish lists of unpaid Holocaust-era policies, that non-binding directive had not yielded significant compliance at
the time this case reached the Court. See Brief for Re-spondent 10; Bazyler, Holocaust Justice, at 132 ("Using the
ICHEIC process, the European insurers have been able to. . . avoid revealing the names of possible claim holders.").
Shortly after oral argument, ICHEIC-participating Germaninsurers made more substantial disclosures. See N. Y.
Times, supra, at 26 (list of 363,232 names published in April2003). But other insurers have been less forthcoming. For
a prime example, Generali--which may have sold more lifeinsurance and annuity policies in Eastern Europe during the
Holocaust than any other company, see Bazyler, supra, at113--reportedly maintains a 340,000-name list of persons to
whom it sold insurance between 1918 and 1945, but has re-fused to disclose the bulk of the information on the list. See
App. 37-38 (declaration of Leslie Tick, California Dept. ofInsurance); Brief for Respondent 5.

California's disclosure law, the HVIRA, was enacted ayear after ICHEIC's formation. Observing that at least

5,600 documented Holocaust survivors reside in California,

Cal. Ins. Code Ann. $ 13801(d) (West Cum. Supp. 2003), theHVIRA declares that "[i]nsurance companies doing business

in the State of California have a responsibility to ensure thatany involvement they or their related companies may have
had with insurance policies of Holocaust victims [is] disclosedto the state," $ 13801(e). The HVIRA accordingly requires
insurance companies doing business in California to discloseinformation concerning insurance policies they or their affiliates sold in Europe between 1920 and 1945, $ 13804(a), anddirects California's Insurance Commissioner to store the information in a publicly accessible "Holocaust Era InsuranceRegistry," $ 13803. The Commissioner is further directed to
suspend the license of any insurer that fails to comply withthe HVIRA's reporting requirements. $ 13806.

These measures, the HVIRA declares, are "necessary to
protect the claims and interests of California residents, aswell as to encourage the development of a resolution to these

issues through the international process or through directaction by the State of California, as necessary." $ 13801(f ).
Information published in the HVIRA's registry could, for example, reveal to a Holocaust survivor residing in Californiathe existence of a viable claim, which she could then present

to ICHEIC for resolution.1The Court refers,

ante, at 408-409, 426, to a number of
other California statutory provisions enabling the litigation

that the HVIRA covers only certain policies issued in Europe more than
50 years ago. Ante, at 425-426. But States have broad authority to regulate the insurance industry, Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State
Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 451 U. S. 648, 653-655 (1981), and a State does
not exceed that authority by assigning special significance to an insurer's
treatment of claims arising out of an era in which government and industry collaborated to rob countless Holocaust victims of their property.

of Holocaust-era insurance claims in California courts.Those provisions, it bears emphasis, are not at issue here.

The HVIRA imposes no duty to pay any claim, nor does itauthorize litigation on any claim. It mandates only information disclosure, and our assessment of the HVIRA is prop-erly confined to that requirement alone.

B
The Federal Government, after prolonged inaction, has re-sponded to the Holocaust-era insurance issue by diplomatic

means. Executive agreements with Germany, Austria, andFrance, the Court observes, are the principal expressions of
the federal approach. Ante, at 413. Signed in July 2000,the German Foundation Agreement establishes a voluntary
foundation, funded by public and private sources, to addressHolocaust-era claims. Agreement Concerning the Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and the Future," 39 Int'lLegal Materials 1298 (2000).

2 "[I]t would be in the interests

of both parties," the agreement declares, "for the Foundationto be the exclusive remedy and forum for addressing . . . all

claims that have been or may be asserted against Germancompanies arising from the National Socialist era and World
War II." Id., at 1299. In the case of insurance, the agree-ment endorses ICHEIC as the appropriate forum for claims
resolution. Ibid.The German Foundation Agreement commits the Federal
Government to certain conduct. It provides, for example,that when a German company is sued in a United States
court on a Holocaust-era claim, the Federal Government willfile with the court a statement that "the President of the
United States has concluded that it would be in the foreignpolicy interests of the United States for the [German] Foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for the resolu-tion of all asserted claims against German companies arising

United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203 (1942), again addressed state-imposed obstacles to the Litvinov Assignment.
Reiterating its holding in Belmont, the Court confirmed that
no State may "deny enforcement of a claim under the Litvinov Assignment because of an overriding policy of the
State." 315 U. S., at 222. Pointing both to the assignment
itself and to a later exchange of diplomatic correspondence
clarifying its scope, see id., at 224-225, and n. 7, the Court
saw no "serious doubt that claims of the kind here in question were included" in the "broad and inclusive" assignment,
id., at 224.

Four decades later, in Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S.
654 (1981), the Court gave effect to an executive agreement
arising out of the Iran hostage crisis. One of the agreement's announced "purpose[s]" was "to terminate all litigation as between the Government of each party and the nationals of the other, and to bring about the settlement and
termination of all such claims through binding arbitration."
Id., at 665 (quoting the agreement). The agreement called
for the formation of an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal
to arbitrate claims not settled within six months. Ibid. In
addition, under the agreement the United States undertook

"to terminate all legal proceedings in United Statescourts involving claims of United States persons and institutions against Iran and its state enterprises, to nul-lify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, to
prohibit all further litigation based on such claims, andto bring about the termination of such claims through
binding arbitration." Ibid. (internal quotation marksomitted).

In line with these firm commitments, the Court held that theagreement and the executive order implementing it validly
"suspended" litigation in United States courts against Ira-nian interests. See

id., at 686-688.Notably, the Court in Dames & Moore was emphatic about

the "narrowness" of its decision. Id., at 688. "We do notdecide," the Court cautioned, "that the President possesses
plenary power to settle claims, even as against foreigngovernmental entities." Ibid. Before sustaining the President's action, the Court determined: (1) Congress "hadimplicitly approved" the practice of claim settlement by
executive agreement, id., at 680; (2) the alternative forumcreated under the executive agreement was "capable of providing meaningful relief," id., at 687; (3) Congress had not inany way disapproved or resisted the President's action, id.,
at 687-688; and (4) the settlement of claims was "a necessaryincident to the resolution of a major foreign policy dispute
between our country and another," id., at 688.Together,

Belmont, Pink, and Dames & Moore confirmthat executive agreements directed at claims settlement may

sometimes preempt state law. The Court states that if theexecutive "agreements here had expressly preempted laws
like HVIRA, the issue would be straightforward." Ante,at 416-417. One can safely demur to that statement, for, as
the Court acknowledges, no executive agreement before usexpressly preempts the HVIRA. Ante, at 417. Indeed, no
agreement so much as mentions the HVIRA's sole concern:public disclosure.

B
Despite the absence of express preemption, the Courtholds that the HVIRA interferes with foreign policy objectives implicit in the executive agreements. See ibid. Iwould not venture down that path.

The Court's analysis draws substantially on Zschernig v.
Miller, 389 U. S. 429 (1968). In that case, the Oregon courtshad applied an Oregon escheat statute to deny an inheritance

to a resident of a Communist bloc country. The Oregoncourts so ruled because the claimant failed to satisfy them
that his country's laws would allow U. S. nationals to inheritestates, nor had the claimant shown he would actually receive payments from the Oregon estate with no confiscationby his home government.

Id., at 432. Applying Oregon'sstatutory conditions, the Court concluded, required Oregon

courts to "launc[h] inquiries into the type of governmentsthat obtain in particular foreign nations," id., at 434, rendering "unavoidable judicial criticism of nations established ona more authoritarian basis than our own," id., at 440. Such
criticism had a "direct impact upon foreign relations," theCourt said, id., at 441, and threatened to "impair the effective exercise of the Nation's foreign policy," id., at 440. TheCourt therefore held the statute unconstitutional as applied
in that case. Id., at 433-434. But see id., at 432 ("We donot accept the invitation to re-examine our ruling in

Clarkv. Allen [331 U. S. 503 (1947)]," which held a substantively

similar California statute facially constitutional.).We have not relied on Zschernig since it was decided, and
I would not resurrect that decision here. The notion of"dormant foreign affairs preemption" with which Zschernig
is associated resonates most audibly when a state action "re-flect[s] a state policy critical of foreign governments and involve[s] `sitting in judgment' on them." L. Henkin, ForeignAffairs and the United States Constitution 164 (2d ed. 1996);

Counsel 49, 50 (1986) ("[W]e believe that [Zschernig] represents the Court's reaction to a particular regulatory statute,
the operation of which intruded extraordinarily deeply into
foreign affairs."). The HVIRA entails no such state action
or policy. It takes no position on any contemporary foreign
government and requires no assessment of any existing foreign regime. It is directed solely at private insurers doing
business in California, and it requires them solely to disclose
information in their or their affiliates' possession or control.
I would not extend Zschernig into this dissimilar domain.4

Neither would I stretch Belmont, Pink, or Dames &
Moore to support implied preemption by executive agreement. In each of those cases, the Court gave effect to the
express terms of an executive agreement. In Dames &
Moore, for example, the Court addressed an agreement explicitly extinguishing certain suits in domestic courts. 453
U. S., at 665; see supra, at 437-438. Here, however, none of
the executive agreements extinguish any underlying claim
for relief. See Neuborne, 80 Wash. U. L. Q., at 824, n. 101.
The United States has agreed to file precatory statements
advising courts that dismissing Holocaust-era claims accords
with American foreign policy, but the German Foundation
Agreement confirms that such statements have no legally
binding effect. See 39 Int'l Legal Materials, at 1304; supra,
at 436. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether even litigation on Holocaust-era insurance claims must be abated in
deference to the German Foundation Agreement or the parallel agreements with Austria and France. Indeed, ambigu4 The Court also places considerable weight on Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363 (2000). As the Court acknowledges,
however, ante, at 423, Crosby was a statutory preemption case. The state
law there at issue posed "an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's
full objectives under the [relevant] federal Act." 530 U. S., at 373. That
statutory decision provides little support for preempting a state law by
inferring preclusive foreign policy objectives from precatory language in
executive agreements.

ity on this point appears to have been the studied aim ofthe American negotiating team. See Eizenstat, Imperfect

Justice, at 272-273 (describing the "double negative" thatsatisfied German negotiators and preserved the flexibility
sought by Justice Department litigators).If it is uncertain whether insurance litigation may continue given the executive agreements on which the Courtrelies, it should be abundantly clear that those agreements
leave disclosure laws like the HVIRA untouched. The con-trast with the Litvinov Assignment at issue in

Belmont andPink is marked. That agreement spoke directly to claim assignment in no uncertain terms; Belmont and Pink con-firmed that state law could not invalidate the very assignments accomplished by the agreement. See supra, at436-437. Here, the Court invalidates a state disclosure law
on grounds of conflict with foreign policy "embod[ied]" incertain executive agreements, ante, at 417, although those
agreements do not refer to state disclosure laws specifically,or even to information disclosure generally.

5 It therefore is

surely an exaggeration to assert that the "HVIRA threat-ens to frustrate the operation of the particular mechanism

the President has chosen" to resolve Holocaust-era claims.
Ante, at 424. If that were so, one might expect to find somereference to laws like the HVIRA in the later-in-time executive agreements. There is none.To fill the agreements' silences, the Court points to statements by individual members of the Executive Branch. Seeante, at 411 (letters from Deputy Secretary of the Treas5 The Court apparently finds in the executive agreements' "express endorsement of ICHEIC's voluntary mechanism" a federal purpose to preempt any information disclosure mechanism not controlled by ICHEIC
itself. Ante, at 423, n. 13. But nothing in the executive agreements suggests that the Federal Government supports the resolution of Holocaustera insurance claims only to the extent they are based upon information
disclosed by ICHEIC. The executive agreements do not, for example,
prohibit recourse to ICHEIC to resolve claims based upon information
disclosed through laws like the HVIRA.

ury Stuart Eizenstat to California Governor Gray Davis andthe Insurance Commissioner of California);

ante, at 422 (testimony before Congress by Eizenstat, stating that a com-pany's participation in ICHEIC should give it "safe haven

from sanctions, subpoenas, and hearings relative to the Holo-caust period" (internal quotation marks omitted)). But we
have never premised foreign affairs preemption on statements of that order. Cf. Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise
Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298, 329-330 (1994) ("Executive Branch actions--press releases, letters, and amicusbriefs"--that "express federal policy but lack the force of

law" cannot render a state law unconstitutional under the
Foreign Commerce Clause.). We should not do so here lest
we place the considerable power of foreign affairs preemption in the hands of individual sub-Cabinet members of the
Executive Branch. Executive officials of any rank may of
course be expected "faithfully [to] represen[t] the President's
chosen policy," ante, at 423, n. 13, but no authoritative text
accords such officials the power to invalidate state law simply by conveying the Executive's views on matters of federal
policy. The displacement of state law by preemption properly requires a considerably more formal and binding federal instrument.

Sustaining the HVIRA would not compromise the President's ability to speak with one voice for the Nation. See
ante, at 424. To the contrary, by declining to invalidate
the HVIRA in this case, we would reserve foreign affairs
preemption for circumstances where the President, acting

under statutory or constitutional authority, has spoken
clearly to the issue at hand. "[T]he Framers did not make
the judiciary the overseer of our government." Dames &
Moore, 453 U. S., at 660 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 594 (1952) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring)). And judges should not be the expositors of
the Nation's foreign policy, which is the role they play by
acting when the President himself has not taken a clear

stand. As I see it, courts step out of their proper role whenthey rely on no legislative or even executive text, but only

on inference and implication, to preempt state laws on for-eign affairs grounds.

In sum, assuming, arguendo, that an executive agreementor similarly formal foreign policy statement targeting disclosure could override the HVIRA, there is no such declarationhere. Accordingly, I would leave California's enactment in
place, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

FINANCE CORP. v. BAZZLE et al., in a representative capacity on behalf of a class and

for all others similarly situated, et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina

No. 02-634. Argued April 22, 2003--Decided June 23, 2003
The Bazzle respondents and the Lackey and Buggs respondents separately

entered into contracts with petitioner Green Tree Financial Corp. that
were governed by South Carolina law and included an arbitration clause
governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Each set of respondents filed
a state-court action, complaining that Green Tree's failure to provide
them with a form that would have told them of their right to name
their own lawyers and insurance agents violated South Carolina law,
and seeking damages. The Bazzles moved for class certification, and
Green Tree sought to stay the court proceedings and compel arbitration.
After the court certified a class and compelled arbitration, Green Tree
selected, with the Bazzles' consent, an arbitrator who later awarded the
class damages and attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award,
and Green Tree appealed, claiming, among other things, that class arbitration was legally impermissible. Lackey and the Buggses also sought
class certification and Green Tree moved to compel arbitration. The
trial court denied Green Tree's motion, finding the agreement unenforceable, but the state appeals court reversed. The parties then chose
an arbitrator, the same arbitrator who was later chosen to arbitrate the
Bazzles' dispute. The arbitrator certified a class and awarded it damages and attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award, and
Green Tree appealed. The State Supreme Court withdrew both cases
from the appeals court, assumed jurisdiction, and consolidated the proceedings. That court held that the contracts were silent in respect to
class arbitration, that they consequently authorized class arbitration,
and that arbitration had properly taken that form.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
351 S. C. 244, 569 S. E. 2d 349, vacated and remanded.

Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, and
Justice Ginsburg, concluded that an arbitrator must determine
whether the contracts forbid class arbitration. Pp. 450-454.

(a) Green Tree argues that the contracts are not silent--that they
forbid arbitration. If the contracts are not silent, then the state court's

539US2 Unit: $U79 [05-03-05 13:22:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
holding is flawed on its own terms; that court neither said nor implied
that it would have authorized class arbitration had the parties' arbitration agreement forbidden it. Whether Green Tree is right about the
contracts presents a disputed issue of contract interpretation. The contracts say that disputes "shall be resolved . . . by one arbitrator selected
by us [Green Tree] with consent of you [Green Tree's customer]." The
class arbitrator was "selected by" Green Tree "with consent of" Green
Tree's customers, the named plaintiffs. And insofar as the other class
members agreed to proceed in class arbitration, they consented as well.
Green Tree did not independently select this arbitrator to arbitrate its
dispute with the other class members, but whether the contracts contain
such a requirement is not decided by the literal contract terms.
Whether "selected by [Green Tree]" means "selected by [Green Tree] to
arbitrate this dispute and no other (even identical) dispute with another
customer" is the question at issue: Do the contracts forbid class arbitration? Given the broad authority they elsewhere bestow upon the arbitrator, the answer is not completely obvious. The parties agreed to
submit to the arbitrator "[a]ll disputes, claims, or controversies arising
from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from
this contract." And the dispute about what the arbitration contracts
mean is a dispute "relating to this contract" and the resulting "relationships." Hence the parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator, not
a judge, would answer the relevant question, and any doubt about the
" `scope of arbitrable issues' " should be resolved " `in favor of arbitration.' " Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473
U. S. 614, 626. The question here does not fall into the limited circumstances where courts assume that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators, to decide a particular arbitration-related matter, as it concerns
neither the arbitration clause's validity nor its applicability to the underlying dispute. The relevant question here is what kind of arbitration
proceeding the parties agreed to, which does not concern a state statute
or judicial procedures, cf. Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of
Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, but rather
contract interpretation and arbitration procedures. Arbitrators are
well situated to answer that question. Pp. 450-453.

(b) With respect to the question whether the contracts forbid class
arbitration, the parties have not yet obtained the arbitration decision
that their contracts foresee. Regarding Bazzle plaintiffs, the State Supreme Court wrote that the trial court issued an order granting class
certification and the arbitrator subsequently administered class arbitration proceedings without the trial court's further involvement. As for
Lackey plaintiffs, the arbitrator decided to certify the class after the
trial court had determined that the identical contract in the Bazzle case

authorized class arbitration procedures, and there is no question that
the arbitrator was aware of that decision. On balance, there is at least
a strong likelihood that in both proceedings the arbitrator's decision
reflected a court's interpretation of the contracts rather than an arbitrator's interpretation. Pp. 453-454.

Justice Stevens concluded that in order to have a controlling
judgment of the Court, and because Justice Breyer's opinion expresses a view of the case close to his own, he concurs in the judgment.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Justice Breyer announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

Justice Scalia, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join.

This case concerns contracts between a commercial lenderand its customers, each of which contains a clause providing

for arbitration of all contract-related disputes. The Su-preme Court of South Carolina held (1) that the arbitration
clauses are silent as to whether arbitration might take theform of class arbitration, and (2) that, in that circumstance,
South Carolina law interprets the contracts as permittingclass arbitration. 351 S. C. 244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). We
granted certiorari to determine whether this holding is con-sistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq.

We are faced at the outset with a problem concerning thecontracts' silence. Are the contracts in fact silent, or do
they forbid class arbitration as petitioner Green Tree Fin-ancial Corp. contends? Given the South Carolina Supreme
Court's holding, it is important to resolve that question.But we cannot do so, not simply because it is a matter of
state law, but also because it is a matter for the arbitratorto decide. Because the record suggests that the parties
have not yet received an arbitrator's decision on that ques-tion of contract interpretation, we vacate the judgment of
the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand the case sothat this question may be resolved in arbitration.

448 GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP. v. BAZZLE

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Bazzles and Green Tree entered into a contract, governed bySouth Carolina law, which included the following arbitration clause:

"ARBITRATION--All disputes, claims, or controversies
arising from or relating to this contract or the relation-ships which result from this contract . . .

shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected
by us with consent of you. This arbitration contract is
made pursuant to a transaction in interstate commerce,and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act at

9 U. S. C. section 1. . . . THE PARTIES VOLUNTAR-ILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY
HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL, EITHER PURSUANT TO
ARBITRATION UNDER THIS CLAUSE OR PUR-SUANT TO A COURT ACTION BY US (AS PROVIDED HEREIN). . . . The parties agree and under-stand that the arbitrator shall have all powers provided
by the law and the contract. These powers shall in-clude all legal and equitable remedies, including, but not
limited to, money damages, declaratory relief, and in-junctive relief." App. 34 (emphasis added, capitalization in original).
Respondents Daniel Lackey and George and Florine Buggs
entered into loan contracts and security agreements for thepurchase of mobile homes with Green Tree. These agreements contained arbitration clauses that were, in all relevantrespects, identical to the Bazzles' arbitration clause. (Their
contracts substitute the word "you" with the word "Buy-er[s]" in the italicized phrase.) 351 S. C., at 264, n. 18, 569
S. E. 2d, at 359, n. 18 (emphasis deleted).

At the time of the loan transactions, Green Tree apparently failed to provide these customers with a legally required form that would have told them that they had a right
to name their own lawyers and insurance agents and would
have provided space for them to write in those names. See

Opinion of Breyer, J.
S. C. Code Ann. $ 37-10-102 (West 2002). The two sets of
customers before us now as respondents each filed separate
actions in South Carolina state courts, complaining that this
failure violated South Carolina law and seeking damages.

In April 1997, the Bazzles asked the court to certify their
claims as a class action. Green Tree sought to stay the
court proceedings and compel arbitration. On January 5,
1998, the court both (1) certified a class action and (2) entered an order compelling arbitration. App. 7. Green Tree
then selected an arbitrator with the Bazzles' consent. And
the arbitrator, administering the proceeding as a class arbitration, eventually awarded the class $10,935,000 in statutory
damages, along with attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award, App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-35a, and Green
Tree appealed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals claiming, among other things, that class arbitration was legally
impermissible.

Lackey and the Buggses had earlier begun a similar court
proceeding in which they, too, sought class certification.
Green Tree moved to compel arbitration. The trial court
initially denied the motion, finding the arbitration agreement
unenforceable, but Green Tree pursued an interlocutory appeal and the State Court of Appeals reversed. Lackey v.
Green Tree Financial Corp., 330 S. C. 388, 498 S. E. 2d 898
(1998). The parties then chose an arbitrator, indeed the
same arbitrator who was subsequently selected to arbitrate
the Bazzles' dispute.

In December 1998, the arbitrator certified a class in arbitration. App. 18. The arbitrator proceeded to hear the
matter, ultimately ruled in favor of the class, and awarded
the class $9,200,000 in statutory damages in addition to attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 36a-54a. Green Tree appealed to the South
Carolina Court of Appeals claiming, among other things, that
class arbitration was legally impermissible.

450 GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP. v. BAZZLE

Opinion of Breyer, J.
The South Carolina Supreme Court withdrew both casesfrom the Court of Appeals, assumed jurisdiction, and consolidated the proceedings. 351 S. C., at 249, 569 S. E. 2d, at351. That court then held that the contracts were silent in
respect to class arbitration, that they consequently author-ized class arbitration, and that arbitration had properly
taken that form. We granted certiorari to consider whetherthat holding is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.

II
The South Carolina Supreme Court's determination thatthe contracts are silent in respect to class arbitration raises

a preliminary question. Green Tree argued there, as it ar-gues here, that the contracts are not silent--that they forbid
class arbitration. And we must deal with that argument atthe outset, for if it is right, then the South Carolina court's
holding is flawed on its own terms; that court neither saidnor implied that it would have authorized class arbitration
had the parties' arbitration agreement forbidden it.Whether Green Tree is right about the contracts themselves presents a disputed issue of contract interpretation.T

he Chief Justice believes that Green Tree is right; in-deed, that Green Tree is so clearly right that we should ignore the fact that state law, not federal law, normally gov-erns such matters, see

post, at 454 (Stevens, J., concurringin judgment and dissenting in part), and reverse the South

Carolina Supreme Court outright, see post, at 458-460(

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). The Chief Justice pointsout that the contracts say that disputes "shall be resolved . . .

by one arbitrator selected by us [Green Tree] with consent ofyou [Green Tree's customer]." App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a.
See post, at 458. And it finds that class arbitration is clearlyinconsistent with this requirement. After all, class arbitration involves an arbitration, not simply between Green Treeand a

named customer, but also between Green Tree and
other (represented) customers, all taking place before the

451Cite as: 539 U. S. 444 (2003)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
arbitrator chosen to arbitrate the initial, named customer'sdispute.

We do not believe, however, that the contracts' languageis as clear as

The Chief Justice believes. The class arbitrator was "selected by" Green Tree "with consent of " GreenTree's customers, the named plaintiffs. And insofar as the

other class members agreed to proceed in class arbitration,
they consented as well.Of course, Green Tree did

not independently select this
arbitrator to arbitrate its disputes with the other class mem-bers. But whether the contracts contain this additional requirement is a question that the literal terms of the contracts
do not decide. The contracts simply say (I) "selected by us
[Green Tree]." And that is literally what occurred. The
contracts do not say (II) "selected by us [Green Tree] to arbitrate this dispute and no other (even identical) dispute with
another customer." The question whether (I) in fact implicitly means (II) is the question at issue: Do the contracts forbid class arbitration? Given the broad authority the contracts elsewhere bestow upon the arbitrator, see, e. g., App.
to Pet. for Cert. 110a (the contracts grant to the arbitrator
"all powers," including certain equitable powers "provided
by the law and the contract"), the answer to this question is
not completely obvious.

At the same time, we cannot automatically accept the
South Carolina Supreme Court's resolution of this contractinterpretation question. Under the terms of the parties'
contracts, the question--whether the agreement forbids
class arbitration--is for the arbitrator to decide. The parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator "[a]ll disputes, claims,
or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or
the relationships which result from this contract." Ibid.
(emphasis added). And the dispute about what the arbitration contract in each case means (i. e., whether it forbids the
use of class arbitration procedures) is a dispute "relating to
this contract" and the resulting "relationships." Hence the

parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator, not a judge,would answer the relevant question. See

First Options of
Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 943 (1995) (arbitrationis a "matter of contract"). And if there is doubt about that

matter--about the " `scope of arbitrable issues' "--we shouldresolve that doubt " `in favor of arbitration.' "

Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.
614, 626 (1985).In certain limited circumstances, courts assume that the

parties intended courts, not arbitrators, to decide a particu-lar arbitration-related matter (in the absence of "clea[r] and
unmistakabl[e]" evidence to the contrary). AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649
(1986). These limited instances typically involve matters of
a kind that "contracting parties would likely have expected
a court" to decide. Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,
537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002). They include certain gateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration
agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration
clause applies to a certain type of controversy. See generally Howsam, supra. See also John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.
Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 546-547 (1964) (whether an arbitration agreement survives a corporate merger); AT&T,
supra, at 651-652 (whether a labor-management layoff controversy falls within the scope of an arbitration clause).

The question here--whether the contracts forbid class arbitration--does not fall into this narrow exception. It concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its
applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties.
Unlike First Options, the question is not whether the parties
wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they
agreed to arbitrate a matter. 514 U. S., at 942-945. Rather
the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to. That question does not concern a state statute or judicial procedures, cf. Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 474-476 (1989). It concernscontract interpretation and arbitration procedures. Arbitrators are well situated to answer that question. Giventhese considerations, along with the arbitration contracts'
sweeping language concerning the scope of the questionscommitted to arbitration, this matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator, not the courts, to decide.Cf.

Howsam, supra, at 83 (finding for roughly similar reasonsthat the arbitrator should determine a certain procedural

"gateway matter"). III

With respect to this underlying question--whether the ar-bitration contracts forbid class arbitration--the parties have
not yet obtained the arbitration decision that their contractsforesee. As far as concerns the Bazzle plaintiffs, the South
Carolina Supreme Court wrote that the "trial court" issued"an order granting class certification" and the arbitrator
subsequently "administered" class arbitration proceedings"without further involvement of the trial court." 351 S. C.,
at 250-251, 569 S. E. 2d, at 352. Green Tree adds that "theclass arbitration was imposed on the parties and the arbitrator by the South Carolina trial court." Brief for Petitioner30. Respondents now deny that this was so, Brief for Respondents 13, but we can find no convincing record supportfor that denial.

As far as concerns the Lackey plaintiffs, what happenedin arbitration is less clear. On the one hand, the

Lackeyarbitrator (the same individual who later arbitrated the Bazzle dispute) wrote: "I determined that a class action shouldproceed in arbitration based upon my careful review of the
broadly drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green Tree."App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a (emphasis added). And respondents suggested at oral argument that the arbitrator's deci-sion was independently made. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.

On the other hand, the Lackey arbitrator decided thisquestion after the South Carolina trial court had determined

539US2 Unit: $U79 [05-03-05 13:22:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN
454 GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP. v. BAZZLE

Opinion of Stevens, J.
that the identical contract in the Bazzle case authorized classarbitration procedures. And there is no question that the

arbitrator was aware of the Bazzle decision, since the Lackeyplaintiffs had argued to the arbitrator that it should impose
class arbitration procedures in part because the state trialcourt in

Bazzle had done so. Record on Appeal 516-518.
In the court proceedings below (where Green Tree took the
opposite position), the Lackey plaintiffs maintained that "tothe extent" the arbitrator decided that the contracts permitted class procedures (in the Lackey case or the Bazzle case),"it was a reaffirmation and/or adoption of [the

Bazzle c]ourt's
prior determination." Record on Appeal 1708, n. 2. Seealso App. 31-32, n. 2.

On balance, there is at least a strong likelihood in Lackeyas well as in

Bazzle that the arbitrator's decision reflected a
court's interpretation of the contracts rather than an arbitra-tor's interpretation. That being so, we remand the case so

that the arbitrator may decide the question of contract interpretation--thereby enforcing the parties' arbitration agreements according to their terms. 9 U. S. C. $ 2; Volt, supra,
at 478-479.

The judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

So ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part.

The parties agreed that South Carolina law would govern
their arbitration agreement. The Supreme Court of South
Carolina has held as a matter of state law that class-action
arbitrations are permissible if not prohibited by the applicable arbitration agreement, and that the agreement between
these parties is silent on the issue. 351 S. C. 244, 262-266,
569 S. E. 2d 349, 359-360 (2002). There is nothing in the
Federal Arbitration Act that precludes either of these deter539US2 Unit: $U79 [05-03-05 13:22:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

minations by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. See
Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 475-476 (1989).

Arguably the interpretation of the parties' agreement
should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator,
rather than the court. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79 (2002). Because the decision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct as a matter of law,
and because petitioner has merely challenged the merits of
that decision without claiming that it was made by the wrong
decisionmaker, there is no need to remand the case to correct
that possible error.

Accordingly, I would simply affirm the judgment of the
Supreme Court of South Carolina. Were I to adhere to my
preferred disposition of the case, however, there would be no
controlling judgment of the Court. In order to avoid that
outcome, and because Justice Breyer's opinion expresses
a view of the case close to my own, I concur in the judgment.
See Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 134 (1945) (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The parties entered into contracts with an arbitration
clause that is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA), 9 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. The Supreme Court of South
Carolina held that arbitration under the contracts could proceed as a class action even though the contracts do not by
their terms permit class-action arbitration. The plurality
now vacates that judgment and remands the case for the
arbitrator to make this determination. I would reverse because this determination is one for the courts, not for the
arbitrator, and the holding of the Supreme Court of South
Carolina contravenes the terms of the contracts and is therefore pre-empted by the FAA.

456 GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP. v. BAZZLE

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
The agreement to arbitrate involved here, like many suchagreements, is terse. Its operative language is contained in

one sentence:

"All disputes, claims, or controversies arising from orrelating to this contract or the relationships which result

from this contract . . . shall be resolved by binding arbi-tration by one arbitrator selected by us with consent of
you." App. 34.
The decision of the arbitrator on matters agreed to be sub-mitted to him is given considerable deference by the courts.

See Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532U. S. 504, 509-510 (2001) (per curiam). The Supreme Court
of South Carolina relied on this principle in deciding that thearbitrator in this case did not abuse his discretion in allowing
a class action. 351 S. C. 244, 266-268, 569 S. E. 2d 349, 361-362 (2002). But the decision of

what to submit to the arbi-trator is a matter of contractual agreement by the parties,

and the interpretation of that contract is for the court, notfor the arbitrator. As we stated in First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 945 (1995):

"[G]iven the principle that a party can be forced to arbi-trate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration, one can understand why courts mighthesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the `who
should decide arbitrability' point as giving the arbitra-tors that power, for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonablywould have thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would
decide."
Just as fundamental to the agreement of the parties aswhat is submitted to the arbitrator is to whom it is submitted. Those are the two provisions in the sentence quotedabove, and it is difficult to say that one is more important
than the other. I have no hesitation in saying that thechoice of arbitrator is as important a component of the agree539US2 Unit: $U79 [05-03-05 13:22:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN

457Cite as: 539 U. S. 444 (2003)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
ment to arbitrate as is the choice of what is to be submittedto him.

Thus, this case is controlled by First Options, and not byour more recent decision in

Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79 (2002). There, the agreement pro-vided that any dispute "shall be determined by arbitration

before any self-regulatory organization or exchange of which
Dean Witter is a member." Id., at 81 (internal quotationmarks omitted). Howsam chose the National Association of

Securities Dealers (NASD), and agreed to that organization's"Uniform Submission Agreement" which provided that the
arbitration would be governed by NASD's "Code of Arbitra-tion Procedure."

Id., at 82. That code, in turn, contained
a limitation. This Court held that it was for the arbitratorto interpret that limitation provision:

" ` "[P]rocedural" questions which grow out of the dis-pute and bear on its final disposition' are presumptively
not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to decide. John
Wiley [& Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557

(1964)] (holding that an arbitrator should decide whetherthe first two steps of a grievance procedure were completed, where these steps are prerequisites to arbitra-tion). So, too, the presumption is that the arbitrator
should decide `allegation[s] of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.' " Id., at 84.

I think that the parties' agreement as to how the arbitra-tor should be selected is much more akin to the agreement

as to what shall be arbitrated, a question for the courts under
First Options, than it is to "allegations of waiver, delay, or
like defenses to arbitrability," which are questions for the
arbitrator under Howsam.

"States may regulate contracts, including arbitration
clauses, under general contract law principles," Allied-Bruce
Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 281 (1995). "[T]he
interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of

state law, which this Court does not sit to review." Volt
Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 474 (1989). But "statelaw may nonetheless be pre-empted to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law--that is, to the extent thatit `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution
of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' " Id., at
477 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)).The parties do not dispute that these contracts fall within

the coverage of the FAA. 351 S. C., at 257, 569 S. E. 2d, at355. The "central purpose" of the FAA is "to ensure that
private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to
their terms." Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 53-54 (1995) (quoting Volt, supra, at 479
(internal quotation marks omitted)). See also Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 688 (1996); First
Options, supra, at 947. In other words, Congress sought
simply to "place such agreements upon the same footing as
other contracts." Volt, supra, at 474 (quoting Scherk v.
Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 511 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This aim "requires that we rigorously
enforce agreements to arbitrate," Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985)
(quoting Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213,
221 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)), in order to
"give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the
parties," Volt, supra, at 479. See also Mitsubishi Motors,
supra, at 626 ("[A]s with any other contract, the parties' intentions control").

Under the FAA, "parties are generally free to structure
their arbitration agreements as they see fit." Volt, supra,
at 479. Here, the parties saw fit to agree that any disputes
arising out of the contracts "shall be resolved by binding
arbitration by one arbitrator selected by us with consent of
you." App. 34. Each contract expressly defines "us" as
petitioner, and "you" as the respondent or respondents

named in that specific contract. Id., at 33 (" `We' and `us'means the Seller

above, its successors and assigns"; " `You'
and `your' means each Buyer above and guarantor, jointlyand severally" (emphasis added)). Each contract also specifies that it governs all "disputes . . . arising from . . . thiscontract or the relationships which result from

this contract. " Id., at 34 (emphasis added). These provisions,
which the plurality simply ignores, see ante, at 450-451,make quite clear that petitioner must select, and each buyer

must agree to, a particular arbitrator for disputes betweenpetitioner and that specific buyer.

While the observation of the Supreme Court of South Carolina that the agreement of the parties was silent as to the
availability of class-wide arbitration is literally true, the
imposition of class-wide arbitration contravenes the justquoted provision about the selection of an arbitrator. To
be sure, the arbitrator that administered the proceedings
was "selected by [petitioner] with consent of " the Bazzles,
Lackey, and the Buggses. App. 34-36. But petitioner had
the contractual right to choose an arbitrator for each dispute
with the other 3,734 individual class members, and this right
was denied when the same arbitrator was foisted upon petitioner to resolve those claims as well. Petitioner may well
have chosen different arbitrators for some or all of these
other disputes; indeed, it would have been reasonable for
petitioner to do so, in order to avoid concentrating all of the
risk of substantial damages awards in the hands of a single
arbitrator. As petitioner correctly concedes, Brief for Petitioner 32, 42, the FAA does not prohibit parties from choosing to proceed on a classwide basis. Here, however, the parties simply did not so choose.

"Arbitration under the Act is a matter of consent, not coercion." Volt, supra, at 479. Here, the Supreme Court of
South Carolina imposed a regime that was contrary to the
express agreement of the parties as to how the arbitrator would be chosen. It did not enforce the "agreemen[t]

GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.
appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbia

No. 02-182. Argued April 29, 2003--Decided June 26, 2003
Georgia's 1997 State Senate districting plan is the benchmark plan for this

litigation. That plan drew 56 districts, 11 of them with a total black
population of over 50%, and 10 of them with a black voting age population of over 50%. The 2000 census revealed that these numbers had
increased so that 13 districts had a black population of at least 50%,
with the black voting age population exceeding 50% in 12 of those districts. After the 2000 census, the Georgia General Assembly began
redistricting the Senate once again. It is uncontested that a substantial
majority of Georgia's black voters vote Democratic, and that all elected
black representatives in the General Assembly are Democrats. The
Senator who chaired the subcommittee that developed the new plan testified he believed that as a district's black voting age population increased beyond what was necessary to elect a candidate, it would push
the Senate more toward the Republicans, and correspondingly diminish
the power of African-Americans overall. Thus, part of the Democrats'
strategy was not only to maintain the number of majority-minority districts and increase the number of Democratic Senate seats, but also to
increase the number of so-called "influence" districts, where black voters would be able to exert a significant--if not decisive--force in the
election process. The new plan therefore "unpacked" the most heavily
concentrated majority-minority districts in the benchmark plan, and created a number of new influence districts, drawing 13 districts with a
majority-black voting age population, 13 additional districts with a black
voting age population of between 30%-50%, and 4 other districts with a
black voting age population of between 25%-30%. When the Senate
adopted the new plan, 10 of the 11 black Senators voted for it. The
Georgia House of Representatives passed the plan with 33 of the 34
black Representatives voting for it. No Republican in either body
voted for the plan, making the votes of the black legislators necessary
for passage. The Governor signed the Senate plan into law in 2001.

Because Georgia is a covered jurisdiction under $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, it must submit any new voting "standard, practice,
or procedure" for preclearance by either the United States Attorney
General or the District Court for the District of Columbia in order to
ensure that the change "does not have the purpose [or] effect of denying

or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color," 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973c. No change should be precleared if it "would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States, 425
U. S. 130, 141. In order to preclear its 2001 plan, Georgia filed suit in
the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the plan does
not violate $ 5. To satisfy its burden of proving nonretrogression, Georgia submitted detailed evidence documenting, among other things, the
total population, total black population, black voting age population, percentage of black registered voters, and the overall percentage of Democratic votes in each district; evidence about how each of these statistics
compared to the benchmark districts; testimony from numerous participants in the plan's enactment that it was designed to increase black
voting strength throughout the State as well as to help ensure a continued Democratic majority in the Senate; expert testimony that black and
nonblack voters have equal chances of electing their preferred candidate
when the black voting age population of a district is at 44.3%; and, in
response to the United States' objections, more detailed statistical evidence with respect to three proposed Senate districts that the United
States found objectionable--Districts 2, 12, and 26--and two districts
challenged by the intervenors--Districts 15 and 22. The United States
argued that the plan should not be precleared because the changes to
the boundaries of Districts 2, 12, and 26 unlawfully reduced black voters'
ability to elect candidates of their choice. The United States' evidence
focused only on those three districts and was not designed to permit
the court to assess the plan's overall impact. The intervenors, four
African-Americans, argued that retrogression had occurred in Districts
15 and 22, and presented proposed alternative plans and an expert report critiquing the State's expert report. A three-judge District Court
panel held that the plan violated $ 5, and was therefore not entitled
to preclearance.

Held:

1. The District Court did not err in allowing the private litigants to
intervene. That court found that the intervenors' analysis of the plan
identifies interests not adequately represented by the existing parties.
Private parties may intervene in $ 5 actions assuming they meet the
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, NAACP v. New
York, 413 U. S. 345, 365, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing intervention in this case, see id., at 367. Morris v.
Gressette, 432 U. S. 491, 504-505, in which the Court held that the decision to object belongs only to the Attorney General, is distinguished
because it concerned the administrative, not the judicial, preclearance

process. Morris itself recognized the difference between the two. See
id., at 503-507. Pp. 476-477.

2. The District Court failed to consider all the relevant factors
when it examined whether Georgia's Senate plan resulted in a retrogression of black voters' effective exercise of the electoral franchise.
Pp. 477-491.

(a) Georgia's argument that a plan should be precleared under $ 5
if it would satisfy $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973,
is rejected. A $ 2 vote dilution violation is not an independent reason to deny $ 5 preclearance, because that would inevitably make $ 5
compliance contingent on $ 2 compliance and thereby replace $ 5 retrogression standards with those for $ 2. Reno v. Bossier Parish School
Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 477. Instead of showing that its plan is nondilutive
under $ 2, Georgia must prove that it is nonretrogressive under $ 5.
Pp. 477-479.

(b) To determine the meaning of "a retrogression in the position of
racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral
franchise," Beer, supra, at 141, the statewide plan must first be examined as a whole: First, the diminution of a minority group's effective
exercise of the electoral franchise violates $ 5 only if the State cannot
show that the gains in the plan as a whole offset the loss in a particular
district. Second, all of the relevant circumstances must be examined,
such as minority voters' ability to elect their candidate of choice, the
extent of the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political
process, and the feasibility of creating a nonretrogressive plan. See,
e. g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1011-1012, 1020-1021. In
assessing the totality of the circumstances, a minority group's comparative ability to elect a candidate of its choice is an important factor, but
it cannot be dispositive or exclusive. See, e. g., Thornburg v. Gingles,
478 U. S. 30, 47-50. To maximize such a group's electoral success, a
State may choose to create either a certain number of "safe" districts
in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the
candidate of their choice, see, e. g., id., at 48-49, or a greater number of
districts in which it is likely, although perhaps not quite as likely as
under the benchmark plan, that minority voters will be able to elect
their candidates, see, e. g., id., at 88-89 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment). Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one of
these redistricting methods over the other. Id., at 89. In considering
the other highly relevant factor in a retrogression inquiry--the extent
to which a new plan changes the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process--a court must examine whether the plan
adds or subtracts "influence districts" where minority voters may not
be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not

Syllabus
decisive, role in the electoral process, cf., e. g., Johnson, supra, at 1007.
In assessing these influence districts' comparative weight, it is important to consider "the likelihood that candidates elected without decisive
minority support would be willing to take the minority's interests into
account." Thornburg, 478 U. S., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment). Various studies suggest that the most effective way to
maximize minority voting strength may be to create more influence or
coalitional districts. Section 5 allows States to risk having fewer minority representatives in order to achieve greater overall representation of a minority group by increasing the number of representatives
sympathetic to the interests of minority voters. See, e. g., id., at 87-89,
99. Another method of assessing the group's opportunity to participate
in the political process is to examine the comparative position of black
representatives' legislative leadership, influence, and power. See Johnson, supra, at 1020. Maintaining or increasing legislative positions of
power for minority voters' representatives of choice, while not dispositive by itself, can show the lack of retrogressive effect. And it is also
significant, though not dispositive, whether the representatives elected
from the very districts created and protected by the Voting Rights Act
support the new plan. Pp. 479-485.

(c) The District Court failed to consider all the relevant factors.
First, although acknowledging the importance of assessing the statewide plan as a whole, the court focused too narrowly on proposed Senate
Districts 2, 12, and 26, without examining the increases in the black
voting age population that occurred in many of the other districts. Second, the court did not consider any factor beyond black voters' comparative ability to elect a candidate of their choice. It improperly rejected
other evidence that the legislators representing the benchmark
majority-minority districts support the plan; that the plan maintains
those representatives' legislative influence; and that Georgia affirmatively decided that the best way to maximize black voting strength was
to adopt a plan that "unpacked" the high concentration of minority voters in the majority-minority districts. In the face of Georgia's evidence
of nonretrogression, the United States' only evidence was that it would
be more difficult for minority voters to elect their candidate of choice in
Districts 2, 12, and 26. Given the evidence submitted in this case, Georgia likely met its burden of showing nonretrogression. Section 5 gives
States the flexibility to implement the type of plan that Georgia has

minority voters in some of those districts will face a somewhat reduced

whether Georgia's State Senate redistricting plan is retrogressive as compared to its previous, benchmark districting
plan.

A

Over the past decade, the propriety of Georgia's state and
congressional districts has been the subject of repeated litigation. In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly began the
process of redistricting after the 1990 census. Because
Georgia is a covered jurisdiction under $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act, see Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 905 (1995),
Georgia submitted its revised State Senate plan to the
United States Department of Justice for preclearance. The
plan as enacted into law increased the number of majorityminority districts from the previous Senate plan. The
Department of Justice nevertheless refused preclearance
because of Georgia's failure to maximize the number of
majority-minority districts. See Johnson v. Miller, 929
F. Supp. 1529, 1537, and n. 23 (SD Ga. 1996). After Georgia
made changes to the Senate plan in an attempt to satisfy the
United States' objections, the State again submitted it to the
Department of Justice for preclearance. Again, the Department of Justice refused preclearance because the plan did not
contain a sufficient number of majority-minority districts.
See id., at 1537, 1539. Finally, the United States precleared

Opinion of the Court
Georgia's third redistricting plan, approving it in the springof 1992. See

id., at 1537.
Georgia's 1992 Senate plan was not challenged in court.See

id., at 1533-1534. Its congressional districting plan,
however, was challenged as unconstitutional under the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See

Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993). In 1995, we held in
Miller v. Johnson that Georgia's congressional districtingplan was unconstitutional because it engaged in "the very

racial stereotyping the Fourteenth Amendment forbids" bymaking race the "predominant, overriding factor explaining"
Georgia's congressional districting decisions. 515 U. S., at
928, 920. And even though it was "safe to say that the congressional plan enacted in the end was required in order to
obtain preclearance," this justification did not permit Georgia to engage in racial gerrymandering. See id., at 921.
Georgia's State Senate districts served as "building blocks"
to create the congressional districting plan found unconstitutional in Miller v. Johnson. Johnson v. Miller, 929 F. Supp.,
at 1533, n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id.,
at 1536.

Georgia recognized that after Miller v. Johnson, its legislative districts were unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. See 929 F. Supp., at 1533, 1540. Accordingly, Georgia attempted to cure the perceived constitutional
problems with the 1992 State Senate districting plan by
passing another plan in 1995. The Department of Justice
refused to preclear the 1995 plan, maintaining that it retrogressed from the 1992 plan and that Miller v. Johnson concerned only Georgia's congressional districts, not Georgia's
State Senate districts. See 929 F. Supp., at 1540-1541.

Private litigants subsequently brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1995 Senate plan. See id., at
1533. The three-judge panel of the District Court reviewing
the 1995 Senate plan found that "[i]t is clear that a black
maximization policy had become an integral part of the sec539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion 5 preclearance process . . . when the Georgia redistrict-ing plans were under review. The net effect of the DOJ's

preclearance objection[s] . . . was to require the State ofGeorgia to increase the number of majority black districts
in its redistricting plans, which were already ameliorativeplans, beyond any reasonable concept of non-retrogression."
Id., at 1539-1540. The court noted that in Miller v. Johnson, we specifically disapproved of the Department of Jus-tice's policy that the maximization of black districts was a

part of the $ 5 retrogression analysis. See 929 F. Supp., at1539. Indeed, in

Miller, we found that the Department of
Justice's objections to Georgia's redistricting plans were
"driven by its policy of maximizing majority-black districts."
515 U. S., at 924. And "[i]n utilizing $ 5 to require States
to create majority-minority districts wherever possible, the
Department of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we have upheld."
Id., at 925.

The District Court stated that the maximization of
majority-minority districts in Georgia "artificially push[ed]
the percentage of black voters within some majority black
districts as high as possible." 929 F. Supp., at 1536. The
plan that eventually received the Department of Justice's
preclearance in 1992 "represented the General Assembly's
surrender to the black maximization policy of the DOJ." Id.,
at 1540. The court then found that the 1995 plan was an
unconstitutional racial gerrymander. See id., at 1543.

Under court direction, Georgia and the Department of Justice reached a mediated agreement on the constitutionality
of the 1995 Senate plan. Georgia passed a new plan in 1997,
and the Department of Justice quickly precleared it. The
redrawn map resembled to a large degree the 1992 plan that
eventually received preclearance from the Department of
Justice, with some changes to accommodate the decision of
this Court in Miller v. Johnson, and of the District Court in
Johnson v. Miller.

Opinion of the Court
All parties here concede that the 1997 plan is the bench-mark plan for this litigation because it was in effect at the

time of the 2001 redistricting effort. The 1997 plan drew 56districts, 11 of them with a total black population of over
50%, and 10 of them with a black voting age population ofover 50%. See Record, Doc. No. 148, Pl. Exh. 1C (hereinafter Pl. Exh.). The 2000 census revealed that these numbers had increased so that 13 districts had a black populationof at least 50%, with the black voting age population exceeding 50% in 12 of those districts. See 195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 39(DC 2002).

After the 2000 census, the Georgia General Assembly
began the process of redistricting the Senate once again.
No party contests that a substantial majority of black voters
in Georgia vote Democratic, or that all elected black representatives in the General Assembly are Democrats. The
goal of the Democratic leadership--black and white--was to
maintain the number of majority-minority districts and also
increase the number of Democratic Senate seats. See id., at
41-42. For example, the Director of Georgia's Legislative
Redistricting Office, Linda Meggers, testified that the Senate
Black Caucus " `wanted to maintain' " the existing majorityminority districts and at the same time " `not waste' " votes.
Id., at 41.

The Vice Chairman of the Senate Reapportionment Committee, Senator Robert Brown, also testified about the goals
of the redistricting effort. Senator Brown, who is black,
chaired the subcommittee that developed the Senate plan at
issue here. See id., at 42. Senator Brown believed when
he designed the Senate plan that as the black voting age
population in a district increased beyond what was necessary, it would "pus[h] the whole thing more towards [the]
Republican[s]." Pl. Exh. 20, at 24. And "correspondingly,"
Senator Brown stated, "the more you diminish the power of
African-Americans overall." Ibid. Senator Charles Walker was the majority leader of the Senate. Senator Walker

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
470 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT

Opinion of the Court
testified that it was important to attempt to maintain aDemocratic majority in the Senate because "we [AfricanAmericans] have a better chance to participate in the politi-cal process under the Democratic majority than we would
have under a Republican majority." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19. Atleast 7 of the 11 black members of the Senate could chair
committees. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 41.

The plan as designed by Senator Brown's committee kepttrue to the dual goals of maintaining at least as many

majority-minority districts while also attempting to increaseDemocratic strength in the Senate. Part of the Democrats'
strategy was not only to maintain the number of majorityminority districts, but to increase the number of so-called
"influence" districts, where black voters would be able to
exert a significant--if not decisive--force in the election
process. As the majority leader testified, "in the past, you
know, what we would end up doing was packing. You put
all blacks in one district and all whites in one district, so
what you end up with is [a] black Democratic district and
[a] white Republican district. That's not a good strategy.
That does not bring the people together, it divides the population. But if you put people together on voting precincts it
brings people together." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19.

The plan as designed by the Senate "unpacked" the most
heavily concentrated majority-minority districts in the
benchmark plan, and created a number of new influence districts. The new plan drew 13 districts with a majority-black
voting age population, 13 additional districts with a black
voting age population of between 30% and 50%, and 4 other
districts with a black voting age population of between 25%
and 30%. See Pl. Exh. 2C. According to the 2000 census,
as compared to the benchmark plan, the new plan reduced
by five the number of districts with a black voting age population in excess of 60%. Compare Pl. Exh. 1D with Pl. Exh.
2C. Yet it increased the number of majority-black voting
age population districts by one, and it increased the number

Opinion of the Court
of districts with a black voting age population of between25% and 50% by four. As compared to the benchmark plan

enacted in 1997, the difference is even larger. Under theold census figures, Georgia had 10 Senate districts with a
majority-black voting age population, and 8 Senate districtswith a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%.
See Pl. Exh. 1C. The new plan thus increased the numberof districts with a majority black voting age population by
three, and increased the number of districts with a blackvoting age population of between 30% and 50% by another
five. Compare Pl. Exh. 1C with Pl. Exh. 2C.The Senate adopted its new districting plan on August 10,
2001, by a vote of 29 to 26. Ten of the eleven black Senatorsvoted for the plan. 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 55. The Georgia
House of Representatives passed the Senate plan by a voteof 101 to 71. Thirty-three of the thirty-four black Representatives voted for the plan. Ibid. No Republican ineither the House or the Senate voted for the plan, making
the votes of the black legislators necessary for passage. Seeid., at 41. The Governor signed the Senate plan into law on
August 24, 2001, and Georgia subsequently sought to obtainpreclearance.

B
Pursuant to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a covered juris-diction like Georgia has the option of either seeking administrative preclearance through the Attorney General of theUnited States or seeking judicial preclearance by instituting
an action in the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia for a declaratory judgment that the voting
change comports with $ 5. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c; Georgia v.
United States, 411 U. S. 526 (1973). Georgia chose the lattermethod, filing suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the

State Senate plan does not violate $ 5.Georgia, which bears the burden of proof in this action,
see Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),attempted to prove that its Senate plan was not retrogres539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sive either in intent or in effect. It submitted detailed evi-dence documenting in each district the total population, the

total black population, the black voting age population, thepercentage of black registered voters, and the overall percentage of Democratic votes (i. e., the overall likelihood thatvoters in a particular district will vote Democratic), among
other things. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs.
2C, 2D. The State also submitted evidence about how eachof these statistics compared to the benchmark districts. See

195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs. 1C, 1D, 1E (revised).Georgia also submitted testimony from numerous people
who had participated in enacting the Senate plan into law,
and from United States Congressman John Lewis, who represents the Atlanta area. These witnesses testified that the
new Senate plan was designed to increase black voting
strength throughout the State as well as to help ensure a
continued Democratic majority in the Senate. The State
also submitted expert testimony that African-American and
non-African-American voters have equal chances of electing
their preferred candidate when the black voting age population of a district is at 44.3%. Finally, in response to objections raised by the United States, Georgia submitted more
detailed statistical evidence with respect to three proposed
Senate districts that the United States found objectionable--
Districts 2, 12, and 26--and two districts that the intervenors challenged--Districts 15 and 22.

The United States, through the Attorney General, argued
in District Court that Georgia's 2001 Senate redistricting
plan should not be precleared. It argued that the plan's
changes to the boundaries of Districts 2, 12, and 26 unlawfully reduced the ability of black voters to elect candidates
of their choice. See Brief for Federal Appellees 8; 195
F. Supp. 2d, at 72. The United States noted that in District
2, the black voting age population dropped from 60.58% to
50.31%; in District 12, the black voting age population
dropped from 55.43% to 50.66%; and in District 26, the black

Opinion of the Court
voting age population dropped from 62.45% to 50.80%.1Moreover, in all three of these districts, the percentage of

black registered voters dropped to just under 50%. TheUnited States also submitted expert evidence that voting is
racially polarized in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26. See id.,at 69-71. The United States acknowledged that some limited percentage of whites would vote for a black candidate,but maintained that the percentage was not sufficient for
black voters to elect their candidate of choice. See id., at70-71. The United States also offered testimony from various witnesses, including lay witnesses living in the three dis-tricts, who asserted that the new contours of Districts 2, 12,
and 26 would reduce the opportunity for blacks to elect acandidate of their choice in those districts; Senator Regina
Thomas of District 2, the only black Senator who votedagainst the plan; Senator Eric Johnson, the Republican
leader of the Senate; and some black legislators who voted

1 Georgia and the United States have submitted slightly different figures
regarding the black voting age population of each district. The differing
figures depend upon whether the total number of blacks includes those
people who self-identify as both black and a member of another minority
group, such as Hispanic. Georgia counts this group of people, while the
United States does not do so. Like the District Court, we consider all the
record information, "including total black population, black registration
numbers and both [black voting age population] numbers." 195 F. Supp.
2d 25, 79 (DC 2002). We focus in particular on Georgia's black voting age
population numbers in this case because all parties rely on them to some
extent and because Georgia used its own black voting age population numbers when it enacted the Senate plan. Moreover, the United States does
not count all persons who identify themselves as black. It counts those
who say they are black and those who say that they are both black and
white, but it does not count those who say they are both black and a
member of another minority group. Using the United States' numbers
may have more relevance if the case involves a comparison of different
minority groups. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994); Bush v.
Vera, 517 U. S. 952 (1996). Here, however, the case involves an examination of only one minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise. In such circumstances, we believe it is proper to look at all individuals who identify themselves as black.

474 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT

Opinion of the Court
for the plan but questioned how the plan would affect black
voters. See Vols. 25-27 Record, Doc. No. 177, United States
Exhs. 707-736 (Depositions). As the District Court stated,
"the United States' evidence was extremely limited in
scope--focusing only on three contested districts in the State
Senate plan. That evidence was not designed to permit the
court to assess the overall impact of [the Senate plan]." 195
F. Supp. 2d, at 37.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, the District Court also permitted four African-American citizens of
Georgia to intervene. The intervenors identified two other
districts--Districts 15 and 22--where they alleged retrogression had occurred. The intervenors "present[ed] little
evidence other than proposed alternative plans and an expert report critiquing the State's expert report." 195 F.
Supp. 2d, at 37.

A three-judge panel of the District Court held that Georgia's State Senate apportionment violated $ 5, and was therefore not entitled to preclearance. See id., at 97. Judge Sullivan, joined by Judge Edwards, concluded that Georgia had
"not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that
the State Senate redistricting plan would not have a retrogressive effect on African American voters" effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Ibid. The court found that
Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 were retrogressive because
in each district, a lesser opportunity existed for the black
candidate of choice to win election under the new plan than
under the benchmark plan. See id., at 93-94. The court
found that the reductions in black voting age population in
Districts 2, 12, and 26 would "diminish African American
voting strength in these districts," and that Georgia had
"failed to present any . . . evidence" that the retrogression
in those districts "will be offset by gains in other districts."
Id., at 88.

475Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Judge Edwards, joined by Judge Sullivan, concurred.
Judge Edwards emphasized that $$ 5 and 2 are "procedurally
and substantively distinct provisions." Id., at 97. He
therefore rejected Georgia's argument that a plan preserving an equal opportunity for minorities to elect candidates of
their choice satisfies $ 5. Judge Edwards also rejected the
testimony of the black Georgia politicians who supported the
Senate plan. In his view, the testimony did not address
whether racial polarization was occurring in Senate Districts
2, 12, and 26. See id., at 101-102.

Judge Oberdorfer dissented. He would have g iven
"greater credence to the political expertise and motivation of
Georgia's African-American political leaders and reasonable
inferences drawn from their testimony and the voting data
and statistics." Id., at 102. He noted that this Court has
not answered "whether a redistricting plan that preserves
or increases the number of districts statewide in which minorities have a fair or reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of choice is entitled to preclearance, or whether every
district must remain at or improve on the benchmark probability of victory, even if doing so maintains a minority supermajority far in excess of the level needed for effective exercise of [the] electoral franchise." Id., at 117.

After the District Court refused to preclear the plan,
Georgia enacted another plan, largely similar to the one at
issue here, except that it added black voters to Districts 2,
12, and 26. The District Court precleared this plan. See
204 F. Supp. 2d 4 (2002). No party has contested the propriety of the District Court's preclearance of the Senate plan as
amended. Georgia asserts that it will use the plan as originally enacted if it receives preclearance.

We noted probable jurisdiction to consider whether the
District Court should have precleared the plan as originally
enacted by Georgia in 2001, 537 U. S. 1151 (2003), and now
vacate the judgment below.

Opinion of the Court

II
Before addressing the merits of Georgia's preclearanceclaim, we address the State's argument that the District

Court was incorrect in allowing the private litigants to inter-vene in this lawsuit. Georgia maintains that private parties
should not be allowed to intervene in $ 5 actions becauseStates should not be subjected to the political stratagems of
intervenors. While the United States disagrees with Geor-gia on the propriety of intervention here, the United States
argues that this question is moot because the participationof the intervenors did not affect the District Court's ruling
on the merits and the intervenors did not appeal the court'sruling.

We do not think Georgia's argument is moot. The inter-venors did not have to appeal because they were prevailing
parties below. Moreover, the District Court addressed theevidence that the intervenors submitted, which is now in
front of this Court. The issue whether intervenors areproper parties still has relevance in this Court because they
argue here that the District Court correctly found that theSenate plan was retrogressive.

The District Court properly found that Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 24 governs intervention in this case. Section 5 permits a State to bring "an action in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. Section 5 doesnot limit in any way the application of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure to this type of lawsuit, and the statute byits terms does not bar private parties from intervening. In
NAACP v. New York, 413 U. S. 345, 365 (1973), we held thatin an action under $ 5, "[i]ntervention in a federal court suit
is governed by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24."To support its argument, Georgia relies on

Morris v. Gres-sette, 432 U. S. 491 (1977). In Morris, we held that in an

administrative preclearance action, the decision to objectbelongs only to the Attorney General and is not judicially

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

477Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
reviewable. See id., at 504-505. But Morris concerned
the administrative preclearance process, not the judicial preclearance process. Morris itself recognized the difference
between administrative preclearance and judicial preclearance. See id., at 503-507.

Here, the District Court granted the motion to intervene
because it found that the intervenors' "analysis of the . . .
Senate redistricting pla[n] identifies interests that are not
adequately represented by the existing parties." App. to
Juris. Statement 218a. Private parties may intervene in $ 5
actions assuming they meet the requirements of Rule 24, and
the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting
the motion to intervene in this case. See NAACP v. New
York, supra, at 367.

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act "has a limited substantive goal: " `to insure that no voting-procedure changes
would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.' " Miller, 515 U. S., at 926
(quoting Beer v. United States, 425 U. S., [at 141])." Bush
v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 982-983 (1996). Thus, a plan that
merely preserves "current minority voting strength" is entitled to $ 5 preclearance. City of Lockhart v. United States,
460 U. S. 125, 134, n. 10 (1983); Bush v. Vera, supra, at 983.
Indeed, a voting change with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose or effect does not violate $ 5. See Reno v.
Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320, 341 (2000). And
"no matter how unconstitutional it may be," a plan that is
not retrogressive should be precleared under $ 5. Id., at
336. "[P]reclearance under $ 5 affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding." Id., at 335.

Georgia argues that a plan should be precleared under $ 5
if the plan would satisfy $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

or structure . . . cause[s] an inequality in the opportunitiesenjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred
representatives." Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 47
(1986); see also id., at 48-50 (enunciating a three-part test to
establish vote dilution); id., at 85-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). Unlike an inquiry
under $ 2, a retrogression inquiry under $ 5, "by definition,
requires a comparison of a jurisdiction's new voting plan
with its existing plan." Bossier Parish I, supra, at 478.
While some parts of the $ 2 analysis may overlap with the

$ 5 inquiry, the two sections "differ in structure, purpose,
and application." Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883 (1994)
(plurality opinion).

In Bossier Parish I, we specifically held that a violation of

$ 2 is not an independent reason to deny preclearance under

$ 5. See 520 U. S., at 477. The reason for this holding was
straightforward: "[R]ecognizing $ 2 violations as a basis for
denying $ 5 preclearance would inevitably make compliance
with $ 5 contingent upon compliance with $ 2. Doing so
would, for all intents and purposes, replace the standards for

$ 5 with those for $ 2." Ibid.

Georgia here makes the flip side of the argument that
failed in Bossier Parish I--compliance with $ 2 suffices for
preclearance under $ 5. Yet the argument fails here for the
same reasons the argument failed in Bossier Parish I. We
refuse to equate a $ 2 vote dilution inquiry with the $ 5 retrogression standard. Georgia's argument, like the argument

Opinion of the Court
in Bossier Parish I, would "shift the focus of $ 5 from nonret-rogression to vote dilution, and [would] change the $ 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existing plan to a hypothetical,undiluted plan." Id., at 480. Instead of showing that the
Senate plan is nondilutive under $ 2, Georgia must prove thatits plan is nonretrogressive under $ 5.

B
Georgia argues that even if compliance with $ 2 does notautomatically result in preclearance under $ 5, its State Senate plan should be precleared because it does not lead to"a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."
Beer v. United States, supra, at 141. See, e. g., Brief for Ap-pellant 32, 36.

While we have never determined the meaning of "effectiveexercise of the electoral franchise," this case requires us to
do so in some detail. First, the United States and the Dis-trict Court correctly acknowledge that in examining whether
the new plan is retrogressive, the inquiry must encompassthe entire statewide plan as a whole. See 195 F. Supp. 2d,
at 73; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. Thus, while the diminution ofa minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise in one or two districts may be sufficient to show a viola-tion of $ 5, it is only sufficient if the covered jurisdiction cannot show that the gains in the plan as a whole offset the lossin a particular district.

Second, any assessment of the retrogression of a minoritygroup's effective exercise of the electoral franchise depends
on an examination of all the relevant circumstances, such asthe ability of minority voters to elect their candidate of
choice, the extent of the minority group's opportunity to par-ticipate in the political process, and the feasibility of creating
a nonretrogressive plan. See, e. g., Johnson v. De Grandy,512 U. S. 997, 1011-1012, 1020-1021 (1994);

Richmond v.

Opinion of the Court
v. Gingles, supra, at 97-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment). "No single statistic provides courts with a

shortcut to determine whether" a voting change retro-gresses from the benchmark.

Johnson v. De Grandy, supra,
at 1020-1021.In assessing the totality of the circumstances, a court

should not focus solely on the comparative ability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice. While this factoris an important one in the $ 5 retrogression inquiry, it cannot

be dispositive or exclusive. The standard in $ 5 is simple--whether the new plan "would lead to a retrogression in the
position of racial minorities with respect to their effective
exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States,
425 U. S., at 141.

The ability of minority voters to elect a candidate of their
choice is important but often complex in practice to determine. In order to maximize the electoral success of a minority group, a State may choose to create a certain number of
"safe" districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice. See
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 48-49; id., at 87-89
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Alternatively, a
State may choose to create a greater number of districts in
which it is likely--although perhaps not quite as likely as
under the benchmark plan--that minority voters will be able
to elect candidates of their choice. See id., at 88-89 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Pildes, Is Voting-Rights
Law Now at War With Itself? Social Science and Voting
Rights in the 2000s, 80 N. C. L. Rev. 1517 (2002).

Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one of
these methods of redistricting over another. Either option
"will present the minority group with its own array of electoral risks and benefits," and presents "hard choices about
what would truly `maximize' minority electoral success."
Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment). On one hand, a smaller number of safe

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

481Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
majority-minority districts may virtually guarantee the election of a minority group's preferred candidate in those districts. Yet even if this concentration of minority voters in
a few districts does not constitute the unlawful packing of
minority voters, see Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 153-
154 (1993), such a plan risks isolating minority voters from
the rest of the State, and risks narrowing political influence
to only a fraction of political districts. Cf. Shaw v. Reno,
509 U. S., at 648-650. And while such districts may result
in more "descriptive representation" because the representatives of choice are more likely to mirror the race of the majority of voters in that district, the representation may be
limited to fewer areas. See H. Pitkin, The Concept of Representation 60-91 (1967).

On the other hand, spreading out minority voters over a
greater number of districts creates more districts in which
minority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. Such a strategy has the potential
to increase "substantive representation" in more districts,
by creating coalitions of voters who together will help to
achieve the electoral aspirations of the minority group. See
id., at 114. It also, however, creates the risk that the minority group's preferred candidate may lose. Yet as we stated
in Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1020:

"[T]here are communities in which minority citizens are
able to form coalitions with voters from other racial and
ethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within a
single district in order to elect candidates of their choice.
Those candidates may not represent perfection to every
minority voter, but minority voters are not immune
from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground, the virtue of which is not to be
slighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics."

482 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT

Opinion of the Court
Section 5 gives States the flexibility to choose one theory ofeffective representation over the other.

In addition to the comparative ability of a minority groupto elect a candidate of its choice, the other highly relevant
factor in a retrogression inquiry is the extent to which a newplan changes the minority group's opportunity to participate
in the political process. " `[T]he power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections.' " Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 99 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) (quoting Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 132(1986)); see also

White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755, 766-767
(1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 149-160 (1971);
Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1011-1012.

Thus, a court must examine whether a new plan adds or
subtracts "influence districts"--where minority voters may
not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a
substantial, if not decisive, role in the electoral process.
Cf. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 947, n. 21 (1996) (Stevens,
J., dissenting); Hays v. Louisiana, 936 F. Supp. 360, 364, n. 17
(WD La. 1996); Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1011-
1012; Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 98-100 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment). In assessing the comparative
weight of these influence districts, it is important to consider
"the likelihood that candidates elected without decisive minority support would be willing to take the minority's interests into account." Id., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment). In fact, various studies have suggested that the
most effective way to maximize minority voting strength
may be to create more influence or coalitional districts. See,
e. g., Lublin, Racial Redistricting and African-American Representation: A Critique of "Do Majority-Minority Districts
Maximize Substantive Black Representation in Congress?"
93 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 183, 185 (1999) (noting that racial redistricting in the early 1990's, which created more majorityminority districts, made Congress "less likely to adopt
initiatives supported by blacks"); Cameron, Epstein, &

Handley, & Lublin, Drawing Effective Minority Districts: AConceptual Framework and Some Empirical Evidence, 79

N. C. L. Rev. 1383 (2001).Section 5 leaves room for States to use these types of influence and coalitional districts. Indeed, the State's choice
ultimately may rest on a political choice of whether substantive or descriptive representation is preferable. See Pitkin,
supra, at 142; Swain, supra, at 5. The State may choose,
consistent with $ 5, that it is better to risk having fewer minority representatives in order to achieve greater overall
representation of a minority group by increasing the number
of representatives sympathetic to the interests of minority
voters. See Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 87-89, 99
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1020.

In addition to influence districts, one other method of assessing the minority group's opportunity to participate in the
political process is to examine the comparative position of
legislative leadership, influence, and power for representatives of the benchmark majority-minority districts. A legislator, no less than a voter, is "not immune from the obligation
to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground."
Ibid. Indeed, in a representative democracy, the very purpose of voting is to delegate to chosen representatives the
power to make and pass laws. The ability to exert more
control over that process is at the core of exercising political
power. A lawmaker with more legislative influence has
more potential to set the agenda, to participate in closeddoor meetings, to negotiate from a stronger position, and to

Opinion of the Court
shake hands on a deal. Maintaining or increasing legislativepositions of power for minority voters' representatives of

choice, while not dispositive by itself, can show the lack ofretrogressive effect under $ 5.

And it is also significant, though not dispositive, whetherthe representatives elected from the very districts created
and protected by the Voting Rights Act support the new
districting plan. The District Court held that the support oflegislators from benchmark majority-minority districts may

show retrogressive purpose, but it is not relevant in assess-ing retrogressive effect. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 89; see also
post, at 503 (Souter, J., dissenting). But we think this evidence is also relevant for retrogressive effect. As the dissent recognizes, the retrogression inquiry asks how "voters
will probably act in the circumstances in which they live."
Post, at 509. The representatives of districts created to ensure continued minority participation in the political process
have some knowledge about how "voters will probably act"
and whether the proposed change will decrease minority voters' effective exercise of the electoral franchise.

The dissent maintains that standards for determining nonretrogression under $ 5 that we announce today create a situation where "[i]t is very hard to see anything left of " $ 5.
Post, at 495. But the dissent ignores that the ability of a
minority group to elect a candidate of choice remains an integral feature in any $ 5 analysis. Cf. Thornburg v. Gingles,
supra, at 98 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). And
the dissent agrees that the addition or subtraction of coalitional districts is relevant to the $ 5 inquiry. See post, at
492, 504. Yet assessing whether a plan with coalitional districts is retrogressive is just as fact-intensive as whether a
plan with both influence and coalitional districts is retrogressive. As Justice Souter recognized for the Court in
the $ 2 context, a court or the Department of Justice should
assess the totality of circumstances in determining retrogression under $ 5. See Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
1020-1021. And it is of course true that evidence of racialpolarization is one of many factors relevant in assessing

whether a minority group is able to elect a candidate ofchoice or to exert a significant influence in a particular district. See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 37; id., at 100-104 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Whitev.
Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973); Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485F. 2d 1297 (CA5 1973) (en banc).

The dissent nevertheless asserts that it "cannot be right"that the $ 5 inquiry goes beyond assessing whether a minority group can elect a candidate of its choice. Post, at 494.But except for the general statement of retrogression in
Beer, the dissent cites no law to support its contention thatretrogression should focus solely on the ability of a minority
group to elect a candidate of choice. As Justice Souterhimself, writing for the Court in

Johnson v. De Grandy,supra, at 1011-1012, has recognized, the "extent of the opportunities minority voters enjoy to participate in the politi-cal processes" is an important factor to consider in assessing
a $ 2 vote-dilution inquiry. See also Thornburg v. Gingles,
supra, at 98-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).In determining how the new districting plan differs from the

benchmark plan, the same standard should apply to $ 5.

C
The District Court failed to consider all the relevant fac-tors when it examined whether Georgia's Senate plan resulted in a retrogression of black voters' effective exerciseof the electoral franchise. First, while the District Court
acknowledged the importance of assessing the statewideplan as a whole, the court focused too narrowly on proposed
Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26. It did not examine the in-creases in the black voting age population that occurred in
many of the other districts. Second, the District Court didnot explore in any meaningful depth any other factor beyond
the comparative ability of black voters in the majority539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
minority districts to elect a candidate of their choice. In
doing so, it paid inadequate attention to the support of legislators representing the benchmark majority-minority districts and the maintenance of the legislative influence of
those representatives.

The District Court correctly recognized that the increase
in districts with a substantial minority of black voters is
an important factor in the retrogression inquiry. See 195
F. Supp. 2d, at 75-78. Nevertheless, it did not adequately
apply this consideration to the facts of this case. The District Court ignored the evidence of numerous other districts
showing an increase in black voting age population, as well
as the other evidence that Georgia decided that a way to
increase black voting strength was to adopt a plan that "unpacked" the high concentration of minority voters in the
majority-minority districts. Its statement that Georgia did
not "presen[t] evidence regarding potential gains in minority
voting strength in Senate Districts other than Districts 2, 12
and 26" is therefore clearly erroneous. Id., at 94. Like the
dissent, we accept the District Court's findings that the reductions in black voting age population in proposed Districts
2, 12, and 26 to just over 50% make it marginally less likely
that minority voters can elect a candidate of their choice in
those districts, although we note that Georgia introduced evidence showing that approximately one-third of white voters
would support a black candidate in those districts, see id., at
66, and that the United States' own expert admitted that the
results of statewide elections in Georgia show that "there
would be a `very good chance' that . . . African American
candidates would win election in the reconstituted districts."
Id., at 71; see also id., at 84-85. Nevertheless, regardless of
any racially polarized voting or diminished opportunity for
black voters to elect a candidate of their choice in proposed
Districts 2, 12, and 26, the District Court's inquiry was too
narrow.

Opinion of the Court
In the face of Georgia's evidence that the Senate plan as awhole is not retrogressive, the United States introduced

nothing apart from the evidence that it would be more diffi-cult for minority voters to elect their candidate of choice in
Districts 2, 12, and 26. As the District Court stated, theUnited States did not introduce any evidence to rebut Georgia's evidence that the increase in black voting age population in the other districts offsets any decrease in black votingage population in the three contested districts: "[T]he United

States' evidence was extremely limited in scope--focusingonly on three contested districts in the State Senate plan."
Id., at 37. Indeed, the District Court noted that the United
States' evidence "was not designed to permit the court to
assess the overall impact" of the Senate plan. Ibid.

Given the evidence submitted in this case, we find that
Georgia likely met its burden of showing nonretrogression.
The increase in black voting age population in the other districts likely offsets any marginal decrease in the black voting
age population in the three districts that the District Court
found retrogressive. Using the overlay of the 2000 census
numbers, Georgia's strategy of "unpacking" minority voters
in some districts to create more influence and coalitional districts is apparent. Under the 2000 census numbers, the
number of majority black voting age population districts
in the new plan increases by one, the number of districts
with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%
increases by two, and the number of districts with a black
voting age population of between 25% and 30% increases by
another 2. See Pl. Exhs. 1D, 2C; see also supra, at 470-471.

Using the census numbers in effect at the time the benchmark plan was enacted to assess the benchmark plan, the
difference is even more striking. Under those figures, the
new plan increases from 10 to 13 the number of districts with
a majority-black voting age population and increases from 8
to 13 the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%. See Pl. Exhs. 1C, 2C. Thus,

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
488 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT

Opinion of the Court
the new plan creates 8 new districts--out of 56--where black
voters as a group can play a substantial or decisive role in
the electoral process. Indeed, under the census figures in
use at the time Georgia enacted its benchmark plan, the
black voting age population in Districts 2, 12, and 26 does
not decrease to the extent indicated by the District Court.
District 2 drops from 59.27% black voting age population to
50.31%. District 26 drops from 53.45% black voting age population to 50.80%. And District 12 actually increases, from
46.50% black voting age population to 50.66%. See Pl. Exhs.
1C, 2C.2 And regardless of any potential retrogression in
some districts, $ 5 permits Georgia to offset the decline in
those districts with an increase in the black voting age population in other districts. The testimony from those who designed the Senate plan confirms what the statistics suggest--that Georgia's goal was to "unpack" the minority
voters from a few districts to increase blacks' effective exer2 The dissent summarily rejects any inquiry into the benchmark plan
using the census numbers in effect at the time the redistricting plan was
passed. See post, at 506. Yet we think it is relevant to examine how the
new plan differs from the benchmark plan as originally enacted by the
legislature. The $ 5 inquiry, after all, revolves around the change from
the previous plan. The 1990 census numbers are far from "irrelevant."
Ibid. Rather, examining the benchmark plan with the census numbers in
effect at the time the State enacted its plan comports with the one-person,
one-vote principle of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), and its progeny. When the decennial census numbers are released, States must redistrict to account for any changes or shifts in population. But before the
new census, States operate under the legal fiction that even 10 years later,
the plans are constitutionally apportioned. After the new enumeration,
no districting plan is likely to be legally enforceable if challenged, given
the shifts and changes in a population over 10 years. And if the State
has not redistricted in response to the new census figures, a federal court
will ensure that the districts comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate before the next election. See, e. g., Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254
(2003); Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U. S. 567 (1997); Growe v.
Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993).

Opinion of the Court
cise of the electoral franchise in more districts. See supra,at 469-471.

Other evidence supports the implausibility of finding ret-rogression here. An examination of black voters' opportunities to participate in the political process shows, if anything,an increase in the effective exercise of the electoral franchise. It certainly does not indicate retrogression. The 34
districts in the proposed plan with a black voting age popula-tion of above 20% consist almost entirely of districts that

have an overall percentage of Democratic votes of above50%. See Pl. Exh. 2D. The one exception is proposed District 4, with a black voting age population of 30.51% and an
overall Democratic percentage of 48.86%. See ibid. These
statistics make it more likely as a matter of fact that black
voters will constitute an effective voting bloc, even if they
cannot always elect the candidate of their choice. See
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). These statistics also buttress the testimony of the designers of the plan such as Senator Brown,
who stated that the goal of the plan was to maintain or increase black voting strength and relatedly to increase the
prospects of Democratic victory. See supra, at 469-470.

The testimony of Congressman John Lewis is not so easily
dismissed. Congressman Lewis is not a member of the
State Senate and thus has less at stake personally in the
outcome of this litigation. Congressman Lewis testified
that "giving real power to black voters comes from the kind
of redistricting efforts the State of Georgia has made," and
that the Senate plan "will give real meaning to voting for
African Americans" because "you have a greater chance of
putting in office people that are going to be responsive." Pl.
Exh. 21, at 21-23. Section 5 gives States the flexibility to
implement the type of plan that Georgia has submitted for
preclearance--a plan that increases the number of districts
with a majority-black voting age population, even if it means
that in some of those districts, minority voters will face a

somewhat reduced opportunity to elect a candidate of theirchoice. Cf.

Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment).The dissent's analysis presumes that we are deciding that

Georgia's Senate plan is not retrogressive. See post, at 501-508. To the contrary, we hold only that the District Court
did not engage in the correct retrogression analysis because
it focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group toelect a candidate of its choice in the majority-minority districts. While the District Court engaged in a thoroughanalysis of the issue, we must remand the case for the District Court to examine the facts using the standard that we
announce today. We leave it for the District Court to determine whether Georgia has indeed met its burden of proof.
The dissent justifies its conclusion here on the ground that
the District Court did not clearly err in its factual determination. But the dissent does not appear to dispute that if
the District Court's legal standard was incorrect, the decision below should be vacated.

The purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral franchise and to
foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1020;
Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S., at 657. As Congressman Lewis
stated: "I think that's what the [civil rights] struggle was all
about, to create what I like to call a truly interracial democracy in the South. In the movement, we would call it creating the beloved community, an all-inclusive community,
where we would be able to forget about race and color and
see people as people, as human beings, just as citizens." Pl.
Exh. 21, at 14. While courts and the Department of Justice
should be vigilant in ensuring that States neither reduce the
effective exercise of the electoral franchise nor discriminate
against minority voters, the Voting Rights Act, as properly
interpreted, should encourage the transition to a society
where race no longer matters: a society where integration

and color-blindness are not just qualities to be proud of, butare simple facts of life. See Shaw v. Reno, supra, at 657.

IV
The District Court is in a better position to reweigh allthe facts in the record in the first instance in light of our

explication of retrogression. The judgment of the DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia, accordingly, is vacated,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
As is evident from the Court's accurate description of thefacts in this case, race was a predominant factor in drawing

the lines of Georgia's State Senate redistricting map. If theCourt's statement of facts had been written as the preface
to consideration of a challenge brought under the Equal Pro-tection Clause or under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
a reader of the opinion would have had sound reason to con-clude that the challenge would succeed. Race cannot be the

of race that would doom a redistricting plan under the Four-teenth Amendment or $ 2 seem to be what save it under $ 5.

I agree that our decisions controlling the $ 5 analysis re-quire the Court's ruling here. See,

in a case where that issue is raised, it should be confronted.There is a fundamental flaw, I should think, in any scheme
in which the Department of Justice is permitted or directedto encourage or ratify a course of unconstitutional conduct in
order to find compliance with a statutory directive. Thisserious issue has not been raised here, and, as already ob539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

I agree with the Court that reducing the number ofmajority-minority districts within a State would not necessarily amount to retrogression barring preclearance under$ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. See ante, at 480-482.
The prudential objective of $ 5 is hardly betrayed if a Statecan show that a new districting plan shifts from supermajority districts, in which minorities can elect their candidates ofchoice by their own voting power, to coalition districts, in
which minorities are in fact shown to have a similar opportu-nity when joined by predictably supportive nonminority voters. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1020 (1994)(explaining in the context of $ 2 that although "society's racial and ethnic cleavages sometimes necessitate majority-minority districts to ensure equal political and electoral opportunity, that should not obscure the fact that there arecommunities in which minority citizens are able to form coalitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups, hav-ing no need to be a majority within a single district in order
to elect candidates of their choice").Before a State shifts from majority-minority to coalition
districts, however, the State bears the burden of provingthat nonminority voters will reliably vote along with the minority. See, e. g., Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520

U. S. 471, 478 (1997). It must show not merely that minorityvoters in new districts may have some influence, but that

minority voters will have effective influence translatable intoprobable election results comparable to what they enjoyed
under the existing district scheme. And to demonstratethis, a State must do more than produce reports of minority
voting age percentages; it must show that the probable vot-ing behavior of nonminority voters will make coalitions with
minorities a real prospect. See, e. g., Pildes, Is Voting-Rights Law Now at War With Itself? Social Science and Voting Rights in the 2000s, 80 N. C. L. Rev. 1517, 1539 (2002).If the State's evidence fails to convince a factfinder that high
racial polarization in voting is unlikely, or that high whitecrossover voting is likely, or that other political and demographic facts point to probable minority effectiveness, a re-duction in supermajority districts must be treated as potentially and fatally retrogressive, the burden of persuasionalways being on the State.

The District Court majority perfectly well understood allthis and committed no error. Error enters this case here in
this Court, whose majority unmoors $ 5 from any practi-cal and administrable conception of minority influence that
would rule out retrogression in a transition from majority-minority districts, and mistakes the significance of the evidence supporting the District Court's decision.

II
The Court goes beyond recognizing the possibility of coali-tion districts as nonretrogressive alternatives to those with

majorities of minority voters when it redefines effective vot-ing power in $ 5 analysis without the anchoring reference to
electing a candidate of choice. It does this by alternativelysuggesting that a potentially retrogressive redistricting plan
could satisfy $ 5 if a sufficient number of so-called "influencedistricts," in addition to "coalitio[n] districts," were created,
ante, at 483, 484, or if the new plan provided minority groups

Souter, J., dissenting
with an opportunity to elect a particularly powerful candi-date, ante, at 483-484. On either alternative, the $ 5 requirement that voting changes be nonretrogressive is sub-stantially diminished and left practically unadministrable.

A
The Court holds that a State can carry its burden to showa nonretrogressive degree of minority "influence" by demonstrating that " `candidates elected without decisive minoritysupport would be willing to take the minority's interests into
account.' " Ante, at 482 (quoting Thornburg v. Gingles, 478U. S. 30, 100 (1986) (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment)).But this cannot be right.

The history of $ 5 demonstrates that it addresses changesin state law intended to perpetuate the exclusion of minority voters from the exercise of political power. When thisCourt held that a State must show that any change in voting
procedure is free of retrogression it meant that changes mustnot leave minority voters with less chance to be effective in
electing preferred candidates than they were before thechange. "[T]he purpose of $ 5 has always been to insure that
no voting-procedure changes would be made that would leadto a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with
respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."
Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976); see, e. g.,id., at 140-141 ("Section 5 was intended `to insure that [the

gains thus far achieved in minority political participation]shall not be destroyed through new [discriminatory] procedures and techniques' " (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-295, p. 19(1975))). In addressing the burden to show no retrogression, therefore, "influence" must mean an opportunity to ex-ercise power effectively.

The Court, however, says that influence may be adequateto avoid retrogression from majority-minority districts when
it consists not of decisive minority voting power but of senti-ment on the part of politicians: influence may be sufficient

Souter, J., dissenting
when it reflects a willingness on the part of politicians toconsider the interests of minority voters, even when they do

not need the minority votes to be elected. The Court holds,in other words, that there would be no retrogression when
the power of a voting majority of minority voters is elimi-nated, so long as elected politicians can be expected to give
some consideration to minority interests.

The power to elect a candidate of choice has been forgot-ten; voting power has been forgotten. It is very hard to see

anything left of the standard of nonretrogression, and it isno surprise that the Court's cited precedential support for
this reconception, see ante, at 482, consists of a footnote from
a dissenting opinion in Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899 (1996),
and footnote dictum in a case from the Western District of
Louisiana.

Indeed, to see the trouble ahead, one need only ask how on
the Court's new understanding, state legislators or federal
preclearance reviewers under $ 5 are supposed to identify or
measure the degree of influence necessary to avoid the retrogression the Court nominally retains as the $ 5 touchstone.
Is the test purely ad hominem, looking merely to the apparent sentiments of incumbents who might run in the new districts? Would it be enough for a State to show that an
incumbent had previously promised to consider minority interests before voting on legislative measures? Whatever
one looks to, however, how does one put a value on influence
that falls short of decisive influence through coalition? Nondecisive influence is worth less than majority-minority control, but how much less? Would two influence districts offset the loss of one majority-minority district? Would it take
three? Or four? The Court gives no guidance for measuring influence that falls short of the voting strength of a coalition member, let alone a majority of minority voters. Nor
do I see how the Court could possibly give any such guidance. The Court's "influence" is simply not functional in the
political and judicial worlds.

B
Identical problems of comparability and administrabilitycount at least as much against the Court's further gloss on

nonretrogression, in its novel holding that a State may tradeoff minority voters' ability to elect a candidate of their choice
against their ability to exert some undefined degree of influ-ence over a candidate likely to occupy a position of official
legislative power. See ante, at 483-484. The Court impliesthat one majority-minority district in which minority voters
could elect a legislative leader could replace a larger num-ber of majority-minority districts with ordinary candidates,
without retrogression of overall minority voting strength.Under this approach to $ 5, a State may value minority votes
in a district in which a potential committee chairman mightbe elected differently from minority votes in a district with
ordinary candidates.It is impossible to believe that Congress could ever have
imagined $ 5 preclearance actually turning on any such dis-tinctions. In any event, if the Court is going to allow a
State to weigh minority votes by the ambitiousness of candi-dates the votes might be cast for, it is hard to see any stopping point. I suppose the Court would not go so far as togive extra points to an incumbent with the charisma to attract a legislative following, but would it value all commit-tee chairmen equally? (The committee chairmen certainly
would not.) And what about a legislator with a network ofinfluence that has made him a proven dealmaker? Thus,
again, the problem of measurement: is a shift from 10majority-minority districts to 8 offset by a good chance that
1 of the 8 may elect a new Speaker of the House?I do not fault the Court for having no answers to these
questions, for there are no answers of any use under $ 5.The fault is more fundamental, and the very fact that the
Court's interpretation of nonretrogression under $ 5 invitesunanswerable questions points to the error of a $ 5 preclearance regime that defies reviewable administration. We are

left with little hope of determining practically whether a dis-tricting shift to one party's overall political advantage can be

expected to offset a loss of majority-minority voting power inparticular districts; there will simply be greater opportunity
to reduce minority voting strength in the guise of obtainingparty advantage.

One is left to ask who will suffer most from the Court'snew and unquantifiable standard. If it should turn out that
an actual, serious burden of persuasion remains on theStates, States that rely on the new theory of influence should
be guaranteed losers: nonretrogression cannot be demon-strated by districts with minority influence too amorphous
for objective comparison. But that outcome is unlikely, andif in subsequent cases the Court allows the State's burden to
be satisfied on the pretense that unquantifiable influence canbe equated with majority-minority power, $ 5 will simply
drop out as a safeguard against the "unremitting and inge-nious defiance of the Constitution" that required the procedure of preclearance in the first place. South Carolina v.Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966).

III
The District Court never reached the question the Courtaddresses, of what kind of influence districts (coalition or not)

might demonstrate that a decrease in majority-minority dis-tricts was not retrogressive. It did not reach this question
because it found that the State had not satisfied its burdenof persuasion on an issue that should be crucial on any administrable theory: 1 the State had not shown the possibility

of actual coalitions in the affected districts that would allowany retreat from majority-minority districts without a retrogressive effect. This central evidentiary finding is invulner-able under the correct standard of review.

This Court's review of the District Court's factual findingsis for clear error. See, e. g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900,
917 (1995); Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462,469 (1987);

McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, 258 (1984); Cityof Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 136 (1983). We

have no business disturbing the District Court's ruling "sim-ply because we would have decided the case differently," but
only if based "on the entire evidence, [we are] left with thedefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 242 (2001) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted). It is not, then, up to us to

" `Unpacking' African American districts may have posi-tive or negative consequences for the statewide electoral

strength of African American voters. To the extentthat voting patterns suggest that minority voters are in
a better position to join forces with other segments ofthe population to elect minority preferred candidates, a
decrease in a district's BVAP may have little or no effecton minority voting strength." 195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 76
(DC 2002).
See id., at 78 ("[T]he Voting Rights Act allows states toadopt plans that move minorities out of districts in which

they formerly constituted a majority of the voting population, provided that racial divisions have healed to the pointthat numerical reductions will not necessarily translate into

The District Court recognized that the key to understand-ing the impact of drops in a district's BVAP on the minority

group's "effective exercise of the electoral franchise," Beer,425 U. S., at 141, is the level of racial polarization. If racial
elements consistently vote in separate blocs, decreasing theproportion of black voters will generally reduce the chance
that the minority group's favored candidate will be elected;whereas in districts with low racial bloc voting or significant
white crossover voting, a decrease in the black proportion
may have no effect at all on the minority's opportunity toelect their candidate of choice. See,

e. g., 195 F. Supp. 2d, at

or not the decreases in BVAP and African American voterregistration in those districts are likely to produce retrogressive effects").This indisputable recognition, that context determines the
effect of decreasing minority numbers for purposes of the $ 5enquiry, points to the nub of this case, and the District
Court's decision boils down to a judgment about what theevidence showed about that context. The District Court
found that the United States had offered evidence of racialpolarization in the contested districts,

3 id., at 86, and it found

that Georgia had failed to present anything relevant on thatissue. Georgia, the District Court said, had "provided the

court with no competent, comprehensive information regard-ing white crossover voting or levels of polarization in individual districts across the State." Id., at 88. In particular, theDistrict Court found it "impossible to extrapolate" anything
about the level of racial polarization from the statistical sub-missions of Georgia's lone expert witness.

Id., at 85. Andthe panel majority took note that Georgia's expert "admitted

on cross-examination" that his evidence simply did not ad-dress racial polarization: "the whole point of my analysis,"
the expert stated, "is not to look at polarization per se. Thequestion is not whether or not blacks and whites in general
vote for different candidates." Ibid. (internal quotationmarks omitted).

Accordingly, the District Court explained that Georgia'sexpert:

3 The majority cites the District Court's comment that " `the United
States' evidence was extremely limited in scope--focusing only on three
contested districts in the State Senate plan.' " Ante, at 474 (quoting 195
F. Supp. 2d, at 37). The District Court correctly did not require the
United States to prove that the plan was retrogressive. As the District
Court explained: "[u]ltimately, the burden of proof in this matter lies with
the State. We look to the State to explain why retrogression is not present, and to prove the absence of racially polarized voting that might diminish African American voting strength in light of several districts' decreased BVAPs." Id., at 86.

"made no attempt to address the central issue beforethe court: whether the State's proposal is retrogressive.

He failed even to identify the decreases in BVAP thatwould occur under the proposed plan, and certainly did
not identify corresponding reductions in the electabilityof African American candidates of choice. The paucity
of information in [the expert's] report thus leaves us un-able to use his analysis to assess the expected change in
African American voting strength statewide that will bebrought by the proposed Senate plan."

Id., at 81.

B
How is it, then, that the majority of this Court speaks of"Georgia's evidence that the Senate plan as a whole is not

retrogressive," against which "the United States did not in-troduce any evidence [in] rebut[tal],"

ante, at 487? The an-swer is that the Court is not engaging in review for clear

error. Instead, it is reweighing evidence de novo, discover-ing what it thinks the District Court overlooked, and drawing evidentiary conclusions the District Court supposedly didnot see. The Court is mistaken on all points.

1
Implicitly recognizing that evidence of voting behavior bymajority voters is crucial to any showing of nonretrogression

when minority numbers drop under a proposed plan, theCourt tries to find evidence to fill the record's gap. It says,
for example, that "Georgia introduced evidence showing thatapproximately one-third of white voters would support a
black candidate in [the contested] districts." Ante, at 486.In support of this claim, however, the majority focuses on
testimony offered by Georgia's expert relating to crossovervoting in the pre-existing rather than proposed districts.
195 F. Supp. 2d, at 66. The District Court specifically notedthat the expert did not calculate crossover voting under the
proposed plan. Id., at 65, n. 31 ("The court also emphasizes

that Epstein did not attempt to rely on the table's calcu-lations to demonstrate voting patterns in the districts, and

calculated crossover in the existing, and not the proposed,Senate districts"). Indeed, in relying on this evidence the
majority attributes a significance to it that Georgia's ownexpert disclaimed, as the District Court pointed out. See
id., at 85 ("[I]t is impossible to extrapolate these voting pat-terns from Epstein's database. As Epstein admitted on
cross-examination: the whole point of my analysis is not tolook at polarization per se. The question is not whether or
not blacks and whites in general vote for different candi-dates" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

2
In another effort to revise the record, the Court faults theDistrict Court, alleging that it "focused too narrowly on proposed Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26." Ante, at 485. In fact,however, it is Georgia that asked the District Court to consider only the contested districts, and the District Court ex-plicitly refused to limit its review in any such fashion: "we
reject the State's argument that this court's review is limitedonly to those districts challenged by the United States,
and should not encompass the redistricting plans in theirentirety. . . . [T]he court's review necessarily extends to the
entire proposed plan." 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 73. The DistrictCourt explained that it "is vested with the final authority to
approve or disapprove the proposed change as a whole."Ibid. "The question before us is whether the proposed Senate plan as a whole, has the `purpose or effect of denying orabridging the right to vote on account of race or color.' "
Id., at 103 (Oberdorfer, J., concurring in part and dissentingin part) (quoting 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c). Though the majority
asserts that "[t]he District Court ignored the evidence of nu-merous other districts showing an increase in black voting
age population," ante, at 486, the District Court, in fact, spe-cifically considered the parties' dispute over the statewide

impact of the change in black voting age population. See,e. g., 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 93 ("The number of Senate Districts

with majorities of BVAP would, according to Georgia's calcu-lations, increase from twelve to thirteen; according to the
Attorney General's interpretation of the census data, thenumber would decrease from twelve to eleven").

3
In a further try to improve the record, the Court focuseson the testimony of certain lay witnesses, politicians presented by the State to support its claim that the Senate planis not retrogressive. Georgia, indeed, relied heavily on the
near unanimity of minority legislators' support for the plan.But the District Court did not overlook this evidence; it
simply found it inadequate to carry the State's burden ofshowing nonretrogression. The District Court majority explained that the "legislators' support is, in the end, far moreprobative of a lack of retrogressive

purpose than of an ab-sence of retrogressive effect." Id., at 89 (emphasis in original). As against the politicians' testimony, the DistrictCourt had contrary "credible," id., at 88, evidence of retrogressive effect. This evidence was the testimony of the ex-pert witness presented by the United States, which "suggests the existence of highly racially polarized voting in theproposed districts,"

ibid., evidence of retrogressive effect towhich Georgia offered "no competent" response, ibid. The

District Court was clearly within bounds in finding that(1) Georgia's proposed plan decreased BVAP in the relevant
districts, (2) the United States offered evidence of significantracial polarization in those districts, and (3) Georgia offered
no adequate response to this evidence.The reasonableness of the District Court's treatment of
the evidence is underscored in its concluding reflection thatit was possible Georgia could have shown the plan to be nonretrogressive, but the evidence the State had actually of-fered simply failed to do that. "There are, without doubt,

539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
numerous other ways, given the limited evidence of raciallypolarized voting in State Senate and local elections, that

Georgia could have met its burden of proof in this case. Yet,the court is limited to reviewing the evidence presented by
the parties, and is compelled to hold that the State has notmet its burden." Id., at 94. "[T]he lack of positive racial
polarization data was the gap at the center of the State'scase [and] the evidence presented by [the] estimable [legislators] does not come close to filling that void." Id., at 100.As must be plain, in overturning the District Court's
thoughtful consideration of the evidence before it, the major-ity of this Court is simply rejecting the District Court's evidentiary finding in favor of its own. It is reweighing testi-mony and making judgments about the competence, interest,
and character of witnesses. The Court is not conductingclear error review.

4
Next, the Court attempts to fill the holes in the State'sevidence on retrogression by drawing inferences favorable to

the State from undisputed statistics. See ante, at 487-489.This exercise comes no closer to demonstrating clear error
than the others considered so far.In the first place, the District Court has already explained
the futility of the Court's effort. Knowing whether thenumber of majority BVAP districts increases, decreases, or
stays the same under a proposed plan does not alone allowany firm conclusion that minorities will have a better, or
worse, or unvarying opportunity to elect their candidates ofchoice. Any such inference must depend not only on trends
in BVAP levels, but on evidence of likely voter turnoutamong minority and majority groups, patterns of racial bloc
voting, likelihood of white crossover voting, and so on.4 In4 The fact that the Court premises its analysis on BVAP alone is ironic
given that the Court, incorrectly, chastises the District Court for committing the very error the Court now engages in, "fail[ing] to consider all the
relevant factors." Ante, at 485.

deed, the core holding of the Court today, with which I agree,
that nonretrogression does not necessarily require maintenance of existing supermajority minority districts, turns on
this very point; comparing the number of majority-minority
districts under existing and proposed plans does not alone
reliably indicate whether the new plan is retrogressive.

Lack of contextual evidence is not, however, the only flaw
in the Court's numerical arguments. Thus, in its first example, ante, at 487, the Court points out that under the proposed plan the number of districts with majority BVAP increases by one over the existing plan,5 but the Court does
not mention that the number of districts with BVAP levels
over 55% decreases by four. See Record, Doc. No. 148, Pl.
Exhs. 1D, 2C. Similarly, the Court points to an increase of
two in districts with BVAP in the 30% to 50% range, along
with a further increase of two in the 25% to 30% range.
Ante, at 487. It fails to mention, however, that Georgia's
own expert argued that 44.3% was the critical threshold for
BVAP levels, 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 107, and the data on which
the Court relies shows the number of districts with BVAP
over 40% actually decreasing by one, see Record, Doc.
No. 148, Pl. Exhs. 1D, 2C. My point is not that these figures
conclusively demonstrate retrogression; I mean to say only
that percentages tell us nothing in isolation, and that without
contextual evidence the raw facts about population levels fail
to get close to indicating that the State carried its burden to
show no retrogression. They do not come close to showing
clear error.

5 Though the Court does not acknowledge it in its discussion of why
"Georgia likely met its burden," ante, at 487, even this claim was disputed.
As the District Court explained: "[t]he number of Senate Districts with
majorities of BVAP would, according to Georgia's calculations, increase
from twelve to thirteen; according to the Attorney General's interpretation of the census data, the number would decrease from twelve to eleven."

Nor could error, clear or otherwise, be shown by the
Court's comparison of the proposed plan with the description
of the State and its districts provided by the 1990 census.
Ante, at 487-489. The 1990 census is irrelevant. We have
the 2000 census, and precedent confirms in no uncertain
terms that the issue for $ 5 purposes is not whether Georgia's
proposed plan would have had a retrogressive effect 13 years
ago: the question is whether the proposed plan would be retrogressive now. See, e. g., Reno v. Bossier Parish School
Bd., 528 U. S. 320, 334 (2000) (Under $ 5 "the baseline is the
status quo that is proposed to be changed"); Holder v. Hall,
512 U. S. 874, 883 (1994) (plurality opinion) (Under $ 5, "[t]he
baseline for comparison is present by definition; it is the existing status"); City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S.,
at 132 ("The proper comparison is between the new system
and the system actually in effect"); Cf. 28 CFR $ 51.54(b)(2)
(2002) (when determining if a change is retrogressive under

$ 5 "[t]he Attorney General will make the comparison based
on the conditions existing at the time of the submission").
The Court's assumption that a proper $ 5 analysis may proceed on the basis of obsolete data from a superseded census
is thus as puzzling as it is unprecedented. It is also an invitation to perverse results, for if a State could carry its burden under $ 5 merely by showing no retrogression from the
state of affairs 13 years ago, it could demand preclearance for
a plan flatly diminishing minority voting strength under $ 5.6

6 For example, if a covered jurisdiction had two majority-minority districts in 1990, but rapidly changing demography had produced two more
during the ensuing decade, a new redistricting plan, setting the number
of majority-minority districts at three would conclusively rule out retrogression on the Court's calculus. This would be the case even when voting behavior showed that nothing short of four majority-minority districts
would preserve the status quo as of 2000.

The Court's final effort to demonstrate that Georgia's planis nonretrogressive focuses on statistics about Georgia Democrats. Ante, at 489. The Court explains that almost allthe districts in the proposed plan with a BVAP above 20%
have a likely overall Democratic performance above 50%, andfrom this the Court concludes that "[t]hese statistics make it
more likely as a matter of fact that black voters will consti-tute an effective voting bloc."

Ibid. But this is not so.The degree to which the statistics could support any judgment about the effect of black voting in State Senate elec-tions is doubtful, and even on the Court's assumptions the
statistics show no clear error by the District Court.As for doubt about what the numbers have to do with
State Senate elections, it is enough to know that the majori-ty's figures are taken from a table describing Democratic voting in statewide, not local, elections. The Court offers nobasis for assuming that voting for Democratic candidates in
statewide elections correlates with voting behavior in localelections,

7 and in fact, the record points to different, not identical, voting patterns. The District Court specifically notedthat the United States's expert testified that "African American candidates consistently received less crossover voting inlocal election[s] than in statewide elections," 195 F. Supp. 2d,
at 71, and the court concluded that there is "compelling evi-dence that racial voting patterns in State Senate races can
be expected to differ from racial voting patterns in statewideraces," id., at 85-86.

7 Even if the majority wanted to rely on these figures to make a claim
about Democratic voting in statewide elections, the predictors' significance
is utterly unclear. The majority pulls its figures from an exhibit titled,
"Political Data Report," and a column labeled, "%OVER DEMVOTES,"
Pl. Exh. 2D. See ante, at 489. The document provides no information
regarding whether the numbers in the column reflect an average of past
performance, a prediction for future performance, or something else
altogether.

508 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT

Souter, J., dissenting
But even if we assume the data on Democratic votingstatewide can tell us something useful about Democratic voting in State Senate districts, the Court's argument does nothold up. It proceeds from the faulty premise that even with
a low BVAP, if enough of the district is Democratic, the mi-nority Democrats will necessarily have an effect on which
candidates are elected. But if the proportion of nonminorityDemocrats is high enough, the minority group may well have
no impact whatever on which Democratic candidate is se-lected to run and ultimately elected. In districts, say, with
20% minority voters (all of them Democrats) and 51% nonmi-nority Democrats, the Democratic candidate has no obvious
need to take the interests of the minority group into account;if everybody votes (or the proportion of stay-at-homes is constant throughout the electorate) the Democrat can win thegeneral election without minority support. Even in a situation where a Democratic candidate needs a substantial frac-tion of minority voters to win (say the population is 25%
minority and 30% nonminority Democrats), the Democraticcandidate may still be able to ignore minority interests if
there is such ideological polarization as between the majorparties that the Republican candidate is entirely unresponsive to minority interests. In that situation, a minoritybloc would presumably still prefer the Democrat, who would
not need to adjust any political positions to get the minor-ity vote.

All of this reasoning, of course, carries a whiff of the lamp.I do not know how Georgia's voters will actually behave if
the percentage of something is x, or maybe y, any more thanthe Court does. We are arguing about numerical abstractions, and my sole point is that the Court's abstract argu-ments do not hold up. Much less do they prove the District
Court wrong. IV

Section 5, after all, was not enacted to address abstrac-tions. It was enacted "to shift the advantage of time and

justifies $ 5's "uncommon exercise of congressional power."
South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 334-335. Sec-tion 5 can only be addressed, and the burden to prove no

retrogression can only be carried, with evidence of how par-ticular populations of voters will probably act in the circumstances in which they live. The State has the burden toconvince on the basis of such evidence. The District Court
considered such evidence: it received testimony, decidedwhat it was worth, and concluded as the trier of fact that the
State had failed to carry its burden. There was no error,and I respectfully dissent.

WIGGINS v. SMITH, WARDEN, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 02-311. Argued March 24, 2003--Decided June 26, 2003
In 1989, petitioner Wiggins was convicted of capital murder by a Maryland

judge and subsequently elected to be sentenced by a jury. His public
defenders, Schlaich and Nethercott, moved to bifurcate the sentencing,
representing that they planned to prove that Wiggins did not kill the
victim by his own hand and then, if necessary, to present a mitigation
case. The court denied the motion. At sentencing, Nethercott told the
jury in her opening statement that they would hear, among other things,
about Wiggins' difficult life, but such evidence was never introduced.
Before closing arguments and outside the presence of the jury, Schlaich
made a proffer to the court to preserve the bifurcation issue for appeal,
detailing the mitigation case counsel would have presented. Schlaich
never mentioned Wiggins' life history or family background. The jury
sentenced Wiggins to death, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed. Represented by new counsel, Wiggins sought postconviction
relief, arguing that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance
by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his dysfunctional background. He presented expert testimony by a forensic social
worker about the severe physical and sexual abuse he had suffered at
the hands of his mother and while under the care of a series of foster
parents. Schlaich testified that he did not remember retaining a forensic social worker to prepare a social history before sentencing, even
though state funds were available for that purpose, and explained that
he and Nethercott had decided to focus on retrying the factual case and
disputing Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. The trial court
denied the petition, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding
that trial counsel had made a reasoned choice to proceed with what
they considered their best defense. Subsequently, the Federal District
Court granted Wiggins relief on his federal habeas petition, holding that
the Maryland courts' rejection of his ineffective assistance claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
In reversing, the Fourth Circuit found trial counsel's strategic decision
to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility to be reasonable.

Held: The performance of Wiggins' attorneys at sentencing violated his

Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Pp. 519-538.

(a) A federal writ can be granted only if a state court decision "was
contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established" precedents of this Court. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). This "unreasonable application" prong permits the writ to be granted when a state
court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably
applies it to the facts of a petitioner's case. Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 362, 413. For this standard to be satisfied, the state court decision
must have been "objectively unreasonable," id., at 409, not just incorrect
or erroneous. An ineffective assistance claim has two components: A
petitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient, and that
the deficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668, 687. Performance is deficient if it falls below an objective
standard of reasonableness, which is defined in terms of prevailing professional norms. Id., at 688. Here, as in Strickland, counsel claim that
their limited investigation into petitioner's background reflected a tactical judgment not to present mitigating evidence and to pursue an alternative strategy instead. In evaluating petitioner's claim, this Court's
principal concern is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but whether the investigation supporting their decision not to
introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' background was itself reasonable. The Court thus conducts an objective review of their performance, measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,
including a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct
as seen from counsel's perspective at the time of that conduct. Id., at
688, 689. Pp. 519-523.

(b) Counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation. Their decision not to expand their investigation beyond a presentence investigation (PSI) report and Baltimore City Department of Social Services
(DSS) records fell short of the professional standards prevailing in
Maryland in 1989. Standard practice in Maryland capital cases at that
time included the preparation of a social history report. Although
there were funds to retain a forensic social worker, counsel chose not to
commission a report. Their conduct similarly fell short of the American
Bar Association's capital defense work standards. Moreover, in light of
the facts counsel discovered in the DSS records concerning Wiggins'
alcoholic mother and his problems in foster care, counsel's decision to
cease investigating when they did was unreasonable. Any reasonably
competent attorney would have realized that pursuing such leads was
necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses, particularly given the apparent absence of aggravating factors from Wiggins'
background. Indeed, counsel discovered no evidence to suggest that
a mitigation case would have been counterproductive or that further
investigation would have been fruitless, thus distinguishing this case

512 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Syllabus
from precedents in which this Court has found limited investigations
into mitigating evidence to be reasonable. The record of the sentencing
proceedings underscores the unreasonableness of counsel's conduct by
suggesting that their failure to investigate thoroughly stemmed from
inattention, not strategic judgment. Until the trial court denied their
bifurcation motion, they had had every reason to develop the most powerful mitigation case possible. During the sentencing process itself,
counsel did not focus exclusively on Wiggins' direct responsibility for
the murder; rather they put on a halfhearted mitigation case instead.
The Maryland Court of Appeals' assumption that counsel's investigation
was adequate reflected an unreasonable application of Strickland. In
deferring to counsel's decision not to present every conceivable mitigation defense despite the fact that counsel based their alleged choice on
an inadequate investigation, the Maryland Court of Appeals further unreasonably applied Strickland. And the court's conclusion that the social services records revealed incidences of sexual abuse, when they in
fact did not, reflects "an unreasonable determination of the facts in light
of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding," 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d)(2). Contrary to the State's and the United States' contention,
the record as a whole does not support the conclusion that counsel conducted a more thorough investigation than the one this Court describes.
Ultimately, this Court's conclusion that counsel's investigation was inadequate does not mean that Strickland requires counsel to investigate
every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely
the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing. Nor does
Strickland require counsel to present such evidence at sentencing in
every case. Rather, the conclusion is based on the much more limited
principle that "strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable" only to the extent that "reasonable professional
judgments support the limitations on investigation." Strickland,
supra, at 690-691. Pp. 523-534.

(c) Counsel's failures prejudiced Wiggins' defense. To establish prejudice, a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,
but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the proceeding's result would
have been different. Strickland, supra, at 694. This Court assesses
prejudice by reweighing the aggravating evidence against the totality
of the mitigating evidence adduced both at trial and in the habeas proceedings. Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 397-398. The mitigating evidence counsel failed to discover and present here is powerful. Wiggins
experienced severe privation and abuse while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother and physical torment, sexual molestation, and
repeated rape while in foster care. His time spent homeless and his
diminished mental capacities further augment his mitigation case. He

thus has the kind of troubled history relevant to assessing a defendant's
moral culpability. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319. Given the
nature and extent of the abuse, there is a reasonable probability that a
competent attorney, aware of this history, would have introduced it at
sentencing, and that a jury confronted with such mitigating evidence
would have returned with a different sentence. The only significant
mitigating factor the jury heard was that Wiggins had no prior convictions. Had it been able to place his excruciating life history on the
mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability that at
least one juror would have struck a different balance. Wiggins had no
record of violent conduct that the State could have introduced to offset
this powerful mitigating narrative. Thus, the available mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, might well have influenced the jury's appraisal
of his moral culpability. Pp. 534-538.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner, Kevin Wiggins, argues that his attorneys' fail-ure to investigate his background and present mitigating evidence of his unfortunate life history at his capital sentencingproceedings violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
In this case, we consider whether the United States Courtof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in upholding the
Maryland Court of Appeals' rejection of this claim.

for the crime on October 20, 1988, and later filed a notice ofintention to seek the death penalty. Two Baltimore County
public defenders, Carl Schlaich and Michelle Nethercott, as-sumed responsibility for Wiggins' case. In July 1989, petitioner elected to be tried before a judge in Baltimore County

Opinion of the Court
Circuit Court. Ibid. On August 4, after a 4-day trial, thecourt found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder, robbery,

and two counts of theft. App. 32.After his conviction, Wiggins elected to be sentenced by a
jury, and the trial court scheduled the proceedings to beginon October 11, 1989. On September 11, counsel filed a motion for bifurcation of sentencing in hopes of presenting Wiggins' case in two phases. Id., at 34. Counsel intended firstto prove that Wiggins did not act as a "principal in the first

degree," ibid.--i. e., that he did not kill the victim by his ownhand. See Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 413 (1996) (requiring
proof of direct responsibility for death eligibility). Counsel
then intended, if necessary, to present a mitigation case. In
the memorandum in support of their motion, counsel argued
that bifurcation would enable them to present each case in
its best light; separating the two cases would prevent the
introduction of mitigating evidence from diluting their claim
that Wiggins was not directly responsible for the murder.
App. 36-42, 37.

On October 12, the court denied the bifurcation motion,
and sentencing proceedings commenced immediately thereafter. In her opening statement, Nethercott told the jurors
they would hear evidence suggesting that someone other
than Wiggins actually killed Lacs. Id., at 70-71. Counsel
then explained that the judge would instruct them to weigh
Wiggins' clean record as a factor against a death sentence.
She concluded: " `You're going to hear that Kevin Wiggins
has had a difficult life. It has not been easy for him. But
he's worked. He's tried to be a productive citizen, and he's
reached the age of 27 with no convictions for prior crimes of
violence and no convictions, period. . . . I think that's an
important thing for you to consider.' " Id., at 72. During
the proceedings themselves, however, counsel introduced no
evidence of Wiggins' life history.

Before closing arguments, Schlaich made a proffer to the
court, outside the presence of the jury, to preserve bifurca539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion as an issue for appeal. He detailed the mitigation casecounsel would have presented had the court granted their

bifurcation motion. He explained that they would have in-troduced psychological reports and expert testimony demonstrating Wiggins' limited intellectual capacities and childlikeemotional state on the one hand, and the absence of aggressive patterns in his behavior, his capacity for empathy, andhis desire to function in the world on the other. See

id., at349-351. At no point did Schlaich proffer any evidence of

petitioner's life history or family background. On October18, the court instructed the jury on the sentencing task before it, and later that afternoon, the jury returned with asentence of death. Id., at 409-410. A divided Maryland
Court of Appeals affirmed. Wiggins v. State, 324 Md. 551,597 A. 2d 1359 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 1007 (1992).

In 1993, Wiggins sought postconviction relief in BaltimoreCounty Circuit Court. With new counsel, he challenged the

adequacy of his representation at sentencing, arguing thathis attorneys had rendered constitutionally defective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evi-dence of his dysfunctional background. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 132a. To support his claim, petitioner presented testi-mony by Hans Selvog, a licensed social worker certified as
an expert by the court. App. 419. Selvog testified con-cerning an elaborate social history report he had prepared
containing evidence of the severe physical and sexual abusepetitioner suffered at the hands of his mother and while in
the care of a series of foster parents. Relying on state socialservices, medical, and school records, as well as interviews
with petitioner and numerous family members, Selvog chron-icled petitioner's bleak life history. App. to Pet. for Cert.
163a.According to Selvog's report, petitioner's mother, a chronic
alcoholic, frequently left Wiggins and his siblings home alone

Opinion of the Court
for days, forcing them to beg for food and to eat paint chipsand garbage.

Id., at 166a-167a. Mrs. Wiggins' abusive behavior included beating the children for breaking into thekitchen, which she often kept locked. She had sex with men

while her children slept in the same bed and, on one occasion,forced petitioner's hand against a hot stove burner--an incident that led to petitioner's hospitalization. Id., at 167a-
171a. At the age of six, the State placed Wiggins in fostercare. Petitioner's first and second foster mothers abused

him physically, id., at 175a-176a, and, as petitioner explainedto Selvog, the father in his second foster home repeatedly
molested and raped him. Id., at 176a-179a. At age 16,
petitioner ran away from his foster home and began living
on the streets. He returned intermittently to additional foster homes, including one in which the foster mother's sons
allegedly gang-raped him on more than one occasion. Id.,
at 190a. After leaving the foster care system, Wiggins
entered a Job Corps program and was allegedly sexually
abused by his supervisor. Id., at 192a.

During the postconviction proceedings, Schlaich testified
that he did not remember retaining a forensic social worker
to prepare a social history, even though the State made funds
available for that purpose. App. 487-488. He explained
that he and Nethercott, well in advance of trial, decided to
focus their efforts on " `retry[ing] the factual case' " and disputing Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. Id., at
485-486. In April 1994, at the close of the proceedings, the
judge observed from the bench that he could not remember
a capital case in which counsel had not compiled a social history of the defendant, explaining, " `[n]ot to do a social history, at least to see what you have got, to me is absolute
error. I just--I would be flabbergasted if the Court of Appeals said anything else.' " Id., at 605. In October 1997,
however, the trial court denied Wiggins' petition for postconviction relief. The court concluded that "when the decision
not to investigate . . . is a matter of trial tactics, there is no

ineffective assistance of counsel." App. to Pet. for Cert.155a-156a.

The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of re-lief, concluding that trial counsel had made "a deliberate, tactical decision to concentrate their effort at convincing thejury" that appellant was not directly responsible for the murder. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15.The court observed that counsel knew of Wiggins' unfortunate childhood. They had available to them both the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report prepared by the Division
of Parole and Probation, as required by Maryland law, Md.Ann. Code, Art. 41, $ 4-609(d) (1988), as well as "more detailed social service records that recorded incidences of phys-ical and sexual abuse, an alcoholic mother, placements in foster care, and borderline retardation." 352 Md., at 608-609,724 A. 2d, at 15. The court acknowledged that this evidence
was neither as detailed nor as graphic as the history elabo-rated in the Selvog report but emphasized that "counsel

didinvestigate and
were aware of appellant's background." Id.,at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16 (emphasis in original). Counsel knew

that at least one uncontested mitigating factor--Wiggins'lack of prior convictions--would be before the jury should
their attempt to disprove Wiggins' direct responsibility forthe murder fail. As a result, the court concluded, Schlaich
and Nethercott "made a reasoned choice to proceed withwhat they thought was their best defense." Id., at 611-612,
724 A. 2d, at 17. C

In September 2001, Wiggins filed a petition for writ ofhabeas corpus in Federal District Court. The trial court
granted him relief, holding that the Maryland courts' rejec-tion of his ineffective assistance claim "involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law." Wigginsv. Corcoran, 164 F. Supp. 2d 538, 557 (2001) (citing Williams
v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)). The court rejected theState's defense of counsel's "tactical" decision to " `retry

Opinion of the Court
guilt,' " concluding that for a strategic decision to be reasonable, it must be "based upon information the attorney
has made after conducting a reasonable investigation." 164
F. Supp. 2d, at 558. The court found that though counsel
were aware of some aspects of Wiggins' background, that
knowledge did not excuse them from their duty to make a
"fully informed and deliberate decision" about whether to
present a mitigation case. In fact, the court concluded, their
knowledge triggered an obligation to look further. Id., at
559.

Reviewing the District Court's decisi on de novo, the
Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that counsel had made a
reasonable strategic decision to focus on petitioner's direct
responsibility. Wiggins v. Corcoran, 288 F. 3d 629, 639-640
(2002). The court contrasted counsel's complete failure to
investigate potential mitigating evidence in Williams, 288
F. 3d, at 640, with the fact that Schlaich and Nethercott knew
at least some details of Wiggins' childhood from the PSI and
social services records, id., at 641. The court acknowledged
that counsel likely knew further investigation "would have
resulted in more sordid details surfacing," but agreed with
the Maryland Court of Appeals that counsel's knowledge of
the avenues of mitigation available to them "was sufficient to
make an informed strategic choice" to challenge petitioner's
direct responsibility for the murder. Id., at 641-642. The
court emphasized that conflicting medical testimony with respect to the time of death, the absence of direct evidence
against Wiggins, and unexplained forensic evidence at the
crime scene supported counsel's strategy. Id., at 641.

We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1027 (2002), and now
reverse.

Opinion of the Court
to effective assistance of counsel. The amendments to 28
U. S. C. $ 2254, enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), circumscribe
our consideration of Wiggins' claim and require us to limit
our analysis to the law as it was "clearly established" by our
precedents at the time of the state court's decision. Section
2254 provides:

"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a
State court shall not be granted with respect to any
claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court
proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--

"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States; or

"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding."

We have made clear that the "unreasonable application"
prong of $ 2254(d)(1) permits a federal habeas court to "grant
the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing
legal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonably
applies that principle to the facts" of petitioner's case. Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 413; see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S.
685, 694 (2002). In other words, a federal court may grant
relief when a state court has misapplied a "governing legal
principle" to "a set of facts different from those of the case
in which the principle was announced." Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003) (citing Williams v. Taylor,
supra, at 407). In order for a federal court to find a state
court's application of our precedent "unreasonable," the state
court's decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous. See Lockyer, supra, at 75. The state court's appli539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cation must have been "objectively unreasonable." See Wil-liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 409.

We established the legal principles that govern claims ofineffective assistance of counsel in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). An ineffective assistance claim hastwo components: A petitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient, and that the deficiency prejudicedthe defense.

Id., at 687. To establish deficient perform-ance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel's representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness."Id., at 688. We have declined to articulate specific guidelines for appropriate attorney conduct and instead have em-phasized that "[t]he proper measure of attorney performance
remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professionalnorms." Ibid.

In this case, as in Strickland, petitioner's claim stems fromcounsel's decision to limit the scope of their investigation
into potential mitigating evidence. Id., at 673. Here, as in
Strickland, counsel attempt to justify their limited investiga-tion as reflecting a tactical judgment not to present mitigating evidence at sentencing and to pursue an alternativestrategy instead. In rejecting the respondent's claim, we
defined the deference owed such strategic judgments interms of the adequacy of the investigations supporting
those judgments:

"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigationof law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made afterless than complete investigation are reasonable precisely
to the extent that reasonable professional judgmentssupport the limitations on investigation. In other

words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investiga-tions or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectivenesscase, a particular decision not to investigate must be
directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circum539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
stances, applying a heavy measure of deference to coun-sel's judgments." Id., at 690-691.

Our opinion in Williams v. Taylor is illustrative of theproper application of these standards. In finding Williams'
ineffectiveness claim meritorious, we applied Strickland andconcluded that counsel's failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justi-fied as a tactical decision to focus on Williams' voluntary confessions, because counsel had not "fulfill[ed] their obligationto conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background." 529 U. S., at 396 (citing 1 ABA Standards forCriminal Justice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1980)).
While Williams had not yet been decided at the time theMaryland Court of Appeals rendered the decision at issue in
this case, cf. post, at 542 (Scalia, J., dissenting), Williams'case was before us on habeas review. Contrary to the dissent's contention, post, at 543, we therefore made no new lawin resolving Williams' ineffectiveness claim. See

Williams,529 U. S., at 390 (noting that the merits of Williams' claim

"are squarely governed by our holding in Strickland"); seealso id., at 395 (noting that the trial court correctly applied
both components of the Strickland standard to petitioner'sclaim and proceeding to discuss counsel's failure to investigate as a violation of Strickland's performance prong). Inhighlighting counsel's duty to investigate, and in referring to
the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as guides, we ap-plied the same "clearly established" precedent of

Stricklandwe apply today. Cf. 466 U. S., at 690-691 (establishing that

"thorough investigation[s]" are "virtually unchallengeable"and underscoring that "counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations"); see also id., at 688-689 ("Prevailingnorms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association
standards and the like . . . are guides to determining whatis reasonable").

In light of these standards, our principal concern in decid-ing whether Schlaich and Nethercott exercised "reasonable

Opinion of the Court
professional judgmen[t]," id., at 691, is not whether counsel
should have presented a mitigation case. Rather, we focus
on whether the investigation supporting counsel's decision
not to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' background
was i tsel f reasonable. Ibi d. Cf. Wi ll i ams v. Taylor,
supra, at 415 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting counsel's
duty to conduct the "requisite, diligent" investigation into
his client's background). In assessing counsel's investigation, we must conduct an objective review of their performance, measured for "reasonableness under prevailing professional norms," Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688, which includes
a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct
as seen "from counsel's perspective at the time," id., at 689
("[E]very effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting
effects of hindsight").

The record demonstrates that counsel's investigation drew
from three sources. App. 490-491. Counsel arranged for
William Stejskal, a psychologist, to conduct a number of
tests on petitioner. Stejskal concluded that petitioner had
an IQ of 79, had difficulty coping with demanding situations,
and exhibited features of a personality disorder. Id., at 44-
45, 349-351. These reports revealed nothing, however, of
petitioner's life history. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-25.

With respect to that history, counsel had available to them
the written PSI, which included a one-page account of Wiggins' "personal history" noting his "misery as a youth," quoting his description of his own background as " `disgusting,' "
and observing that he spent most of his life in foster care.
App. 20-21. Counsel also "tracked down" records kept by
the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS) documenting petitioner's various placements in the State's foster care system. Id., at 490; Lodging of Petitioner. In describing the scope of counsel's investigation into petitioner's

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
524 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
life history, both the Fourth Circuit and the Maryland Courtof Appeals referred only to these two sources of information.

See 288 F. 3d, at 640-641; Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15.

Counsel's decision not to expand their investigation be-yond the PSI and the DSS records fell short of the professional standards that prevailed in Maryland in 1989. As
Schlaich acknowledged, standard practice in Maryland incapital cases at the time of Wiggins' trial included the preparation of a social history report. App. 488. Despite the factthat the Public Defender's office made funds available for the
retention of a forensic social worker, counsel chose not to
commission such a report. Id., at 487. Counsel's conduct
similarly fell short of the standards for capital defense work
articulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)--standards to which we long have referred as "guides to determining what is reasonable." Strickland, supra, at 688;
Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 396. The ABA Guidelines
provide that investigations into mitigating evidence "should
comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor." ABA
Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel
in Death Penalty Cases 11.4.1(C), p. 93 (1989) (emphasis
added). Despite these well-defined norms, however, counsel
abandoned their investigation of petitioner's background
after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources. Cf. id., 11.8.6, p. 133 (noting that among the topics counsel should consider presenting
are medical history, educational history, employment and
training history, family and social history, prior adult and
juvenile correctional experience, and religious and cultural
influences (emphasis added)); 1 ABA Standards for Criminal
Justice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1982) ("The lawyer
also has a substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors both to the prosecutor initially and

Opinion of the Court
to the court at sentencing. . . . Investigation is essential tofulfillment of these functions").

The scope of their investigation was also unreasonable inlight of what counsel actually discovered in the DSS records.
The records revealed several facts: Petitioner's mother wasa chronic alcoholic; Wiggins was shuttled from foster home
to foster home and displayed some emotional difficulties
while there; he had frequent, lengthy absences from school;and, on at least one occasion, his mother left him and his

siblings alone for days without food. See Lodging of Peti-tioner 54-95, 126, 131-136, 140, 147, 159-176. As the Federal District Court emphasized, any reasonably competent
attorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was
necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses, particularly given the apparent absence of any aggravating factors in petitioner's background. 164 F. Supp. 2d,
at 559. Indeed, counsel uncovered no evidence in their investigation to suggest that a mitigation case, in its own right,
would have been counterproductive, or that further investigation would have been fruitless; this case is therefore distinguishable from our precedents in which we have found
limited investigations into mitigating evidence to be reasonable. See, e. g., Strickland, supra, at 699 (concluding that
counsel could "reasonably surmise . . . that character and
psychological evidence would be of little help"); Burger v.
Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 794 (1987) (concluding counsel's limited
investigation was reasonable because he interviewed all witnesses brought to his attention, discovering little that was
helpful and much that was harmful); Darden v. Wainwright,
477 U. S. 168, 186 (1986) (concluding that counsel engaged
in extensive preparation and that the decision to present a
mitigation case would have resulted in the jury hearing evidence that petitioner had been convicted of violent crimes
and spent much of his life in jail). Had counsel investigated
further, they might well have discovered the sexual abuse
later revealed during state postconviction proceedings.

526 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
The record of the actual sentencing proceedings under-scores the unreasonableness of counsel's conduct by suggesting that their failure to investigate thoroughly resulted frominattention, not reasoned strategic judgment. Counsel
sought, until the day before sentencing, to have the proceed-ings bifurcated into a retrial of guilt and a mitigation stage.
See supra, at 515. On the eve of sentencing, counsel represented to the court that they were prepared to come forwardwith mitigating evidence, App. 45, and that they intended to

present such evidence in the event the court granted theirmotion to bifurcate. In other words, prior to sentencing,
counsel never actually abandoned the possibility that they
would present a mitigation defense. Until the court denied
their motion, then, they had every reason to develop the
most powerful mitigation case possible.

What is more, during the sentencing proceeding itself,
counsel did not focus exclusively on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. After introducing that issue in her
opening statement, id., at 70-71, Nethercott entreated the
jury to consider not just what Wiggins "is found to have
done," but also "who [he] is." Id., at 70. Though she told
the jury it would "hear that Kevin Wiggins has had a difficult
life," id., at 72, counsel never followed up on that suggestion
with details of Wiggins' history. At the same time, counsel
called a criminologist to testify that inmates serving life sentences tend to adjust well and refrain from further violence
in prison--testimony with no bearing on whether petitioner
committed the murder by his own hand. Id., at 311-312.
Far from focusing exclusively on petitioner's direct responsibility, then, counsel put on a halfhearted mitigation case, taking precisely the type of " `shotgun' " approach the Maryland
Court of Appeals concluded counsel sought to avoid. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. When viewed
in this light, the "strategic decision" the state courts and
respondents all invoke to justify counsel's limited pursuit of
mitigating evidence resembles more a post hoc rationaliza539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion of counsel's conduct than an accurate description of theirdeliberations prior to sentencing.

In rejecting petitioner's ineffective assistance claim, theMaryland Court of Appeals appears to have assumed that
because counsel had some information with respect to peti-tioner's background--the information in the PSI and the
DSS records--they were in a position to make a tactical
choice not to present a mitigation defense. Id., at 611-612,724 A. 2d, at 17 (citing federal and state precedents finding

ineffective assistance in cases in which counsel failed to con-duct an investigation of any kind). In assessing the reasonableness of an attorney's investigation, however, a court
must consider not only the quantum of evidence already
known to counsel, but also whether the known evidence
would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.
Even assuming Schlaich and Nethercott limited the scope
of their investigation for strategic reasons, Strickland does
not establish that a cursory investigation automatically justifies a tactical decision with respect to sentencing strategy.
Rather, a reviewing court must consider the reasonableness
of the investigation said to support that strategy. 466
U. S., at 691.

The Maryland Court of Appeals' application of Strickland's governing legal principles was objectively unreasonable. Though the state court acknowledged petitioner's
claim that counsel's failure to prepare a social history "did
not meet the minimum standards of the profession," the
court did not conduct an assessment of whether the decision
to cease all investigation upon obtaining the PSI and the
DSS records actually demonstrated reasonable professional
judgment. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 609, 724 A. 2d,
at 16. The state court merely assumed that the investigation was adequate. In light of what the PSI and the DSS
records actually revealed, however, counsel chose to abandon
their investigation at an unreasonable juncture, making a
fully informed decision with respect to sentencing strategy

528 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
impossible. The Court of Appeals' assumption that the in-vestigation was adequate,

ibid., thus reflected an unreasonable application of Strickland. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). Asa result, the court's subsequent deference to counsel's strategic decision not "to present every conceivable mitigation de-fense," 352 Md., at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16, despite the fact that
counsel based this alleged choice on what we have made clear
was an unreasonable investigation, was also objectively un-reasonable. As we established in

Strickland, "strategic
choices made after less than complete investigation are rea-sonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional

judgments support the limitations on investigation." 466
U. S., at 690-691.

Additionally, the court based its conclusion, in part, on a
clear factual error--that the "social service records . . . recorded incidences of . . . sexual abuse." 352 Md., at 608-609,
724 A. 2d, at 15. As the State and the United States now
concede, the records contain no mention of sexual abuse,
much less of the repeated molestations and rapes of petitioner detailed in the Selvog report. Brief for Respondents
22; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26; App. to
Pet. for Cert. 175a-179a, 190a. The state court's assumption
that the records documented instances of this abuse has been
shown to be incorrect by "clear and convincing evidence," 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1), and reflects "an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the
State court proceeding," $ 2254(d)(2). This partial reliance
on an erroneous factual finding further highlights the unreasonableness of the state court's decision.

The dissent insists that this Court's hands are tied, under

$ 2254(d), "by the state court's factual determinations that
Wiggins' trial counsel `did investigate and were aware
of [Wiggins'] background,' " post, at 550. But as we have
made clear, the Maryland Court of Appeals' conclusion that
the scope of counsel's investigation into petitioner's background met the legal standards set in Strickland repre539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

529Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
sented an objectively unreasonable application of our precedent. $ 2254(d)(1). Moreover, the court's assumption that
counsel learned of a major aspect of Wiggins' background,
i. e., the sexual abuse, from the DSS records was clearly
erroneous. The requirements of $ 2254(d) thus pose no bar

to granting petitioner habeas relief.

2
In their briefs to this Court, the State and the United
States contend that counsel, in fact, conducted a more thorough investigation than the one we have just described.
This conclusion, they explain, follows from Schlaich's postconviction testimony that he knew of the sexual abuse Wiggins suffered, as well as of the hand-burning incident. According to the State and its amicus, the fact that counsel
claimed to be aware of this evidence, which was not in the
social services records, coupled with Schlaich's statement
that he knew what was in "other people's reports," App. 490-
491, suggests that counsel's investigation must have extended beyond the social services records. Tr. of Oral Arg.
31-36; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26-27, n. 4;
Brief for Respondents 35. Schlaich simply "was not asked
to and did not reveal the source of his knowledge" of the
abuse. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27, n. 4.

In considering this reading of the state postconviction record, we note preliminarily that the Maryland Court of Appeals clearly assumed both that counsel's investigation began
and ended with the PSI and the DSS records and that this
investigation was sufficient in scope to satisfy Strickland's
reasonableness requirement. See Wiggins v. State, 352 Md.,
at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15. The court also assumed, erroneously, that the social services records cited incidences of sexual abuse. See id., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. Respondents' interpretation of Schlaich's postconviction testimony
therefore has no bearing on whether the Maryland Court of

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
530 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
Appeals' decision reflected an objectively unreasonable appli-cation of

Strickland.
In its assessment of the Maryland Court of Appeals' opin-ion, the dissent apparently does not dispute that if counsel's

investigation in this case had consisted exclusively of the PSIand the DSS records, the court's decision would have constituted an unreasonable application of Strickland. See post,
at 543-544. Of necessity, then, the dissent's primary conten-tion is that the Maryland Court of Appeals

did decide that
Wiggins' counsel looked beyond the PSI and the DSS recordsand that we must therefore defer to that finding under

$ 2254(e)(1). See post, at 544-551. Had the court found
that counsel's investigation extended beyond the PSI and the
DSS records, the dissent, of course, would be correct that

$ 2254(e) would require that we defer to that finding. But
the state court made no such finding.

The dissent bases its conclusion on the Maryland Court of
Appeals' statements that " `[c]ounsel were aware that appellant had a most unfortunate childhood,' " and that " `counsel
did investigate and were aware of appellant's background.' "
See post, at 540, 545 (quoting Wiggins v. State, supra, at 608,
610, 724 A. 2d, at 15, 16). But the state court's description
of how counsel learned of petitioner's childhood speaks for
itself. The court explained: "Counsel were aware that appellant had a most unfortunate childhood. Mr. Schlaich had
available to him not only the pre-sentence investigation report . . . but also more detailed social service records." See
352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. This construction reflects the state court's understanding that the investigation
consisted of the two sources the court mentions. Indeed,
when describing counsel's investigation into petitioner's
background, the court never so much as implies that counsel
uncovered any source other than the PSI and the DSS records. The court's conclusion that counsel were aware of "incidences of . . . sexual abuse" does not suggest otherwise,
cf. supra, at 518, because the court assumed that counsel

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

531Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
learned of such incidents from the social services records.
Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15.

The court's subsequent statement that, "as noted, counsel
did investigate and were aware of appellant's background,"
underscores our conclusion that the Maryland Court of Appeals assumed counsel's investigation into Wiggins' childhood consisted of the PSI and the DSS records. The court's
use of the phrase "as noted," which the dissent ignores,
further confirms that counsel's investigation consisted of the
sources previously described, i. e., the PSI and the DSS
records. It is the dissent, therefore, that "rests upon a fundamental fallacy," post, at 544--that the Maryland Court of
Appeals determined that Schlaich's investigation extended
beyond the PSI and the DSS records.

We therefore must determine, de novo, whether counsel
reached beyond the PSI and the DSS records in their investigation of petitioner's background. The record as a whole
does not support the conclusion that counsel conducted a
more thorough investigation than the one we have described.
The dissent, like the State and the United States, relies primarily on Schlaich's postconviction testimony to establish
that counsel investigated more extensively. But the questions put to Schlaich during his postconviction testimony all
referred to what he knew from the social services records;
the line of questioning, after all, first directed him to his
discovery of those documents. His subsequent reference to
"other people's reports," made in direct response to a question concerning petitioner's mental retardation, appears to
be an acknowledgment of the psychologist's reports we know
counsel commissioned--reports that also revealed nothing of
the sexual abuse Wiggins experienced. App. 349. As the
state trial judge who heard this testimony concluded at the
close of the proceedings, there is "no reason to believe that
[counsel] did have all of this information." Id., at 606 (emphasis added).

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
532 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
The State maintained at oral argument that Schlaich's ref-erence to "other people's reports" indicated that counsel

learned of the sexual abuse from sources other than the PSIand the DSS records. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 33, 35. But when
pressed repeatedly to identify the sources counsel mighthave consulted, the State acknowledged that no written reports documented the sexual abuse and speculated that counsel must have learned of it through "[o]ral reports" fromWiggins himself.

Id., at 36. Not only would the phrase
"other people's reports" have been an unusual way for coun-sel to refer to conversations with his client, but the record

contains no evidence that counsel ever pursued this line of
questioning with Wiggins. See id., at 24-25. For its part,
the United States emphasized counsel's retention of the psychologist. Id., at 51; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. But again, counsel's decision to hire a psychologist
sheds no light on the extent of their investigation into petitioner's social background. Though Stejskal based his conclusions on clinical interviews with Wiggins, as well as meetings with Wiggins' family members, Lodging of Petitioner,
his final report discussed only petitioner's mental capacities
and attributed nothing of what he learned to Wiggins' social history.

To further underscore that counsel did not know, prior to
sentencing, of the sexual abuse, as well as of the other incidents not recorded in the DSS records, petitioner directs
us to the content of counsel's October 17, 1989, proffer. Before closing statements and outside the presence of the jury,
Schlaich proffered to the court the mitigation case counsel
would have introduced had the court granted their motion to
bifurcate. App. 349-351. In his statement, Schlaich referred only to the results of the psychologist's test and mentioned nothing of Wiggins' troubled background. Given that
the purpose of the proffer was to preserve their pursuit of
bifurcation as an issue for appeal, they had every incentive
to make their mitigation case seem as strong as possible.

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

533Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Counsel's failure to include in the proffer the powerful evi-dence of repeated sexual abuse is therefore explicable only

if we assume that counsel had no knowledge of the abuse.Contrary to the dissent's claim, see post, at 547, we are not
accusing Schlaich of lying. His statements at the postcon-viction proceedings that he knew of this abuse, as well as
of the hand-burning incident, may simply reflect a mistakenmemory shaped by the passage of time. After all, the state
postconviction proceedings took place over four years afterWiggins' sentencing. Ultimately, given counsel's likely ignorance of the history of sexual abuse at the time of sentenc-ing, we cannot infer from Schlaich's postconviction testimony
that counsel looked further than the PSI and the DSS rec-ords in investigating petitioner's background. Indeed, the
record contains no mention of sources other than those it isundisputed counsel possessed, see

supra, at 523-524. Wetherefore conclude that counsel's investigation of petitioner's

background was limited to the PSI and the DSS records.

3
In finding that Schlaich and Nethercott's investigation didnot meet

Strickland's performance standards, we emphasizethat Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every

conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how un-likely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing. Nor does Strickland require defense counsel to pre-sent mitigating evidence at sentencing in every case. Both
conclusions would interfere with the "constitutionally pro-tected independence of counsel" at the heart of

Strickland.466 U. S., at 689. We base our conclusion on the much more

limited principle that "strategic choices made after less thancomplete investigation are reasonable" only to the extent
that "reasonable professional judgments support the limita-tions on investigation." Id., at 690-691. A decision not to
investigate thus "must be directly assessed for reasonable-ness in all the circumstances."

Id., at 691.

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
534 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Opinion of the Court
Counsel's investigation into Wiggins' background did notreflect reasonable professional judgment. Their decision to

end their investigation when they did was neither consistentwith the professional standards that prevailed in 1989, nor
reasonable in light of the evidence counsel uncovered in thesocial services records--evidence that would have led a reasonably competent attorney to investigate further. Coun-sel's pursuit of bifurcation until the eve of sentencing and
their partial presentation of a mitigation case suggest thattheir incomplete investigation was the result of inattention,
not reasoned strategic judgment. In deferring to counsel'sdecision not to pursue a mitigation case despite their unreasonable investigation, the Maryland Court of Appealsunreasonably applied

Strickland. Furthermore, the courtpartially relied on an erroneous factual assumption. The

requirements for habeas relief established by 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d) are thus satisfied.

In order for counsel's inadequate performance to consti-tute a Sixth Amendment violation, petitioner must show that

counsel's failures prejudiced his defense. Strickland, 466U. S., at 692. In Strickland, we made clear that, to establish
prejudice, a "defendant must show that there is a reasonableprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the
result of the proceeding would have been different. A rea-sonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine
confidence in the outcome." Id., at 694. In assessing pre-judice, we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the
totality of available mitigating evidence. In this case, ourreview is not circumscribed by a state court conclusion with
respect to prejudice, as neither of the state courts belowreached this prong of the

Strickland analysis.The mitigating evidence counsel failed to discover and

present in this case is powerful. As Selvog reported basedon his conversations with Wiggins and members of his fam539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ily, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-19, Wiggins experienced severe privation and abuse in the first six years of his
life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother.
He suffered physical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care. The
time Wiggins spent homeless, along with his diminished
mental capacities, further augment his mitigation case. Petitioner thus has the kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant's moral culpability.
Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319 (1989) (" `[E]vidence
about the defendant's background and character is relevant
because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse' "); see also Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112 (1982) (noting that consideration of the offender's life history is a " `part of the process
of inflicting the penalty of death' "); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.
586, 604 (1978) (invalidating Ohio law that did not permit
consideration of aspects of a defendant's background).

Given both the nature and the extent of the abuse petitioner suffered, we find there to be a reasonable probability
that a competent attorney, aware of this history, would have
introduced it at sentencing in an admissible form. While it
may well have been strategically defensible upon a reasonably thorough investigation to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder, the two sentencing strategies
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Moreover, given the
strength of the available evidence, a reasonable attorney
might well have chosen to prioritize the mitigation case
over the direct responsibility challenge, particularly given
that Wiggins' history contained little of the double edge we
have found to justify limited investigations in other cases.
Cf. Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776 (1987); Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
The dissent nevertheless maintains that Wiggins' counselwould not have altered their chosen strategy of focusing exclusively on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder.See

post, at 553-554. But as we have made clear, counsel
were not in a position to make a reasonable strategic choiceas to whether to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility, the

sordid details of his life history, or both, because the investigation supporting their choice was unreasonable. See
supra, at 524-527. Moreover, as we have noted, see supra,
at 526, Wiggins' counsel did not focus solely on Wiggins'direct responsibility. Counsel told the sentencing jury

"[y]ou're going to hear that Kevin Wiggins has had a difficult
life," App. 72, but never followed up on this suggestion.

We further find that had the jury been confronted with
this considerable mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable
probability that it would have returned with a different sentence. In reaching this conclusion, we need not, as the dissent suggests, post, at 554-556, make the state-law evidentiary findings that would have been at issue at sentencing.
Rather, we evaluate the totality of the evidence--"both that
adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas
proceeding[s]." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 397-398
(emphasis added).

In any event, contrary to the dissent's assertion, it appears
that Selvog's report may have been admissible under Maryland law. In Whittlesey v. State, 340 Md. 30, 665 A. 2d 223
(1995), the Maryland Court of Appeals vacated a trial court
decision excluding, on hearsay grounds, testimony by Selvog
himself. The court instructed the trial judge to exercise its
discretion to admit "any relevant and reliable mitigating evidence, including hearsay evidence that might not be admissible in the guilt-or-innocence phase of the trial." Id., at 73,
665 A. 2d, at 244. This "relaxed standard," the court observed, would provide the factfinder with "the opportunity
to consider `any aspect of a defendant's character or record
. . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less

Opinion of the Court
than death.' " Ibid. See also Ball v. State, 347 Md. 156,172-173, 699 A. 2d 1170, 1177 (1997) (noting that the trial

judge had admitted Selvog's social history report on the de-fendant). While the dissent dismisses the contents of the
social history report, calling Wiggins a "liar" and his claimsof sexual abuse "uncorroborated gossip,"

post, at 554, 555,
Maryland appears to consider this type of evidence relevant
at sentencing, see Whittlesey, supra, at 71, 665 A. 2d, at 243("The reasons for relaxing the rules of evidence apply with

particular force in the death penalty context"). Not eventhe State contests that Wiggins suffered from the various
types of abuse and neglect detailed in the PSI, the DSS records, and Selvog's social history report.

Wiggins' sentencing jury heard only one significant mitigating factor--that Wiggins had no prior convictions. Had
the jury been able to place petitioner's excruciating life history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable
probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance. Cf. Borchardt v. State, 367 Md. 91, 139-140,
786 A. 2d 631, 660 (2001) (noting that as long as a single juror
concludes that mitigating evidence outweighs aggravating
evidence, the death penalty cannot be imposed); App. 369
(instructing the jury: "If you unanimously find that the State
has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the aggravating circumstance does outweigh the mitigating circumstances, then consider whether death is the appropriate
sentence").

Moreover, in contrast to the petitioner in Williams v. Taylor, supra, Wiggins does not have a record of violent conduct
that could have been introduced by the State to offset this
powerful mitigating narrative. Cf. id., at 418 (Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting) (noting that Williams had savagely beaten
an elderly woman, stolen two cars, set fire to a home, stabbed
a man during a robbery, and confessed to choking two inmates and breaking a fellow prisoner's jaw). As the Federal
District Court found, the mitigating evidence in this case is

538 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Scalia, J., dissenting
stronger, and the State's evidence in support of the deathpenalty far weaker, than in Williams, where we found prejudice as the result of counsel's failure to investigate and pre-sent mitigating evidence. Id., at 399. We thus conclude
that the available mitigating evidence, taken as a whole,"might well have influenced the jury's appraisal" of Wiggins'
moral culpability. Id., at 398. Accordingly, the judgmentof the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

The Court today vacates Kevin Wiggins' death sentenceon the ground that his trial counsel's investigation of potential mitigating evidence was "incomplete." Ante, at 534.Wiggins' trial counsel testified under oath, however, that he
was aware of the basic features of Wiggins' troubled child-hood that the Court claims he overlooked. App. 490-491.
The Court chooses to disbelieve this testimony for reasonsthat do not withstand analysis. Moreover, even if this disbelief could plausibly be entertained, that would certainlynot establish (as 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) requires) that the Maryland Court of Appeals was unreasonable in believing it, andin therefore concluding that counsel adequately investigated
Wiggins' background. The Court also fails to observe$ 2254(e)(1)'s requirement that federal habeas courts respect
state-court factual determinations not rebutted by "clear andconvincing evidence." The decision sets at naught the statutory scheme we once described as a "highly deferentialstandard for evaluating state-court rulings,"

have learned--and could have presented to the jury--the following evidence: (1) According to family members, Wiggins'
mother was an alcoholic who neglected her children and
failed to feed them properly, App. to Pet. for Cert. 165a-169a;
(2) according to Wiggins and his sister India, Wiggins'
mother intentionally burned 5-year-old Wiggins' hands on a
kitchen stove as punishment for playing with matches, id.,
at 169a-171a; (3) Wiggins was placed in foster care at age
six because of his mother's neglect, and was moved in and
out of various foster families, id., at 173a-192a; (4) according
to Wiggins, one of his foster parents sexually abused him
" `two or three times a week, sometimes everyday,' " when
he was eight years old, id., at 177a-179a; (5) according to
Wiggins, at age 16 he was knocked unconscious and raped
by two of his foster mother's teenage children, id., at 190a;
(6) according to Wiggins, when he joined the Job Corps at
age 18 a Job Corps administrator "made sexual advances . . .
and they became sexually involved," id., at 192a-193a (later,
according to Wiggins, the Job Corps supervisor drugged him
and when Wiggins woke up, he "knew he had been anally
penetrated," id., at 193a); and (7) Wiggins is " `borderline' "
mentally retarded, id., at 193a-194a. All this information is
contained in a "social history" report prepared by social
worker Hans Selvog for use in the state postconviction
proceedings.

In those proceedings, Carl Schlaich (one of Wiggins' two
trial attorneys) testified that, although he did not retain a
social worker to assemble a "social history" report, he nevertheless had detailed knowledge of Wiggins' background:

" `Q But you knew that Mr. Wiggins, Kevin Wiggins,
had been removed from his natural mother as a result
of a finding of neglect and abuse when he was six years
old, is that correct?

" `A I believe that we tracked all of that down.

and convincing evidence.1 Relying on these factual findings,
the Maryland Court of Appeals rejected Wiggins' claim that
his trial attorneys failed adequately to investigate potential
mitigating evidence. Wiggins' trial counsel, it said, "did not
have as detailed or graphic a history as was prepared by
Mr. Selvog, but that is not a Constitutional deficiency. See

The state court having adjudicated Wiggins' Sixth Amendment claim on the merits, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) bars habeas
relief unless the state-court decision "was contrary to, or

involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States," $ 2254(d)(1), or "was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence
presented in the State court proceeding," $ 2254(d)(2). The
Court concludes without foundation that the Maryland Court
of Appeals' decision failed both these tests. I shall discuss
each in turn.

A

In concluding that the Maryland Court of Appeals unreasonably applied our clearly established precedents, the
Court disregards $ 2254(d)(1)'s command that only "clearly
established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States," be used in assessing the reasonableness of state-court decisions. Further, the Court misdescribes the state court's opinion while ignoring $ 2254(e)(1)'s

1 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1) provides:
"In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus
by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be
correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence."

requirement that federal habeas courts respect state-courtfactual determinations.

1
We have defined "clearly established Federal law, as deter-mined by the Supreme Court of the United States," to encompass "the holdings . . . of this Court's decisions as of
the time of the relevant state-court decision." Williams v.Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000) (emphasis added). Yet in

discussing what our precedents have "clearly established"with respect to ineffectiveness claims, the Court relies upon
a case--Williams v. Taylor, supra--that postdates theMaryland court's decision rejecting Wiggins' Sixth Amendment claim. See ante, at 522. The Court concedes that
Williams was not "clearly established Federal law" at thetime of the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision, ante, at 522,

yet believes that it may ignore $ 2254(d)'s strictures on theground that "Williams' case was before us on habeas review[,
and] we therefore made no new law in resolving [his] ineffec-tiveness claim," ibid. The Court is wrong--in both its
premise and its conclusion.Although Williams was a habeas case, we reviewed the
first prong of the habeas petitioner's Strickland claim--the inadequate-performance question--de novo. Williams
had surmounted $ 2254(d)'s bar to habeas relief because weheld that the Virginia Supreme Court's analysis with respect
to Strickland's second prong--the prejudice prong--wasboth "contrary to," and "an unreasonable application of,"
our clearly established precedents. See Williams, supra, at393-394, 397. That left us free to provide habeas relief--
and since the State had not raised a Teague defense, see
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), we proceeded to analyzethe inadequate-performance contention de novo, rather than

under "clearly established" law. That is clear from the factthat we cited no cases in our discussion of the inadequateperformance question, see 529 U. S., at 395-396. The Courtis mistaken to assert that this discussion "made no new law,"

Scalia, J., dissenting
ante, at 522. There was nothing in Strickland, or in any ofour "clearly established" precedents at the time of the Virginia Supreme Court's decision, to support Williams' state-ment that trial counsel had an "obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background," 529 U. S.,at 396. That is why the citation supporting the statement
is not one of our opinions, but rather standards promulgatedby the American Bar Association,

ibid. (citing 1 ABA Stand-ards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d

ed. 1980)). Insofar as this Court's cases were concerned,Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 794 (1987), had rejected an
ineffective-assistance claim even though acknowledging thattrial counsel "could well have made a more thorough investigation than he did." And Strickland had eschewed the im-position of such "rules" on counsel, 466 U. S., at 688-689, specifically stating that the very ABA standards upon whichWilliams later relied "are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides." 466 U. S., at 688 (empha-sis added).

Williams did make new law--law that was not"clearly established" at the time of the Maryland Court of

Appeals' decision.But even if the Court were correct in its characterization
of Williams, that still cannot justify its decision to ignore anAct of Congress. Whether Williams "made new law" or
not, what Williams held was not clearly established Su-preme Court precedent as of the time of the state court's
decision, and cannot be used to find fault in the state-courtopinion. Section 2254(d)(1) means what it says, and the
Court simply defies the congressionally imposed limits onfederal habeas review.

2
The Court concludes that Strickland was applied unrea-sonably (and $ 2254(d)(1) thereby satisfied) because the Maryland Court of Appeals' conclusion that trial counsel ade-quately investigated Wiggins' background, see

Wiggins, 352Md., at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16, was unreasonable. That assess539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
544 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Scalia, J., dissenting
ment cannot possibly be sustained, particularly in light ofthe state court's factual determinations that bind this Court

under $ 2254(e)(1). The Court's analysis of this point restsupon a fundamental fallacy: that the state court "clearly assumed that counsel's investigation began and ended with thePSI and the DSS records,"

ante, at 529. That is demonstrably not so. The state court did observe that Wiggins' trial
attorneys "had available" the presentence investigation(PSI) report and the Maryland Department of Social Services (DSS) reports, Wiggins, supra, at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at15-16, but there is absolutely nothing in the state-court opinion that says (or assumes) that these were the only sources
on which counsel relied. It is rather this Court that makes
such an assumption--or rather, such a bald assertion, see
ante, at 527 (asserting that counsel "cease[d] all investigation" upon receipt of the PSI and DSS reports); ante, at 524
(referring to "[c]ounsel's decision not to expand their investigation beyond the PSI and DSS records").

Nor could the Maryland Court of Appeals have "assumed"
that Wiggins' trial counsel looked no further than the PSI
and DSS reports, because the state-court record is clear that
Wiggins' trial attorneys had investigated well beyond these
sources. Public-defender investigators interviewed Wiggins' family members, see Defendant's Supplemental Answer
to State's Discovery Request filed in No. 88-CR-5464 (Cir.
Ct. Baltimore Cty., Md., Sept. 18, 1989), Lodging of Respondents, and Wiggins' trial attorneys hired a psychologist,
Dr. William Stejskal (who reviewed the DSS records, conducted clinical interviews, and performed six different psychological tests of Wiggins, ibid.; App. 349-351), and a criminologist, Dr. Robert Johnson (who interviewed Wiggins and
testified that Wiggins would adjust adequately to life in
prison, id., at 319-321). Schlaich also testified in the state
postconviction proceedings that he knew information about
Wiggins' background that was not contained in the DSS or
PSI reports--such as the allegation that Wiggins' mother

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

545Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)
Scalia, J., dissenting
burned his hands as a child, id., at 490--so Schlaich must
have investigated sources beyond these reports.

As the Court notes, ante, at 529-530, the Maryland Court
of Appeals did not expressly state that counsel's investigation extended beyond the PSI and DSS records. There was
no reason whatever to do so, since it had found that "counsel
did investigate and were aware of appellant's background,"
Wiggins, supra, at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16, and since that finding was based on a state-court record that clearly demonstrates investigation beyond the PSI and DSS reports. The
court's failure to recite what is obvious from the record
surely provides no basis for believing that it stupidly "assumed" the opposite of what is obvious from the record.

Once one eliminates the Court's mischaracterization of the
state-court opinion--which did not and could not have "assumed" that Wiggins' counsel knew only what was contained
in the DSS and PSI reports--there is no basis for finding
it "unreasonable" to believe that counsel's investigation was
adequate. As noted earlier, Schlaich testified in the state
postconviction proceedings that he was aware of the essential items contained in the later-prepared "social history" report. He knew that Wiggins was subjected to neglect and
abuse from his mother, App. 490, that there were reports of
sexual abuse at one of his foster homes, ibid., that his mother
had burned his hands as a child, ibid., that a Job Corps supervisor had made homosexual overtures toward him, id.,
at 490-491, and that Wiggins was " `borderline' " mentally
retarded, id., at 491.2 Schlaich explained that, although he

2 The only incident contained in the "social history" report about which
Schlaich did not confirm knowledge was the occurrence of sexual abuse in
more than one of Wiggins' foster homes. And that knowledge remained
unconfirmed only because the question posed asked him whether he knew
of reports of abuse at " `one' " of the foster homes. App. 490. The record
does not show that Schlaich knew of all these incidents in the degree of
detail contained in the "social history" report--but it does not show that
he did not, either. In short, given Schlaich's testimony, there is no basis

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
546 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Scalia, J., dissenting
was aware of all this potential mitigating evidence, he chosenot to present it to the jury for a strategic reason--namely,

that it would conflict with his efforts to persuade the jurythat Wiggins was not a " `principal' " in Mrs. Lacs's murder
(i. e., that he did not kill Lacs by his own hand). Id., at504-505.

There are only two possible responses to this testimonythat might salvage Wiggins' ineffective-assistance claim.
The first would be to declare that Schlaich had an ines-capable

duty to hire a social worker to construct a so-called"social history" report, regardless of Schlaich's pre-existing

knowledge of Wiggins' background. Petitioner makes thissuggestion, see Brief for Petitioner 32, n. 8 (asserting that it
was " `a normative standard' " at the time of Wiggins' casefor capital defense lawyers in Maryland to obtain a social
history); and the Court flirts with accepting it, see ante, at524 ("[P]rofessional standards that prevailed in Maryland . . .
at the time of Wiggins' trial" included, for defense of capitalcases, "the preparation of a social history report");

ibid. (cit-ing ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance

of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 11.8.6, p. 133 (1989) (here-inafter ABA Guidelines), which says that counsel should
make efforts " `to discover all reasonably available mitigat-ing evidence' " (emphasis added by the Court)). To think
that the requirement of a "social history" was part of "clearlyestablished Federal law" (which is what $ 2254(d) requires)
when the events here occurred would be absurd. Nothingin our clearly established precedents requires counsel to retain a social worker when he is already largely aware of hisclient's background. To the contrary, Strickland emphasizes that "[t]here are countless ways to provide effectiveassistance in any given case," 466 U. S., at 689, and further
states that "[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected inAmerican Bar Association standards and the like . . . are

for finding that he was without knowledge of anything in the "social history" report.

Scalia, J., dissenting
guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only
guides," id., at 688. Cf. ante, at 524 (treating the ABA
Guidelines as "well-defined norms"). It is inconceivable thatSchlaich, assuming he testified truthfully regarding his detailed knowledge of Wiggins' troubled childhood, App. 490-491, would need to hire a social worker to comport with
Strickland's competence standards. And it certainly would
not have been unreasonable for the Maryland Court of Ap-peals to conclude otherwise.

The second possible response to Schlaich's testimony abouthis extensive awareness of Wiggins' background is to assert
that Schlaich lied. The Court assumes sub silentio throughout its opinion that Schlaich was not telling the truth when
he testified that he knew of reports of sexual abuse in one of
Wiggins' foster homes, see, e. g., ante, at 525 ("Had counsel
investigated further, they might well have discovered the
sexual abuse later revealed during state postconviction proceedings"), and eventually declares straight-out that it disbelieves Schlaich, ante, at 531-533. This conclusion rests upon
a blatant mischaracterization of the record, and an improper
shifting of the burden of proof to the State to demonstrate
Schlaich's awareness of Wiggins' background, rather than requiring Wiggins to prove Schlaich's ignorance of it. But,
more importantly, it is simply not enough for the Court to
conclude, ante, at 533, that it "cannot infer from Schlaich's
postconviction testimony that counsel looked further than
the PSI and DSS reports in investigating petitioner's background." If it is at least reasonable to believe Schlaich told
the truth, then it could not have been unreasonable for the
Maryland Court of Appeals to conclude that Wiggins' trial
attorneys conducted an adequate investigation into his background. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1).

Schlaich's testimony must have been false, the Court insists, because the social services records do not contain any
evidence of sexual abuse, and "the questions put to Schlaich
during his postconviction testimony all referred to what he

539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
548 WIGGINS v. SMITH

Scalia, J., dissenting
knew from the social services records." Ante, at 531. That
is not true. Schlaich was never asked "what he knew from
the social services records." With regard to the alleged
sexual abuse in particular, Schlaich answered " `[y]es' " to
the following question: " `You also knew that where [sic]
were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster homes?' "
This question did not "refe[r] to what [Schlaich] knew from
the social services records," as the Court declares; and neither, by the way, did any of the other questions put to
Schlaich regarding his knowledge of Wiggins' background.
See App. 490-491. Wiggins' postconviction counsel simply
never asked Schlaich to reveal the source of his knowledge.

Schlaich's most likely source of knowledge of the alleged
sexual abuse was Wiggins himself; even Hans Selvog's extensive "social history" report unearthed no documentation
or corroborating witnesses with respect to that claim. Id.,
at 464; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 177a, 193a. The Court,
however, dismisses this possibility for two reasons. First,
because "the record contains no evidence that counsel
ever pursued this line of questioning with Wiggins." Ante,
at 532. This statement calls for a timeout to get our bearings: The burden of proof here is on Wiggins to show that
counsel made their decision without adequate knowledge.
See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687. And when counsel has
testified, under oath, that he did have particular knowledge,
the burden is not on counsel to show how he obtained it, but
on Wiggins (if he wishes to impeach that testimony) to show
that counsel could not have obtained it. Thus, the absence
of evidence in the record as to whether or not Schlaich pursued this line of questioning with Wiggins dooms, rather
than fortifies, Wiggins' ineffective-assistance claim. Wiggins has produced no evidence that anything in Hans Selvog's "social history" report was unknown to Schlaich, and
no evidence that any source on which Selvog relied was not
used by Schlaich.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court's second reason for rejecting the possibility thatSchlaich learned of the alleged sexual abuse from Wiggins is

even more incomprehensible. The Court claims that "thephrase `other people's reports' [would] have been an unusual
way for counsel to refer to conversations with his client."Ante, at 532. But Schlaich never used the phrase "other
people's reports" in describing how he learned of the allegedsexual abuse in Wiggins' foster homes. Schlaich testified
only that he learned of Wiggins' borderline mental retardation as it was reported in " `other people's reports' ":

" `Q And you also knew that he was borderline men-tally retarded?

" `A Yes.
" `Q You knew all--
" `A At least I knew that as it was reported in other
people's reports, yes.

" `Q But you knew it?
" `A Yes.' " App. 490-491 (emphasis added).

It is clear that when Schlaich said, " `At least I knew that asit was reported in other people's reports,' " id., at 491 (emphasis added), the " `that' " to which he referred was the factthat Wiggins was borderline mentally retarded--not the
other details of Wiggins' background which Schlaich had pre-viously testified he knew.

The Court's final reason for disbelieving Schlaich's sworntestimony is his failure to mention the alleged sexual abuse
in the proffer of mitigating evidence he would introduce ifthe trial court granted his motion to bifurcate. "Counsel's
failure to include in the proffer the powerful evidence of re-peated sexual abuse is . . . explicable only if we assume that
counsel had no knowledge of the abuse." Ante, at 533. Butbecause the

only evidence of sexual abuse consisted of Wig-gins' own assertions, see App. 464; App. to Pet. for Cert.

177a, 193a (evidence not exactly worthy of the Court's flat-tering description as "powerful"),

there was nothing to prof539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

fer unless Schlaich declared an intent to put Wiggins onthe stand. Given counsel's chosen trial strategy to prevent

Wiggins from testifying during the sentencing proceedings,the decision not to mention sexual abuse in the proffer is
perfectly consistent with counsel's claimed knowledge of thealleged abuse.

Of course these reasons the Court offers--which rangefrom the incredible up to the feeble--are used only in support of the Court's conclusion that, in its independent judgment, Schlaich was lying. The Court does not even attemptto establish (as it must) that it was objectively unreasonable

for the state court to believe Schlaich's testimony and there-fore conclude that he conducted an adequate investigation of
Wiggins' background. It could not possibly make this show-ing. Wiggins has not produced any direct evidence that his
attorneys were uninformed with respect to anything in hisbackground, and the Court can muster no circumstantial evidence beyond the powerfully unconvincing fact that Schlaichfailed to mention the allegations of sexual abuse in his proffer. To make things worse, the Court is still bound (thoughone would not know it from the opinion) by the state court's
factual determinations that Wiggins' trial counsel "did inves-tigate and

were aware of [Wiggins'] background," Wiggins,352 Md., at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16 (emphasis in original), and

that "[c]ounsel were aware that [Wiggins] had a most un-fortunate childhood," id., at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15. See 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1).3 Because it is at least reasonable to be3 The Court defends its refusal to adhere to these state-court factual
determinations on the ground that "the Maryland Court of Appeals' conclusion that the scope of counsel's investigation . . . met the legal standards
set forth in Strickland represented an objectively unreasonable application of our precedent." Ante, at 528-529. That is an inadequate response, for several reasons. First, because in the very course of determining what was the scope of counsel's investigation, the Court was bound
to accept (as it did not) the Maryland Court of Appeals' factual findings
that counsel knew of Wiggins' background, including his "most unfortunate childhood." And it is an inadequate response, secondly, because even

lieve Schlaich's testimony, and because $ 2254(e)(1) requiresus to respect the state court's factual determination that

Wiggins' trial attorneys were aware of Wiggins' background,the Maryland Court of Appeals' legal conclusion--that trial
counsel "did not have as detailed or graphic a history as wasprepared by Mr. Selvog, but that is not a Constitutional
deficiency," Wiggins, supra, at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16 (empha-sis added)--is unassailable under $ 2254(d)(1).

B
The Court holds in the alternative that Wiggins has satis-fied $ 2254(d)(2), which allows a habeas petitioner to escape

$ 2254(d)'s bar to relief when the state court's adjudicationof his claim "resulted in a decision that was

based on anunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding." (Emphasisadded.) This is so, the Court says, because the Maryland
Court of Appeals wrongly claimed that Wiggins' social serv-ices records "recorded incidences of . . . sexual abuse." 352
Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15.That it made that claim is true enough. And I will concede that Wiggins has rebutted the presumption of correct-ness by the "clear and convincing evidence" that $ 2254(e)(1)
requires. It is both clear and convincing from reading theDSS records that they contain no evidence of sexual abuse.
I will also assume, arguendo, that the state court's error was"unreasonable" in light of the evidence presented in the
state-court proceeding.Given all that, the Court's conclusion that a $ 2254(d)(2)
case has been made out still suffers from the irreparable deafter the Court concludes that the petitioner has avoided $ 2254(d)'s bar to
relief because of that misapplication of Strickland (or because of the alleged mistaken factual assumption "that counsel learned of . . . sexual
abuse . . . from the DSS records," ante, at 529), it still must observe

$ 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness in deciding the merits of the habeas question. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 341, 348 (2003).

fect that the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision was not"based on" this mistaken factual determination. What difference did it make whether the social services recordscontained evidence of sexual abuse? Even if they did not,
the court's decision would have been the same in light ofSchlaich's sworn testimony that he was aware of the alleged
sexual abuse. The source of Schlaich's knowledge--whetherhe obtained it from the DSS reports or from Wiggins himself--was of no consequence. The only thing that matteredwas that Schlaich

knew, and testified under oath that heknew, enough about Wiggins' background to make it reasonable to proceed without a report by a social worker. TheCourt's opinion does not even discuss this requirement of

$ 2254(d)(2), that the unreasonable determination of facts beone on which the state-court decision was based.

II
The Court's indefensible holding that Wiggins has avoided$ 2254(d)'s bar to relief is not alone enough to entitle Wiggins

to habeas relief on his Sixth Amendment claim. Wigginsstill must establish that he was "prejudiced" by his counsel's
alleged "error." Strickland, 466 U. S., at 691-696. Spe-cifically, Wiggins must demonstrate that, if his trial attorneys had retained a licensed social worker to assemble a"social history" of their client, there is a "reasonable probability" that (1) his attorneys would have chosen to presentthe social history evidence to the jury,

and (2) upon hearingthat evidence, the jury would have spared his life. The

Court's analysis on these points continues its disregard forthe record in a determined procession toward a seemingly
preordained result.There is no "reasonable probability" that a social-history
investigation would have altered the chosen strategy of Wig-gins' trial counsel. As noted earlier, Schlaich was well
aware--without the benefit of a "social history" report--thatWiggins had a troubled childhood and background. And the

Court remains bound, even after concluding that Wiggins hassatisfied the standards of $$ 2254(d)(1) and (d)(2), by the state

court's factual determination that Wiggins' trial attorneys"

were aware of [Wiggins'] background," Wiggins, 352 Md., at
610, 724 A. 2d, at 16 (emphasis in original), and "were awarethat [Wiggins] had a most unfortunate childhood,"

id., at 608,
724 A. 2d, at 15. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1). Wiggins' trial
attorneys chose, however, not to present evidence of Wig-gins' background to the jury because of their "deliberate,

tactical decision to concentrate their effort at convincing thejury that appellant was not a principal in the killing of
Ms. Lacs." Wiggins, supra, at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15.Wiggins has not shown that the incremental information
in Hans Selvog's social-history report would have inducedcounsel to change this course. Schlaich testified under oath
that presenting the type of evidence in Selvog 's report wouldhave conflicted with his chosen defense strategy to raise
doubts as to Wiggins' role as a principal, and that he wanted
to avoid a "shotgun approach" with the jury. App. 504-505.4
(This testimony is entirely unrefuted by the Court's statement that at the time of trial counsel "were not in a position
to make a reasonable strategic choice," because of their alleged inadequate investigation, ante, at 536. Schlaich presented this testimony in state postconviction proceedings,
when there was no doubt he was fully aware of the details of
Wiggins' background. See App. 490-491.) It is irrelevant
whether a hypothetical "reasonable attorney" might have introduced evidence of alleged sexual abuse, ante, at 535-536;
Wiggins' attorneys would not have done so, and therefore

4 Introducing evidence that Wiggins suffered semiweekly (or perhaps
daily) sexual abuse as a child, for example, could have led the jury to
conclude that this horrible experience made Wiggins precisely the type of
person who could perpetrate this bizarre crime--in which a 77-year-old
woman was found drowned in the bathtub of her apartment, clothed but
missing her underwear, and sprayed with Black Flag Ant and Roach
Killer.

Wiggins was not prejudiced by their allegedly inadequateinvestigation. There is simply nothing to show (and the

Court does not even dare to assert) that there is a "reason-able probability" this evidence would have been introduced
in this case. Ante, at 535-536.What is more, almost all of Selvog's social-history evidence
was inadmissible at the time of Wiggins' trial. Marylandlaw provides that evidence in a capital sentencing proceeding
must be "reliable" to be admissible, see Whittlesey v. State,340 Md. 30, 70, 665 A. 2d 223, 243 (1995), and many of

the anecdotes regarding Wiggins' childhood consist of thebaldest hearsay--statements that have been neither taken
in court, nor given under oath, nor subjected to cross-examination, nor even submitted in the form of a signed affidavit. Consider, for example, the allegation that Wiggins'foster father sexually abused him " `two or three times a
week, sometimes everyday,' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 177a.The

only source of that information was Wiggins himself,in his unsworn and un-cross-examined interview with Hans

Selvog. There is absolutely no documentation or corrobora-tion of the claim, App. 464, and the allegedly abusive foster
parent is apparently deceased, id., at 470. Wiggins was,however, examined by a pediatrician during the time that
this supposed biweekly or daily sexual abuse occurred, andthe pediatrician's report mentioned no signs of sexual abuse.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a; App. 464.Much of the other "evidence" in Selvog 's report (including
Wiggins' claim that he was drugged by his Job Corps super-visor and raped while unconscious, and that he was raped by
the teenage sons at his fourth foster home) was also undocu-mented and based entirely on Wiggins' say-so. The Court
treats all this uncorroborated gossip as established fact,5

5 Wiggins' postconviction lawyers could have increased the credibility of
these anecdotes, and assisted this Court's prejudice determination, by at
least having Wiggins testify under oath in the state postconviction proceedings as to his allegedly abusive childhood. They did not do that--

ante, at 534-535--indeed, even refers to it as "powerful" evi-dence, ante, at 534--and assumes that Wiggins' lawyers

could have simply handed Hans Selvog 's report to the jury.Nothing could be further from the truth. As the State Circuit Court explained in rejecting Wiggins' Sixth Amendmentclaim, "Selvog's report would have had a great deal of difficulty in getting into evidence in Maryland. He was not li-censed in Maryland, the report contains multiple instances
of hearsay, it contains many opinions in the nature of diagno-sis of a medical nature." App. to Pet. for Cert. 156a.

The Court contends that Selvog's report "may have beenadmissible,"

ante, at 536--relying for that contention uponWhittlesey v. State, supra. Whittlesey, however, merely vacated the trial judge's decision that a social-history reportassembled by Selvog was per se inadmissible on hearsay
grounds and remanded for a determination whether thehearsay evidence was "reliable." Id., at 71-72, 665 A. 2d, at
243. Thus, unless the Court is prepared to make the implau-sible contention that Wiggins' hearsay statements in Selvog's report are "reliable" under Maryland law, there is nobasis for its conclusion that Maryland "consider[s] this type
of evidence relevant at sentencing," ante, at 537. The StateCircuit Court in the present case, in its decision that postdated Whittlesey, certainly did not think Selvog 's report metthe standard of reliability, App. to Pet. for Cert. 156a, and
that court's assessment was undoubtedly correct. Wiggins'accounts of his background, as reported by Selvog, are the
hearsay statements of a convicted murderer and, as the trialtestimony in this case demonstrates, a serial liar. Wiggins lied to Geraldine Armstrong when he told her thatMrs. Lacs's car belongs to " `a buddy of min[e],' " App. 179.
He lied when he told the police that he had obtained

Court to vacate a jury verdict of death on the basis of rumor and innuendo
in a "social history" report that would never be admissible in a court

Mrs. Lacs's car and credit cards on Friday in the afternoon,rather than Thursday,

id., at 180. He lied to Armstrong
about how he obtained Mrs. Lacs's ring, ibid. And, knowingthat the information he provided to Selvog would be used to

attack his death sentence, Wiggins had every incentive to lieagain about the supposed abuse he suffered. The hearsay
statements in Selvog 's report pertaining to the alleged sexual abuse were of especially dubious reliability; Marylandcourts have consistently refused to allow hearsay evidence

regarding alleged sexual abuse, except for statements pro-vided by the victim to a treating physician. See

Bohnert v.
State, 312 Md. 266, 276, 539 A. 2d 657, 662 (1988) (refusing to
admit into evidence a social worker's opinion, based on a
child's "unsubstantiated averments," that the child had been
sexually abused); Nixon v. State, 140 Md. App. 170, 178-188,
780 A. 2d 344, 349-354 (2001) (child protective services
agent's testimony that retarded teenager told agent she had
been sexually abused was inadmissible hearsay); Low v.
State, 119 Md. App. 413, 424-426, 705 A. 2d 67, 73-74 (1998)
(refusing to admit into evidence examining physician's testimony regarding a child's statements of sexual abuse).

Given that the anecdotes in Selvog 's report were unreliable, and therefore inadmissible, the only way Wiggins' trial
attorneys could have presented these allegations to the jury
would have been to place Wiggins on the witness stand.
Wiggins has not established (and the Court does not assert)
any "reasonable probability" that they would have done
this, given the dangers they saw in exposing their client to
cross-examination over a wide range of issues. See App.
353 (Wiggins' trial attorneys advising him in open court:
" `Kevin, if you do take the witness stand, you must answer
any question that's asked of you. If it is a question the
judge rules is a permissible question, you would have to answer' "). Their perception of those dangers must surely
have been heightened by their observation of Wiggins' volatile and obnoxious behavior throughout the trial. See, e. g.,

out. . . . I didn't do it. He can't tell me I did it' "); id., at 56(Wiggins interrupting the prosecutor's opening argument to
say: " `I'm not going to take that because I didn't kill thatlady. I'm not going to sit there and take that' ").

But even indulging, for the sake of argument, the Court'sbelief that Selvog's report "may" have been admissible,

ante,at 536, the Court's prejudice discussion simply assumes without analysis that the sentencing jury would have believedthe report's hearsay accounts of Wiggins' statements. Ante,
at 536-537. Yet that same jury would have learned duringthe guilt phase of the trial that Wiggins is a proven liar, see
App. 179-180, and Wiggins would not have aided his credibil-ity with the jury by avoiding the witness stand and funneling
his story through a social worker. I doubt very much thatWiggins' jury would have shared the Court's uncritical and
wholesale acceptance of these hearsay claims.

Today's decision is extraordinary--even for our " `death-is-different' " jurisprudence. See Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154, 185 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Itfails to give effect to $ 2254(e)(1)'s requirement that statecourt factual determinations be presumed correct, and disbe-lieves the sworn testimony of a member of the bar while
treating hearsay accounts of statements of a convicted mur-derer as established fact. I dissent.

LAWRENCE et al. v. TEXAS
certiorari to the court of appeals of texas,fourteenth district

No. 02-102. Argued March 26, 2003--Decided June 26, 2003
Responding to a reported weapons disturbance in a private residence,

Houston police entered petitioner Lawrence's apartment and saw him
and another adult man, petitioner Garner, engaging in a private, consensual sexual act. Petitioners were arrested and convicted of deviate sexual intercourse in violation of a Texas statute forbidding two persons of
the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In affirming, the State Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that the statute was
not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The court considered Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186,
controlling on that point.

Held: The Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same

sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. Pp. 564-579.

(a) Resolution of this case depends on whether petitioners were free
as adults to engage in private conduct in the exercise of their liberty
under the Due Process Clause. For this inquiry the Court deems it
necessary to reconsider its Bowers holding. The Bowers Court's initial
substantive statement--"The issue presented is whether the Federal
Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage
in sodomy . . . ," 478 U. S., at 190--discloses the Court's failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in
Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a
married couple were it said that marriage is just about the right to have
sexual intercourse. Although the laws involved in Bowers and here
purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act, their penalties and purposes have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon
the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. They seek to control a personal relationship
that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within
the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons
the right to choose to enter upon relationships in the confines of their
homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free
persons. Pp. 564-567.

Syllabus
(b) Having misapprehended the liberty claim presented to it, the
Bowers Court stated that proscriptions against sodomy have ancient
roots. 478 U. S., at 192. It should be noted, however, that there is no
longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter. Early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally, whether between men and women
or men and men. Moreover, early sodomy laws seem not to have been
enforced against consenting adults acting in private. Instead, sodomy
prosecutions often involved predatory acts against those who could not
or did not consent: relations between men and minor girls or boys, between adults involving force, between adults implicating disparity in
status, or between men and animals. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which Bowers placed such reliance is
as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is
with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character. Far from possessing "ancient roots," ibid., American
laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of
the 20th century. Even now, only nine States have singled out samesex relations for criminal prosecution. Thus, the historical grounds relied upon in Bowers are more complex than the majority opinion and
the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger there indicated. They
are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated. The Bowers Court was, of course, making the broader point that for centuries
there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral, but this Court's obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to
mandate its own moral code, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.
v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 850. The Nation's laws and traditions in the
past half century are most relevant here. They show an emerging
awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in
deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.
See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 857. Pp. 567-573.

(c) Bowers' deficiencies became even more apparent in the years following its announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the conduct referenced in Bowers are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce
their laws only against homosexual conduct. In those States, including
Texas, that still proscribe sodomy (whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct), there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. Casey, supra, at 851--which confirmed that the Due Process Clause protects personal decisions relating
to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education--and Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 624--which
struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals--cast Bow539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
ers' holding into even more doubt. The stigma the Texas criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. Although the offense is but a
minor misdemeanor, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports
for the dignity of the persons charged, including notation of convictions
on their records and on job application forms, and registration as sex
offenders under state law. Where a case's foundations have sustained
serious erosion, criticism from other sources is of greater significance.
In the United States, criticism of Bowers has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not just as to its
historical assumptions. And, to the extent Bowers relied on values
shared with a wider civilization, the case's reasoning and holding have
been rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, and that other
nations have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected
right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct.
There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or
urgent. Stare decisis is not an inexorable command. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828. Bowers' holding has not induced detrimental
reliance of the sort that could counsel against overturning it once there
are compelling reasons to do so. Casey, supra, at 855-856. Bowers
causes uncertainty, for the precedents before and after it contradict its
central holding. Pp. 573-577.

(d) Bowers' rationale does not withstand careful analysis. In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded that (1) the fact
that a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular
practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice, and (2) individual decisions concerning the intimacies
of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring,
are a form of "liberty" protected by due process. That analysis should
have controlled Bowers, and it controls here. Bowers was not correct
when it was decided, is not correct today, and is hereby overruled. This
case does not involve minors, persons who might be injured or coerced,
those who might not easily refuse consent, or public conduct or prostitution. It does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent,
engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. Petitioners' right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the
full right to engage in private conduct without government intervention. Casey, supra, at 847. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate
state interest which can justify its intrusion into the individual's personal and private life. Pp. 577-579.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Liberty protects the person from unwarranted govern-ment intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In

our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. Andthere are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside
the home, where the State should not be a dominant pres-ence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty
presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom ofthought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.
The instant case involves liberty of the person both in itsspatial and in its more transcendent dimensions.

I
The question before the Court is the validity of a Texasstatute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to

engage in certain intimate sexual conduct.In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in responseto a reported weapons disturbance. They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners, John Geddes Lawrence,

resided. The right of the police to enter does not seem tohave been questioned. The officers observed Lawrence and

another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act. Thetwo petitioners were arrested, held in custody overnight, and
charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.The complaints described their crime as "deviate sexual
intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex(man)." App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a, 139a. The applicable
state law is Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 21.06(a) (2003). It pro-vides: "A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate
sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex."The statute defines "[d]eviate sexual intercourse" as follows:

"(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of oneperson and the mouth or anus of another person; or
"(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an object." $ 21.01(1).

The petitioners exercised their right to a trial de novo inHarris County Criminal Court. They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment and of a like provision of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const., Art. 1, $ 3a. Those contentions were
rejected. The petitioners, having entered a plea of nolo

$141.25. App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a-110a.The Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District

considered the petitioners' federal constitutional argumentsunder both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment. After hearing the case enbanc the court, in a divided opinion, rejected the constitutional arguments and affirmed the convictions. 41 S. W. 3d349 (2001). The majority opinion indicates that the Court of
Appeals considered our decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478U. S. 186 (1986), to be controlling on the federal due process
aspect of the case. Bowers then being authoritative, this
was proper.

564 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1044 (2002), to consider
three questions:

1. Whether petitioners' criminal convictions under the
Texas "Homosexual Conduct" law--which criminalizes
sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical
behavior by different-sex couples--violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of
the laws.

2. Whether petitioners' criminal convictions for adult
consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their
vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

3. Whether Bowers v. Hardwick, supra, should be overruled? See Pet. for Cert. i.

The petitioners were adults at the time of the alleged offense. Their conduct was in private and consensual.

II
We conclude the case should be resolved by determining
whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the
private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution. For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider the Court's holding in Bowers.

There are broad statements of the substantive reach of
liberty under the Due Process Clause in earlier cases, including Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), and
Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); but the most pertinent beginning point is our decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965).

In Griswold the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting
the use of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling
or aiding and abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court
described the protected interest as a right to privacy and

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

565Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
placed emphasis on the marriage relation and the protectedspace of the marital bedroom.

Id., at 485.
After Griswold it was established that the right to makecertain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond

the marital relationship. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S.438 (1972), the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons. The case
was decided under the Equal Protection Clause, id., at 454;but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on

to state the fundamental proposition that the law impairedthe exercise of their personal rights,

ibid. It quoted from
the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to bein conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed

with this statement of its own:

"It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. . . . If the rightof privacy means anything, it is the right of the

individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted gov-ernmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or begeta child."

Id., at 453.

The opinions in Griswold and Eisenstadt were part of thebackground for the decision in

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113
(1973). As is well known, the case involved a challenge tothe Texas law prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other

States were affected as well. Although the Court held thewoman's rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exerciseof her liberty under the Due Process Clause. The Court
cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go
well beyond it. Roe recognized the right of a woman to
make certain fundamental decisions affecting her destiny
and confirmed once more that the protection of liberty under
the Due Process Clause has a substantive dimension of fundamental significance in defining the rights of the person.

566 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
In Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977),the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to persons under 16 yearsof age. Although there was no single opinion for the Court,
the law was invalidated. Both Eisenstadt and Carey, aswell as the holding and rationale in

Roe, confirmed that the
reasoning of Griswold could not be confined to the protection
of rights of married adults. This was the state of the lawwith respect to some of the most relevant cases when the

Court considered Bowers v. Hardwick.The facts in

Bowers had some similarities to the instant
case. A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to
have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another
adult male. The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy. One
difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute
prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were
of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen,
applies only to participants of the same sex. Hardwick was
not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court
to declare the state statute invalid. He alleged he was a
practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution. The
Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia
law. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the
opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.
Four Justices dissented. 478 U. S., at 199 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ.);
id., at 214 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and
Marshall, JJ.).

The Court began its substantive discussion in Bowers as
follows: "The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many
States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

567Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
for a very long time." Id., at 190. That statement, we nowconclude, discloses the Court's own failure to appreciate the

extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct
demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as itwould demean a married couple were it to be said marriage

is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse. The
laws involved in Bowers and here are, to be sure, statutesthat purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual

act. Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private
human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of
places, the home. The statutes do seek to control a personal
relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose
without being punished as criminals.

This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by
the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or
abuse of an institution the law protects. It suffices for us
to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this
relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.
When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct
with another person, the conduct can be but one element in
a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the
right to make this choice.

Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there
is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the
Bowers Court said: "Proscriptions against that conduct have
ancient roots." Id., at 192. In academic writings, and in
many of the scholarly amicus briefs filed to assist the Court
in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of the historical
premises relied upon by the majority and concurring opin539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ions in Bowers. Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae16-17; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as

Amici Curiae 15-21; Brief for Professors of History et al.as

Amici Curiae 3-10. We need not enter this debate in
the attempt to reach a definitive historical judgment, butthe following considerations counsel against adopting the definitive conclusions upon which Bowers placed such reliance.

At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstand-ing history in this country of laws directed at homosexual

conduct as a distinct matter. Beginning in colonial timesthere were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English
criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation
Parliament of 1533. The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well
as relations between men and men. See, e. g., King v. Wiseman, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting
"mankind" in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).
Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American
sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men. See, e. g., 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law

$ 1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 47-50 (5th Am. ed.
1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law
143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes $ 203 (2d ed. 1893).
The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual
conduct may be explained in part by noting that according
to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct
category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.
See, e. g., J. Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality 10 (1995);
J. D'Emilio & E. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of
Sexuality in America 121 (2d ed. 1997) ("The modern terms
homosexuality and heterosexuality do not apply to an era
that had not yet articulated these distinctions"). Thus early
American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as
such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual
activity more generally. This does not suggest approval of

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

569Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
homosexual conduct. It does tend to show that this particu-lar form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category

from like conduct between heterosexual persons.Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A sub-stantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for
which there are surviving records were for predatory acts
against those who could not or did not consent, as in the caseof a minor or the victim of an assault. As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be nolack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that
did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus
the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century
treatise, see 2 Chitty, supra, at 49, addressed the predatory
acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy. Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved
relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between
adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between
men and animals.

To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the
acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain
even taking into account the problems always inherent in
prosecuting consensual acts committed in private. Under
then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of
sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice. A partner's testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not
consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable
of consent. See, e. g., F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed.
1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880). The
rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions. In all events that infrequency makes it difficult
to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic

570 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
punishment of the consensual acts committed in privateand by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the Bowers decision placedsuch reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of
nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition ofprosecuting acts because of their homosexual character.

The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts
was not much discussed in the early legal literature. Wecan infer that one reason for this was the very private nature

of the conduct. Despite the absence of prosecutions, theremay have been periods in which there was public criticism
of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal
laws be enforced to discourage their practices. But far from
possessing "ancient roots," Bowers, 478 U. S., at 192, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until
the last third of the 20th century. The reported decisions
concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 1880-1995 are not always
clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 14-15, and n. 18.

It was not until the 1970's that any State singled out
same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine
States have done so. See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983
Kan. Sess. Laws p. 652; 1974 Ky. Acts p. 847; 1977 Mo. Laws
p. 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p. 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p. 1632;
1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399;
see also Post v. State, 715 P. 2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986)
(sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).
Post-Bowers even some of these States did not adhere to the
policy of suppressing homosexual conduct. Over the course
of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have
moved toward abolishing them. See, e. g., Jegley v. Picado,
349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332 (2002); Gryczan v. State, 283
Mont. 433, 942 P. 2d 112 (1997); Campbell v. Sundquist, 926
S. W. 2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996); Commonwealth v. Wasson,

842 S. W. 2d 487 (Ky. 1992); see also 1993 Nev. Stats. p. 518(repealing Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 201.193).

In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in Bowersare more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate. Their histori-cal premises are not without doubt and, at the very least,
are overstated.

It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there
have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conductas immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior,
and respect for the traditional family. For many persons
these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they
aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.
These considerations do not answer the question before us,
however. The issue is whether the majority may use the
power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. "Our obligation
is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral
code." Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,
505 U. S. 833, 850 (1992).

Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in
Bowers and further explained his views as follows: "Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have
been subject to state intervention throughout the history of
Western civilization. Condemnation of those practices is
firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards." 478 U. S., at 196. As with Justice White's assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the
sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger
as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults. See, e. g., Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656. In all events we think
that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
572 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
most relevance here. These references show an emergingawareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult

persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in mat-ters pertaining to sex. "[H]istory and tradition are the
starting point but not in all cases the ending point of thesubstantive due process inquiry."

County of Sacramento
v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 857 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring).

This emerging recognition should have been apparentwhen

Bowers was decided. In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clearthat it did not recommend or provide for "criminal penalties

for consensual sexual relations conducted in private." ALI,
Model Penal Code $ 213.2, Comment 2, p. 372 (1980). It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many
people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct
not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily
enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail. ALI,
Model Penal Code, Commentary 277-280 (Tent. Draft No. 4,
1955). In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the
Model Penal Code. Other States soon followed. Brief for
Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 15-16.

In Bowers the Court referred to the fact that before 1961
all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of
the Court's decision 24 States and the District of Columbia
had sodomy laws. 478 U. S., at 192-193. Justice Powell
pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored,
however. Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce
its law for decades. Id., at 197-198, n. 2 ("The history of
nonenforcement suggests the moribund character today of
laws criminalizing this type of private, consensual conduct").

The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the
history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral
and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction. A committee advising
the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
punishing homosexual conduct. The Wolfenden Report: Re-port of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963). Parliament enacted the substance of those rec-ommendations 10 years later. Sexual Offences Act 1967, $ 1.

Of even more importance, almost five years before Bowerswas decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to Bowers and to today's case. An
adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was apracticing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual

homosexual conduct. The laws of Northern Ireland forbadehim that right. He alleged that he had been questioned, his
home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.
The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were
invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) || 52.
Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision
is at odds with the premise in Bowers that the claim put
forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization.

In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in Bowers became even more apparent in the years following its
announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the Bowers decision are reduced
now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct. In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there
is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. The State of Texas admitted
in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone
under those circumstances. State v. Morales, 869 S. W. 2d
941, 943.

Two principal cases decided after Bowers cast its holding
into even more doubt. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the
Due Process Clause. The Casey decision again confirmed

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
574 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Opinion of the Court
that our laws and tradition afford constitutional protectionto personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.
Id., at 851. In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making thesechoices, we stated as follows:

"These matters, involving the most intimate and per-sonal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices
central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central tothe liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's ownconcept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of
the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters
could not define the attributes of personhood were theyformed under compulsion of the State."

Ibid.

Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for
these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do. The deci-sion in

Bowers would deny them this right.
The second post-Bowers case of principal relevance is
Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996). There the Court
struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals
as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Romer invali-dated an amendment to Colorado's Constitution which named

as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians,or bisexual either by "orientation, conduct, practices or relationships," id., at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted), anddeprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination
laws. We concluded that the provision was "born of animos-ity toward the class of persons affected" and further that it
had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose. Id., at 634.

As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the
petitioners and some amici contend that Romer provides the
basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal
Protection Clause. That is a tenable argument, but we con539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

575Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
clude the instant case requires us to address whether Bowersitself has continuing validity. Were we to hold the statute

invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might ques-tion whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sexand different-sex participants.

Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand
respect for conduct protected by the substantive guaranteeof liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on

the latter point advances both interests. If protected con-duct is made criminal and the law which does so remains
unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons. When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself
is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres. The central holding of Bowers has been brought in question by this
case, and it should be addressed. Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons.

The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not
trivial. The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system. Still, it
remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged. The petitioners will bear on

This underscores the consequential nature of the punishmentand the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition. Furthermore, the Texas criminal convic-tion carries with it the other collateral consequences always
following a conviction, such as notations on job application
forms, to mention but one example.The foundations of

Bowers have sustained serious erosion
from our recent decisions in Casey and Romer. When ourprecedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other

sources is of greater significance. In the United States criticism of Bowers has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not just as to its
historical assumptions. See, e. g., C. Fried, Order and Law:
Arguing the Reagan Revolution--A Firsthand Account
81-84 (1991); R. Posner, Sex and Reason 341-350 (1992).
The courts of five different States have declined to follow it
in interpreting provisions in their own state constitutions
parallel to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Jegley v. Picado, 349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332
(2002); Powell v. State, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S. E. 2d 18, 24 (1998);
Gryczan v. State, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P. 2d 112 (1997); Campbell v. Sundquist, 926 S. W. 2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996); Commonwealth v. Wasson, 842 S. W. 2d 487 (Ky. 1992).

To the extent Bowers relied on values we share with a
wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and
holding in Bowers have been rejected elsewhere. The European Court of Human Rights has followed not Bowers
but its own decision in Dudgeon v. United Kingdom. See
P. G. & J. H. v. United Kingdom, App. No. 00044787/98, || 56

Other nations, too, have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct. See Brief for Mary

Opinion of the Court
Robinson et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12. The right the peti-tioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral

part of human freedom in many other countries. There hasbeen no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legiti-mate or urgent.

The doctrine of stare decisis is essential to the respectaccorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability
of the law. It is not, however, an inexorable command.
Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991) ("Stare decisisis not an inexorable command; rather, it `is a principle of

policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the lat-est decision' " (quoting Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106,
119 (1940))). In Casey we noted that when a court is askedto overrule a precedent recognizing a constitutional liberty
interest, individual or societal reliance on the existence ofthat liberty cautions with particular strength against reversing course. 505 U. S., at 855-856; see also id., at 844 ("Lib-erty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt"). The holding in Bowers, however, has not induced detrimental reliancecomparable to some instances where recognized individual
rights are involved. Indeed, there has been no individual orsocietal reliance on

Bowers of the sort that could counselagainst overturning its holding once there are compelling

reasons to do so. Bowers itself causes uncertainty, for theprecedents before and after its issuance contradict its central holding.The rationale of Bowers does not withstand careful analysis. In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevenscame to these conclusions:

"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantlyclear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a
State has traditionally viewed a particular practice asimmoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law
prohibiting the practice; neither history nor traditioncould save a law prohibiting miscegenation from consti539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tutional attack. Second, individual decisions by mar-ried persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical

relationship, even when not intended to produce off-spring, are a form of `liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover,this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried
as well as married persons." 478 U. S., at 216 (footnotesand citations omitted).

Justice Stevens' analysis, in our view, should have beencontrolling in Bowers and should control here.

Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is notcorrect today. It ought not to remain binding precedent.
Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is overruled.The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who aresituated in relationships where consent might not easily be
refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual personsseek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with
full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexualpractices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners
are entitled to respect for their private lives. The Statecannot demean their existence or control their destiny by
making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right toliberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full
right to engage in their conduct without intervention of thegovernment. "It is a promise of the Constitution that there
is a realm of personal liberty which the government may notenter." Casey, supra, at 847. The Texas statute furthers
no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusioninto the personal and private life of the individual.

Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clausesof the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment
known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities,they might have been more specific. They did not presume

to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to cer-tain truths and later generations can see that laws once

thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress.As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can
invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed, and the case is remanded for fur-ther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
The Court today overrules Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S.186 (1986). I joined Bowers, and do not join the Court in

overruling it. Nevertheless, I agree with the Court thatTexas' statute banning same-sex sodomy is unconstitutional.
See Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 21.06 (2003). Rather than rely-ing on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, as the Court does, I base myconclusion on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment "is essentially a direction that all persons similarlysituated should be treated alike." Cleburne v. Cleburne
Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 439 (1985); see also Plylerv.

Doe, 457 U. S. 202, 216 (1982). Under our rational basisstandard of review, "legislation is presumed to be valid and

will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute isrationally related to a legitimate state interest." Cleburne
v. Cleburne Living Center, supra, at 440; see also Depart-ment of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534 (1973);
Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 632-633 (1996); Nordlingerv. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1992).

Laws such as economic or tax legislation that are scruti-nized under rational basis review normally pass constitutional muster, since "the Constitution presumes that evenimprovident decisions will eventually be rectified by the

democratic processes." Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, supra, at 440; see also Fitzgerald v. Racing Assn. of
Central Iowa, ante, p. 103; Williamson v. Lee Optical of
Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). We have consistently held,
however, that some objectives, such as "a bare . . . desire toharm a politically unpopular group," are not legitimate state

interests. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, supra, at
534. See also Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, supra,at 446-447;

Romer v. Evans, supra, at 632. When a law
exhibits such a desire to harm a politically unpopular group,we have applied a more searching form of rational basis review to strike down such laws under the Equal Protection
Clause.

We have been most likely to apply rational basis review
to hold a law unconstitutional under the Equal Protection
Clause where, as here, the challenged legislation inhibits
personal relationships. In Department of Agriculture v.
Moreno, for example, we held that a law preventing those
households containing an individual unrelated to any other
member of the household from receiving food stamps violated equal protection because the purpose of the law was
to " `discriminate against hippies.' " 413 U. S., at 534. The
asserted governmental interest in preventing food stamp
fraud was not deemed sufficient to satisfy rational basis review. Id., at 535-538. In Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S.
438, 447-455 (1972), we refused to sanction a law that discriminated between married and unmarried persons by prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to single persons.
Likewise, in Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, supra, we
held that it was irrational for a State to require a home for
the mentally disabled to obtain a special use permit when
other residences--like fraternity houses and apartment
buildings--did not have to obtain such a permit. And in
Romer v. Evans, we disallowed a state statute that "impos[ed] a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single
named group"--specifically, homosexuals. 517 U. S., at 632.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
The statute at issue here makes sodomy a crime only if aperson "engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another

individual of the same sex." Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 21.06(a)(2003). Sodomy between opposite-sex partners, however, is
not a crime in Texas. That is, Texas treats the same con-duct differently based solely on the participants. Those
harmed by this law are people who have a same-sex sexual
orientation and thus are more likely to engage in behaviorprohibited by $ 21.06.

The Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyesof the law by making particular conduct--and only that conduct--subject to criminal sanction. It appears that prosecutions under Texas' sodomy law are rare. See State v. Morales, 869 S. W. 2d 941, 943 (Tex. 1994) (noting in 1994 that

$ 21.06 "has not been, and in all probability will not be, enforced against private consensual conduct between adults").
This case shows, however, that prosecutions under $ 21.06 do
occur. And while the penalty imposed on petitioners in this
case was relatively minor, the consequences of conviction are
not. It appears that petitioners' convictions, if upheld,
would disqualify them from or restrict their ability to engage
in a variety of professions, including medicine, athletic training, and interior design. See, e. g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann.

$ 164.051(a)(2)(B) (2003 Pamphlet) (physician); $ 451.251(a)(1)
(athletic trainer); $ 1053.252(2) (interior designer). Indeed,
were petitioners to move to one of four States, their convictions would require them to register as sex offenders to local
law enforcement. See, e. g., Idaho Code $ 18-8304 (Cum.
Supp. 2002); La. Stat. Ann. $ 15:542 (West Cum. Supp. 2003);
Miss. Code Ann. $ 45-33-25 (West 2003); S. C. Code Ann.

$ 23-3-430 (West Cum. Supp. 2002); cf. ante, at 575-576.

And the effect of Texas' sodomy law is not just limited
to the threat of prosecution or consequence of conviction.
Texas' sodomy law brands all homosexuals as criminals,
thereby making it more difficult for homosexuals to be
treated in the same manner as everyone else. Indeed, Texas

itself has previously acknowledged the collateral effects of
the law, stipulating in a prior challenge to this action that
the law "legally sanctions discrimination against [homosexuals] in a variety of ways unrelated to the criminal law," including in the areas of "employment, family issues, and housing." State v. Morales, 826 S. W. 2d 201, 203 (Tex. App.
1992).

Texas attempts to justify its law, and the effects of the law,
by arguing that the statute satisfies rational basis review
because it furthers the legitimate governmental interest of
the promotion of morality. In Bowers, we held that a state
law criminalizing sodomy as applied to homosexual couples
did not violate substantive due process. We rejected the
argument that no rational basis existed to justify the law,
pointing to the government's interest in promoting morality.
478 U. S., at 196. The only question in front of the Court in
Bowers was whether the substantive component of the Due
Process Clause protected a right to engage in homosexual
sodomy. Id., at 188, n. 2. Bowers did not hold that moral
disapproval of a group is a rational basis under the Equal
Protection Clause to criminalize homosexual sodomy when
heterosexual sodomy is not punished.

This case raises a different issue than Bowers: whether,
under the Equal Protection Clause, moral disapproval is a
legitimate state interest to justify by itself a statute that
bans homosexual sodomy, but not heterosexual sodomy. It
is not. Moral disapproval of this group, like a bare desire
to harm the group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy
rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause.
See, e. g., Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S.,
at 534; Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S., at 634-635. Indeed, we
have never held that moral disapproval, without any other
asserted state interest, is a sufficient rationale under the
Equal Protection Clause to justify a law that discriminates
among groups of persons.

583Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Moral disapproval of a group cannot be a legitimate gov-ernmental interest under the Equal Protection Clause because legal classifications must not be "drawn for the purposeof disadvantaging the group burdened by the law."

Id., at
633. Texas' invocation of moral disapproval as a legitimatestate interest proves nothing more than Texas' desire to

criminalize homosexual sodomy. But the Equal Protection
Clause prevents a State from creating "a classification of per-sons undertaken for its own sake."

Id., at 635. And because Texas so rarely enforces its sodomy law as applied toprivate, consensual acts, the law serves more as a statement

of dislike and disapproval against homosexuals than as a tool
to stop criminal behavior. The Texas sodomy law "raise[s]
the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is
born of animosity toward the class of persons affected."
Id., at 634.

Texas argues, however, that the sodomy law does not discriminate against homosexual persons. Instead, the State
maintains that the law discriminates only against homosexual conduct. While it is true that the law applies only to
conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is
closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, Texas' sodomy law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.
"After all, there can hardly be more palpable discrimination
against a class than making the conduct that defines the class
criminal." Id., at 641 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a State makes homosexual
conduct criminal, and not "deviate sexual intercourse" committed by persons of different sexes, "that declaration in and
of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to
discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres."
Ante, at 575.

Indeed, Texas law confirms that the sodomy statute is directed toward homosexuals as a class. In Texas, calling a
person a homosexual is slander per se because the word "ho539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
mosexual" "impute[s] the commission of a crime." Plumley
v. Landmark Chevrolet, Inc., 122 F. 3d 308, 310 (CA5 1997)
(applying Texas law); see also Head v. Newton, 596 S. W. 2d
209, 210 (Tex. App. 1980). The State has admitted that because of the sodomy law, being homosexual carries the presumption of being a criminal. See State v. Morales, 826
S. W. 2d, at 202-203 ("[T]he statute brands lesbians and gay
men as criminals and thereby legally sanctions discrimination against them in a variety of ways unrelated to the criminal law"). Texas' sodomy law therefore results in discrimination against homosexuals as a class in an array of areas
outside the criminal law. See ibid. In Romer v. Evans, we
refused to sanction a law that singled out homosexuals "for
disfavored legal status." 517 U. S., at 633. The same is
true here. The Equal Protection Clause " `neither knows
nor tolerates classes among citizens.' " Id., at 623 (quoting Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan,
J., dissenting)).

A State can of course assign certain consequences to a
violation of its criminal law. But the State cannot single out
one identifiable class of citizens for punishment that does not
apply to everyone else, with moral disapproval as the only
asserted state interest for the law. The Texas sodomy statute subjects homosexuals to "a lifelong penalty and stigma.
A legislative classification that threatens the creation of an
underclass . . . cannot be reconciled with" the Equal Protection Clause. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S., at 239 (Powell, J.,
concurring).

Whether a sodomy law that is neutral both in effect and
application, see Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886),
would violate the substantive component of the Due Process
Clause is an issue that need not be decided today. I am confident, however, that so long as the Equal Protection Clause
requires a sodomy law to apply equally to the private consensual conduct of homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, such a

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

585Cite as: 539 U. S. 558 (2003)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
law would not long stand in our democratic society. In the
words of Justice Jackson:

"The framers of the Constitution knew, and we should
not forget today, that there is no more effective practical
guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which
officials would impose upon a minority be imposed generally. Conversely, nothing opens the door to arbitrary
action so effectively as to allow those officials to pick
and choose only a few to whom they will apply legislation and thus to escape the political retribution that
might be visited upon them if larger numbers were affected." Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York,
336 U. S. 106, 112-113 (1949) (concurring opinion).

That this law as applied to private, consensual conduct is
unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause does not
mean that other laws distinguishing between heterosexuals
and homosexuals would similarly fail under rational basis
review. Texas cannot assert any legitimate state interest
here, such as national security or preserving the traditional
institution of marriage. Unlike the moral disapproval of
same-sex relations--the asserted state interest in this case--
other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage
beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group.

A law branding one class of persons as criminal based
solely on the State's moral disapproval of that class and the
conduct associated with that class runs contrary to the values of the Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause,
under any standard of review. I therefore concur in the
Court's judgment that Texas' sodomy law banning "deviate
sexual intercourse" between consenting adults of the same
sex, but not between consenting adults of different sexes, is
unconstitutional.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt."Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.

833, 844 (1992). That was the Court's sententious response,barely more than a decade ago, to those seeking to overrule
Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). The Court's responsetoday, to those who have engaged in a 17-year crusade to
overrule Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), is verydifferent. The need for stability and certainty presents no
barrier.Most of the rest of today's opinion has no relevance to its
actual holding--that the Texas statute "furthers no legiti-mate state interest which can justify" its application to petitioners under rational-basis review. Ante, at 578 (overrul-ing

Bowers to the extent it sustained Georgia's antisodomystatute under the rational-basis test). Though there is discussion of "fundamental proposition[s]," ante, at 565, and"fundamental decisions," ibid., nowhere does the Court's
opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a "fundamentalright" under the Due Process Clause; nor does it subject the
Texas law to the standard of review that would be appro-priate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual sodomy

were a "funda-mental right." Thus, while overruling the outcome of Bowers, the Court leaves strangely untouched its central legalconclusion: "[R]espondent would have us announce . . . a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. This weare quite unwilling to do." 478 U. S., at 191. Instead the
Court simply describes petitioners' conduct as "an exerciseof their liberty"--which it undoubtedly is--and proceeds to
apply an unheard-of form of rational-basis review that willhave far-reaching implications beyond this case. Ante,
at 564. I

I begin with the Court's surprising readiness to reconsidera decision rendered a mere 17 years ago in

wick. I do not myself believe in rigid adherence to stare
decisis in constitutional cases; but I do believe that we
should be consistent rather than manipulative in invoking
the doctrine. Today's opinions in support of reversal do not
bother to distinguish--or indeed, even bother to mention--
the paean to stare decisis coauthored by three Members of
today's majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. There,
when stare decisis meant preservation of judicially invented
abortion rights, the widespread criticism of Roe was strong
reason to reaffirm it:

"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the
Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort
of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe[,] . . .
its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the
normal case does not carry. . . . [T]o overrule under fire
in the absence of the most compelling reason . . . would
subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question." 505 U. S., at 866-867.

Today, however, the widespread opposition to Bowers, a decision resolving an issue as "intensely divisive" as the issue in
Roe, is offered as a reason in favor of overruling it. See
ante, at 576-577. Gone, too, is any "enquiry" (of the sort
conducted in Casey) into whether the decision sought to be
overruled has "proven `unworkable,' " Casey, supra, at 855.

Today's approach to stare decisis invites us to overrule an
erroneously decided precedent (including an "intensely divisive" decision) if: (1) its foundations have been "ero[ded]" by
subsequent decisions, ante, at 576; (2) it has been subject to
"substantial and continuing" criticism, ibid.; and (3) it has
not induced "individual or societal reliance" that counsels
against overturning, ante, at 577. The problem is that Roe
itself--which today's majority surely has no disposition to
overrule--satisfies these conditions to at least the same degree as Bowers.

588 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Scalia, J., dissenting
(1) A preliminary digressive observation with regard tothe first factor: The Court's claim that

Planned Parenthood
v. Casey, supra, "casts some doubt" upon the holding in Bowers (or any other case, for that matter) does not withstand
analysis. Ante, at 571. As far as its holding is concerned,
Casey provided a less expansive right to abortion than did
Roe, which was already on the books when Bowers was decided. And if the Court is referring not to the holding of
Casey, but to the dictum of its famed sweet-mystery-of-life
passage, ante, at 574 (" `At the heart of liberty is the rightto define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the

universe, and of the mystery of human life' "): That "casts
some doubt" upon either the totality of our jurisprudence or
else (presumably the right answer) nothing at all. I have
never heard of a law that attempted to restrict one's "right
to define" certain concepts; and if the passage calls into question the government's power to regulate actions based on
one's self-defined "concept of existence, etc.," it is the passage that ate the rule of law.

I do not quarrel with the Court's claim that Romer v.
Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996), "eroded" the "foundations" of
Bowers' rational-basis holding. See Romer, supra, at 640-
643 (Scalia, J., dissenting). But Roe and Casey have been
equally "eroded" by Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702,
721 (1997), which held that only fundamental rights which
are " `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' "
qualify for anything other than rational-basis scrutiny under
the doctrine of "substantive due process." Roe and Casey,
of course, subjected the restriction of abortion to heightened
scrutiny without even attempting to establish that the freedom to abort was rooted in this Nation's tradition.

(2) Bowers, the Court says, has been subject to "substantial and continuing [criticism], disapproving of its reasoning
in all respects, not just as to its historical assumptions."
Ante, at 576. Exactly what those nonhistorical criticisms
are, and whether the Court even agrees with them, are left

unsaid, although the Court does cite two books. See ibid.(citing C. Fried, Order and Law: Arguing the Reagan Revolution--A Firsthand Account 81-84 (1991); R. Posner, Sexand Reason 341-350 (1992)).

1 Of course, Roe too (and by

extension Casey) had been (and still is) subject to unrelent-ing criticism, including criticism from the two commentators

cited by the Court today. See Fried, supra, at 75 ("Roe wasa prime example of twisted judging"); Posner,

the third factor. "[T]here has been," the Court says, "noindividual or societal reliance on Bowers of the sort that

"immoral and unacceptable" constitutes a rational basis forregulation. See,

Sherman v. Henry,928 S. W. 2d 464, 469-473 (Tex. 1996) (relying on Bowers in

rejecting a claimed constitutional right to commit adultery).We ourselves relied extensively on Bowers when we concluded, in Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 569(1991), that Indiana's public indecency statute furthered
"a substantial government interest in protecting order andmorality," ibid. (plurality opinion); see also id., at 575
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). State laws againstbigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity arelikewise sustainable only in light of

Bowers' validation oflaws based on moral choices. Every single one of these laws

is called into question by today's decision; the Court makesno effort to cabin the scope of its decision to exclude them
from its holding. See ante, at 572 (noting "an emergingawareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult
persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives inmatters pertaining to sex" (emphasis added)). The impossibility of distinguishing homosexuality from other traditional"morals" offenses is precisely why Bowers rejected the
rational-basis challenge. "The law," it said, "is constantlybased on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the DueProcess Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed." 478
U. S., at 196.2

2 While the Court does not overrule Bowers' holding that homosexual
sodomy is not a "fundamental right," it is worth noting that the "societal
reliance" upon that aspect of the decision has been substantial as well.

What a massive disruption of the current social order,therefore, the overruling of Bowers entails. Not so the

overruling of Roe, which would simply have restored theregime that existed for centuries before 1973, in which
the permissibility of, and restrictions upon, abortion weredetermined legislatively State by State.

Casey, however,
chose to base its stare decisis determination on a different
"sort" of reliance. "[P]eople," it said, "have organized inti-mate relationships and made choices that define their views

of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on theavailability of abortion in the event that contraception should
fail." 505 U. S., at 856. This falsely assumes that the con-sequence of overruling

Roe would have been to make abortion unlawful. It would not; it would merely have permitted

the States to do so. Many States would unquestionablyhave declined to prohibit abortion, and others would not

have prohibited it within six months (after which the mostsignificant reliance interests would have expired). Even for
persons in States other than these, the choice would not havebeen between abortion and childbirth, but between abortion
nearby and abortion in a neighboring State.To tell the truth, it does not surprise me, and should surprise no one, that the Court has chosen today to revise thestandards of

stare decisis set forth in Casey. It has therebyexposed Casey's extraordinary deference to precedent for

the result-oriented expedient that it is.

II
Having decided that it need not adhere to stare decisis,the Court still must establish that

Bowers was wrongly de-cided and that the Texas statute, as applied to petitioners,

is unconstitutional.Texas Penal Code Ann. $ 21.06(a) (2003) undoubtedly imposes constraints on liberty. So do laws prohibiting prosti-tution, recreational use of heroin, and, for that matter, working more than 60 hours per week in a bakery. But there isno right to "liberty" under the Due Process Clause, though
today's opinion repeatedly makes that claim. Ante, at 567("The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice"); ante, at 574(" `These matters . . . are central to the liberty protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment' "); ante, at 578 ("Their right toliberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full
right to engage in their conduct without intervention ofthe government"). The Fourteenth Amendment

expressly
allows States to deprive their citizens of "liberty," so longas "due process of law" is provided:

"No state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, orproperty,

without due process of law." Amdt. 14 (em-phasis added).

Our opinions applying the doctrine known as "substantivedue process" hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits

States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unlessthe infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721.We have held repeatedly, in cases the Court today does not
overrule, that only fundamental rights qualify for this so-called "heightened scrutiny" protection--that is, rights
which are " `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradi-tion,' "

not only be " `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,' " Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.

Moreover, liberty interests
unsupported by history and tradition, though not deserving of "heightened
scrutiny," are still protected from state laws that are not rationally related to any legitimate state interest. Id., at 722. As I proceed to discuss, it is this latter principle that the Court applies in the present case.

594 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Scalia, J., dissenting
Bowers held, first, that criminal prohibitions of homosex-ual sodomy are not subject to heightened scrutiny because

they do not implicate a "fundamental right" under the DueProcess Clause, 478 U. S., at 191-194. Noting that "[p]roscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots," id., at192, that "[s]odomy was a criminal offense at common law
and was forbidden by the laws of the original 13 States whenthey ratified the Bill of Rights,"

ibid., and that many Stateshad retained their bans on sodomy, id., at 193, Bowers concluded that a right to engage in homosexual sodomy was not" `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,' " id.,
at 192.The Court today does not overrule this holding. Not once
does it describe homosexual sodomy as a "fundamentalright" or a "fundamental liberty interest," nor does it subject
the Texas statute to strict scrutiny. Instead, having failedto establish that the right to homosexual sodomy is " `deeply
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,' " the Court con-cludes that the application of Texas's statute to petitioners'
conduct fails the rational-basis test, and overrules Bowers'holding to the contrary, see

id., at 196. "The Texas statutefurthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual."Ante, at 578.

I shall address that rational-basis holding presently.First, however, I address some aspersions that the Court
casts upon Bowers' conclusion that homosexual sodomy is nota "fundamental right"--even though, as I have said, the
Court does not have the boldness to reverse that conclusion.

III
The Court's description of "the state of the law" at thetime of

Bowers only confirms that Bowers was right. Ante,at 566. The Court points to Griswold v. Connecticut, 381

U. S. 479, 481-482 (1965). But that case expressly disclaimed any reliance on the doctrine of "substantive due

process," and grounded the so-called "right to privacy" inpenumbras of constitutional provisions

other than the Due
Process Clause. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972),likewise had nothing to do with "substantive due process";

it invalidated a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribu-tion of contraceptives to unmarried persons solely on the
basis of the Equal Protection Clause. Of course Eisenstadt
contains well-known dictum relating to the "right to pri-vacy," but this referred to the right recognized in

Griswold--a right penumbral to the specific guarantees in theBill of Rights, and not a "substantive due process" right.

Roe v. Wade recognized that the right to abort an unborn
child was a "fundamental right" protected by the Due Process Clause. 410 U. S., at 155. The Roe Court, however,
made no attempt to establish that this right was " `deeply
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' "; instead, it
based its conclusion that "the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty . . . is broad enough to encompass a
woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy" on its own normative judgment that antiabortion
laws were undesirable. See id., at 153. We have since rejected Roe's holding that regulations of abortion must be
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, see
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U. S., at 876 ( joint opinion
of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); id., at 951-953
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part)--and thus, by logical implication, Roe's
holding that the right to abort an unborn child is a "fundamental right." See 505 U. S., at 843-912 ( joint opinion of
O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (not once describing
abortion as a "fundamental right" or a "fundamental liberty
interest").

After discussing the history of antisodomy laws, ante, at
568-571, the Court proclaims that, "it should be noted that
there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter," ante,

539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
596 LAWRENCE v. TEXAS

Scalia, J., dissenting
at 568. This observation in no way casts into doubt the "de-finitive [historical] conclusio[n],"

ibid., on which Bowers relied: that our Nation has a longstanding history of laws pro-hibiting

sodomy in general--regardless of whether it was
performed by same-sex or opposite-sex couples:

"It is obvious to us that neither of these formulations
would extend a fundamental right to homosexuals toengage in acts of consensual sodomy. Proscriptions

against that conduct have ancient roots. Sodomy wasa criminal offense at common law and was forbidden by
the laws of the original 13 States when they ratified theBill of Rights. In 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, all but 5 of the 37 States in the Union
had criminal sodomy laws. In fact, until 1961, all 50States outlawed

sodomy, and today, 24 States and the
District of Columbia continue to provide criminal penal-ties for

sodomy performed in private and between consenting adults. Against this background, to claim thata right to engage in such conduct is `deeply rooted in

this Nation's history and tradition' or `implicit in theconcept of ordered liberty' is, at best, facetious." 478
U. S., at 192-194 (citations and footnotes omitted; em-phasis added).

It is (as Bowers recognized) entirely irrelevant whether thelaws in our long national tradition criminalizing homosexual
sodomy were "directed at homosexual conduct as a distinctmatter."

Ante, at 568. Whether homosexual sodomy was
prohibited by a law targeted at same-sex sexual relationsor by a more general law prohibiting both homosexual and

heterosexual sodomy, the only relevant point is that it was
criminalized--which suffices to establish that homosexual
sodomy is not a right "deeply rooted in our Nation's history
and tradition." The Court today agrees that homosexual
sodomy was criminalized and thus does not dispute the facts
on which Bowers actually relied.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Next the Court makes the claim, again unsupported byany citations, that "[l]aws prohibiting sodomy do not seem

to have been enforced against consenting adults acting inprivate."

Ante, at 569. The key qualifier here is "acting
in private"--since the Court admits that sodomy laws wereenforced against consenting adults (although the Court contends that prosecutions were "infrequen[t]," ibid.). I do not
know what "acting in private" means; surely consensual sod-omy, like heterosexual intercourse, is rarely performed on

stage. If all the Court means by "acting in private" is "onprivate premises, with the doors closed and windows covered," it is entirely unsurprising that evidence of enforcement would be hard to come by. (Imagine the circumstances that would enable a search warrant to be obtained
for a residence on the ground that there was probable cause
to believe that consensual sodomy was then and there occurring.) Surely that lack of evidence would not sustain the
proposition that consensual sodomy on private premises with
the doors closed and windows covered was regarded as a
"fundamental right," even though all other consensual sodomy was criminalized. There are 203 prosecutions for consensual, adult homosexual sodomy reported in the West Reporting system and official state reporters from the years
1880-1995. See W. Eskridge, Gaylaw: Challenging the
Apartheid of the Closet 375 (1999) (hereinafter Gaylaw).
There are also records of 20 sodomy prosecutions and 4 executions during the colonial period. J. Katz, Gay/Lesbian Almanac 29, 58, 663 (1983). Bowers' conclusion that homosexual sodomy is not a fundamental right "deeply rooted in this
Nation's history and tradition" is utterly unassailable.

Realizing that fact, the Court instead says: "[W]e think
that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of
most relevance here. These references show an emerging
awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult
persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in
matters pertaining to sex." Ante, at 571-572 (emphasis

Scalia, J., dissenting
added). Apart from the fact that such an "emerging aware-ness" does not establish a "fundamental right," the statement is factually false. States continue to prosecute allsorts of crimes by adults "in matters pertaining to sex":
prostitution, adult incest, adultery, obscenity, and child por-nography. Sodomy laws, too, have been enforced "in the
past half century," in which there have been 134 reported
cases involving prosecutions for consensual, adult, homosex-ual sodomy. Gaylaw 375. In relying, for evidence of an

"emerging recognition," upon the American Law Institute's1955 recommendation not to criminalize " `consensual sexual
relations conducted in private,' " ante, at 572, the Court ignores the fact that this recommendation was "a point of resistance in most of the states that considered adopting the
Model Penal Code." Gaylaw 159.

In any event, an "emerging awareness" is by definition not
"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition[s]," as
we have said "fundamental right" status requires. Constitutional entitlements do not spring into existence because
some States choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions
on certain behavior. Much less do they spring into existence, as the Court seems to believe, because foreign nations
decriminalize conduct. The Bowers majority opinion never
relied on "values we share with a wider civilization," ante,
at 576, but rather rejected the claimed right to sodomy on
the ground that such a right was not " `deeply rooted in this
Nation's history and tradition,' " 478 U. S., at 193-194 (emphasis added). Bowers' rational-basis holding is likewise devoid of any reliance on the views of a "wider civilization," see
id., at 196. The Court's discussion of these foreign views
(ignoring, of course, the many countries that have retained
criminal prohibitions on sodomy) is therefore meaningless
dicta. Dangerous dicta, however, since "this Court . . .
should not impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions on Americans." Foster v. Florida, 537 U. S. 990, n. (2002) (Thomas,
J., concurring in denial of certiorari).

I turn now to the ground on which the Court squarelyrests its holding: the contention that there is no rational

basis for the law here under attack. This proposition isso out of accord with our jurisprudence--indeed, with the jurisprudence of any society we know--that it requires littlediscussion.

The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the beliefof its citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are "immoral and unacceptable," Bowers, supra, at 196--the sameinterest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. Bow-ers held that this was a legitimate state interest. The Court
today reaches the opposite conclusion. The Texas statute,it says, "furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of theindividual," ante, at 578 (emphasis added). The Court embraces instead Justice Stevens' declaration in his Bowersdissent, that " `the fact that the governing majority in a
State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as im-moral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,' " ante, at 577. This effectively decrees theend of all morals legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the
promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even a legitimate state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws cansurvive rational-basis review.

V
Finally, I turn to petitioners' equal-protection challenge,which no Member of the Court save

Justice O'Connor,
ante, at 579 (opinion concurring in judgment), embraces: Onits face $ 21.06(a) applies equally to all persons. Men and

women, heterosexuals and homosexuals, are all subject to itsprohibition of deviate sexual intercourse with someone of the
same sex. To be sure, $ 21.06 does distinguish between thesexes insofar as concerns the partner with whom the sexual

Scalia, J., dissenting
acts are performed: men can violate the law only with othermen, and women only with other women. But this cannot

itself be a denial of equal protection, since it is precisely thesame distinction regarding partner that is drawn in state
laws prohibiting marriage with someone of the same sexwhile permitting marriage with someone of the opposite sex.

The objection is made, however, that the antimiscegena-tion laws invalidated in

Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 8(1967), similarly were applicable to whites and blacks alike,

and only distinguished between the races insofar as the part-ner was concerned. In Loving, however, we correctly applied heightened scrutiny, rather than the usual rational-basis review, because the Virginia statute was "designed to
maintain White Supremacy." Id., at 6, 11. A racially dis-criminatory purpose is always sufficient to subject a law to
strict scrutiny, even a facially neutral law that makes nomention of race. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,
241-242 (1976). No purpose to discriminate against men orwomen as a class can be gleaned from the Texas law, so
rational-basis review applies. That review is readily satis-fied here by the same rational basis that satisfied it in

Bow-ers--society's belief that certain forms of sexual behavior are

"immoral and unacceptable," 478 U. S., at 196. This is thesame justification that supports many other laws regulating
sexual behavior that make a distinction based upon the iden-tity of the partner--for example, laws against adultery, fornication, and adult incest, and laws refusing to recognize homo-sexual marriage.

Justice O'Connor argues that the discrimination in thislaw which must be justified is not its discrimination with
regard to the sex of the partner but its discrimination withregard to the sexual proclivity of the principal actor.

"While it is true that the law applies only to conduct, theconduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely
correlated with being homosexual. Under such circum-stances, Texas' sodomy law is targeted at more than con539US2 Unit: $U82 [05-03-05 16:24:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
duct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as aclass." Ante, at 583.

Of course the same could be said of any law. A law againstpublic nudity targets "the conduct that is closely correlated
with being a nudist," and hence "is targeted at more thanconduct"; it is "directed toward nudists as a class." But be
that as it may. Even if the Texas law does deny equal pro-tection to "homosexuals as a class," that denial still does not
need to be justified by anything more than a rational basis,which our cases show is satisfied by the enforcement of traditional notions of sexual morality.

Justice O'Connor simply decrees application of "a moresearching form of rational basis review" to the Texas statute.

Ante, at 580. The cases she cites do not recognize such astandard, and reach their conclusions only after finding, as
required by conventional rational-basis analysis, that no con-ceivable legitimate state interest supports the classification
at issue. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S., at 635; Cleburne v.Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 448-450 (1985);
Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534-538(1973). Nor does

Justice O'Connor explain precisely whather "more searching form" of rational-basis review consists

of. It must at least mean, however, that laws exhibiting"a desire to harm a politically unpopular group,"

ante, at 580,are invalid
even though there may be a conceivable rationalbasis to support them.

This reasoning leaves on pretty shaky grounds state lawslimiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.

Justice O'Connor seeks to preserve them by the conclusory statementthat "preserving the traditional institution of marriage" is a

legitimate state interest. Ante, at 585. But "preservingthe traditional institution of marriage" is just a kinder way
of describing the State's moral disapproval of same-sex cou-ples. Texas's interest in $ 21.06 could be recast in similarly
euphemistic terms: "preserving the traditional sexual moresof our society." In the jurisprudence

has seemingly created, judges can validate laws by charac-terizing them as "preserving the traditions of society"

(good); or invalidate them by characterizing them as "ex-pressing moral disapproval" (bad).

* * *
Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is theproduct of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed

on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I meanthe agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed
at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionallyattached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools(to which any reputable law school

must seek to belong) ex-cludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from

its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small)that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person
who openly engages in homosexual conduct. See Romer,supra, at 653.

One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion isthe Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is "an invitation to subject homosexual per-sons to discrimination both in the public and in the private
spheres." Ante, at 575. It is clear from this that the Courthas taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role
of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rulesof engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want
persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as part-ners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as
teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in theirhome. They view this as protecting themselves and their
families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral anddestructive. The Court views it as "discrimination" which
it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued isthe Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that

Scalia, J., dissenting
culture are not obviously "mainstream"; that in most Stateswhat the Court calls "discrimination" against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposalsto ban such "discrimination" under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress, see Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1994, S. 2238, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.
(1994); Civil Rights Amendments, H. R. 5452, 94th Cong.,
1st Sess. (1975); that in some cases such "discrimination" is
mandated by federal statute, see 10 U. S. C. $ 654(b)(1) (mandating discharge from the Armed Forces of any service mem-ber who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts);

and that in some cases such "discrimination" is a constitutional right, see Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S.
640 (2000).

Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals,
or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal
democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other
morality change over time, and every group has the right to
persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is
the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in
that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of
the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens
is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts--or, for that
matter, display any moral disapprobation of them--than I
would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is
well within the range of traditional democratic action, and
its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a
brand-new "constitutional right" by a Court that is impatient
of democratic change. It is indeed true that "later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in
fact serve only to oppress," ante, at 579; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the
premise of our system that those judgments are to be made

by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste thatknows best.

One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter tothe people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike
judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion.The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual
conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage,
but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexualacts--and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so thatwe need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage,
as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the
Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). See Halpern v. Toronto, 2003 WL 34950 (Ontario Ct. App.); Cohen,
Dozens in Canada Follow Gay Couple's Lead, Washington
Post, June 12, 2003, p. A25. At the end of its opinion--after
having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence--the Court says that the present case "does not
involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to
enter." Ante, at 578. Do not believe it. More illuminating
than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of
thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to
"personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education," and then declares that "[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as
heterosexual persons do." Ante, at 574 (emphasis added).
Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional
law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of
homosexual conduct is "no legitimate state interest" for purposes of proscribing that conduct, ante, at 578; and if, as the
Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), "[w]hen

sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring," ante, at 567; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of
marriage to homosexual couples exercising "[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution," ibid.? Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are
allowed to marry. This case "does not involve" the issue of
homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that
principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of
this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly
assures us, this is so.

The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are
only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a
"fundamental right" (which the Court does not dispute), nor
is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the
equal protection of the laws. I dissent.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
I join Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion. I write separately to note that the law before the Court today "is . . .
uncommonly silly." Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,
527 (1965) (Stewart, J., dissenting). If I were a member of
the Texas Legislature, I would vote to repeal it. Punishing
someone for expressing his sexual preference through noncommercial consensual conduct with another adult does not
appear to be a worthy way to expend valuable law enforcement resources.

Notwithstanding this, I recognize that as a Member of this
Court I am not empowered to help petitioners and others

STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, firstappellate district

No. 01-1757. Argued March 31, 2003--Decided June 26, 2003
In 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limitations permitting prosecution for sex-related child abuse where the prior limitations
period has expired if, inter alia, the prosecution is begun within one
year of a victim's report to police. A subsequently added provision
makes clear that this law revives causes of action barred by prior limitations statutes. In 1998, petitioner Stogner was indicted for sex-related
child abuse committed between 1955 and 1973. At the time those
crimes were allegedly committed, the limitations period was three
years. Stogner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the
Ex Post Facto Clause forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution. The trial court agreed, but the California Court of Appeal reversed. The trial court denied Stogner's subsequent dismissal motion,
in which he argued that his prosecution violated the Ex Post Facto and
Due Process Clauses. The Court of Appeal affirmed.

Held: A law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations

period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a
previously time-barred prosecution. California's law extends the time
in which prosecution is allowed, authorizes prosecutions that the passage of time has previously barred, and was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Such features
produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids. First,
the law threatens the kinds of harm that the Clause seeks to avoid, for
the Clause protects liberty by preventing governments from enacting
statutes with "manifestly unjust and oppressive" retroactive effects.
Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391. Second, the law falls literally within
the categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws that Justice Chase set
forth more than 200 years ago in Calder v. Bull, which this Court has
recognized as an authoritative account of the Clause's scope, Collins v.
Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 46. It falls within the second category, which
Justice Chase understood to include a new law that inflicts punishments
where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment. Third, numerous legislators, courts, and commentators have long believed it well
settled that the Clause forbids resurrection of a time-barred prosecution. The Reconstruction Congress of 1867 rejected a bill that would
have revived time-barred treason prosecutions against Jefferson Davis

and others, passing instead a law extending unexpired limitations periods. Roughly contemporaneous State Supreme Courts echoed the view
that laws reviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto. Even
courts that have upheld extensions of unexpired statutes of limitations
have consistently distinguished situations where the periods have expired, often using language that suggests a presumption that reviving
time-barred criminal cases is not allowed. This Court has not previously spoken decisively on this matter. Neither its recognition that
the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not
apply after the relevant limitations period has expired, Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598, nor its holding that a Civil War statute
retroactively tolling limitations periods during the war was valid as an
exercise of Congress' war powers, Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 503-
504, dictates the outcome here. Instead, that outcome is determined
by the nature of the harms that the law creates, the fact that the law
falls within Justice Chase's second category, and a long line of authority. Pp. 610-633.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
California has brought a criminal prosecution after expira-tion of the time periods set forth in previously applicable

statutes of limitations. California has done so under the au-thority of a new law that (1) permits resurrection of otherwise time-barred criminal prosecutions, and (2) was itselfenacted

after pre-existing limitations periods had expired.We conclude that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause,

Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1, bars application of this new law to thepresent case.

I
In 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limi-tations governing sex-related child abuse crimes. The new

statute permits prosecution for those crimes where "[t]helimitation period specified in [prior statutes of limitations]
has expired"--provided that (1) a victim has reported an al-legation of abuse to the police, (2) "there is independent evidence that clearly and convincingly corroborates the victim'sallegation," and (3) the prosecution is begun within one year
of the victim's report. 1993 Cal. Stats. ch. 390, $ 1 (codifiedas amended at Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 803(g) (West Supp.
2003)). A related provision, added to the statute in 1996,makes clear that a prosecution satisfying these three conditions "shall revive any cause of action barred by [prior stat-utes of limitations]." 1996 Cal. Stats. ch. 130, $ 1 (codified at
Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 803(g)(3)(A) (West Supp. 2003)). Thestatute thus authorizes prosecution for criminal acts committed many years beforehand--and where the original limi-tations period has expired--as long as prosecution begins
within a year of a victim's first complaint to the police.In 1998, a California grand jury indicted Marion Stogner,
the petitioner, charging him with sex-related child abusecommitted decades earlier--between 1955 and 1973. Withyers et al. by David M. Porter, Barry T. Simons, Martin N. Buchanan,

610 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
out the new statute allowing revival of the State's cause of
action, California could not have prosecuted Stogner. The
statute of limitations governing prosecutions at the time the
crimes were allegedly committed had set forth a 3-year limitations period. And that period had run 22 years or more
before the present prosecution was brought.

Stogner moved for the complaint's dismissal. He argued
that the Federal Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I,

$ 10, cl. 1, forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution. The trial court agreed that such a revival is unconstitutional. But the California Court of Appeal reversed,
citing a recent, contrary decision by the California Supreme
Court, People v. Frazer, 21 Cal. 4th 737, 982 P. 2d 180 (1999),
cert. denied, 529 U. S. 1108 (2000). Stogner then moved to
dismiss his indictment, arguing that his prosecution is unconstitutional under both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due
Process Clause, Amdt. 14, $ 1. The trial court denied Stogner's motion, and the Court of Appeal upheld that denial.
Stogner v. Superior Court, 93 Cal. App. 4th 1229, 114 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 37 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider Stogner's constitutional claims. 537 U. S. 1043 (2002).

II
The Constitution's two Ex Post Facto Clauses prohibit the
Federal Government and the States from enacting laws with
certain retroactive effects. See Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3 (Federal
Government); Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1 (States). The law at issue
here created a new criminal limitations period that extends
the time in which prosecution is allowed. It authorized
criminal prosecutions that the passage of time had previously barred. Moreover, it was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Do
these features of the law, taken together, produce the kind
of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids? We conclude
that they do.

Opinion of the Court
First, the new statute threatens the kinds of harm that, inthis Court's view, the

Ex Post Facto Clause seeks to avoid.
Long ago Justice Chase pointed out that the Clause protectsliberty by preventing governments from enacting statutes

with "manifestly unjust and oppressive" retroactive effects.
Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391 (1798). Judge Learned Hand
later wrote that extending a limitations period after the
State has assured "a man that he has become safe from itspursuit . . . seems to most of us unfair and dishonest."

Falter v. United States, 23 F. 2d 420, 426 (CA2), cert. denied,277 U. S. 590 (1928). In such a case, the government has

refused "to play by its own rules," Carmell v. Texas, 529
U. S. 513, 533 (2000). It has deprived the defendant of the
"fair warning," Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28 (1981),
that might have led him to preserve exculpatory evidence.
F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, p. 210 (8th
ed. 1880) ("The statute [of limitations] is . . . an amnesty,
declaring that after a certain time . . . the offender shall be
at liberty to return to his country . . . and . . . may cease to
preserve the proofs of his innocence"). And a Constitution
that permits such an extension, by allowing legislatures to
pick and choose when to act retroactively, risks both "arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation," and erosion of
the separation of powers, Weaver, supra, at 29, and n. 10.
See Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 137-138 (1810) (viewing
the Ex Post Facto Clause as a protection against "violent
acts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment").

Second, the kind of statute at issue falls literally within
the categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws set forth by
Justice Chase more than 200 years ago in Calder v. Bull,
supra--a categorization that this Court has recognized as
providing an authoritative account of the scope of the
Ex Post Facto Clause. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,
46 (1990); Carmell, supra, at 539. Drawing substantially on
Richard Wooddeson's 18th-century commentary on the nature of ex post facto laws and past parliamentary abuses,

612 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Chase divided ex post facto laws into categories that he de-scribed in two alternative ways. See 529 U. S., at 522-524,

and n. 9. He wrote:

"I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws,within the words and the intent of the prohibition. 1st.

Every law that makes an action done before the passingof the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal;
and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, whencommitted. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the lawannexed to the crime, when committed.

4th. Everylaw that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives

less, or different, testimony, than the law required atthe time of the commission of the offence, in order to
convict the offender. All these, and similar laws, aremanifestly unjust and oppressive." Calder, supra, at
390-391 (emphasis altered from original).
In his alternative description, Chase traced these four cat-egories back to Parliament's earlier abusive acts, as follows:

Category 1: "Sometimes they respected the crime, bydeclaring acts to be treason, which were not treason,
when committed."
Category 2: "[A]t other times they inflicted punish-ments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any

punishment."
Category 3: "[I]n other cases, they inflicted greater pun-ishment, than the law annexed to the offence."

Category 4: "[A]t other times, they violated the rules
of evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof) byadmitting one witness, when the existing law required

two; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath ofthe wife against the husband; or other testimony, which
the courts of justice would not admit." 3 Dall., at 389(emphasis altered from original).

613Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
The second category--including any "law that aggravates
a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed,"
id., at 390--describes California's statute as long as thosewords are understood as Justice Chase understood them--

i. e., as referring to a statute that "inflict[s] punishments,where the party was not, by

law, liable to any punishment,"
id., at 389. See also 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View
of the Laws of England 638 (1792) (hereinafter Wooddeson,Systematical View) (discussing the

ex post facto status of a
law that affects punishment by "making therein some inno-vation,

or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law" (emphasis added)).
After (but not before) the original statute of limitations had
expired, a party such as Stogner was not "liable to any punishment." California's new statute therefore "aggravated"
Stogner's alleged crime, or made it "greater than it was,
when committed," in the sense that, and to the extent that,
it "inflicted punishment" for past criminal conduct that
(when the new law was enacted) did not trigger any such
liability. See also H. Black, American Constitutional Law

$ 266, p. 700 (4th ed. 1927) (hereinafter Black, American Constitutional Law) ("[A]n act condoned by the expiration of the
statute of limitations is no longer a punishable offense"). It
is consequently not surprising that New Jersey's highest
court long ago recognized that Chase's alternative description of second category laws "exactly describes the operation" of the kind of statute at issue here. Moore v. State, 43
N. J. L. 203, 217 (1881) (emphasis added). See also H. Black,
Constitutional Prohibitions Against Legislation Impairing
the Obligation of Contracts, and Against Retroactive and
Ex Post Facto Laws $ 235, p. 298 (1887) (hereinafter Black,
Constitutional Prohibitions) ("Such a statute" "certainly
makes that a punishable offense which was previously a condoned and obliterated offense").

So to understand the second category (as applying where
a new law inflicts a punishment upon a person not then sub539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
614 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
ject to that punishment, to any degree) explains why andhow that category differs from both the first category (making criminal noncriminal behavior) and the third category(aggravating the punishment). And this understanding is
consistent, in relevant part, with Chase's second category ex-amples--examples specifically provided to illustrate Chase's
alternative description of laws " `inflict[ing] punishments,
where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment,' "
Calder, 3 Dall., at 389.

Following Wooddeson, Chase cited as examples of suchlaws Acts of Parliament that banished certain individuals

accused of treason. Id., at 389, and n. ##; see also Carmell,
529 U. S., at 522-524, and n. 11. Both Chase and Wooddeson
explicitly referred to these laws as involving "banishment."
Calder, supra, at 389, and n. ##; 2 Wooddeson, Systematical
View 638-639. This fact was significant because Parliament had enacted those laws not only after the crime's commission, but under circumstances where banishment "was
simply not a form of penalty that could be imposed by
the courts." Carmell, supra, at 523, n. 11; see also 11 W.
Holdsworth, A History of English Law 569 (1938). Thus,
these laws, like the California law at issue here, enabled punishment where it was not otherwise available "in the ordinary course of law," 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638.
As this Court previously recognized in Carmell, supra, at
523, and n. 11, it was this vice that was relevant to Chase's
purpose.

It is true, however, that Parliament's Acts of banishment,
unlike the law in this case, involved a punishment (1) that the
legislature imposed directly, and (2) that courts had never
previously had the power to impose. But these differences
are not determinative. The first describes not a retroactivity problem but an attainder problem that Justice Chase's
language does not emphasize and with which the Constitution separately deals, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3; Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. The
second difference seems beside the point. The example of

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

615Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Parliament's banishment laws points to concern that a legis-lature, knowing the accused and seeking to have the accused

punished for a pre-existing crime, might enable punishmentof the accused in ways that existing law forbids. That fundamental concern, related to basic concerns about retroac-tive penal laws and erosion of the separation of powers, applies with equal force to punishment like that enabled by
California's law as applied to Stogner--punishment thatcourts lacked the power to impose at the time the legislature

acted. See Black, Constitutional Prohibitions $ 235, at 298("It would be superfluous to point out that such an act [reviving otherwise time-barred criminal liability] would fall
within the evils intended to be guarded against by the prohibition in question"). Cf. 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law $ 444a,
pp. 347-348, n. b (rev. 7th ed. 1874) (hereinafter Criminal
Law).

In finding that California's law falls within the literal
terms of Justice Chase's second category, we do not deny
that it may fall within another category as well. Justice
Chase's fourth category, for example, includes any "law that
alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender."
Calder, supra, at 390. This Court has described that category as including laws that diminish "the quantum of evidence required to convict." Carmell, supra, at 532.

Significantly, a statute of limitations reflects a legislative
judgment that, after a certain time, no quantum of evidence
is sufficient to convict. See United States v. Marion, 404
U. S. 307, 322 (1971). And that judgment typically rests, in
large part, upon evidentiary concerns--for example, concern
that the passage of time has eroded memories or made witnesses or other evidence unavailable. United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117 (1979); 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N.
King, Criminal Procedure $ 18.5(a), p. 718 (1999); Wharton,
Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, at 210. Indeed, this

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
616 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Court once described statutes of limitations as creating"a presumption which renders proof unnecessary."

Wood v.
Carpenter, 101 U. S. 135, 139 (1879).Consequently, to resurrect a prosecution after the relevant

statute of limitations has expired is to eliminate a currentlyexisting conclusive presumption forbidding prosecution, and
thereby to permit conviction on a quantum of evidence where
that quantum, at the time the new law is enacted, wouldhave been legally insufficient. And, in that sense, the new

law would "violate" previous evidence-related legal rules byauthorizing the courts to " `receiv[e] evidence . . . which the
courts of justice would not [previously have] admit[ted]' " as
sufficient proof of a crime, supra, at 612. Cf. Collins, 497
U. S., at 46 ("Subtle ex post facto violations are no more permissible than overt ones"); Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall.
277, 329 (1867) (The Ex Post Facto Clause "cannot be evaded
by the form in which the power of the State is exerted").
Nonetheless, given Justice Chase's description of the second
category, we need not explore the fourth category, or other
categories, further.

Third, likely for the reasons just stated, numerous legislators, courts, and commentators have long believed it well
settled that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids resurrection of
a time-barred prosecution. Such sentiments appear already
to have been widespread when the Reconstruction Congress
of 1867--the Congress that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment--rejected a bill that would have revived time-barred
prosecutions for treason that various Congressmen wanted
brought against Jefferson Davis and "his coconspirators,"
Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 279 (1866-1867) (comments
of Rep. Lawrence). Radical Republicans such as Roscoe
Conkling and Thaddeus Stevens, no friends of the South, opposed the bill because, in their minds, it proposed an "ex post
facto law," id., at 68 (comments of Rep. Conkling), and
threatened an injustice tantamount to "judicial murder," id.,
at 69 (comments of Rep. Stevens). In this instance, Con539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gress ultimately passed a law extending unexpired limita-tions periods, ch. 236, 15 Stat. 183--a tailored approach to

extending limitations periods that has also been taken inmodern statutes,

e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 3293 (notes on effective
date of 1990 amendment and effect of 1989 amendment); Cal.Penal Code Ann. $ 805.5 (West Supp. 2003).

Further, Congressmen such as Conkling were not the only
ones who believed that laws reviving time-barred prosecu-tions are

ex post facto. That view was echoed in roughly
contemporaneous opinions by State Supreme Courts. E. g.,
State v. Sneed, 25 Tex. Supp. 66, 67 (1860); Moore, 43 N. J. L.,
at 216-217. Cf. State v. Keith, 63 N. C. 140, 145 (1869) (A
State's repeal of an amnesty was "substantially an ex post
facto law"). Courts, with apparent unanimity until California's decision in Frazer, have continued to state such views,
and, when necessary, so to hold. E. g., People ex rel. Reibman v. Warden, 242 App. Div. 282, 285, 275 N. Y. S. 59, 62

Even where courts have upheld extensions of unexpiredstatutes of limitations (extensions that our holding today
does not affect, see supra, at 613), they have consistently
distinguished situations where limitations periods have expired. Further, they have often done so by saying that extension of existing limitations periods is not ex post facto
"provided," "so long as," "because," or "if " the prior limitations periods have not expired--a manner of speaking that
suggests a presumption that revival of time-barred criminal
cases is not allowed. E. g., United States v. Madia, 955 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court
is subject to enlargement or repeal without being obnoxious
to the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws").

Given the apparent unanimity of pre-Frazer case law, legal
scholars have long had reason to believe this matter settled.
As early as 1887, Henry Black reported that, although "not
at all numerous," the "cases upon this point . . . unmistakably
point to the conclusion that such an act would be ex post
facto in the strict sense, and void." Constitutional Prohibitions $ 235, at 297. Even earlier, in 1874, Francis Wharton
supported this conclusion by emphasizing the historic role of
statutes of limitations as "acts of grace or oblivion, and not
of process," "extinguish[ing] all future prosecution" and making an offense unable to "be again called into existence at
the caprice of the prince." 1 Criminal Law $ 444a, at 347-
348, n. b. More modern commentators--reporting on the
same and subsequent cases--have come to the same conclusion. E. g., 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law $ 294, pp. 349-350
(1998 and Supp. 2002); 16A C. J. S., Constitutional Law $ 420,
p. 372 (1984 and Supp. 2002); 4 LaFave, Israel, & King, Criminal Procedure $ 18.5(a), at 718, n. 6; 2 C. Antieau & W. Rich,
Modern Constitutional Law $ 38.11, p. 445 (2d ed. 1997);

"estopped from prosecuting"). Likewise, with respect to
the closely related case of a law repealing an amnesty--a
case not distinguished by the dissent--William Wade concluded early on that "[s]uch an act would be as clearly in
contravention of the inhibition of ex post facto laws as though
it undertook to annex criminality to an act innocent when
done." Operation and Construction of Retroactive Laws

$ 286, p. 339 (1880). But cf. post, at 638-639 (Kennedy, J.,dissenting).

This Court itself has not previously spoken decisively onthis matter. On the one hand, it has clearly stated that the
Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination doesnot apply after the relevant limitations period has expired.
Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598 (1896). And that
rule may suggest that the expiration of a statute of limita-tions is irrevocable, for otherwise the passage of time would

not have eliminated fear of prosecution.On the other hand, in

Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 503-
504 (1871), this Court upheld a statute, enacted during the
Civil War, that retroactively tolled all civil and criminal limitations for periods during which the war had made service
of process impossible or courts inaccessible. Stewart, however, involved a civil, not a criminal, limitations statute. Id.,
at 500-501. Significantly, in reviewing this civil case, the
Court upheld the statute as an exercise of Congress' war
powers, id., at 507, without explicit consideration of any potential collision with the Ex Post Facto Clause. Moreover,
the Court already had held, independent of Congress' Act,
that statutes of limitations were tolled for "the time during
which the courts in the States lately in rebellion were closed
to the citizens of the loyal States . . . ." Id., at 503; see also
Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 539-542 (1868). Hence, the
Court could have seen the relevant statute as ratifying a
pre-existing expectation of tolling due to wartime exigencies,
rather than as extending limitations periods that had truly
expired. See id., at 541; see also Stewart, supra, at 507. In
our view, Stewart therefore no more dictates the outcome
here than does seemingly contrary precedent regarding the
Fifth Amendment privilege.

Instead, we believe that the outcome of this case is determined by the nature of the harms that California's law creates, by the fact that the law falls within Justice Chase's
second category as Chase understood that category, and by

Opinion of the Court
a long line of authority holding that a law of this type vio-lates the Ex Post Facto Clause.

III
In a prodigious display of legal and historical textual re-search, the dissent finely parses cases that offer us support,

see post, at 633-637; shows appreciation for 19th-century dis-sident commentary, see post, at 638-639; discusses in depth
its understanding of late 17th-century and early 18th-centuryparliamentary history, post, at 642-649; and does its best to
drive a linguistic wedge between Justice Chase's alternativedescriptions of categories of

ex post facto laws, post, at 640-641. All to what end? The dissent undertakes this Herculean effort to prove that it is not unfair, in any constitution-ally relevant sense, to prosecute a man for crimes committed
25 to 42 years earlier when nearly a generation has passedsince the law granted him an effective amnesty. Cf. post,
at 649-653.We disagree strongly with the dissent's ultimate conclusion about the fairness of resurrecting a long-dead prosecu-tion. See infra, at 630-632. Rather, like Judge Learned
Hand, we believe that this retroactive application of a later-enacted law is unfair. And, like most other judges who have
addressed this issue, see supra, at 617-618, we find thewords

"ex post facto" applicable to describe this kind of un-fairness. Indeed, given the close fit between laws that work

this kind of unfairness and the Constitution's concern withex post facto laws, we might well conclude that California's
law falls within the scope of the Constitution's interdictioneven were the dissent's historical and precedent-related criticisms better founded than they are.We need not examine that possibility here, however, because the dissent's reading of the relevant history and prece-dent raises far too many problems to serve as a foundation
for the reading of "ex post facto" that it proposes. In ourview, that reading is too narrow; it is unsupported by prec539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
edent; and it would deny liberty where the Constitutiongives protection.

A
In the dissent's view, Chase's historical examples showthat

"Calder's second category concerns only laws" that both(1) "subjec[t] the offender to increased punishment" and

(2) do so by "chang[ing] the nature of an offense to make itgreater than it was at the time of commission." Post, at
642 (emphasis added). The dissent does not explain what itmeans by "chang[ing] the nature of an offense," but we must
assume (from the fact that this language comes in a dissent)that it means something beyond attaching otherwise unavailable punishment and requires, in addition, some form of re-characterization of the crime. After all, the dissent seeks
to show through its discussion of the relevant historical ex-amples that a new law subjecting to punishment a person not
then legally subject to punishment does not fall within thesecond category

unless the new law somehow changes thekind of crime that was previously at issue.

The dissent's discussion of the historical examples suffersfrom several problems. First, it raises problems of historical accuracy. In order to show the occurrence of a changein the kind or nature of the crime, the dissent argues that
Parliament's effort to banish the Earl of Clarendon amountedto an effort "to elevate criminal behavior of lower magnitude
to the level of treason." Post, at 643. The dissent supportsthis argument with a claim that "the allegations [against
Clarendon] could not support a charge of treason." Ibid.Historians, however, appear to have taken a different view.
But cf. post, at 646. In their view, at least one chargeagainst Clarendon

did amount to treason.Clarendon was charged with "betraying his majesty's secret counsels to his enemies during the war." Edward Earlof Clarendon's Trial, 6 How. St. Tr. 292, 350 (1667) (hereinafter Clarendon's Trial). In the words of one historian,this charge "undoubtedly contained treasonous matter. "

this specific charge--a charge of conduct that amounted to
treason--that the House of Commons (which had previously
refused to impeach Clarendon on other charges that did not
amount to treason) "voted to impeach Clarendon for high
treason." Roberts, Impeachment 13; accord, Clarendon's
Trial 350-351.

The House of Lords initially thought that the Commons
had failed to provide sufficient evidence because it failed to
provide "special articles" laying out "particulars to prove it."
Roberts, Impeachment 14. The Lords and Commons deadlocked over whether a "general charge" was sufficient. Ibid.
See also Clarendon's Trial 351-374. But Clarendon fled,

The Lords and Commons then agreed to banish Clarendon.
The Act of banishment--the only item in this complicated
history explicitly cited by Chase--explained that Clarendon
was being banished because he had "been impeached by
the Commons . . . of Treason and other misdemeanours" and
had "fled whereby Justice cannot be done upon him according
to his demerit." 19 & 20 Car. II, c. 2 (1667-1668) (reprint

624 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
In sum, Clarendon's case involved Parliament's punishment of an individual who was charged before Parliament
with treason and satisfactorily proved to have committed
treason, but whom Parliament punished by imposing "banishment" in circumstances where the party was not, in "the
ordinary course of law," liable to any "banishment." See
supra, at 614. Indeed, because Clarendon had fled the country, it had become impossible to hold a proper trial to subject
Clarendon to punishment through "ordinary" proceedings.
See 19 & 20 Car. II, c. 2; Clarendon's Trial 385-386. To
repeat, the example of Clarendon's banishment is an example
of an individual's being punished through legislation that
subjected him to punishment otherwise unavailable, to any
degree, through "the ordinary course of law"--just as Chase
and his predecessor Wooddeson said. Calder, 3 Dall., at 389,
and n. ##; 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638. See also
Carmell, 529 U. S., at 523, n. 11.

A second problem that the dissent's account raises is one
of historical completeness. That account does not explain
how the second relevant example--the banishment of the
Bishop of Atterbury--can count as an example of a recharacterization of a pre-existing crime. The dissent concedes
that Atterbury was charged with conduct constituting a
"conspiracy to depose George I." Post, at 647. It ought
then to note (but it does not note) that, like the charge of
" `betraying his majesty's secret counsels,' " supra, at 622,
this charge was recognized as a charge of treason, see 2
J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 266-
267 (1883). As the dissent claims, the evidence upon which
Parliament based its decision to banish may have been "meager," and the punishment may even have been greater than
some expected. Post, at 647. But the relevant point is
that Parliament did not recharacterize the Bishop's crime.
Rather, through extraordinary proceedings that concluded
with a punishment that only the legislature could impose,

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

625Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
Parliament aggravated a predefined crime by imposing apunishment that courts could not have imposed in "the ordinary course."Third, the dissent's account raises a problem of

vagueness.
The dissent describes Justice Chase's alternative descriptionof the second category as "shed[ding] light on the meaning"

of the category, post, at 641, and describes the historical references that accompany Chase's alternative description as"illustrative examples,"

post, at 649. But the question is
would the dissent apply the term ex post facto to laws thatfall within the alternative description--or would it not? If

not, how does it reconcile its view with Carmell? See 529
U. S., at 522, n. 9; see also id., at 523 (Wooddeson's categories
"correlate precisely to Calder's four categories"). If so, how
does it explain the fact that the alternative description nowhere says anything about recharacterizing, or "changing
the nature," of a crime?

In our view, the key to the Atterbury and Clarendon examples lies not in any kind of recharacterization, or the like,
but in the fact that Atterbury and Clarendon suffered the
"same sentence"--"banishment." 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638; see also Calder, supra, at 389, n. ## (using the
word "banishment" to describe both examples). As we have
argued, supra, at 614, Parliament aggravated the crimes at
issue by imposing an otherwise unavailable punishment--
namely, banishment--which was, according to Wooddeson, a
"forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course
of law," 2 Systematical View 638.

Fourth, the dissent's initial account suffers from a technical
problem of redundancy. Were the second category always
to involve the recharacterization of an offense in a way that
subjects it to greater punishment, see post, at 642, the second
category would be redundant. Any law falling within it
would also necessarily fall within the third category, which
already encompasses " `[e]very law that . . . inflicts a greater
punishment,' " supra, at 612 (emphasis added).

626 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Fifth, the dissent's historical account raises problems of
pertinence. For one thing, to the extent that we are construing the scope of the Calder categories, we are trying not
to investigate precisely what happened during the trials of
Clarendon and Atterbury, but to determine how, several
decades later, an 18th-century legal commentator and an
18th-century American judge who relied on that commentator--and, by extension, the Framers themselves--likely
understood the scope of the words "ex post facto." Hence,
the dissent's account seems of little relevance once we recognize that:

(1) When Justice Chase set forth his alternative language for the second category (the language that the
historical examples are meant to illuminate), he said
nothing about recharacterizing crimes, Calder, 3 Dall.,
at 389;

(2) When Chase speaks of laws "declaring acts to be
treason, which were not treason, when committed,"
ibid., he uses this language for his alternative description of first category laws, and not second category laws,
supra, at 612; and

(3) Wooddeson says nothing about recharacterizing
crimes and instead uses the Clarendon and Atterbury
examples to illustrate laws that "principally affect the
punishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law," 2 Systematical View 638 (some emphasis added).

Of course, we do not know whether Chase and Wooddeson,
in using such language, had statutes of limitations specifically in mind. We know only that their descriptions of ex
post facto laws and the relevant historical examples indicate
an ex post facto category broad enough to include retroactive
changes in, and applications of, those statutes. And we

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

627Cite as: 539 U. S. 607 (2003)
Opinion of the Court
know that those descriptions fit this case--the dissent's his-torical exegesis notwithstanding.

More importantly, even were we to accept the dissent'sview that Chase's second category examples involved some
kind of recharacterization of criminal behavior (which theydid not), why would recharacterization be the ex post facto
touchstone? Why, in a case where (a) application of a pre-viously inapplicable punishment and (b) recharacterization
(or "changing the nature") of criminal behavior do not comehand in hand, should the absence of the latter make a critical
difference? After all, the presence of a recharacterizationwithout new punishment works no harm. But the presence
of the new punishment without recharacterization works allthe harm. Indeed, it works retroactive harm--a circumstance relevant to the applicability of a constitutional provi-sion aimed at preventing unfair retroactive laws. Perhaps
that is why Justice Chase's alternative description--which,like Wooddeson's, speaks of laws "affect[ing]

the punishment," ibid.--does not mention recharacterization or thelike.

B
The dissent believes that our discussion of the case law is"less persuasive than it may appear at a first glance." Post,

at 633. The dissent says that this case law is "deficient,"and that we rely on an "inapposite" case and other cases that
"flatly contradict" the "principles" on which we rely. Post,at 634, 635.

Having reviewed the relevant cases and commentary, wecontinue to believe that our characterizations are accurate.
We say that courts, "with apparent unanimity until Califor-nia's decision in

Frazer, have continued to state" that "lawsreviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto" and,

"when necessary, so to hold." Supra, at 617. That state-ment is accurate. The dissent refers to no case, outside of
California, that has held, or even suggested, anything tothe contrary.

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
628 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Of course, one might claim that the judges who wrote thecited opinions did not consider the matter as thoroughly as

has the dissent or used precisely the same kind of reasoning.The dissent makes this kind of argument in its discussion of
the old New Jersey case, Moore v. State, 43 N. J. L. 203(1881)--a case that we believe supports our view. The dissent says that the Moore court "expressly stated that a statute reviving an expired limitations period `is not covered byany of [Justice Chase's] classes.' "

Post, at 635. And the
dissent draws from this language the conclusion that Moore"flatly contradict[s]" our views.

Post, at 635.
The dissent, however, has taken the language that it
quotes out of context. In context, the court's statement reflects a conclusion that the language of Justice Chase's first
description of the categories (which Moore used the word
"classes" to describe) does not fit cases in which a State revives time-barred prosecutions. The Moore court immediately adds, however, that Chase's alternative description of
second category laws does fit this case. Indeed, it "easily
embraces" a statute that, like the statute here, retroactively
extends an expired statute of limitations and "exactly describes [its] operation." 43 N. J. L., at 216-217 (emphasis
added). Had the New Jersey court had the benefit of Carmell, 529 U. S., at 522-524, and n. 9, or perhaps even of the
dissent itself, post, at 641, would it not have recognized
Chase's alternative description as an authoritative account
of elements of Chase's "classes"? Would it then not have
withdrawn its earlier statement, which the dissent quotes?
Would it not have simply held that the statute did fall within
the second category? Our reading of the case leads us to
answer these questions affirmatively, but we leave the interested reader to examine the case and draw his or her own
conclusions.

The dissent draws special attention to another case, State
v. Sneed, 25 Tex. Supp. 66 (1860), arguing that it is "inapposite" because it "avoided the issue" whether a law was

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ex post facto "by holding that the statute was not meantto apply retroactively." Post, at 634. Here is the court's

analysis, virtually in full:

"In this case the bar of the statute of limitations ofone year was completed before the Code went into operation . . . . The state having neglected to prosecutewithin the time prescribed for its own action, lost the
right to prosecute the suit. To give an Act of the Legis-lature, passed after such loss, the effect of reviving the
right of action in the State, would give it an operationex post facto, which we cannot suppose the Legislature
intended." 25 Tex. Supp., at 67.
The reader can make up his own mind.Neither can we accept the dissent's view that Judge

Learned Hand's like-minded comments in Falter were "un-supported,"

post, at 637. In fact, Judge Hand's commentshad support in pre-existing case law, commentary, and published legislative debates, supra, at 616-620, and Hand'sopinion specifically cited Moore and two other early cases,
Commonwealth v. Duffy, 96 Pa. 506 (1880), and People v.Buckner, 281 Ill. 340, 117 N. E. 1023 (1917). Falter, 23
F. 2d, at 425.We add that, whatever the exact counts of categories of
cases that we cite, cf. post, at 633, it is not surprising thatmost of these cases involve dicta, while only a handful involve clear holdings. Where the law has long been acceptedas clearly settled, few cases are likely to arise, and cases that
do arise most likely involve bordering areas of law, such asnew limitations statutes enacted

prior to expiration of pre-existing limitations periods. Consistent with this expectation, one commentator noted in 1993 that the questionwhether to give retroactive effect to the extension of unexpired limitations periods had "become timely due to statelegislature amendments during the early 1980s that lengthen
the limitation period for the crimes of rape and sexual inter-course with a child." Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 1.6,

Opinion of the Court
at 36. The law at issue today represents a kind of extremevariant that, given the legal consensus of unconstitutionality,

has not likely been often enacted in our Nation's history.Cf. 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law $ 219a, p. 127 (rev. 4th ed. 1868)
(declining to answer whether a law reviving time-barredprosecutions was ex post facto in part because "it is not likely
to come before the courts").Neither should it be surprising if the reasoning in a string
of cases stretching back over nearly 150 years is not per-fectly consistent with modern conceptions of how legal analysis should proceed. After all, Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167(1925), an opinion relied on by the dissent,

post, at 640, isitself vulnerable to criticism that its "method of analysis is

foreclosed by this Court's precedents," post, at 637. SeeCollins, 497 U. S., at 45-46. In assessing the case law, we
find the essential fact to be the unanimity of judicial viewsthat the kind of statute before us is ex post facto. See
supra, at 617-619.The situation is similar with respect to commentators.
Here, the essential fact is that, over a span of well over acentury, commentators have come to the same conclusion,
and have done so with virtual unanimity. See supra, at 619-620. We say "virtual," for the dissent identifies one commentator who did not, namely, Joel Bishop--the same com-mentator relied on 122 years ago by the dissent in

Moore,supra, at 240. The Moore majority rejected Bishop's conclusion. So did other contemporary courts and commenta-tors. Supra, at 617-620. We do the same.

C
The dissent says it is a "fallacy" to apply the label " `unfairand dishonest' " to this statute, a law that revives long-dead

prosecutions. Post, at 650. The dissent supports this con-clusion with three arguments. First, it suggests that "retroactive extension of unexpired statutes of limitations" is noless unfair.

Ibid. Second, the dissent refers to the small

Opinion of the Court
likelihood that "criminals keep calendars" to mark the expi-ration of limitations periods, and it mocks the possibility that

revival "destroys a reliance interest." Ibid. Third, the dis-sent emphasizes the harm that child molestation causes, a
harm that "will plague the victim for a lifetime," andstresses the need to convict those who abuse children.

Post,
at 651.

In making the first argument, the dissent reverses field,abandoning its historical literalism to appeal to practical consequences. But history, case law, and constitutional pur-poses

all are relevant. At a minimum, the first two of these
adequately explain the difference between expired and unexpired statutes of limitations, and Chase's alternative description of second category laws itself supports such a distinction. See supra, at 613-614, 618-619.

In making its second argument, which denies the existence
of significant reliance interests, the dissent ignores the
potentially lengthy period of time (in this case, 22 years)
during which the accused lacked notice that he might be
prosecuted and during which he was unaware, for example,
of any need to preserve evidence of innocence. See supra,
at 609-610. Memories fade, and witnesses can die or disappear. See supra, at 615-616. Such problems can plague
child abuse cases, where recollection after so many years
may be uncertain, and "recovered" memories faulty, but may
nonetheless lead to prosecutions that destroy families. See,
e. g., Holdsworth, Is It Repressed Memory with Delayed
Recall or Is It False Memory Syndrome? The Controversy
and Its Potential Legal Implications, 22 Law & Psychol. Rev.
103, 103-104 (1998). Regardless, a constitutional principle
must apply not only in child abuse cases, but in every criminal case. And, insofar as we can tell, the dissent's principle
would permit the State to revive a prosecution for any kind
of crime without any temporal limitation. Thus, in the
criminal context, the dissent goes beyond our prior statements of what is constitutionally permissible even in the

analogous civil context. Chase Securities Corp. v. Donald-son, 325 U. S. 304, 312, n. 8, 315-316 (1945) (acknowledging

that extension of even an expired civil limitations period canunconstitutionally infringe upon a "vested right"); William
Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. Co., 268 U. S. 633,637 (1925) (holding the same). But see post, at 638, 653. It
is difficult to believe that the Constitution grants greaterprotection from unfair retroactivity to property than to
human liberty.As to the dissent's third argument, we agree that the
State's interest in prosecuting child abuse cases is an impor-tant one. But there is also a predominating constitutional
interest in forbidding the State to revive a long-forbiddenprosecution. And to hold that such a law is

ex post factodoes not prevent the State from extending time limits for

the prosecution of future offenses, or for prosecutions not yettime barred.

In sum, California's law subjects an individual such asStogner to prosecution long after the State has, in effect,
granted an amnesty, telling him that he is "at liberty to re-turn to his country . . . and that from henceforth he may
cease to preserve the proofs of his innocence," Wharton,Criminal Pleading and Practice $ 316, at 210. See also
Moore, 43 N. J. L., at 223-224. It retroactively withdrawsa complete defense to prosecution after it has already
attached, and it does so in a manner that allows the State towithdraw this defense at will and with respect to individuals
already identified. See supra, at 611. "Unfair" seems to usa fair characterization.

IV
The statute before us is unfairly retroactive as applied toStogner. A long line of judicial authority supports characterization of this law as ex post facto. For the reasonsstated, we believe the law falls within Justice Chase's second
category of ex post facto laws. We conclude that a lawenacted after expiration of a previously applicable limita539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tions period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it isapplied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution. The

California court's judgment to the contrary is

Reversed.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

California has enacted a retroactive extension of statutesof limitations for serious sexual offenses committed against

minors. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 803(g) (West Supp. 2003).The new period includes cases where the limitations period
has expired before the effective date of the legislation. Toinvalidate the statute in the latter circumstance, the Court
tries to force it into the second category of Calder v. Bull,3 Dall. 386 (1798), which prohibits a retroactive law " `that
aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when
committed.' " Ante, at 612 (quoting Calder, supra, at 390
(emphasis in original)). These words, in my view, do not
permit the Court's holding, but indeed foreclose it. A law
which does not alter the definition of the crime but only revives prosecution does not make the crime "greater than it
was, when committed." Until today, a plea in bar has not
been thought to form any part of the definition of the offense.

To overcome this principle, the Court invokes "a long line
of authority holding that a law of this type violates the
Ex Post Facto Clause." Ante, at 621. The Court's list of
precedents, ante, at 617-619, is less persuasive than it may
appear at a first glance. Of the 22 cases cited by the Court,
only 4 had to decide whether a revival of expired prosecutions was constitutional. See Moore v. State, 43 N. J. L. 203,
216-217 (1881); United States v. Fraidin, 63 F. Supp. 271, 276
(Md. 1945); People v. Shedd, 702 P. 2d 267, 268 (Colo. 1985)
(en banc) (per curiam); Commonwealth v. Rocheleau, 404
Mass. 129, 130-131, 533 N. E. 2d 1333, 1334 (1989), cited ante,
at 617. These four cases--which are the only cases that are
relevant--will be discussed in due course.

634 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The case of State v. Sneed, 25 Tex. Supp. 66, 67 (1860),
cited ante, at 617, is inapposite. There, the court avoided
the issue by holding that the statute was not meant to apply
retroactively. Interpreting the statute so as to avoid invalidation on constitutional grounds, Sneed did not pass on the
merits. Even if the court addressed the merits, its cursory
paragraph-long opinion, reproduced by the majority in its
entirety, ante, at 629, contains no reference to Justice Chase's
classification, nor indeed any analysis whatsoever. This unreasoned opinion scarcely supports the majority's novel interpretation of Calder's second category.

In the remaining 17 cases, the question was not presented.
As the Court itself concedes, eight of these cases considered
only extensions of unexpired statutes of limitations, and upheld them. Ante, at 618. The Court does not mention that
nine other cases have done so as well. See People ex rel.
Reibman v. Warden, 242 App. Div. 282, 275 N. Y. S. 59 (1934);
State v. Hodgson, 108 Wash. 2d 662, 740 P. 2d 848 (1987) (en
banc); State v. Nunn, 244 Kan. 207, 768 P. 2d 268 (1989); State
v. O'Neill, 118 Idaho 244, 796 P. 2d 121 (1990); State v. Schultzen, 522 N. W. 2d 833 (Iowa 1994); State v. Comeau, 142 N. H.
84, 697 A. 2d 497 (1997); State v. Hamel, 138 N. H. 392, 643
A. 2d 953 (1994); Santiago v. Commonwealth, 428 Mass. 39,
697 N. E. 2d 979 (1998), cited ante, at 617. Because these
cases did not need to decide whether the Ex Post Facto
Clause would bar the extension of expired limitations periods, the question did not receive the same amount of attention as if the courts were required to dispose of the issue.

The case law compiled by the Court is deficient, furthermore, at a more fundamental level. Our precedents hold
that the reach of the Ex Post Facto Clause is strictly limited
to the precise formulation of the Calder categories. We
have made it clear that these categories provide "an exclusive definition of ex post facto laws," Collins v. Youngblood,
497 U. S. 37, 42 (1990), and have admonished that it is

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
"a mistake to stray beyond Calder's four categories," Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 539 (2000). Justice Chase himself stressed that the categories must be construed with cau-tion to avoid any unnecessary extension: "I am under a

necessity to give a construction, or explanation of the words,`

ex post facto law,' because they have not any certain meaning attached to them. But I will not go farther than I feel
myself bound to do; and if I ever exercise the jurisdiction Iwill not decide

any law to be void, but in a very clear case."
3 Dall., at 395.The Court seems to recognize these principles,

ante, at
611-612, but then relies on cases which flatly contradict
them. The opinion of the New Jersey's Court of Errors and
Appeals in Moore v. State, supra, on which the Court places
special emphasis, see ante, at 613, 617, 628, 630, 632, expressly stated that a statute reviving an expired limitations
period "is not covered by any of [Justice Chase's] classes."
43 N. J. L., at 216. The Moore court made a fleeting mention
that the statute might fall within Chase's fourth category,
but immediately dismissed this line of inquiry. Instead, it
proceeded to "[l]oo[k] away from his classification to what he
states to have been the motive for and principle sustaining
the edict." Ibid. As Collins and Carmell explained, this
expansive approach to the Ex Post Facto Clause is contrary
to Calder's admonition that its categories must be followed
with care.

The majority's lengthy defense of Moore's legitimacy, ante,
at 628, exposes the weaknesses both of that case and of the
Court's opinion. The majority argues Moore's statement
that the statute was not covered by Justice Chase's categories referred only to the principal description of these categories, but not to the alternative one the Court now seeks
to embrace. The view that a statute not covered by Justice
Chase's main formulations--the only formulations our cases
have treated as authoritative--may still be ex post facto if it
falls within his historical examples is a view no court until

today has endorsed. The Moore court was no exception.When it held that the state statute was "not covered by any

of [Justice Chase's] classes," Moore made clear it was lookingbeyond the language of the

Calder categories: "Judge Chase
did not consider his classes as exhaustive," and so "a statutesubstantially imposing punishment for a previous act which,

without the statute, would not be so punishable, is an ex post
facto law, although it may not be included in the letter ofJudge Chase's rules." 43 N. J. L., at 216, 220. The point

was further emphasized by the separate opinion of Chancel-lor Runyon, a member of the one-judge

Moore majority that
invalidated the law as ex post facto: "[W]here the enactment,
in whatever guise legislative ingenuity or subtlety may present it, inflicts the substantial injury, and does the essential
wrong which the constitution sought to guard against, a true
interpretation will hold it to be within the prohibition." Id.,
at 226. The references to "substantia[l] imposi[tion of] punishment" and "substantial injury" are reminiscent of the references to "substantial protections" and "substantial personal rights" used to enlarge the scope of the Ex Post Facto
Clause and disapproved of in Collins. 497 U. S., at 46. By
endorsing Moore, the majority seeks to resurrect this rejected reasoning here.

The other precedents the Court invokes--both the cases
where extension of expired statutes of limitations was at
issue and the cases which merely opined on the question in
dicta--have the same flaw. The misconception causing it
arises from Judge Learned Hand's dictum, mentioned while
holding that an extension of an unexpired statute of limitations is not ex post facto, that if the statute had expired there
would be a violation. Falter v. United States, 23 F. 2d 420,
425 (CA2 1928). Judge Hand based this distinction on a citation of the faulty decision in Moore and on his belief that
whether an extension of a limitations period is ex post facto
"turns upon how much violence is done to our instinctive
feelings of justice and fair play." Falter, supra, at 425-426.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The Court's opinion is premised on the same approach. Itrelies on Judge Hand for the proposition that an extension

of expired limitations periods " `seems to most of us unfairand dishonest.' "

Ante, at 611 (quoting Falter, supra, at
426). In previous cases, however, the Court has explainedthat this conception of our

ex post facto jurisprudence is incorrect: "[W]hile the principle of unfairness helps explain
and shape the Clause's scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself,invalidating laws under the

Ex Post Facto Clause by its own
force." Carmell, supra, at 533, n. 23 (citing W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int'l, 493 U. S.
400, 409 (1990)).

It was the unsupported Hand observation that formed the
rationale applied by many of the cases the Court cites, including all the post-Moore cases where expired limitations
periods were at issue. See Fraidin, 63 F. Supp., at 276 (relying on Falter and containing no discussion of the Calder
categories); Shedd, 702 P. 2d, at 268 (same); Hodgson, 108
Wash. 2d, at 667-668, 740 P. 2d, at 851 (relying on, and quoting from, Falter); Rocheleau, 404 Mass., at 130, 533 N. E. 2d,
at 1334 (containing no Calder analysis but relying instead on
its earlier decision in Commonwealth v. Bargeron, 402 Mass.
589, 524 N. E. 2d 829 (1988), which in turn was based on
Falter); O'Neill, 118 Idaho, at 246, 796 P. 2d, at 123 (citing
Falter and supplying no analysis of its own); State v. Hirsch,
245 Neb. 31, 39, 511 N. W. 2d 69, 76 (1994) (relying on Falter);
Hamel, 138 N. H., at 395, 643 A. 2d, at 955 (same). Since
these cases applied the methodology our Court has disavowed, they provide the majority with scant support. None
of them even discussed the issue in terms of Calder's second
category, much less construed that category in the manner
today's decision improperly proposes. The flaw of these
cases is not, as the majority argues, that they are "not perfectly consistent with modern conceptions of how legal analysis should proceed," ante, at 630; the flaw is that their
method of analysis is foreclosed by this Court's precedents.

638 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The majority turns for help to a roster of commentatorswho concluded that revival of expired statutes of limitations

is precluded by the ex post facto guarantee. See ante, at619-620. Some of the commentators applied the same expansive approach we have declared impermissible in Collinsand

Carmell. Henry Black, on whose work the Court relies
the most, see ante, at 613, 615, 619, openly acknowledged
that the revival of expired statutes of limitations is not cov-ered by any of the

Calder categories. See Constitutional
Prohibitions Against Legislation Impairing the Obligation ofContracts, and Against Retroactive and Ex Post Facto Laws

$ 227, p. 291 (1887). Black, moreover, relied on the example
of the civil statutes of limitations, which he believed could
not be revived. Id., $ 235, at 296-297. The Court's later
case law has rendered this interpretation questionable.
See, e. g., Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U. S. 304,
314-316 (1945). Other commentators relied, often with no
analysis, on the Moore and Falter line of cases, which were
plagued by methodological infirmities since discovered. See
authorities cited ante, at 619. None of these scholars explained their conclusion by reference to Calder's second
category.

There are scholars who have considered with care the
meaning of that category; and they reached the conclusion
stated in this dissent, not the conclusion embraced by the
majority. In his treatise on retroactive legislation, William
Wade defined the category as covering the law "which undertakes to aggravate a past offence, and make it greater than
when committed, endeavors to bring it under some description of transgression against which heavier penalties or more
severe punishments have been denounced: as, changing the
character of an act which, when committed, was a misdemeanor, to a crime; or, declaring a previously committed offence, of one of the classes graduated, and designated by the
number of its degree, to be of a higher degree than it was
when committed." Operation and Construction of Retroac539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
tive Laws $ 273, pp. 317-318 (1880). Joel Prentiss Bishop's
work on statutory crimes concluded that a law reviving expired prosecution "is not within any of the recognized legal
definitions of an ex post facto law." Commentaries on the
Law of Statutory Crimes $ 266, p. 294 (rev. 3d ed. 1901).
The author's explanation is an apt criticism of the Court's
opinion: "The punishment which it renders possible, by forbidding the defense of lapse of time, is exactly what the law
provided when `the fact' transpired. No bending of language, no supplying of implied meanings, can, in natural reason, work out the contrary conclusion. . . . The running of
the old statute had taken from the courts the right to proceed against the offender, leaving the violated law without
its former remedy; but it had not obliterated the fact that
the law forbade the act when it was done, or removed from
the doer's mind his original consciousness of guilt." Id.,

$ 266, at 294-295. In reaching his conclusion, Bishop considered, and rejected, the argument put forth by the Moore
majority. Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes,
supra, $ 266, at 295, and n. 5. This rejection does not, as the
majority believes, undermine Bishop's conclusion, see ante,
at 630; given Moore's infirmities, it strengthens the validity
of his interpretation.

This definition of Calder's second category is necessary for
consistency with our accepted understanding of categories
one and three. The first concerns laws declaring innocent
acts to be a crime; the third prohibits retroactive increases
in punishment. 3 Dall., at 390. The first three categories
guard against the common problem of retroactive redefinition of conduct by criminalizing it (category one), enhancing
its criminal character (category two), or increasing the applicable punishment (category three). The link between these
categories was noted by Justice Paterson in Calder itself:
"The enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems to come
within the same mischief as the creation of a crime or pen539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
640 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
alty; and therefore they may be classed together." Id.,at 397.

The point is well illustrated in Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S.167 (1925), whose formulation of the

Calder categories we
later described as "faithful to our best knowledge of the orig-inal understanding of the

Ex Post Facto Clause." Collins,
497 U. S., at 43. Beazell involved a retroactively applied law
providing for joint trials for most felonies, with separatetrials allowed only when requested by one of the defendants

or the prosecutor, and only with the leave of the court. 269U. S., at 168-169. The prior law had provided for separate
trials whenever a defendant so requested. Id., at 168. Reviewing an ex post facto challenge to the new law, the Court
noted that the first three Calder categories address "the
criminal quality attributable to an act." 269 U. S., at 170.
Applying this definition, the Court held the state statute did
not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because "[i]t does not
deprive [the defendant] of any defense previously available,
nor affect the criminal quality of the act charged. Nor does
it change the legal definition of the offense or the punishment
to be meted out." Ibid. In other words, the Ohio statute
fell into none of the first three Calder categories. The second category, as the Beazell Court understood it, covered
those retroactive statutes which "affect the criminal quality
of the act charged [by] chang[ing] the legal definition of
the offense." 269 U. S., at 170. The California statute challenged by petitioner changes only the timespan within which
the action against him may be filed; it does not alter the
criminal quality assigned to the offense.

The Court's opinion renders the second Calder category
unlimited and the surrounding categories redundant. A law
which violates the first Calder category would also violate
the Court's conception of category two, because such a law
would "inflic[t] punishments, where the party was not, by
law, liable to any punishment." Ante, at 612 (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted). The majority

Kennedy, J., dissenting
attempts to eliminate this redundancy by limiting its defini-tion to instances where the conduct was criminal, yet if Justice Chase's alternative description of the second category issupposed to be definitive of its scope,

ante, at 611, it would
seem to strike broader than the Court's limiting construc-tion. Similarly, a retroactive law increasing punishment in

violation of the third category would also constitute an "innovation" for which, prior to the passage of the new law, theoffender was not liable,

ante, at 612, and so be prohibited
under the Court's unbounded interpretation of category two.The Court's new definition not only distorts the original

meaning of the second Calder category, but also threatens
the coherence of the overall ex post facto scheme.

Realizing the inconsistency, the majority scarcely refers to
the authoritative language Justice Chase used to describe
the second category. Instead, the Court relies on what it
terms Justice Chase's alternative description of that category, which speaks about laws which " `inflict[ed] punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment.' " Ante, at 612 (emphasis deleted) (quoting Calder, 3
Dall., at 389). These words are not, strictly speaking, a description of the second category itself; they are a description
of the category's historical origins. Justice Chase used
them to refer to certain laws passed by the British Parliament which led the Founders to adopt the Ex Post Facto
Clause; he did not intend them as a definitive description of
the laws prohibited by that constitutional provision. Ibid.
This description of a category's origins may, of course, shed
light on the meaning of Justice Chase's principal formulation,
which was meant to be definitive. The Court, however, uses
Chase's alternative description as the independent operative
definition of that category. None of our precedents, until
today, based their holding on the language of Justice Chase's
alternative description, certainly not in situations when the
statute under review would not fit within the principal
formulation.

The Court, in any event, misunderstands the alternative
description. As our precedents have instructed, this description must be viewed in the context of the history of
the British parliamentary enactments to which Justice Chase
referred. Ante, at 614; cf. Carmell, 529 U. S., at 526-530
(examining the historical circumstances of the case of Sir
John Fenwick, cited by Justice Chase as an example of the
fourth ex post facto category, in order "[t]o better understand
the type of law that falls within that category"). With respect to the second category, Justice Chase provided two examples: the banishments of Lord Clarendon in 1667 and of
Bishop Francis Atterbury in 1723. Calder, supra, at 389,
and n. ## (citing 19 Car. II, c. 10; 9 Geo. I, c. 17). A consideration of both historical episodes confirms that Calder's second category concerns only laws which change the nature
of an offense to make it greater than it was at the time of
commission, thereby subjecting the offender to increased
punishment.

Justice Chase and, it can be presumed, the Founders were
familiar with the parliamentary proceedings leading to the
banishment of the Earl of Clarendon. Clarendon, former
Lord Chancellor and principal advisor to Charles II, was impeached by the House of Commons on charges of treason.
Edward Earl of Clarendon's Trial, 6 How. St. Tr. 292, 330-
334, 350 (1667) (hereinafter Clarendon's Trial); G. Miller,
Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon 20-21 (1983). The House
of Lords, however, refused to commit Clarendon to trial,
finding the allegations not cognizable as treason under the
law. Clarendon's Trial 358, 367. With the two Houses
deadlocked, Clarendon left the country, an exit wise for his
safety, perhaps, but not for his cause. For upon his departure the impeachment was abandoned yet Parliament agreed
on a bill banishing Clarendon for treason and imposing
an extensive range of civil disabilities. Id., at 374, 385,
390-391.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The principal objection raised against the impeachmentcharges was that they did not, under the law of the time,

constitute treason. Id., at 342-346, 348-349, 350, 356-360,367-372. The objection was not, it must be noted, that the
charges were premised on innocent conduct. (If that werethe nature of the objection, Justice Chase would have used
the case to illustrate his first category, rather than his second one.) In fact, the impeachment explicitly alleged thatClarendon violated the law. See

id., at 330-333. The objection made by Chase and by later legal scholars was thatby the act of banishment the House sought to elevate criminal behavior of lower magnitude to the level of treason,
thereby redefining what constitutes a treasonous offense.
Even if Parliament assumed, on the basis of Clarendon's
flight, that the allegations were true, see id., at 389-390, that
constructive admission did not alter the fact that, under the
laws of the time, the allegations could not support a charge
of treason. By enacting the bill, Parliament declared these
allegations sufficient to constitute treason. Some parliamentary colloquy suggested, moreover, that Clarendon was
being punished for his flight, rather than for offenses alleged.
See id., at 389 ("[I]t is plain, if you proceed upon this bill,
you go not upon your impeachment, but because he is fled
from the justice of the land"). A flight from justice was not
considered an offense so severe as to warrant banishment,
"the highest punishment next to death." Id., at 386. If the
offense of flight was enhanced because of the prior offenses,
then it was an increase in the gravity of the crime after its
commission. Either way, the legislation increased the gravity of Clarendon's offense.

The bill passed against Clarendon accomplished what English common-law scholar Richard Wooddeson described as
the danger against which the second ex post facto category
was designed to guard. The bill "ma[de] some innovation,
or creat[ed] some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the
ordinary course of law." 2 A Systematical View of the Laws

Kennedy, J., dissenting
of England 638 (1792) (hereinafter Wooddeson). It wasWooddeson's interpretation of the English common law that

Justice Chase relied upon. See Calder, 3 Dall., at 391; Carmell, supra, at 522-523, and n. 10; ante, at 614. The Court
argues that the innovation deplored by Wooddeson was theimposition of a sanction (banishment) which, under settled

law, was the prerogative of Parliament, not of the courts.
Ibid. That may be so, but it cannot help the Court becausethis is not what California has done. Section 803(g) did not

impose any punishment not otherwise contained in the Cal-ifornia Penal Code. It did what legislatures have done
throughout history: It specified when the criminal justice
system may prosecute certain crimes. The majority tries to
explain away this distinction as "not determinative," ibid.,
but it makes all the difference. By imposing on a particular
offender a punishment not prescribed by the existing legal
norms a legislature signals its judgment that the gravity of
the offense warrants its special intervention. In contrast,
by prescribing general rules for the adjudication of offenses
the legislature leaves the determination of the offender's culpability entirely to the courts.

The majority's explanation of the English precedents, in
all events, is not the most logical one. Justice Chase's alternative description covered enactments which "inflicted punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any
punishment." Calder, supra, at 389. Though only a parliamentary Act could subject an individual to banishment in
17th-century England, Parliament's power to pass such Acts
was unquestioned. See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of
English Law 569 (1938). A sanction of banishment was acknowledged as a punishment provided for by the existing
laws, both at the time of Clarendon's trial and afterwards.
See, e. g., Craies, Compulsion of Subjects to Leave the
Realm, 6 L. Q. Rev. 388, 392 (1890) ("[B]anishment, perpetual
or temporary, was well known to the common law"); An Act
for Punishment of Rogues, 39 Eliz. 1, c. 4, s. 4 (1597) (permit539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ting banishment of dangerous rogues); the Roman CatholicRelief Act, 10 Geo. 4, c. 7, s. 28 (1829) (providing for the

banishment of Jesuits). By law, then, a charge of high trea-son would have made Clarendon liable to banishment, which
is inconsistent with Justice Chase's formulation.To explain away the inconsistency, the Court redefines the
words "by law" to refer only to punishments "not otherwise
available `in the ordinary course of law.' " Ante, at 614(quoting 2 Wooddeson 638). As already explained, it was an

accepted procedure in 17th-century England for Parliamentto pass laws imposing banishment.

The majority must mean, then, that banishment was not
available through the courts. At the time of Clarendon's
trial, however, British courts were empowered to adjudicate
treason and to punish it with death. 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the
Crown *348-*351; see also 2 Jowitt's Dictionary of English
Law 1799-1800 (2d ed. 1977). If the charges against Clarendon accurately alleged treason, he was eligible, through ordinary judicial proceedings, to receive capital punishment,
which was obviously a sanction more severe than banishment. For the majority's historical explanation to work,
Justice Chase's alternative description of the second category would have to prohibit laws which inflicted a punishment where the party was not, through normal judicial proceedings, liable to that precise punishment but was liable to
a greater one. This formulation can hardly be reconciled
with the words Justice Chase used, much less with his principal formulation of the second category. A legislature does
not make an individual's crime "greater than it was, when
committed," Calder, supra, at 390, by assigning a punishment less severe than the one available through the courts.

If Justice Chase's reference to Clarendon's trial is to have
explanatory power, one must look for an alternative interpretation. What was repulsive to Chase and Wooddeson in
Clarendon's trial was not the imposition of banishment as
such, but that the sanction was outside the limits of what

646 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Clarendon's offense merited under the law established at thetime of its commission, and was instead premised on Parliament's exaggeration of the gravity of the offense. Viewedthis way, the Clarendon example lends no support to the majority's position, but instead undercuts it.It must be acknowledged that, as the majority points out,
a number of historians have treated one of the charges levied
against Clarendon, that of betraying the King's secrets tothe enemy, as impeachable treason.

Ante, at 622-623. The
historical judgment, however, is not as uniform as the Courtmakes it seem. See 7 E. Foss, Judges of England 130 (1864)

("No one can read the articles [against Clarendon] without
seeing the weakness and frivolity of the allegations, none of
them, even if true, amounting to treason"); R. Berger, Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems 45-46 (1974) (explaining the articles of impeachment against Clarendon as
based on the Parliament's power to declare certain nontreasonous offenses to be treason).

Historians are in agreement, though, that the Commons
could not substantiate the charge of betraying secrets to the
enemy. 2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England:
From the Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II
367, 373 (rev. ed. 1881); Roberts, The Impeachment of the
Earl of Clarendon, 13 Camb. Hist. J. 13-14 (1957); Roberts,
The Law of Impeachment in Stuart England, 84 Yale L. J.
1419, 1426 (1975); Berger, supra, at 45, n. 193. It is due to
this absence of evidence that the Commons refused to
produce particulars of the treason charge against Clarendon, insisting instead the Lords trust their word that the underlying conduct was treasonous. Although the technical
grounds for the Lords' objection to this charge was the lack
of specificity, the objection can also be viewed as reflecting
a belief that the Commons were attempting to aggravate
Clarendon's offenses by labeling them as treason absent any
justification. As Henry Hallam has explained in his respected study of the English constitutional history, "if the

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
house of lords shall be of opinion, either by consulting thejudges or otherwise, that no treason is specially alleged, they

should, notwithstanding any technical words, treat the of-fence as a misdemeanor." 2 Hallam,

supra, at 413. Justice
Chase could have viewed the betrayal of secrets charge in asimilar way, as a subterfuge through which the Commons

were trying to elevate Clarendon's offenses to the level of
treason.The proposed interpretation of Clarendon's example is

reinforced by considering the proceedings against BishopFrancis Atterbury, who, in the midst of hysteria over both
real and supposed Jacobite plots, was accused of conspiracy
to depose George I. The evidence against Atterbury was
meager, and supporters of the Crown, fearing that neither
the common-law courts nor even the House of Lords would
convict, introduced a bill of banishment. G. Bennett, Tory
Crisis in Church and State, 1688-1730, pp. 258-265 (1975);
Bishop Atterbury's Trial, 16 How. St. Tr. 323, 640 (1723) (reprint 2000) (hereinafter Atterbury's Trial). The bill declared Atterbury a traitor, and subjected him to a range of
punishments not previously imposed, including exile and civil
death. Id., at 644-646; Bennett, supra, at 265. The Duke
of Wharton, who registered the lengthiest dissent, commented that "this Bill seems as irregular in the punishments
it inflicts, as it is in its foundation, and carries with it

an unnatural degree of hardship." Atterbury's Trial 691.
The only bill of comparable harshness was the Act banishing
Clarendon. Those sanctions were more mild, id., at 691-692,
but, as we have seen, just as violative of the rule against
penalties imposed after the fact. As in the case of Clarendon, Parliament adjudged Atterbury's offense to be so grave
as to merit a singularly severe punishment. The bill designed vindictive forfeitures and disabilities not imposed in
the ordinary course of law.

The Atterbury case illustrates again the close relationship
between the second and the third Calder categories. See

648 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
supra, at 639-640 (quoting Calder, 3 Dall., at 397 (Paterson,J.)). As already explained,

supra, at 640-641, the Court's
misconstruction of Justice Chase's historical examples takesthe second category out of this logical continuum. Contrary

to the majority's belief, ante, at 625, an interpretation whichhighlights the link between these two categories is more
faithful to the original understanding. Richard Wooddeson,
the Court's preferred commentator, discussed these two cat-egories together, noting that both "principally affect

the punishment." 2 Wooddeson 638-640; see also id., at 624.Atterbury's trial also illustrates why the majority's interpretation of the historical examples as premised on the
courts' inability to impose banishment is untenable. See
supra, at 645-646. Had Atterbury been convicted of treason through the courts, he would have been subject to capital
punishment. Parliament's decision to prosecute Atterbury
may have been driven by fear of backlash provoked by a
death sentence, for Atterbury enjoyed considerable popularity and sympathy in some circles. See Bennett, supra, at
259. Wooddeson speculated, in an observation in tension
with the majority's interpretation, that Atterbury's sentence
may have been motivated by a desire "of mitigating punishment." 2 Wooddeson 639. The mitigation, of course, was
in comparison to the possible death verdict, not, as already
explained, in comparison to the ordinary noncapital punishment Atterbury could have received.

Clarendon's and Atterbury's trials show why Stogner's
case does not belong in Calder's second ex post facto category. The California Legislature did not change retroactively the description of Stogner's alleged offense so as to
subject him to an unprecedented and particularly severe
punishment. The offense is described in the same terms as
before the passage of $ 803(g); the punishment remains the
same. The character of the offense is therefore unchanged;
it is perceived by the criminal justice system in the same
way as before, and punished with the same force. The only

Kennedy, J., dissenting
change is that Stogner may now be prosecuted, whereasprior to the statute the prosecution could not have taken

place. These illustrative examples, then, suggest the second
Calder category encompasses only the laws which, to the
detriment of the defendant, change the character of theoffense to make it greater than it was at the time of

commission.

The majority seems to suggest that retroactive extensionof expired limitations periods is " `arbitrary and potentially

vindictive legislation,' " ante, at 611 (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 29, and n. 10 (1981)), but does not attempt
to support this accusation. And it could not do so. The
California statute can be explained as motivated by legitimate concerns about the continuing suffering endured by the
victims of childhood abuse.

The California Legislature noted that "young victims
often delay reporting sexual abuse because they are easily
manipulated by offenders in positions of authority and trust,
and because children have difficulty remembering the crime
or facing the trauma it can cause." People v. Frazer, 21 Cal.
4th 737, 744, 982 P. 2d 180, 183-184 (1999). The concern is
amply supported by empirical studies. See, e. g., Summit,
Abuse of the Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome,
in 1 J. of Child Sexual Abuse 153, 156-163 (1992); Lyon, Scientific Support for Expert Testimony on Child Sexual Abuse
Accommodation, in Critical Issues in Child Sexual Abuse
107, 114-120 (J. Conte ed. 2002).

The problem the legislature sought to address is illustrated well by this case. Petitioner's older daughter testified she did not report the abuse because she was afraid of
her father and did not believe anyone would help her. After
she left petitioner's home, she tried to forget the abuse.
Petitioner's younger daughter did not report the abuse because she was scared. He tried to convince her it was a
normal way of life. Even after she moved out of petitioner's
house, she was afraid to speak for fear she would not be

believed. She tried to pretend she had a normal childhood.It was only her realization that the father continued to abuse

other children in the family that led her to disclose the abuse,in order to protect them.

The Court tries to counter by saying the California statuteis " `unfair and dishonest' " because it violated the State's initial assurance to the offender that " `he has become safe from
its pursuit' " and deprived him of "the `fair warning.' "
Ante, at 611 (quoting Falter v. United States, 23 F. 2d, at
426; Weaver, supra, at 28). The fallacy of this rationale isapparent when we recall that the Court is careful to leave in

place the uniform decisions by state and federal courts to
uphold retroactive extension of unexpired statutes of limitations against an ex post facto challenge. Ante, at 613.

There are two rationales to explain the proposed dichotomy between unexpired and expired statutes, and neither
works. The first rationale must be the assumption that if an
expired statute is extended, the crime becomes more serious,
thereby violating category two; but if an unexpired statute
is extended, the crime does not increase in seriousness.
There is no basis in logic, in our cases, or in the legal literature to support this distinction. Both extensions signal,
with equal force, the policy to prosecute offenders.

This leaves the second rationale, which must be that an
extension of the expired statute destroys a reliance interest.
We should consider whether it is warranted to presume that
criminals keep calendars so they can mark the day to discard
their records or to place a gloating phone call to the victim.
The first expectation is minor and likely imaginary; the second is not, but there is no conceivable reason the law should
honor it. And either expectation assumes, of course, the
very result the Court reaches; for if the law were otherwise,
there would be no legitimate expectation. The reliance exists, if at all, because of the circular reason that the Court
today says so; it does not exist as part of our traditions or
social understanding.

In contrast to the designation of the crime, which carriesa certain measure of social opprobrium and presupposes a

certain punishment, the statute of limitations has little orno deterrent effect. See Note, Retroactive Application of
Legislatively Enlarged Statutes of Limitations for ChildAbuse: Time's No Bar to Revival, 22 Ind. L. Rev. 989, 1014
(1989) ("The statute of limitations has no measurable impact
on allegedly criminal behavior, neither encouraging nor de-terring such conduct"); Note, Ex Post Facto Limitations

on Legislative Power, 73 Mich. L. Rev. 1491, 1513 (1975)("[W]hile many defendants rely on substantive definitions of
proscribed conduct, few rely on many of the numerous laws
regulating the enforcement processes"). The Court does
not claim a sex offender would desist if he knew he would be
liable to prosecution when his offenses were disclosed.

The law's approach to the analogous problem of reliance
by wrongdoers in the civil sphere is instructive. We have
held that expired statutes of limitations can be repealed to
revive a civil action. See, e. g., Chase Securities Corp., 325
U. S., at 314; Plaut v. Sprendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211,
229 (1995). These holdings were made in the areas of contracts and investments where reliance does exist and does
matter. We allow the civil wrong to be vindicated nonetheless. If we do so in the civil sphere where reliance is real,
we should do so in the criminal sphere where it is, for the
most part, a fictional construct.

When a child molester commits his offense, he is well
aware the harm will plague the victim for a lifetime. See
Briere & Runtz, Post Sexual Abuse Trauma: Data and Implications for Clinical Practice, 2 J. of Interpersonal Violence
367, 374-376 (1987); 1 J. Myers, Evidence in Child Abuse and
Neglect Cases $ 4.2, pp. 221-223 (2d ed. 1992); Browne &
Finkelhor, Initial and Long-Term Effects: A Review of the
Research, in A Sourcebook on Child Sexual Abuse 143, 150-
164 (D. Finkelhor et al. eds. 1986). The victims whose interests $ 803(g) takes into consideration have been subjected to

539US2 Unit: $U83 [07-05-05 18:57:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
652 STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
sexual abuse within the confines of their own homes and by
people they trusted and relied upon for protection. A familial figure of authority can use a confidential relation to conceal a crime. The violation of this trust inflicts deep and
lasting hurt. Its only poor remedy is that the law will show
its compassion and concern when the victim at last can find
the strength, and know the necessity, to come forward.
When the criminal has taken distinct advantage of the
tender years and perilous position of a fearful victim, it is
the victim's lasting hurt, not the perpetrator's fictional reliance, that the law should count the higher. The victims
whose cause is now before the Court have at last overcome
shame and the desire to repress these painful memories.
They have reported the crimes so that the violators are
brought to justice and harm to others is prevented. The
Court now tells the victims their decision to come forward
is in vain.

The gravity of the crime was known, and is being measured, by its wrongfulness when committed. It is a common
policy for States to suspend statutes of limitations for civil
harms against minors, in order to "protec[t] minors during
the period when they are unable to protect themselves." 2
C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 10.2.1, p. 104 (1991).
Some States toll the limitations periods for minors even
where a guardian is appointed, see id., at 105-106, and even
when the tolling conflicts with statutes of repose, id., at 108.
The difference between suspension and reactivation is so
slight that it is fictional for the Court to say, in the given
context, the new policy somehow alters the magnitude of the
crime. The wrong was made clear by the law at the time of
the crime's commission. The criminal actor knew it, even
reveled in it. It is the commission of the then-unlawful act
that the State now seeks to punish. The gravity of the
crime is left unchanged by altering a statute of limitations
of which the actor was likely not at all aware.

The California statute does not fit any of the remainingCalder categories: It does not criminalize conduct which was

innocent when done; it allows the prosecutor to seek thesame punishment as the law authorized at the time the offense was committed and no more; and it does not alter thegovernment's burden to establish the elements of the crime.
Any concern about stale evidence can be addressed by thejudge and the jury, and by the requirement of proof beyond
reasonable doubt. Section 803(g), moreover, contains an ad-ditional safeguard: It conditions prosecution on a presentation of independent evidence that corroborates the victim'sallegations by clear and convincing evidence. Cal. Penal
Code Ann. $$ 803(g)(1), (2)(B) (West Supp. 2003). These pro-tections, as well as the general protection against oppressive
prosecutions offered by the Due Process Clause, should as-suage the majority's fear,

ante, at 631, that the statute willhave California overrun by vindictive prosecutions resting

on unreliable recovered memories. See United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977).The statute does not violate petitioner's rights under the

Due Process Clause. We have held, in the civil context, thatexpired statutes of limitations do not implicate fundamental
rights under the Clause. See, e. g., Chase Securities Corp.,supra, at 314. For reasons already explained, see supra, at
652, there is no reason to reach a different conclusion here.The Court's stretching of Calder's second category contradicts the historical understanding of that category, departsfrom established precedent, and misapprehends the purposes
of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Court also disregards theinterests of those victims of child abuse who have found the
courage to face their abusers and bring them to justice. TheCourt's opinion harms not only our

ex post facto jurispru-dence but also these and future victims of child abuse, and

so compels my respectful dissent.

656 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Stevens, J., concurring
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,and with whom

Justice Souter joins as to Part III,concurring.

Beginning in 1996, Nike was besieged with a series of alle-gations that it was mistreating and underpaying workers at
foreign facilities. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. Nike re-sponded to these charges in numerous ways, such as by sending out press releases, writing letters to the editors of vari-ous newspapers around the country, and mailing letters to
university presidents and athletic directors. See id., at 3a-4a. In addition, in 1997, Nike commissioned a report by former Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young onthe labor conditions at Nike production facilities. See id.,
at 67a. After visiting 12 factories, "Young issued a reportthat commented favorably on working conditions in the
factories and found no evidence of widespread abuse or mis-treatment of workers." Ibid.

In April 1998, respondent Marc Kasky, a California resi-dent, sued Nike for unfair and deceptive practices under California's Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. CodeAnn. $ 17200 et seq. (West 1997), and False Advertising Law,

$ 17500 et seq. Respondent asserted that "in order to maintain and/or increase its sales," Nike made a number of "falsestatements and/or material omissions of fact" concerning the

working conditions under which Nike products are manufac-tured. Lodging of Petitioners 2 (|| 1). Respondent alleged
"no harm or damages whatsoever regarding himself individ-ually,"

id., at 4-5 (|| 8), but rather brought the suit "on behalf
of the General Public of the State of California and on infor-mation and belief,"

id., at 3 (|| 3).
Nike filed a demurrer to the complaint, contending thatrespondent's suit was absolutely barred by the First Amendment. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leaveto amend and entered a judgment of dismissal. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 80a-81a. Respondent appealed, and the California
Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that Nike's statements

Stevens, J., concurring
"form[ed] part of a public dialogue on a matter of public con-cern within the core area of expression protected by the

First Amendment." Id., at 79a. The California Court ofAppeal also rejected respondent's argument that it was error
for the trial court to deny him leave to amend, reasoningthat there was "no reasonable possibility" that the complaint
could be amended to allege facts that would justify any restrictions on what was--in the court's view--Nike's "non-commercial speech."

Ibid.
On appeal, the California Supreme Court reversed andremanded for further proceedings. The court held that

"[b]ecause the messages in question were directed by a commercial speaker to a commercial audience, and because they
made representations of fact about the speaker's own business operations for the purpose of promoting sales of its
products, . . . [the] messages are commercial speech." 27
Cal. 4th 939, 946, 45 P. 3d 243, 247 (2002). However, the
court emphasized that the suit "is still at a preliminary stage,
and that whether any false representations were made is a
disputed issue that has yet to be resolved." Ibid.

We granted certiorari to decide two questions: (1)
whether a corporation participating in a public debate may
"be subjected to liability for factual inaccuracies on the theory that its statements are `commercial speech' because they
might affect consumers' opinions about the business as a
good corporate citizen and thereby affect their purchasing
decisions"; and (2) even assuming the California Supreme
Court properly characterized such statements as commercial speech, whether the "First Amendment, as applied to
the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, permit[s]
subjecting speakers to the legal regime approved by that
court in the decision below." Pet. for Cert. i. Today, however, the Court dismisses the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.

In my judgment, the Court's decision to dismiss the writ
of certiorari is supported by three independently sufficient

Stevens, J., concurring
reasons: (1) the judgment entered by the California Su-preme Court was not final within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.

$ 1257; (2) neither party has standing to invoke the jurisdic-tion of a federal court; and (3) the reasons for avoiding the
premature adjudication of novel constitutional questionsapply with special force to this case.

I
The first jurisdictional problem in this case revolvesaround the fact that the California Supreme Court never entered a final judgment. Congress has granted this Courtappellate jurisdiction with respect to state litigation only
after the highest state court in which judgment could be hadhas rendered a final judgment or decree. See

ibid. A lit-eral interpretation of the statute would preclude our review

whenever further proceedings remain to be determined in astate court, "no matter how dissociated from the only federal
issue" in the case. Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson,326 U. S. 120, 124 (1945). We have, however, abjured such a
"mechanical" construction of the statute, and accepted juris-diction in certain exceptional "situations in which the highest
court of a State has finally determined the federal issue pres-ent in a particular case, but in which there are further proceedings in the lower state courts to come." Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 477 (1975).1Nike argues that this case fits within the fourth category

of such cases identified in Cox, which covers those cases inwhich "the federal issue has been finally decided in the state
courts with further proceedings pending in which the partyseeking review" might prevail on nonfederal grounds, "reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclu-sive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action,"

1 Notably, we recognized in Cox that in most, if not all, of these exceptional situations, the "additional proceedings anticipated in the lower state
courts . . . would not require the decision of other federal questions that
might also require review by the Court at a later date." 420 U. S., at 477.

Stevens, J., concurring
and "refusal immediately to review the state-court decisionmight seriously erode federal policy."

Id., at 482-483. In
each of the three cases that the Court placed in the fourthcategory in

Cox, the federal issue had not only been finally
decided by the state court, but also would have been finallyresolved by this Court whether the Court agreed or disagreed with the state court's disposition of the issue. Thus,
in Construction Laborers v. Curry, 371 U. S. 542 (1963), thefederal issue was whether the National Labor Relations

Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the controversy; in
Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555
(1963), the federal issue was whether a special federal venue
statute applied to immunize the defendants in a state-court
action; and in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418
U. S. 241 (1974), the federal issue was whether a Florida statute requiring a newspaper to carry a candidate's reply to an
editorial was constitutional. In Cox itself, the federal question was whether the State could prohibit the news media
from publishing the name of a rape victim. In none of those
cases would the resolution of the federal issue have been
affected by further proceedings.

In Nike's view, this case fits within the fourth Cox category because if this Court holds that Nike's speech was noncommercial, then "reversal of the state court on the federal
issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the
relevant cause of action." 420 U. S., at 482-483; see also
Reply Brief for Petitioners 4; Reply to Brief in Opposition
4-5. Notably, Nike's argument assumes that all of the
speech at issue in this case is either commercial or noncommercial and that the speech therefore can be neatly classified
as either absolutely privileged or not.

Theoretically, Nike is correct that we could hold that all
of Nike's allegedly false statements are absolutely privileged
even if made with the sort of "malice" defined in New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), thereby precluding any further proceedings or amendments that might over539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., concurring
come Nike's First Amendment defense. However, given theinterlocutory posture of the case before us today, the Court

could also take a number of other paths that would neitherpreclude further proceedings in the state courts, nor finally
resolve the First Amendment questions in this case. Forexample, if we were to affirm, Nike would almost certainly
continue to maintain that some, if not all, of its challenged
statements were protected by the First Amendment andthat the First Amendment constrains the remedy that may

be imposed. Or, if we were to reverse, we might hold thatthe speech at issue in this case is subject to suit only if made
with actual malice, thereby inviting respondent to amend his
complaint to allege such malice. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43.
Or we might conclude that some of Nike's speech is commercial and some is noncommercial, thereby requiring further
proceedings in the state courts over the legal standards that
govern the commercial speech, including whether actual malice must be proved.

In short, because an opinion on the merits in this case
could take any one of a number of different paths, it is not
clear whether reversal of the California Supreme Court
would "be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant
cause of action [in] the state proceedings still to come."
Cox, 420 U. S., at 482-483. Nor is it clear that reaching the
merits of Nike's claims now would serve the goal of judicial
efficiency. For, even if we were to decide the First Amendment issues presented to us today, more First Amendment
issues might well remain in this case, making piecemeal review of the Federal First Amendment issues likely. See
Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, 621 (1981) (per curiam) (noting
that in most, if not all, of the cases falling within the four
Cox exceptions, there was "no probability of piecemeal review with respect to federal issues"). Accordingly, in my
view, the judgment of the California Supreme Court does
not fall within the fourth Cox exception and cannot be regarded as final.

II
The second reason why, in my view, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear Nike's claims is that neither party has standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. See
Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 154-155 (1990) ("Article III, of course, gives the federal courts jurisdiction over
only `cases and controversies,' and the doctrine of standing
serves to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process"). Without alleging that
he has any personal stake in the outcome of this case, respondent is proceeding as a private attorney general seeking
to enforce two California statutes on behalf of the general
public of the State of California. He has not asserted any
federal claim; even if he had attempted to do so, he could not
invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court because he failed to
allege any injury to himself that is "distinct and palpable."
Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501 (1975). Thus, respondent
does not have Article III standing. For that reason, were
the federal rules of justiciability to apply in state courts, this
suit would have been "dismissed at the outset." ASARCO
Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 617 (1989).2

Even though respondent would not have had standing to
commence suit in federal court based on the allegations in
the complaint, Nike--relying on ASARCO--contends that it
has standing to bring the case to this Court. See Reply
Brief for Petitioners 5. In ASARCO, a group of taxpayers
brought a suit in state court seeking a declaration that the
State's law on mineral leases on state lands was invalid.
After the Arizona Supreme Court "granted plaintiffs a declaratory judgment that the state law governing mineral

Stevens, J., concurring
leases is invalid," 490 U. S., at 611,3 the defendants sought toinvoke the jurisdiction of this Court. In holding that the

defendants had standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the fed-eral courts, we noted that the state proceedings had "resulted in a final judgment altering tangible legal rights," id.,at 619, and we adopted the following rationale:

"When a state court has issued a judgment in a casewhere plaintiffs in the original action had no standing
to sue under the principles governing the federal courts,we may exercise our jurisdiction on certiorari if the
judgment of the state court causes direct, specific, andconcrete injury to the parties who petition for our review, where the requisites of a case or controversy arealso met."

Id., at 623-624.

The rationale supporting our jurisdictional holding inASARCO, however, does not extend to this quite different

case. Unlike ASARCO, in which the state-court proceed-ings ended in a declaratory judgment invalidating a state
law, no "final judgment altering tangible legal rights" hasbeen entered in the instant case.

Id., at 619. Rather, theCalifornia Supreme Court merely held that respondent's

complaint was sufficient to survive Nike's demurrer and toallow the case to go forward. To apply ASARCO to this
case would effect a drastic expansion of ASARCO's reason-ing, extending it to cover an interlocutory ruling that merely
allows a trial to proceed.4 Because I do not believe such a

3 The Arizona Supreme Court also remanded the case for the trial court
to determine what further relief might be appropriate. See id., at 611.
Thus, while leaving open the question of remedy on remand, the statecourt judgment in ASARCO finally decided the federal issue. See id., at
612 (holding that the federal issues had been adjudicated by the state
court and that the remaining issues would not give rise to any further
federal question).

4 Justice Breyer would extend ASARCO--which provides an exception to our normal standing requirement--to encompass not merely
a defendant's challenge to an adverse state-court judgment but also a

Stevens, J., concurring
significant expansion of ASARCO is warranted, my view isthat Nike lacks the requisite Article III standing to invoke

this Court's jurisdiction. III

The third reason why I believe this Court has appropri-ately decided to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted
centers around the importance of the difficult First Amend-ment questions raised in this case. As Justice Brandeis
famously observed, the Court has developed, "for its owngovernance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction,
a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upona large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon
it for decision." Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346(1936) (concurring opinion). The second of those rules is
that the Court will not anticipate a question of constitutionallaw in advance of the necessity of deciding it.

Id., at 346-347. The novelty and importance of the constitutional questions presented in this case provide good reason for adheringto that rule.

This case presents novel First Amendment questions be-cause the speech at issue represents a blending of commercial speech, noncommercial speech and debate on an issue ofpublic importance.

5 See post, at 676-678. On the one hand,

defendant's motion to dismiss a state-court complaint alleging that semicommercial speech was false and misleading. See post, at 668-670 (dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether the "speech-chilling injury" associated with the defense of such a case may or may not outweigh the
benefit of having a public forum in which the defendant may establish the
truth of the contested statements, such an unprecedented expansion would
surely change the character of our standing doctrine, greatly extending
ASARCO's reach.

5 Further complicating the novel First Amendment issues in this case is

the fact that in this Court Nike seeks to challenge the constitutionality of
the private attorney general provisions of California's Unfair Competition
Law and False Advertising Law. It apparently did not raise this specific
challenge below. Whether the scope of protection afforded to Nike's
speech should differ depending on whether the speech is challenged in a

539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
664 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Stevens, J., concurring
if the allegations of the complaint are true, direct communi-cations with customers and potential customers that were

intended to generate sales--and possibly to maintain or en-hance the market value of Nike's stock--contained significant factual misstatements. The regulatory interest in pro-tecting market participants from being misled by such
misstatements is of the highest order. That is why we havebroadly (perhaps overbroadly) stated that "there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact." Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974). On the other hand,the communications were part of an ongoing discussion and

debate about important public issues that was concerned notonly with Nike's labor practices, but with similar practices
used by other multinational corporations. See Brief forAmerican Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations as Amicus Curiae 2. Knowledgeable personsshould be free to participate in such debate without fear of
unfair reprisal. The interest in protecting such participantsfrom the chilling effect of the prospect of expensive litigation
is therefore also a matter of great importance. See, e. g.,Brief for ExxonMobil et al. as

Amici Curiae 2; Brief forPfizer Inc. as Amicus Curiae 11-12. That is why we have

provided such broad protection for misstatements about pub-lic figures that are not animated by malice. See New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964).Whether similar protection should extend to cover corporate misstatements made about the corporation itself, orwhether we should presume that such a corporate speaker
knows where the truth lies, are questions that may have tobe decided in this litigation. The correct answer to such
questions, however, is more likely to result from the studyof a full factual record than from a review of mere unproven
allegations in a pleading. Indeed, the development of such
public or a private enforcement action, see post, at 678, is a difficult and
important question that I believe would benefit from further development below.

a record may actually contribute in a positive way to thepublic debate. In all events, I am firmly convinced that the

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
I dissent from the order dismissing the writ of certiorarias improvidently granted.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
dissenting.

During the 1990's, human rights and labor groups, newspaper editorial writers, and others severely criticized the Nikecorporation for its alleged involvement in disreputable labor

practices abroad. See Lodging of Petitioners 7-8, 96-118,127-162, 232-235, 272-273. This case focuses upon whether,
and to what extent, the First Amendment protects certain
efforts by Nike to respond--efforts that took the form of
written communications in which Nike explained or denied
many of the charges made.

The case arises under provisions of California law that authorize a private individual, acting as a "private attorney
general," effectively to prosecute a business for unfair competition or false advertising. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann.

$$ 17200, 17204, 17500, 17535 (West 1997). The respondent,
Marc Kasky, has claimed that Nike made false or misleading
commercial statements. And he bases this claim upon statements that Nike made in nine specific documents, including
press releases and letters to the editor of a newspaper, to
institutional customers, and to representatives of nongovernmental organizations. Brief for Respondent 5.

The California Court of Appeal affirmed dismissal of
Kasky's complaint without leave to amend on the ground that

539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
666 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Breyer, J., dissenting
"the record discloses noncommercial speech, addressed to atopic of public interest and responding to public criticism of

Nike's labor practices." App. to Pet. for Cert. 78a. TheCourt of Appeal added that it saw "no merit to [Kasky's]
scattershot argument that he might still be able to state acause of action on some theory allowing content-related
abridgement of noncommercial speech." Id., at 79a.

Kasky appealed to the California Supreme Court. He fo-cused on the commercial nature of the communications at

issue, while pointing to language in this Court's cases statingthat the First Amendment, while offering protection to
truthful commercial speech, does not protect false or misleading commercial speech, see Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 563
(1980). Kasky did not challenge the lower courts' denial of
leave to amend his complaint. He also conceded that, if
Nike's statements fell outside the category of "commercial
speech," the First Amendment protected them and "the ultimate issue is resolved in Nike's favor." Appellant's Brief on
the Merits in No. S087859 (Cal.), p. 1; accord, Appellant's
Reply Brief in No. S087859 (Cal.), pp. 1-2.

The California Supreme Court held that the speech at
issue falls within the category of "commercial speech."
Consequently, the California Supreme Court concluded, the
First Amendment does not protect Nike's statements insofar
as they were false or misleading--regardless of whatever
role they played in a public debate. 27 Cal. 4th 939, 946,
969, 45 P. 3d 243, 247, 262 (2002). Hence, according to the
California Supreme Court, the First Amendment does not
bar Kasky's lawsuit--a lawsuit that alleges false advertising
and related unfair competition (which, for ease of exposition,
I shall henceforth use the words "false advertising" to describe). The basic issue presented here is whether the California Supreme Court's ultimate holding is legally correct.
Does the First Amendment permit Kasky's false advertising
"prosecution" to go forward?

Breyer, J., dissenting
After receiving 34 briefs on the merits (including 31 ami-cus briefs) and hearing oral argument, the Court dismisses

the writ of certiorari, thereby refusing to decide the ques-tions presented, at least for now. In my view, however, the
questions presented directly concern the freedom of Ameri-cans to speak about public matters in public debate, no jurisdictional rule prevents us from deciding those questions now,and delay itself may inhibit the exercise of constitutionally
protected rights of free speech without making the issue sig-nificantly easier to decide later on. Under similar circumstances, the Court has found that failure to review an inter-locutory order entails "an inexcusable delay of the benefits
[of appeal] Congress intended to grant." Mills v. Alabama,384 U. S. 214, 217 (1966). I believe delay would be similarly
wrong here. I would decide the questions presented, as weinitially intended.

I
Article III's "case or controversy" requirement does notbar us from hearing this case. Article III requires a litigant

to have "standing"--i. e., to show that he has suffered"injury in fact," that the injury is "fairly traceable" to actions of the opposing party, and that a favorable decision willlikely redress the harm. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154,
162 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Kasky, thestate-court plaintiff in this case, might indeed have had trouble meeting those requirements, for Kasky's complaint spe-cifically states that Nike's statements did not harm Kasky
personally. Lodging of Petitioners 4-5 (|| 8). But Nike, thestate-court defendant--not Kasky, the plaintiff--has brought
the case to this Court. And Nike has standing to complainhere of Kasky's actions.

These actions threaten Nike with "injury in fact." As a"private attorney general," Kasky is in effect enforcing a
state law that threatens to discourage Nike's speech. SeeCal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. $$ 17204, 17535 (West 1997).
This Court has often found that the enforcement of such a

668 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Breyer, J., dissenting
law works constitutional injury even if enforcement proceedings are not complete--indeed, even if enforcement is no
more than a future threat. See, e. g., Houston v. Hill, 482
U. S. 451, 459, n. 7 (1987) (standing where there is " `a genuine threat of enforcement' " against future speech); Steffel v.
Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459 (1974) (same). Cf. First Nat.
Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 785, n. 21 (1978)
(The "burden and expense of litigating [an] issue" itself can
"unduly impinge on the exercise of the constitutional right");
Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U. S. 29, 52-53 (1971)
(plurality opinion) ("The very possibility of having to engage
in litigation, an expensive and protracted process, is threat
enough"). And a threat of a civil action, like the threat of a
criminal action, can chill speech. See New York Times Co.
v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 278 (1964) ("Plainly the Alabama
law of civil libel is `a form of regulation that creates hazards
to protected freedoms markedly greater than those that attend reliance upon the criminal law' ").

Here, of course, an action to enforce California's laws--
laws that discourage certain kinds of speech--amounts to
more than just a genuine, future threat. It is a present reality--one that discourages Nike from engaging in speech. It
thereby creates "injury in fact." Supra, at 667. Further,
that injury is directly "traceable" to Kasky's pursuit of this
lawsuit. And this Court's decision, if favorable to Nike, can
"redress" that injury. Ibid.

Since Nike, not Kasky, now seeks to bring this case to
federal court, why should Kasky's standing problems make a
critical difference? In ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.
605, 618 (1989), this Court specified that a defendant with
standing may complain of an adverse state-court judgment,
even if the other party--the party who brought the suit in
state court and obtained that judgment--would have lacked
standing to bring a case in federal court. See also Virginia
v. Hicks, ante, at 120-121.

Breyer, J., dissenting
In ASARCO, state taxpayers (who ordinarily lack federal
"standing") sued a state agency in state court, seeking a
judgment declaring that the State's mineral leasing procedures violated federal law. See 490 U. S., at 610. ASARCO
and other mineral leaseholders intervened as defendants.
Ibid. The plaintiff taxpayers obtained a state-court judgment declaring that the State's mineral leasing procedures
violated federal law. The defendant mineral leaseholders
asked this Court to review the judgment. And this Court
held that the leaseholders had standing to seek reversal of
that judgment here.

The Court wrote:

"When a state court has issued a judgment in a case
where plaintiffs in the original action had no standing
to sue under the principles governing the federal courts,
we may exercise our jurisdiction on certiorari [1] if

the judgment of the state court causes direct, specific,
and concrete injury to the parties who petition for our
review, where [2] the requisites of a case or controversy
are also met." Id., at 623-624 (bracketed numbers
added).

No one denies that "requisites of a case or controversy" other
than standing are met here. But is there "direct, specific,
and concrete injury"?

In ASARCO itself, such "injury" consisted of the threat,
arising out of the state court's determination, that the defendants' leases might later be canceled (if, say, a third party
challenged those leases in later proceedings and showed they
were not "made for `true value' "). Id., at 611-612, 618.
Here that "injury" consists of the threat, arising out of the
state court's determination, that defendant Nike's speech on
public matters might be "chilled" immediately and legally
restrained in the future. See supra, at 668. Where is the
meaningful difference?

670 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Breyer, J., dissenting
I concede that the state-court determination in ASARCO
was more "final" in the sense that it unambiguously ordered
a declaratory judgment, see 490 U. S., at 611-612 (finding
that two exceptions to normal finality requirements applied),
while the state-court determination here, where such declaratory relief was not sought, takes the form of a more intrinsically interlocutory holding, see ante, at 662, and n. 4 (Stevens, J., concurring). But with respect to "standing," what
possible difference could that circumstance make? The
state court in ASARCO finally resolved federal questions
related to state leasehold procedures; the state court here
finally resolved the basic free speech issue--deciding that
Nike's statements constituted "commercial speech" which,
when "false or misleading," the government "may entirely
prohibit," 27 Cal. 4th, at 946, 45 P. 3d, at 247. After answering the basic threshold question, the state court in ASARCO
left other, more specific questions for resolution in further
potential or pending proceedings, 490 U. S., at 611-612. The
state court here did the same.

In ASARCO, the relevant further proceedings might have
taken place in a new lawsuit; here they would have taken
place in the same lawsuit. But that difference has little
bearing on the likelihood of injury. Indeed, given the nature
of the speech-chilling injury here and the fact that it is likely
to occur immediately, I should think that constitutional
standing in this case would flow from standing in ASARCO
a fortiori.

No federal statute prevents us from hearing this case.
The relevant statute limits our jurisdiction to "[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State
in which a decision could be had." 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a) (emphasis added). But the California Supreme Court determination before us, while technically an interim decision, is a
"final judgment or decree" for purposes of this statute.

That is because this Court has interpreted the statute'sphrase "final judgment" to refer, in certain circumstances, to

a state court's final determination of a federal issue, even ifthe determination of that issue occurs in the midst of ongoing
litigation. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,477 (1975). In doing so, the Court has said that it thereby
takes a "pragmatic approach," not a "mechanical" approach,to "determining finality."

Id., at 477, 486 (emphasis added).And it has set forth several criteria that determine when an

interim state-court judgment is "final" for purposes of thestatute, thereby permitting our consideration of the federal
matter at issue.The four criteria relevant here are those determining
whether a decision falls within what is known as Cox's"fourth category" or "fourth exception." They consist of
the following:

(1) "the federal issue has been finally decided in thestate courts";

(2) in further pending proceedings, "the party seekingreview here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal
grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the fed-eral issue by this Court";
(3) "reversal of the state court on the federal issuewould be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling thenature and character of, or determining the admissibility
of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come"; and
(4) "a refusal immediately to review the state-court de-cision might seriously erode federal policy."

Id., at482-483.

Each of these four conditions is satisfied in this case.

Viewed from Cox's "pragmatic" perspective, "the federalissue has been finally decided in the state courts."

482, 486. The California Supreme Court considered ninespecific instances of Nike's communications--those upon

which Kasky says he based his legal claims. Brief for Re-spondent 5. These include (1) a letter from Nike's Director
of Sports Marketing to university presidents and athletic di-rectors presenting "facts" about Nike's labor practices; (2) a
30-page illustrated pamphlet about those practices; (3) a
press release (posted on Nike's Web site) commenting onthose practices; (4) a posting on Nike's Web site about its

"code of conduct"; (5) a document on Nike's letterhead shar-ing its "perspective" on the labor controversy; (6) a press
release responding to "[s]weatshop [a]llegations"; (7) a letter
from Nike's Director of Labor Practices to the Chief Executive Officer of YWCA of America, discussing criticisms of
its labor practices; (8) a letter from Nike's European public
relations manager to a representative of International Restructuring Education Network Europe, discussing Nike's
practices; and (9) a letter to the editor of The New York
Times taking issue with a columnist's criticisms of Nike's
practices. Ibid.; see also Lodging of Petitioners 121-125,
182-191, 198-230, 270, 285, 322-324. The California Supreme Court then held that all this speech was "commercial
speech" and consequently the "governmen[t] may entirely
prohibit" that speech if it is "false or misleading." 27 Cal.
4th, at 946, 45 P. 3d, at 247.

The California Supreme Court thus "finally decided" the
federal issue--whether the First Amendment protects the
speech in question from legal attack on the ground that it is
"false or misleading." According to the California Supreme
Court, nothing at all remains to be decided with respect to
that federal question. If we permit the California Supreme
Court's decision to stand, in all likelihood this litigation will
now simply seek to determine whether Nike's statements
were false or misleading, and perhaps whether Nike was
negligent in making those statements--matters involving
questions of California law.

I concede that some other, possibly related federal consti-tutional issue

might arise upon remand for trial. But some
such likelihood is always present in ongoing litigation, partic-ularly where, as in past First Amendment cases, this Court

reviews interim state-court decisions regarding, for example,requests for a temporary injunction or a stay pending appeal,
or (as here) denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint. E. g.,
National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43(1977)

(per curiam) (denial of a stay pending appeal); Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415 (1971)(temporary injunction);

Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214
(1966) (motion to dismiss).

Some such likelihood was present in Cox itself. The Cox
plaintiff, the father of a rape victim, sued a newspaper in
state court, asserting a right to damages under state law,
which forbade publication of a rape victim's name. The trial
court, believing that the statute imposed strict liability on
the newspaper, granted summary judgment in favor of the
victim. See Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 231 Ga. 60, 64,
200 S. E. 2d 127, 131 (1973), rev'd, 420 U. S. 469 (1975). The
State Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part.
That court agreed with the plaintiff that state law provided
a cause of action and that the cause of action was consistent
with the First Amendment. 231 Ga., at 64, 200 S. E. 2d,
at 131. However, the State Supreme Court disagreed about
the standard of liability. Rather than strict liability, the
standard, it suggested, was one of "wilful or negligent disregard for the fact that reasonable men would find the invasion highly offensive." Ibid. And it remanded the case
for trial. The likelihood that further proceedings would
address federal constitutional issues--concerning the relation between, for instance, the nature of the privacy invasion,
the defendants' state of mind, and the First Amendment--
would seem to have been far higher there than in any further
proceedings here. Despite that likelihood, and because the
State Supreme Court held in effect that the First Amend539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
ment did not protect the speech at issue, this Court held thatits determination of that constitutional question was "plainly

final." Cox, 420 U. S., at 485. California's Supreme Courthas made a similar holding, and its determination of the federal issue is similarly "final."

B
The second condition specifies that, in further proceedings,the "party seeking review here"--

i. e., Nike--"might prevailon the merits on nonfederal grounds."

Id., at 482. If Nikeshows at trial that its statements are neither false nor misleading, nor otherwise "unfair" under California law, Cal.Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. $$ 17200, 17500 (West 1997), it
will show that those statements did not constitute unfaircompetition or false advertising under California law--a nonfederal ground. And it will "prevail on the merits on non-federal grounds," Cox, 420 U. S., at 482. The second condition is satisfied. C

The third condition requires that "reversal of the statecourt on the federal issue . . . be preclusive of any further
litigation on the relevant cause of action." Id., at 482-483.Taken literally, this condition is satisfied. An outright reversal of the California Supreme Court would reinstatethe judgment of the California intermediate court, which
affirmed dismissal of the complaint without leave to amend.
Supra, at 665-666. It would forbid Kasky to proceed inso-far as Kasky's state-law claims focus on the nine documents

previously discussed. And Kasky has conceded that hisclaims rest on statements made in those documents. Brief
for Respondent 5.I concede that this Court might not reverse the California
Supreme Court outright. It might take some middleground, neither affirming nor fully reversing, that permits
this litigation to continue. See ante, at 659-660 (Stevens,J., concurring). But why is that possibility relevant? The

Breyer, J., dissenting
third condition specifies that "reversal"--not some other dis-position--will preclude "further litigation."

The significance of this point is made clear by our priorcases. In

Cox, this Court found jurisdiction despite the fact
that it might have chosen a middle First Amendmentground--perhaps, for example, precluding liability (for publication of a rape victim's name) where based on negligence,
but not where based on malice. And such an intermediateground, while producing a judgment that the State Supreme

Court decision was erroneous, would have permitted thelitigation to go forward. Cf. Brief for Appellants in

Cox
Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, O. T. 1973, No. 73-938, p. 68,
n. 127 (arguing that " `summary judgment, rather than trial
on the merits, is a proper vehicle for affording constitutional
protection' "). Similarly in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.
Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974), the Court might have held that
the Constitution permits a State to require a newspaper to
carry a candidate's reply to an editorial--but only in certain
circumstances--thereby potentially leaving a factual issue
whether those circumstances applied. Cf. Brief for Appellant in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, O. T. 1973,
No. 73-797, pp. 26-27, and n. 60 (noting that the State Supreme Court based its decision in part on a conclusion, unsupported by record evidence, that control of mass media
had become substantially concentrated). One can imagine
similar intermediate possibilities in virtually every case in
which the Court has found this condition satisfied, including
those involving technical questions of statutory jurisdiction
and venue, cf. ante, at 659 (Stevens, J., concurring).

Conceivably, one might argue that the third condition is
not satisfied here despite literal compliance, see supra, at
674 and this page, on the ground that, from a pragmatic perspective, outright reversal is not a very realistic possibility.
But that proposition simply is not so. In my view, the probabilities are precisely the contrary, and a true reversal is a
highly realistic possibility.

676 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Breyer, J., dissenting
To understand how I reach this conclusion, the readermust recall the nature of the holding under review. The

California Supreme Court held that certain specific commu-nications, exemplified by the nine documents upon which
Kasky rests his case, fall within that aspect of the Court'scommercial speech doctrine that says the First Amendment
protects only truthful commercial speech; hence, to the extent commercial speech is false or misleading, it is unpro-tected. See

supra, at 666.
The Court, however, has added, in commercial speechcases, that the First Amendment " `embraces at the least the

liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public
concern.' " Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 534 (1980); accord, Central
Hudson, 447 U. S., at 562-563, n. 5. And in other contexts
the Court has held that speech on matters of public concern
needs " `breathing space' "--potentially incorporating certain
false or misleading speech--in order to survive. New York
Times, 376 U. S., at 272; see also, e. g., Gertz v. Robert Welch,
Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974); Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S.
374, 388-389 (1967).

This case requires us to reconcile these potentially conflicting principles. In my view, a proper resolution here
favors application of the last mentioned public-speech principle, rather than the first mentioned commercial-speech
principle. Consequently, I would apply a form of heightened
scrutiny to the speech regulations in question, and I believe
that those regulations cannot survive that scrutiny.

First, the communications at issue are not purely commercial in nature. They are better characterized as involving
a mixture of commercial and noncommercial (public-issueoriented) elements. The document least likely to warrant
protection--a letter written by Nike to university presidents
and athletic directors--has several commercial characteristics. See Appendix, infra (reproducing pages 190 and 191 of
Lodging of Petitioners). As the California Supreme Court

539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
implicitly found, 27 Cal. 4th, at 946, 45 P. 3d, at 247, it waswritten by a "commercial speaker" (Nike), it is addressed

to a "commercial audience" (potential institutional buyers orcontractees), and it makes "representations of fact about the
speaker's own business operations" (labor conditions). Ibid.See,

e. g., Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S.
60, 66-67 (1983).

But that letter also has other critically important and,I believe, predominant noncommercial characteristics with

which the commercial characteristics are "inextricably inter-twined."

Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,
Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796 (1988). For one thing, the letter
appears outside a traditional advertising format, such as a
brief television or newspaper advertisement. It does not
propose the presentation or sale of a product or any other
commercial transaction, United States v. United Foods, Inc.,
533 U. S. 405, 409 (2001) (describing this as the "usua[l]"
definition for commercial speech). Rather, the letter suggests that its contents might provide "information useful in
discussions" with concerned faculty and students. Lodging
of Petitioners 190. On its face, it seeks to convey information to "a diverse audience," including individuals who have
"a general curiosity about, or genuine interest in," the public
controversy surrounding Nike, Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S.
809, 822 (1975).

For another thing, the letter's content makes clear that, in
context, it concerns a matter that is of significant public interest and active controversy, and it describes factual matters related to that subject in detail. In particular, the letter describes Nike's labor practices and responds to criticism
of those practices, and it does so because those practices
themselves play an important role in an existing public debate. This debate was one in which participants advocated,
or opposed, public collective action. See, e. g., Lodging of
Petitioners 143 (article on student protests), 232-236 (fact
sheet with "Boycott Nike" heading). See generally Roth v.

Breyer, J., dissenting
United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957) (The First Amend-ment's protections of speech and press were "fashioned to

assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing aboutof political and social changes"). That the letter is factual
in content does not argue against First Amendment protec-tion, for facts, sometimes facts alone, will sway our views on
issues of public policy.

These circumstances of form and content distinguish thespeech at issue here from the more purely "commercial

speech" described in prior cases. See, e. g., United Foods,
supra, at 409 (commercial speech "usually defined as speech
that does no more than propose a commercial transaction"
(emphasis added)); Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.
v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 473-474 (1989) (describing this as "the
test"); Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 561 (commercial speech
defined as "expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience" (emphasis added)).
The speech here is unlike speech--say, the words "dolphinsafe tuna"--that commonly appears in more traditional advertising or labeling contexts. And it is unlike instances of
speech where a communication's contribution to public debate is peripheral, not central, cf. id., at 562-563, n. 5.

At the same time, the regulatory regime at issue here differs from traditional speech regulation in its use of private
attorneys general authorized to impose "false advertising"
liability even though they themselves have suffered no harm.
See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. $$ 17204, 17535 (West 1997).
In this respect, the regulatory context is unlike most traditional false advertising regulation. And the "false advertising" context differs from other regulatory contexts--say,
securities regulation--where a different balance of concerns
calls for different applications of First Amendment principles. Cf. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447,
456-457 (1978).

These three sets of circumstances taken together--circumstances of format, content, and regulatory context--warrant

539US2 Unit: $U84 [05-03-05 16:45:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

treating the regulations of speech at issue differently fromregulations of purer forms of commercial speech, such as

simple product advertisements, that we have reviewed in thepast. And, where all three are present, I believe the First
Amendment demands heightened scrutiny.Second, I doubt that this particular instance of regulation
(through use of private attorneys general) can survive
heightened scrutiny, for there is no reasonable "fit" betweenthe burden it imposes upon speech and the important governmental " `interest served,' " Fox, supra, at 480. Rather,the burden imposed is disproportionate.

I do not deny that California's system of false advertising
regulation--including its provision for private causes of action--furthers legitimate, traditional, and important public
objectives. It helps to maintain an honest commercial marketplace. It thereby helps that marketplace better allocate
private goods and services. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy
v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
765 (1976). It also helps citizens form "intelligent opinions
as to how [the marketplace] ought to be regulated or altered." Ibid.

But a private "false advertising" action brought on behalf
of the State, by one who has suffered no injury, threatens to
impose a serious burden upon speech--at least if extended
to encompass the type of speech at issue under the standards
of liability that California law provides, see Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code Ann. $$ 17200, 17500 (West 1997) (establishing regimes
of strict liability, as well as liability for negligence); Cortez
v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., 23 Cal. 4th 163,
181, 999 P. 2d 706, 717 (2000) (stating that California's unfair
competition law imposes strict liability). The delegation of
state authority to private individuals authorizes a purely
ideological plaintiff, convinced that his opponent is not telling
the truth, to bring into the courtroom the kind of political
battle better waged in other forums. Where that political
battle is hard fought, such plaintiffs potentially constitute

680 NIKE, INC. v. KASKY

Breyer, J., dissenting
a large and hostile crowd freely able to bring prosecutionsdesigned to vindicate their beliefs, and to do so unencumbered by the legal and practical checks that tend to keep theenergies of public enforcement agencies focused upon more
purely economic harm. Cf. Forsyth County v. Nationalist
Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 134-135 (1992); Bantam Books, Inc.
v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 67-71 (1963).

That threat means a commercial speaker must take partic-ular care--considerably more care than the speaker's noncommercial opponents--when speaking on public matters.A large organization's unqualified claim about the adequacy
of working conditions, for example, could lead to liability,
should a court conclude after hearing the evidence that
enough exceptions exist to warrant qualification--even if
those exceptions were unknown (but perhaps should have
been known) to the speaker. Uncertainty about how a court
will view these, or other, statements, can easily chill a speaker's efforts to engage in public debate--particularly where a
"false advertising" law, like California's law, imposes liability based upon negligence or without fault. See Gertz, 418
U. S., at 340; Time, 385 U. S., at 389. At the least, they create concern that the commercial speaker engaging in public
debate suffers a handicap that noncommercial opponents do
not. See First Nat. Bank, 435 U. S., at 785-786; see also
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.
819, 828 (1995).

At the same time, it is difficult to see why California needs
to permit such actions by private attorneys general--at least
with respect to speech that is not "core" commercial speech
but is entwined with, and directed toward, a more general
public debate. The Federal Government regulates unfair
competition and false advertising in the absence of such
suits. 15 U. S. C. $ 41 et seq. As far as I can tell, California's delegation of the government's enforcement authority
to private individuals is not traditional, and may be unique,
Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. I do not see how "false advertising"

681Cite as: 539 U. S. 654 (2003)
Breyer, J., dissenting
regulation could suffer serious impediment if the Constitution limited the scope of private attorney general actions
to circumstances where more purely commercial and less
public-debate-oriented elements predominate. As the historical treatment of speech in the labor context shows,
substantial government regulation can coexist with First
Amendment protections designed to provide room for public
debate. Compare, e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395
U. S. 575, 616-620 (1969) (upholding prohibition of employer
comments on unionism containing threats or promises), with
Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 531-532 (1945); Thornhill
v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940).

These reasons convince me that it is likely, if not highly
probable, that, if this Court were to reach the merits, it
would hold that heightened scrutiny applies; that, under

the circumstances here, California's delegation of enforcement authority to private attorneys general disproportionately burdens speech; and that the First Amendment consequently forbids it.

Returning to the procedural point at issue, I believe this
discussion of the merits shows that not only will "reversal"
of the California Supreme Court "on the federal issue" prove
"preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of
action," Cox, 420 U. S., at 482-483, but also such "reversal"
is a serious possibility. Whether we take the words of the
third condition literally or consider the circumstances pragmatically, that condition is satisfied.

D
The fourth condition is that "a refusal immediately to review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal
policy." Id., at 483. This condition is met because refusal
immediately to review the state-court decision before us will
"seriously erode" the federal constitutional policy in favor of
free speech.

Breyer, J., dissenting
If permitted to stand, the state court's decision may well
"chill" the exercise of free speech rights. See id., at 486;
Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 56 (1989).
Continuation of this lawsuit itself means increased expense,
and, if Nike loses, the results may include monetary liability
(for "restitution") and injunctive relief (including possible
corrective "counterspeech"). See, e. g., Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., 20 Cal.
4th 163, 179, 973 P. 2d 527, 539 (1999); Consumers Union of
U. S., Inc. v. Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, 4 Cal. App. 4th 963,
971-972, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 193, 197-198 (1992). The range of
communications subject to such liability is broad; in this case,
it includes a letter to the editor of The New York Times.
The upshot is that commercial speakers doing business in
California may hesitate to issue significant communications
relevant to public debate because they fear potential lawsuits
and legal liability. Cf. Gertz, supra, at 340 (warning that
overly stringent liability for false or misleading speech can
"lead to intolerable self-censorship"); Time, supra, at 389
("Fear of large verdicts in damage suits for innocent or
merely negligent misstatement, even fear of the expense involved in their defense, must inevitably cause publishers to
`steer . . . wider of the unlawful zone' ").

This concern is not purely theoretical. Nike says without
contradiction that because of this lawsuit it has decided "to
restrict severely all of its communications on social issues
that could reach California consumers, including speech in
national and international media." Brief for Petitioners 39.
It adds that it has not released its annual Corporate Responsibility Report, has decided not to pursue a listing in the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and has refused "dozens of
invitations . . . to speak on corporate responsibility issues."
Ibid. Numerous amici--including some who do not believe
that Nike has fully and accurately explained its labor practices--argue that California's decision will "chill" speech and

thereby limit the supply of relevant information available to
those, such as journalists, who seek to keep the public informed about important public issues. Brief for American
Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae 2-3; Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as Amicus Curiae
10-12; Brief for ABC Inc. et al. as Amici Curiae 6-13; Brief
for Pfizer Inc. as Amicus Curiae 10-14.

In sum, all four conditions are satisfied here. See supra,
at 671. Hence, the California Supreme Court's judgment
falls within the scope of the term "final" as it appears in 28
U. S. C. $ 1257(a), and no statute prevents us from deciding
this case.

III

There is no strong prudential argument against deciding
the questions presented. Compare ante, at 663-664 (Stevens, J., concurring), with Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,
346-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). These constitutional questions are not easy ones, for they implicate both
free speech and important forms of public regulation. But
they arrive at the threshold of this case, asking whether the
Constitution permits this private attorney general's lawsuit
to go forward on the basis of the pleadings at hand. This
threshold issue was vigorously contested and decided, adverse to Nike, below. Cf. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519,
534-535 (1992). And further development of the record
seems unlikely to make the questions presented any easier
to decide later.

At the same time, waiting extracts a heavy First Amendment price. If this suit goes forward, both Nike and other
potential speakers, out of reasonable caution or even an excess of caution, may censor their own expression well beyond
what the law may constitutionally demand. See Time, 385
U. S., at 389; Gertz, 418 U. S., at 340. That is what a "chilling effect" means. It is present here.

Breyer, J., dissenting

IV
In sum, I can find no good reason for postponing a decisionin this case. And given the importance of the First Amendment concerns at stake, there are strong reasons not to doso. The position of at least one

amicus--opposed to Nikeon the merits of its labor practice claims but supporting Nike

on its free speech claim--echoes a famous sentiment re-flected in the writings of Voltaire: `I do not agree with what
you say, but I will fight to the end so that you may say it.'See Brief for American Federation of Labor and Congress of
Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae 3. A case thatimplicates that principle is a case that we should decide.

I would not dismiss as improvidently granted the writissued in this case. I respectfully dissent from the Court's
contrary determination.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS

PRATO v. VALLAS et al.
on application for extension of time

No. 02A1042 (02-9753). Decided June 9, 2003
Petitioner's request for an extension of time to file a certiorari petition

following this Court's May 19, 2003, order denying her leave to proceed
in forma pauperis is denied because there are no grounds upon which
this Court would grant certiorari.

Justice Stevens, Circuit Justice.
Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and amotion for leave to proceed

in forma pauperis in this Courton December 20, 2002. On May 19, 2003, over my unpublished dissent, the Court issued an order denying petitionerleave to proceed

in forma pauperis and giving petitioneruntil June 9, 2003, to pay the docketing fee required by Rule

38(a) and to submit a petition in compliance with Rule 33.1of the Rules of this Court. Petitioner now seeks an extension of time within which to comply with the May 19 order,explaining that she needs additional time to raise money to
pay the docketing fee and printing costs. Having reviewedpetitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari, I am satisfied
that there are no grounds upon which this Court would grantcertiorari, and I therefore deny petitioner's request for an
extension of time.

1. Class arbitration.--South Carolina Supreme Court's judgment--that
parties' contracts, which are governed by Federal Arbitration Act and
South Carolina law, permit class arbitration--is vacated and case is remanded. Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, p. 444.

2. Federal Arbitration Act--Debt-restructuring agreement.--There is
a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to enforce, under FAA, an
arbitration provision included in parties' debt-restructuring agreement.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Commerce Clause.

Discrimination against out-of-state businesses--State milk regulations.--Section 144 of Federal Agriculture and Reform Act of 1996 does
not exempt California's milk pricing and pooling regulations from Commerce Clause scrutiny. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, p. 59.

II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Prison visitation--State regulations.--Michigan regulation barring
visitation for prison inmates with two substance-abuse violations is not
a cruel and unusual confinement condition violating Eighth Amendment.
Overton v. Bazzetta, p. 126.

III. Due Process.

1. Liberty interest--Right to reject medical treatment--Forced medication.--Eighth Circuit erred in approving forced medication solely to render Sell competent to stand trial. Sell v. United States, p. 166.

2. State criminal law--Consensual sexual conduct between same sex
couple.--Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of same sex to
engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Lawrence v. Texas, p. 558.

IV. Equal Protection of the Laws.

1. Law school admissions policy--Racial preferences.--University of
Michigan Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining educational benefits
that flow from a diverse student body is not prohibited by Equal Protection Clause, Title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964, or 42 U. S. C. $ 1981.
Grutter v. Bollinger, p. 306.

2. State taxes slot machines--Differential rate for river boat and racetrack machines.--Iowa's differential tax rate for river boat and racetrack
slot machine adjusted revenues does not violate Equal Protection Clause.
Fitzgerald v. Racing Assn. of Central Iowa, p. 103.

3. University's freshman admissions policy--Racial preferences.--Because University of Michigan's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve its asserted interest in
diversity, policy violates Equal Protection Clause, Title VI of Civil Rights
Act of 1964, and 42 U. S. C. $ 1981. Gratz v. Bollinger, p. 244.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
V. Ex Post Facto Laws.

New statute of limitations--Sex-related child abuse.--California law
providing a new criminal statute of limitations governing sex-related child
abuse crimes, which was enacted after expiration of previously applicable limitations period, violates Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied
to revive a previously time-barred prosecution. Stogner v. California,
p. 607.

VI. Freedom of Association.

Prison visitation--State regulations.--Michigan regulations that restrict visits with prison inmates bear a rational relation to legitimate
penological interests sufficient to sustain them regardless of whether respondent prisoners have a constitutional right of association that survives
incarceration. Overton v. Bazzetta, p. 126.

VII. Freedom of Speech.

1. Nonprofit advocacy corporations--Campaign contributions.--A
federal law that bars corporations from contributing directly to candidates
for federal office is consistent with First Amendment when applied to nonprofit advocacy corporations. Federal Election Comm'n v. Beaumont,
p. 146.

2. Overbreadth doctrine--Low-income housing--Trespass policy.--
Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority's trespass policy at

a low-income housing development is not facially invalid under First
Amendment's overbreadth doctrine. Virginia v. Hicks, p. 113.

VIII. Privileges and Immunities.

Disparate treatment of out-of-state businesses--State milk regulations.--Absence of an express statement in California laws and regulations identifying out-of-state residency as a basis for disparate treatment
in State's milk pricing and pooling regulations is not a sufficient basis for
rejecting petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims. Hillside
Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, p. 59.

IX. Right to Counsel.

Effective assistance of counsel--Sentencing hearing.--Performance of
trial counsel at sentencing violated Wiggins' Sixth Amendment right to
effective assistance of counsel. Wiggins v. Smith, p. 510.

X. Spending Clause.

Children's Internet Protection Act--Filtering software--Assistance to
public libraries.--District Court's judgment--that Act's filtering software
provisions exceed Congress' Spending Clause authority because any public
library complying with those provisions will necessarily violate First
