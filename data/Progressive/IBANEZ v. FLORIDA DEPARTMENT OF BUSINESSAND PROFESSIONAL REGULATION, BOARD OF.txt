Petitioner Silvia Safille Ibanez, a member of the FloridaBar since 1983, practices law in Winter Haven, Florida. Sheis also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), licensed by respondent Florida Board of Accountancy (Board) 1 to "practicepublic accounting." In addition, she is authorized by theCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards, a privateorganization, to use the trademarked designation "CertifiedFinancial Planner" (CFP).Ibanez referred to these credentials in her advertising andother communication with the public. She placed CPA andCFP next to her name in her yellow pages listing (under"Attorneys") and on her business card. She also used thosedesignations at the left side of her "Law Offices" stationery.Notwithstanding the apparently truthful nature of her communication--it is undisputed that neither her CPA licensenor her CFP certification has been revoked--the Board reprimanded her for engaging in "false, deceptive, and misleading" advertising. Final Order of the Board of Accountancy(May 12, 1992) (hereinafter Final Order), App. 178, 194.The record reveals that the Board has not shouldered theburden it must carry in matters of this order.

S. 136 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdemonstrated with sufficient specificity that any member ofthe public could have been misled by Ibanez' constitutionallyprotected speech or that any harm could have resulted fromallowing that speech to reach the public's eyes. We therefore hold that the Board's decision censuring Ibanez is incom-patible with First Amendment restraints on official action.IUnder Florida's Public Accountancy Act, only licensedCPA's may "[a]ttest as an expert in accountancy to the reliability or fairness of presentation of financial information,"Fla. Stat. $ 473.322(1)(c) (1991),2 or use the title "CPA" orother title "tending to indicate that such person holds anactive license" under Florida law. $ 473.322(1)(b). Furthermore, only licensed CPA's may "[p]ractice public accounting."$ 473.322(1)(a). "Practicing public accounting" is defined asan "offe[r] to perform . . . one or more types of services in-volving the use of accounting skills, or . . . management advisory or consulting services," Fla. Stat. $ 473.302(5) (Supp.1992), made by one who either is, $ 473.302(5)(a), or "hold[s]himself . . . out as," $ 473.302(5)(b) (emphasis added), a certi-fied public accountant.3The Board learned of Ibanez' use of the designations CPAand CFP when a copy of Ibanez' yellow pages listing wasmailed, anonymously, to the Board's offices; it thereuponcommenced an investigation and, subsequently, issued acomplaint against her. The Board charged Ibanez with (1)2 This "attest" function is more commonly referred to as "auditing."3 Florida's Public Accountancy Act is known as a "Title Act" because,with the exception of the "attest" function, activities performed by CPA'scan lawfully be performed by non-CPA's. See Brief for Respondent 11-12. The Act contains additional restrictions on the conduct of licensedCPA's. For example, a partnership or corporation cannot "practice publicaccounting" unless all partners or shareholders are CPA's, Fla. Stat.$ 473.309 (1991), nor may licensees "engaged in the practice of public accounting" pay or accept referral fees, $ 473.3205, or accept contingencyfees, $ 473.319.512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT140 IBANEZ v.

The hearing officer subsequently found in Ibanez' favor on all counts, and recommended to the Board that,4 Florida Stat. $ 473.3101 (Supp. 1994) requires that "[e]ach partnership,corporation, or limited liability company seeking to engage in the practiceof public accounting" apply for a license from the Board, and $ 473.309requires that each such partnership or corporation hold a current license.5 Rule 24.001(1) states, in pertinent part, that "[n]o licensee shall disseminate . . . any . . . advertising which is in any way fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading, if it . . .

The CFP Board ofStandards, the "recognizing agency" in regard to Ibanez' CFP designation,has not been approved by the Board.6 Ibanez pointed out that she does not perform the "attest" function inher law practice, and that no service she performs requires a CPA license.See supra, at 139, n. 3.512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT141Cite as: 512 U.

Recommended Order (filed Jan. 15, 1992),App. 147.The Board rejected the hearing officer's recommendation,and declared Ibanez guilty of "false, deceptive and misleading" advertising. Final Order, id., at 194. The Board rea-soned, first, that Ibanez was "practicing public accounting"by virtue of her use of the CPA designation and was thussubject to the Board's disciplinary jurisdiction.Id., at 183.Because Ibanez had insisted that her law practice was out-side the Board's regulatory jurisdiction, she had, in theBoard's judgment, rendered her use of the CPA designationmisleading:"[Ibanez] advertises the fact that she is a CPA, whileperforming the same `accounting' activities she performed when she worked for licensed CPA firms, butshe does not concede that she is engaged in the practiceof public accounting so as to bring herself within thejurisdiction of the Board of Accountancy for any negli-gence or errors [of which] she may be guilty when delivering her services to her clients."[Ibanez] is unwilling to acquiesce in the requirementsof [the Public Accountancy Act] and [the Board's rules]by complying with those requirements. She does notlicense her firm as a CPA firm; forego certain forms ofremuneration denied to individuals who are practicingpublic accountancy; or limit the ownership of her firm toother CPAs. . . . [She] has, in effect, told the public thatshe is subject to the provisions of [the Public Accountancy Act] and the jurisdiction of the Board of Accountancy when she believes and acts as though she is not."Id., at 184-185.Next, the Board addressed Ibanez' use of the CFP designation. On that matter, the Board stated that any designation using the term "certified" to refer to a certifying orga512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT142 IBANEZ v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION, BD. OF ACCOUNTANCYOpinion of the Courtnization other than the Board itself (or an organizationapproved by the Board) "inherently mislead[s] the public intobelieving that state approval and recognition exists."

S. 1067 (1994), and now reverse.IIAThe Board correctly acknowledged that Ibanez' use ofthe CPA and CFP designations was "commercial speech."Final Order, App. 186. Because "disclosure of truthful, rel-evant information is more likely to make a positive contribution to decisionmaking than is concealment of such infor-mation," Peel v. Attorney Registration and DisciplinaryComm'n of Ill., 496 U. S. 91, 108 (1990), only false, deceptive,or misleading commercial speech may be banned.Zaudererv. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,471 U. S. 626, 638 (1985), citing Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U. S.1 (1979); see also In re R. M. J., 455 U.

S., at 203 (Statecan regulate commercial speech if it shows that it has "asubstantial interest" and that the interference with speechis "in proportion to the interest served").The State's burden is not slight; the "free flow of commer-cial information is valuable enough to justify imposing onwould-be regulators the costs of distinguishing the truthfulfrom the false, the helpful from the misleading, and theharmless from the harmful." Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 646."[M]ere speculation or conjecture" will not suffice; rather theState "must demonstrate that the harms it recites are realand that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree." Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770, 771; see alsoZauderer, 471 U. S., at 648-649 (State's "unsupported asser-tions" insufficient to justify prohibition on attorney advertising; "broad prophylactic rules may not be so lightly justifiedif the protections afforded commercial speech are to retaintheir force"). Measured against these standards, the orderreprimanding Ibanez cannot stand.BWe turn first to Ibanez' use of the CPA designation in hercommercial communications. On that matter, the Board'sposition is entirely insubstantial. To reiterate, Ibanez holdsa currently active CPA license which the Board has neversought to revoke. The Board asserts that her truthful com-munication is nonetheless misleading because it "[tells] thepublic that she is subject to the provisions of [the Accoun-tancy Act] and the jurisdiction of the Board of Accountancywhen she believes and acts as though she is not." FinalOrder, App. 185; see also Brief for Respondent 20 ("[T]he use512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT144 IBANEZ v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION, BD. OF ACCOUNTANCYOpinion of the Courtof the CPA designation . . . where the licensee is unwillingto comply with the provisions of the [statute] under whichthe license was granted, is inherently misleading and maybe prohibited.").Ibanez no longer contests the Board's assertion of jurisdic-tion, see Brief for Petitioner 28 (Ibanez "is, in fact, a licenseesubject to the rules of the Board"), and in any event, whatshe "believes" regarding the reach of the Board's authorityis not sanctionable. See Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., 401U. S. 1, 6 (1971) (First Amendment "prohibits a State fromexcluding a person from a profession or punishing him solelybecause . . . he holds certain beliefs"). Nor can the Boardrest on a bare assertion that Ibanez is "unwilling to comply"with its regulation. To survive constitutional review, theBoard must build its case on specific evidence of noncompli-ance. Ibanez has neither been charged with, nor foundguilty of, any professional activity or practice out of compli-ance with the governing statutory or regulatory standards.8And as long as Ibanez holds an active CPA license from theBoard we cannot imagine how consumers can be misled byher truthful representation to that effect.CThe Board's justifications for disciplining Ibanez for usingthe CFP designation are scarcely more persuasive. TheBoard concluded that the words used in the designation--particularly, the word "certified"--so closely resemble "theterms protected by state licensure itself, that their use, whennot approved by the Board, inherently mislead[s] the publicinto believing that state approval and recognition exists."Final Order, App. 193-194. This conclusion is difficult tomaintain in light of Peel. We held in Peel that an attorney'suse of the designation "Certified Civil Trial Specialist By the8 Notably, the Board itself withdrew the only charge against Ibanez ofthis kind, viz., the allegation that she practiced public accounting in anunlicensed firm. See supra, at 140.512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT145Cite as: 512 U. S. 136 (1994)Opinion of the CourtNational Board of Trial Advocacy" was neither actually norinherently misleading. See 496 U. S., at 106 (rejecting contention that use of National Board of Trial Advocacy certifi-cation on attorney's letterhead was "actually misleading");id., at 110 ("State may not . . . completely ban statementsthat are not actually or inherently misleading, such as certification as a specialist by bona fide organizations such asNBTA");id., at 111 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J., con-curring in judgment) (agreeing that attorney's letterheadwas "neither actually nor inherently misleading"). TheBoard offers nothing to support a different conclusion withrespect to the CFP designation.9 Given "the complete ab-sence of any evidence of deception," id., at 106, the Board's"concern about the possibility of deception in hypotheticalcases is not sufficient to rebut the constitutional presumptionfavoring disclosure over concealment," id., at 111.109 Justice O'Connor writes that "[t]he average consumer has no way toverify the accuracy or value of [Ibanez'] use of the CFP designation" because her advertising, "[u]nlike the advertisement in Peel, . . . did notidentify the organization that had conferred the certification." Post, at150. We do not agree that the consumer of financial planning services isthus disarmed.To verify Ibanez' CFP credential, a consumer could call the CFP Boardof Standards. The Board that reprimanded Ibanez never suggested thatsuch a call would be significantly more difficult to make than one to thecertifying organization in Peel, the National Board of Trial Advocacy. Wenote in this regard that the attorney's letterhead in Peel supplied no address or telephone number for the certifying agency. Most instructive onthis matter, we think, is the requirement of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Florida Bar, to which attorney Ibanez is subject, that sheprovide "written information setting forth the factual details of [her] experience, expertise, background, and training" to anyone who so inquires.See Florida Bar, Rule of Professional Conduct 4-7.3(a)(2).10 The Board called only three witnesses at the proceeding against Ibanez, all of whom were employees or former employees of the Departmentof Professional Regulation. Neither the witnesses, nor the Board in itssubmissions to this Court, offered evidence that any member of the publichas been misled by the use of the CFP designation. See Peel, 496 U. S.,at 100-101 (noting that there was "no contention that any potential client512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT146 IBANEZ v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION, BD. OF ACCOUNTANCYOpinion of the CourtThe Board alternatively contends that Ibanez' use of theCFP designation is "potentially misleading," entitling theBoard to "enact measures short of a total ban to preventdeception or confusion." Brief for Respondent 33, citingPeel, 496 U. S., at 116 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J.,concurring in judgment). If the "protections afforded commercial speech are to retain their force," Zauderer, 471 U. S.,at 648-649, we cannot allow rote invocation of the words "potentially misleading" to supplant the Board's burden to"demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that itsrestriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree."Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771.The Board points to Rule 24.001(1)( j), Fla. Admin. Code$ 61H1-24.001(1)( j) (1994), which prohibits use of any "specialist" designation unless accompanied by a disclaimer,made "in the immediate proximity of the statement that implies formal recognition as a specialist"; the disclaimer must"stat[e] that the recognizing agency is not affiliated with orsanctioned by the state or federal government," and it mustset out the recognizing agency's "requirements for recognition, including, but not limited to, educatio[n], experience[,]and testing." See Brief for Respondent 33-35. Given thestate of this record--the failure of the Board to point to anyharm that is potentially real, not purely hypothetical--weare satisfied that the Board's action is unjustified. We express no opinion whether, in other situations or on a differentrecord, the Board's insistence on a disclaimer might serve asan appropriately tailored check against deception or confusion, rather than one imposing "unduly burdensome disclosure requirements [that] offend the First Amendment."Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 651. This much is plain, however:The detail required in the disclaimer currently described bythe Board effectively rules out notation of the "specialist"or person was actually misled or deceived," nor "any factual finding ofactual deception or misunderstanding").512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT147Cite as: 512 U. S. 136 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdesignation on a business card or letterhead, or in a yellowpages listing.11The concurring Justices, on whom the Board relies, didindeed find the "[NBTA] Certified Civil Trial Specialist"statement on a lawyer's letterhead "potentially misleading,"but they stated no categorical rule applicable to all specialtydesignations. Thus, they recognized that "[t]he potential formisunderstanding might be less if the NBTA were a commonly recognized organization and the public had a generalunderstanding of its requirements." Peel, 496 U. S., at 115.In this regard, we stress again the failure of the Board toback up its alleged concern that the designation CFP wouldmislead rather than inform.The Board never adverted to the prospect that the publicpotentially in need of a civil trial specialist, see Peel, supra,is wider, and perhaps less sophisticated, than the public withfinancial resources warranting the services of a planner.Noteworthy in this connection, "Certified Financial Planner"and "CFP" are well-established, protected federal trademarks that have been described as "the most recognizeddesignation[s] in the planning field."

Approxi11 Under the Board's regulations, moreover, it appears that even a disclaimer of the kind described would not have saved Ibanez from censure.Rule 24.001(i) flatly bans "[s]tat[ing] a form of recognition by any entityother than the Board that uses the ter[m] `certified.' " Separate and distinct from that absolute prohibition, the regulations further proscribe"[s]tat[ing] or impl[ying] that the licensee has received formal recognitionas a specialist in any aspect of the practice of public accounting, unless thestatement contains" a copiously detailed disclaimer.

See supra, at 139, n. 3. It is therefore significant that her use of the designation CFP is considered inall respects appropriate by the Florida Bar. See Brief forFlorida Bar as Amicus Curiae 9-10 (noting that Florida Bar,Rules of Professional Conduct, and particularly Rule 4-7.3,"specifically allo[w] Ibanez to disclose her CPA and CFP credentials [and] contemplate that Ibanez must provide thisinformation to prospective clients (if relevant)").Beyond question, this case does not fall within the caveatnoted in Peel covering certifications issued by organizationsthat "had made no inquiry into petitioner's fitness," or had"issued certificates indiscriminately for a price"; statementsmade in such certifications, "even if true, could be misleading." 496 U. S., at 102. We have never sustained restrictions on constitutionally protected speech based on a recordso bare as the one on which the Board relies here. SeeEdenfield, 507 U.
