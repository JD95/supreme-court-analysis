This case concerns the authority of federal district courtsto assist in the production of evidence for use in a foreign orinternational tribunal. In the matter before us, respondentAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with theDirectorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) ofthe Commission of the European Communities (EuropeanCommission or Commission). In pursuit of that complaint,AMD applied to the United States District Court for theNorthern District of California, invoking 28 U. S. C.$ 1782(a), for an order requiring Intel to produce potentiallyrelevant documents. Section 1782(a) provides that a federaldistrict court "may order" a person "resid[ing]" or "found"in the district to give testimony or produce documents "foruse in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal . . .upon the application of any interested person."Concluding that $ 1782(a) did not authorize the requesteddiscovery, the District Court denied AMD's application.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed thatdetermination and remanded the case, instructing the District Court to rule on the merits of AMD's application. Inaccord with the Court of Appeals, we hold that the DistrictCourt had authority under $ 1782(a) to entertain AMD's dis-covery request. The statute, we rule, does not categoricallybar the assistance AMD seeks: (1) A complainant before theEuropean Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an "interested person" within $ 1782(a)'s compass; (2) the Commis-sion is a $ 1782(a) "tribunal" when it acts as a first-instance*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Chamber ofCommerce of the United States by Roy T.

We caution, however,that $ 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, a federal dis-trict court to provide judicial assistance to foreign or international tribunals or to "interested person[s]" in proceedingsabroad. Whether such assistance is appropriate in this caseis a question yet unresolved. To guide the District Courton remand, we suggest considerations relevant to the disposition of that question. IASection 1782 is the product of congressional efforts, overthe span of nearly 150 years, to provide federal-court assistance in gathering evidence for use in foreign tribunals.Congress first provided for federal-court aid to foreign tribunals in 1855; requests for aid took the form of letters roga-tory forwarded through diplomatic channels. See Act ofMar. 2, 1855, ch. 140, $ 2, 10 Stat. 630 (circuit court may ap-point "a United States commissioner designated . . . to makethe examination of witnesses" on receipt of a letter rogatoryfrom a foreign court); Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 95, $ 1, 12 Stat.769 (authorizing district courts to respond to letters rogatoryby compelling witnesses here to provide testimony for useabroad in "suit[s] for the recovery of money or property").1In 1948, Congress substantially broadened the scope of as1 "[A] letter rogatory is the request by a domestic court to a foreigncourt to take evidence from a certain witness."

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtsistance federal courts could provide for foreign proceedings.That legislation, codified as $ 1782, eliminated the prior requirement that the government of a foreign country be aparty or have an interest in the proceeding. The measureallowed district courts to designate persons to preside atdepositions "to be used in any civil action pending in anycourt in a foreign country with which the United States isat peace." Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, $ 1782, 62 Stat. 949(emphasis added). The next year, Congress deleted "civilaction" from $ 1782's text and inserted "judicial proceeding."Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, $ 93, 63 Stat. 103. See gen-erally Jones, International Judicial Assistance: ProceduralChaos and a Program for Reform, 62 Yale L. J. 515 (1953).In 1958, prompted by the growth of international commerce, Congress created a Commission on InternationalRules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission) to "investigate and study existing practices of judicial assistance andcooperation between the United States and foreign countrieswith a view to achieving improvements."

L. 88-619, $ 9, 78 Stat. 997; Smit, Interna-tional Litigation 1026-1035.As recast in 1964, $ 1782 provided for assistance in obtain-ing documentary and other tangible evidence as well as testimony.

We also granted review on two other questions.First, does $ 1782(a) make discovery available to complain-ants, such as AMD, who do not have the status of private"litigants" and are not sovereign agents? See Pet. for Cert.(i). Second, must a "proceeding" before a foreign "tribunal"be "pending" or at least "imminent" for an applicant to in-voke $ 1782(a) successfully?

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the Court(same). Answering "yes" to the first question and "no" tothe second, we affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment.IITo place this case in context, we sketch briefly how theEuropean Commission, acting through the DG-Competition,enforces European competition laws and regulations. TheDG-Competition's "overriding responsibility" is to conductinvestigations into alleged violati ons of the EuropeanUnion's competition prescriptions. See European Commission Amicus Curiae 6. On receipt of a complaint or suasponte, the DG-Competition conducts a preliminary investi-gation. Ibid. In that investigation, the DG-Competition"may take into account information provided by a complain-ant, and it may seek information directly from the target ofthe complaint." Ibid. "Ultimately, DG Competition's pre-liminary investigation results in a formal written decisionwhether to pursue the complaint. If [the DG-Competition]declines to proceed, that decision is subject to judicial review" by the Court of First Instance and, ultimately, by thecourt of last resort for European Union matters, the Courtof Justice for the European Communities (European Courtof Justice).Id., at 7; App. 50; see, e. g., Case T-241/97, StorkAmsterdam BV v. Commission, 2000 E. C. R. II-309, [2000]5 C. M. L. R. 31 (Ct. 1st Instance 2000) (annulling Commis-sion's rejection of a complaint).8If the DG-Competition decides to pursue the complaint, ittypically serves the target of the investigation with a formal"statement of objections" and advises the target of its in-tention to recommend a decision finding that the target hasviolated European competition law. European Commission8 The Court of First Instance, which is "attached to the [European]Court of Justice," was established "to improve the judicial protection ofindividual interests, particularly in cases requiring the examination ofcomplex facts, whilst at the same time reducing the workload of the [European] Court of Justice."

The target is entitled to a hearing beforean independent officer, who provides a report to the DGCompetition. Ibid.; App. 18-27. Once the DG-Competitionhas made its recommendation, the European Commissionmay "dismis[s] the complaint, or issu[e] a decision finding in-fringement and imposing penalties." European CommissionAmicus Curiae 7. The Commission's final action dismissingthe complaint or holding the target liable is subject to reviewin the Court of First Instance and the European Court ofJustice.Ibid.; App. 52-53, 89-90.Although lacking formal "party" or "litigant" status inCommission proceedings, the complainant has significantprocedural rights. Most prominently, the complainant maysubmit to the DG-Competition information in support of itsallegations, and may seek judicial review of the Commission'sdisposition of a complaint. See European Commission Ami-cus Curiae 7-8, and n. 5; Stork Amsterdam, 2000 E. C. R.II, at 328-329, |||| 51-53. IIIAs "in all statutory construction cases, we begin [our ex-amination of $ 1782] with the language of the statute."Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (2002). Thelanguage of $ 1782(a), confirmed by its context, our examination satisfies us, warrants this conclusion: The statute au-thorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a European Commissionproceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling,i. e., a final ad-ministrative action both responsive to the complaint and reviewable in court.9 Accordingly, we reject the categoricallimitations Intel would place on the statute's reach.9 The dissent suggests that the Commission "more closely resembles aprosecuting authority, say, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division,than an administrative agency that adjudicates cases, say, the FederalTrade Commission." Post, at 270. That is a questionable suggestion inview of the European Commission's authority to determine liability andimpose penalties, dispositions that will remain final unless overturned bythe European courts. See supra this page.542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN256 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtAWe turn first to Intel's contention that the catalog of "in-terested person[s]" authorized to apply for judicial assistanceunder $ 1782(a) includes only "litigants, foreign sovereigns,and the designated agents of those sovereigns," and excludesAMD, a mere complainant before the Commission, accordedonly "limited rights." Brief for Petitioner 10-11, 24, 26-27.Highlighting $ 1782's caption, "[a]ssistance to foreign and in-ternational tribunals and tolitigants before such tribunals,"Intel urges that the statutory phrase "any interested person"should be read, correspondingly, to reach only "litigants."Id., at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis inoriginal).The caption of a statute, this Court has cautioned, "cannotundo or limit that which the [statute's] text makes plain."Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529(1947). The text of $ 1782(a), "upon the application of anyinterested person," plainly reaches beyond the universe ofpersons designated "litigant." No doubt litigants are included among, and may be the most common example of,the "interested person[s]" who may invoke $ 1782; we read$ 1782's caption to convey no more. See, e. g., Whitman v.American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 482-483(2001) (rejecting narrow reading of 42 U. S. C. $ 7511(a) basedon caption in light of "specifically" broader coverage of pro-vision's text).The complainant who triggers a European Commission in-vestigation has a significant role in the process. As earlierobserved, see supra, at 255, in addition to prompting an in-vestigation, the complainant has the right to submit information for the DG-Competition's consideration, and mayproceed to court if the Commission discontinues the investigation or dismisses the complaint. App. 52-53. Giventhese participation rights, a complainant "possess[es] a reasonable interest in obtaining [ judicial] assistance," andtherefore qualifies as an "interested person" within any fairconstruction of that term. See Smit, International Litiga542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN257Cite as: 542 U.

But those courts are not proof-taking instances. Their review is limited to the record before theCommission. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Hence, AMD could"use" evidence in the reviewing courts only by submitting itto the Commission in the current, investigative stage.Moreover, when Congress established the Commission onInternational Rules of Judicial Procedure in 1958, seesupra,at 248, it instructed the Rules Commission to recommend10 The term "interested person," Intel notes, also appears in 28 U. S. C.$ 1696(a), a provision enacted concurrently with the 1964 revision of $ 1782.Brief for Petitioner 27. Section 1696(a) authorizes federal district courtsto "order service . . . of any document issued in connection with a [foreign]proceeding" pursuant to a request made by the foreign tribunal "or uponapplication of any interested person." Intel reasons that "[t]he class ofprivate parties qualifying as `interested persons' for [service] purposesmust of course be limited to litigants, because private parties . . . cannotserve `process' unless they have filed suit." Brief for Petitioner 27 (emphasis in original). Section 1696(a), however, is not limited to service ofprocess; it allows service of "any document" issued in connection with aforeign proceeding. As the Government points out by way of example:"[I]f the European Commission's procedures were revised to require acomplainant to serve its complaint on a target company, but the complainant's role in the Commission's proceedings otherwise remained unchanged,[$ ]1696 would authorize the district court to provide that `interested [person]' with assistance in serving that document."

Section 1782 had previously referred to"any judicial proceeding." The Rules Commission's draft,which Congress adopted, replaced that term with "a proceed-ing in a foreign or international tribunal."

See also European Commission Amicus Curiae 9("[W]hen the Commission acts on DG Competition's final recommendation . . . the investigative function blur[s] into deci-sionmaking.").

CIntel also urges that AMD's complaint has not progressedbeyond the investigative stage; therefore, no adjudicative action is currently or even imminently on the Commission'sagenda. Brief for Petitioner 27-29.Section 1782(a) does not limit the provision of judicial as-sistance to "pending" adjudicative proceedings. In 1964,when Congress eliminated the requirement that a proceed-ing be "judicial," Congress also deleted the requirement thata proceeding be "pending." See supra, at 248-249.

The legislative history of the1964 revision is in sync; it reflects Congress' recognition thatjudicial assistance would be available "whether the foreignor international proceeding or investigation is of a criminal,civil, administrative, or other nature." S. Rep. No. 1580, at9 (emphasis added).In 1996, Congress amended $ 1782(a) to clarify that thestatute covers "criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation." See $ 1342(b), 110 Stat. 486; supra, at 249.Nothing suggests that this amendment was an endeavor torein in, rather than to confirm, by way of example, the broadrange of discovery authorized in 1964. See S. Rep. No. 1580,at 7 ("[T]he [district] court[s] have discretion to grant assist-ance when proceedings are pending before investigatingmagistrates in foreign countries.").In short, we reject the view, expressed inIn re IshiharaChemical Co., that $ 1782 comes into play only when adjudi-cative proceedings are "pending" or "imminent." See 251F. 3d, at 125 (proceeding must be "imminent--very likelyto occur and very soon to occur" (internal quotation marksomitted)). Instead, we hold that $ 1782(a) requires only thata dispositive ruling by the Commission, reviewable by theEuropean courts, be within reasonable contemplation. SeeCrown Prosecution Serv. of United Kingdom, 870 F. 2d, at691; In re Request for Assistance from Ministry of LegalAffairs of Trinidad and Tobago, 848 F. 2d 1151, 1155, andn. 9 (CA11 1988); Smit, International Litigation 1026 ("It isnot necessary . . . for the [adjudicative] proceeding to bepending at the time the evidence is sought, but only that theevidence is eventually to be used in such a proceeding.").DWe take up next the foreign-discoverability rule on whichlower courts have divided: Does $ 1782(a) categorically bar a542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN260 INTEL CORP. v.

Seesupra, at 253-254, and n. 7.We note at the outset, and count it sig nificant, that$ 1782(a) expressly shields privileged material: "A personmay not be compelled to give his testimony or statement orto produce a document or other thing in violation of any le-gally applicable privilege." See S. Rep. No. 1580, at 9 ("[N]operson shall be required under the provisions of [$ 1782] toproduce any evidence in violation of an applicable privilege."). Beyond shielding material safeguarded by an appli-cable privilege, however, nothing in the text of $ 1782 limitsa district court's production-order authority to materials thatcould be discovered in the foreign jurisdiction if the materials were located there. "If Congress had intended to imposesuch a sweeping restriction on the district court's discretion,at a time when it was enacting liberalizing amendments tothe statute, it would have included statutory language tothat effect."

The Senate Report observes in this regard that $ 1782(a) "leaves theissuance of an appropriate order to the discretion of the court11 Section 1782(a) instructs that a district court's discovery order "mayprescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part thepractice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal,for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or otherthing . . . [or may be] the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."

No. 1580,at 7.Intel raises two policy concerns in support of a foreigndiscoverability limitation on $ 1782(a) aid--avoiding offenseto foreign governments, and maintaining parity between litigants. Brief for Petitioner 23-24; Reply Brief 5, 13-14; seeIn re Application of Asta Medica, S. A., 981 F. 2d 1, 6 (CA11992) ("Congress did not seek to place itself on a collisioncourse with foreign tribunals and legislatures, which havecarefully chosen the procedures and laws best suited to theirconcepts of litigation."). While comity and parity concernsmay be important as touchstones for a district court's exercise of discretion in particular cases, they do not permit ourinsertion of a generally applicable foreign-discoverabilityrule into the text of $ 1782(a).We question whether foreign governments would in factbe offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but notrequiring, judicial assistance. A foreign nation may limitdiscovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its ownlegal practices, culture, or traditions--reasons that do notnecessarily signal objection to aid from United States federalcourts. SeeBayer, 146 F. 3d, at 194 ("[T]here is no reason toassume that because a country has not adopted a particulardiscovery procedure, it would take offense at its use."); Smit,Recent Developments in International Litigation, 35 S. Tex.L. Rev. 215, 235-236 (1994) (hereinafter Smit, Recent Devel-opments) (same).12 A foreign tribunal's reluctance to order12 Most civil-law systems lack procedures analogous to the pretrial discovery regime operative under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. SeeALI, ALI/Unidroit Principles and Rules of Transnational Civil Procedure,Proposed Final Draft, Rule 22, Comment R-22E, p. 118 (2004) ("Disclosureand exchange of evidence under the civil-law systems are generally morerestricted, or nonexistent."); Hazard, Discovery and the Role of the Judgein Civil Law Jurisdictions, 73 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1017, 1018-1019 (1998)(same). See also Smit, Recent Developments 235, n. 93 ("The drafters[of $ 1782] were quite aware of the circumstance that civil law systems542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN262 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtproduction of materials present in the United States simi-larly may signal no resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to $ 1782(a). See South Carolina Ins. Co. v.Assurantie Maatschappij "De Zeven Provincien" N. V.,[1987] 1 App. Cas. 24 (House of Lords ruled that nondis-coverability under English law did not stand in the way of alitigant in English proceedings seeking assistance in theUnited States under $ 1782).13 When the foreign tribunalwould readily accept relevant information discovered in theUnited States, application of a foreign-discoverability rulewould be senseless. The rule in that situation would serveonly to thwart $ 1782(a)'s objective to assist foreign tribunalsin obtaining relevant information that the tribunals may finduseful but, for reasons having no bearing on internationalcomity, they cannot obtain under their own laws.Concerns about maintaining parity among adversaries inlitigation likewise do not provide a sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule. When information issought by an "interested person," a district court could con-dition relief upon that person's reciprocal exchange of information. See Euromepa, S. A. v. R. Esmerian, Inc., 51 F. 3d1095, 1102 (CA2 1995); Smit, Recent Developments 237.Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on itsacceptance of the information to maintain whatever measureof parity it concludes is appropriate. See Euromepa, 51F. 3d, at 1101.14generally do not have American type pretrial discovery, and do not compelthe production of documentary evidence.").13 See Smit, American Assistance to Litigation in Foreign and International Tribunals: Section 1782 of Title 28 of the U.

Int'l L. & Comm. 1, 13, and n. 63 (1998) (hereinafter Smit, AmericanAssistance) (noting that "[a] similar decision was rendered by the President of the Amsterdam District Court").14 A civil-law court, furthermore, might attend to litigant-parity concerns in its merits determination: "In civil law countries, documentaryevidence is generally submitted as an attachment to the pleadings or aspart of a report by an expert. . . . A civil law court generally rules uponthe question of whether particular documentary evidence may be relied542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN263Cite as: 542 U. S. 241 (2004)Opinion of the CourtWe also reject Intel's suggestion that a $ 1782(a) applicantmust show that United States law would allow discoveryin domestic litigation analogous to the foreign proceeding.Brief for Petitioner 19-20 ("[I]f AMD were pursuing thismatter in the United States, U. S. law would preclude it fromobtaining discovery of Intel's documents."). Section 1782 isa provision for assistance to tribunals abroad. It does notdirect United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.15For example, we have in the United States no close analogueto the European Commission regime under which AMD isnot free to mount its own case in the Court of First Instanceor the European Court of Justice, but can participate only ascomplainant, an "interested person," in Commission-steeredproceedings. See L. Ritter, W. Braun, & F. Rawlinson, European Competition Law: A Practitioner's Guide 824-826(2d ed. 2000) (describing a complaint as a potentially "morecertain (and cheaper) alternative to private enforcementthrough the [European Union's member states'] courts").16upon only in its decision on the merits." Smit, Recent Developments 235-236, n. 94.15 Among its proposed rules, the dissent would exclude from $ 1782(a)'sreach discovery not available "under foreign law" and "under domesticlaw in analogous circumstances." Post, at 270. Because comparison ofsystems is slippery business, the dissent's rule is infinitely easier to statethan to apply. As the dissent's examples tellingly reveal, see post, at 267-268, a foreign proceeding may have no direct analogue in our legal system.In light of the variety of foreign proceedings resistant to ready classification in domestic terms, Congress left unbounded by categorical rules thedetermination whether a matter is proceeding "in a foreign or international tribunal." While we reject the rules the dissent would inject intothe statute, see post, at 269-273, we do suggest guides for the exercise ofdistrict-court discretion, see infra, at 264-266.16 At oral argument, counsel for AMD observed: "In the United States,we could have brought a private action in the district court for these verysame violations. In Europe, our only Europe-wide remedy was to go tothe [European Commission]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN264 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIVAs earlier emphasized, see supra, at 260-261, a districtcourt is not required to grant a $ 1782(a) discovery application simply because it has the authority to do so. SeeUnited Kingdom v. United States, 238 F. 3d 1312, 1319 (CA112001) ("a district court's compliance with a $ 1782 request isnot mandatory"). We note below factors that bear consider-ation in ruling on a $ 1782(a) request.First, when the person from whom discovery is sought isa participant in the foreign proceeding (as Intel is here), theneed for $ 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordi-narily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant inthe matter arising abroad. A foreign tribunal has jurisdic-tion over those appearing before it, and can itself order themto produce evidence. App. to Reply Brief 4a ("When th[e]person [who is to produce the evidence] is a party to theforeign proceedings, the foreign or international tribunal canexercise its own jurisdiction to order production of the evidence." (quoting declaration of H. Smit in In re: Applicationof Ishihara Chemical Co., Ltd., For order to take discoveryof Shipley Company, L. L. C., Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1782,Misc. 99-232 (FB) (EDNY, May 18, 2000))). In contrast,nonparticipants in the foreign proceeding may be outside theforeign tribunal's jurisdictional reach; hence, their evidence,available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent$ 1782(a) aid. See App. to Reply Brief 4a.Second, as the 1964 Senate Report suggests, a court presented with a $ 1782(a) request may take into account thenature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreigngovernment or the court or agency abroad to U. S. federalcourt judicial assistance. See S. Rep. No. 1580, at 7. Fur-ther, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on$ 1782(a)'s scope may be relevant in determining whether adiscovery order should be granted in a particular case. SeeBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23. Specifically,542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN265Cite as: 542 U. S. 241 (2004)Opinion of the Courta district court could consider whether the $ 1782(a) requestconceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gatheringrestrictions or other policies of a foreign country or theUnited States. See id., at 27. Also, unduly intrusive orburdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed. SeeBayer, 146 F. 3d, at 196 (remanding for district-court consideration of "appropriate measures, if needed, to protect theconfidentiality of materials");In re Application of Esses, 101F. 3d 873, 876 (CA2 1996) (affirming limited discovery that isneither "burdensome [n]or duplicative").Intel maintains that, if we do not accept the categoricallimitations it proposes, then, at least, we should exercise oursupervisory authority to adopt rules barring $ 1782(a) discovery here. Brief for Petitioner 34-36; cf. Thomas v. Arn, 474U. S. 140, 146-147 (1985) (this Court can establish rules of"sound judicial practice" (internal quotation marks omitted)).We decline, at this juncture, to adopt supervisory rules.Any such endeavor at least should await further experiencewith $ 1782(a) applications in the lower courts.17 The European Commission has stated in amicus curiae briefs to thisCourt that it does not need or want the District Court's assistance. See European Commission Amicus Curiae 11-16;Brief for European Commission asAmicus Curiae in Sup17 The dissent sees a need for "categorical limits" to ward off "expensive,time-consuming battles about discovery." Post, at 268. That concernseems more imaginary than real. There is no evidence whatsoever, in the40 years since $ 1782(a)'s adoption, see supra, at 248, of the costs, delays,and forced settlements the dissent hypothesizes. See Smit, American Assistance 1, 19-20 ("The revised section 1782 . . . has been applied in scoresof cases. . . . All in all, Section 1782 has largely served the purposes forwhich it was enacted. . . . [T]here appears to be no reason for seriouslyconsidering, at this time, any statutory amendments.").The Commission, we note, is not obliged to respond to a discovery request of the kind AMD has made. The party targeted in the complaintand in the $ 1782(a) application would no doubt wield the laboring oar inopposing discovery, as Intel did here. Not only was there no "need forthe Commission to respond," post, at 271, the Commission in fact made nosubmission at all in the instant matter before it reached this Court.542US1 Unit: $U67 [10-31-06 13:57:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN266 INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtport of Pet. for Cert. 4-8. It is not altogether clear, however, whether the Commission, which may itself invoke$ 1782(a) aid, means to say "never" or "hardly ever" to judicial assistance from United States courts. Nor do we knowwhether the European Commission's views on $ 1782(a)'s utility are widely shared in the international community by entities with similarly blended adjudicative and prosecutorialfunctions.Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.Intel and its amici have expressed concerns that AMD's application, if granted in any part, may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage "fishing expeditions," andundermine the European Commission's Leniency Program.See Brief for Petitioner 37; European Commission AmicusCuriae 11-16.18 Yet no one has suggested that AMD's complaint to the Commission is pretextual. Nor has it beenshown that $ 1782(a)'s preservation of legally applicable privileges, see supra, at 260, and the controls on discovery available to the District Court, see, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.26(b)(2) and (c), would be ineffective to prevent discovery ofIntel's business secrets and other confidential information.On the merits, this case bears closer scrutiny than it hasreceived to date. Having held that $ 1782(a) authorizes, butdoes not require, discovery assistance, we leave it to thecourts below to ensure an airing adequate to determinewhat, if any, assistance is appropriate.1918 The European Commission's "Leniency Program" allows "cartel participants [to] confess their own wrongdoing" in return for prosecutorialleniency.
