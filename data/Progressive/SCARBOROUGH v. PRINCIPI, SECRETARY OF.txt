Relevanthere, EAJA authorizes the payment of fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States; the Government may defeat this entitlement by showing that itsposition in the underlying litigation "was substantially justified." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(A). In a further provision,$ 2412(d)(1)(B), the Act prescribes the timing and content ofapplications seeking fees authorized by $ 2412(d)(1)(A). Section 2412(d)(1)(B) specifies as the time for filing the application "within thirty days of final judgment in the action." Inthe same sentence, the provision identifies the application'scontents, in particular, a showing that the applicant is a "prevailing party" who meets the financial eligibility condition(in this case, a net worth that "did not exceed $2,000,000 atthe time the . . . action was filed," $ 2412(d)(2)(B)); and astatement of the amount sought, with an accompanying itemization. The fee application instruction adds in the nextsentence: "The [applicant] shall also allege that the positionof the United States was not substantially justified."Petitioner Randall C. Scarborough was the prevailingparty in an action against the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability benefits. His counsel filed a timely application for fees showing Scarborough's "eligib[ility] to receivean award" and "the amount sought, including [the required]itemized statement." $ 2412(d)(1)(B). But counsel failedinitially to allege, in addition, that "the position of the UnitedStates was not substantially justified." Pointing to thatomission, the Government moved to dismiss the fee application. Scarborough's counsel immediately filed an amendedapplication adding that the Government's opposition to theunderlying claim for benefits "was not substantially justified." In the interim between the initial filing and theamendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing periodhad expired. For that sole reason, the United States Courtof Appeals for Veterans Claims granted the Government's541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtmotion to dismiss the application and the Federal Circuit affirmed that disposition.Scarborough's petition for certiorari presents this question: May a timely fee application, pursuant to $ 2412(d), beamended after the 30-day filing period has run to cure aninitial failure to allege that the Government's position in theunderlying litigation lacked substantial justification? Wehold that a curative amendment is permissible and that Scarborough's fee application, as amended, qualifies for consideration and determination on the merits.IACongress enacted EAJA, Pub. L. 96-481, Tit.

EAJA added twonew prescriptions to $ 2412 that expressly authorize attorney's fee awards against the Federal Government. First,$ 2412(b) made the United States liable for attorney's feesand expenses "to the same extent that any other party wouldbe liable under the common law or under the terms of anystatute which specifically provides for such an award."

S. 401 (2004)Opinion of the Courtagency of the United States. This case concerns the con-struction of $ 2412(d).Congress initially adopted $ 2412(d) for a trial period ofthree years, Pub. L. 96-481, $ 204(c); in 1985, Congress substantially reenacted the measure, this time without a sunsetprovision, Pub. L. 99-80, 99 Stat. 183. See id., $ 6(b)(2), 99Stat. 186. Congress' aim, in converting $ 2412(d) from atemporary measure to a permanent one, was "to ensure thatcertain individuals, partnerships, corporations . . . or otherorganizations will not be deterred from seeking review of, ordefending against, unjustified governmental action becauseof the expense involved." H. R. Rep. No. 99-120, p. 4.Section 2412(d) currently provides, in relevant part:"(d)(1)(A) Except as otherwise specifically providedby statute, a court shall award to a prevailing partyother than the United States fees and other expenses,in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection(a),[1] incurred by that party in any civil action (otherthan cases sounding in tort), . . . brought by or againstthe United States in any court having jurisdiction ofthat action, unless the court finds that the position of theUnited States was substantially justified or that specialcircumstances make an award unjust."(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other ex-penses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in theaction, submit to the court an application for fees andother expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under thissubsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness . . .stating the actual time expended and the rate at whichfees and other expenses were computed. The party1 Subsection (a) states: "Except as otherwise specifically provided bystatute, a judgment for costs . . . may be awarded to the prevailing partyin any civil action brought by or against the United States . . . in any courthaving jurisdiction of such action." $ 2412(a)(1).541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 SCARBOROUGH v.

The second sentence of$ 2412(d)(1)(B) adds a fourth instruction, requiring the appli-cant simply to "allege" that the position of the United Stateswas not substantially justified.BOn July 9, 1999, petitioner Scarborough, a United StatesNavy veteran, prevailed before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) on a claim for disability benefits.App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-44a. Eleven days later, Scarborough's counsel applied, on Scarborough's behalf, for attor-ney's fees and costs pursuant to $ 2412(d). App. 4-5. Scarborough himself would gain from any fee recovery becausehis lawyer's statutory contingent fee, ordinarily 20% of theveteran's past-due benefits, 38 U. S.

S. 401 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThe Clerk of the CAVC returned Scarborough's initial feeapplication on the ground that it was filed too soon. App.6-7. After the CAVC issued a judgment noting that thetime for filing postdecision motions had expired, Scarborough's counsel filed a second EAJA application (the one atissue here) setting forth, as did the first application, thatScarborough was the prevailing party in the underlying litigation; that his net worth did not exceed $2 million; and adescription of work counsel performed for Scarborough sincecounsel's retention in August 1998. Id., at 8-9. The appli-cation requested $19,333.75 in attorney's fees and $117.80 incosts. Id., at 9. Scarborough's applications, both the firstand the second, failed to allege "that the position of theUnited States [in the underlying litigation] was not substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(B). In all other respects,it is not here disputed, Scarborough's filings met the$ 2412(d)(1)(B) application-content requirements.Again, the Clerk of the CAVC found the application premature, but this time retained it, unfiled, until the time toappeal the CAVC's judgment had expired. The Clerk thenfiled the fee application and notified the respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs that his response was due within 30days. Id., at 10. After receiving and exhausting a 30-dayextension of time to respond, the Secretary moved to dismissthe fee application. Id., at 2. The CAVC lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction to award fees under $ 2412(d), the Secretary maintained, because Scarborough's counsel had failed toallege, within 30 days of the final judgment, "that the position of the United States was not substantially justified,"$ 2412(d)(1)(B). CAVC Record, Doc. 12, pp. 4-5.Scarborough's counsel promptly filed an amendment to thefee application, stating in a new paragraph that "the government's defense of the Appellant's claim was not substantiallyjustified."

Simultaneously, Scarborough opposedthe Secretary's motion to dismiss, urging that the omissioninitially to plead "no substantial justification" could be cured541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN410 SCARBOROUGH v.

On June 14, 2000, the CAVC dismissed Scarborough's fee application on the ground assertedby the Government.Scarborough v. West, 13 Vet. App. 530(per curiam).A year-and-a-half later, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 273 F. 3d 1087 (2001). EAJA mustbe construed strictly in favor of the Government, the Courtof Appeals stated, because the Act effects a partial waiverof sovereign immunity, rendering the United States liable forattorney's fees when the Government otherwise would notbe required to pay. Id., at 1089-1090. In the court's view,"[t]he language of the EAJA statute is plain and unambiguous"; it requires a party seeking fees under $ 2412(d)to submit an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day time limit. Id., at 1090 (citing$ 2412(d)(1)(B)). The court acknowledged that the Courtsof Appeals for the Third and Eleventh Circuits read$ 2412(d)(1)(B) to require only that the fee application be filedwithin 30 days; those Circuits allow later amendments toperfect the application-content specifications set out in$ 2412(d)(1)(B). Id., at 1090-1091 (citing Dunn v. UnitedStates, 775 F. 2d 99, 104 (CA3 1985) (applicant need not submit within 30 days an itemized statement accounting for theamount sought), and Singleton v. Apfel, 231 F. 3d 853, 858(CA11 2000) (applicant need not allege within 30 days thather net worth did not exceed $2 million or that the Government's position was not substantially justified)).The Federal Circuit also distinguished its own decision inBazalo v. West, 150 F. 3d 1380 (1998), which had held thatan applicant may supplement an EAJA application to curean initial failure to show eligibility for fees. The applicantin Bazalo had failed to allege and establish, within the30-day period, that he was a qualified "party" within themeaning of $ 2412(d), i. e., that his "net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed,"541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 541 U. S. 401 (2004)Opinion of the Court$ 2412(d)(2)(B). Id., at 1381. Bazalo differed from Scarbor-ough's case, the Court of Appeals said, because theBazaloapplicant had essentially complied with the basic pleadingrequirements and simply needed to "fles[h] out . . . the details." 273 F. 3d, at 1092.We granted Scarborough's initial petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, andremanded the case in light of this Court's decision in Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106 (2002). See 536U. S. 920 (2002). Edelman concerned an Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation relating toTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the regulation allowed amendment of an employment discrimination charge,timely filed with the EEOC, to add, after the filing deadlinehad passed, the required, but initially absent, verification.See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(b) (requiring charges to "be in writing under oath or affirmation"). We upheld the regulation.Title VII, we explained, in line with "a long history of practice," 535 U. S., at 116, permitted "relation back" of a verification missing from an original filing, id., at 115-118.On remand of Scarborough's case to the same Federal Circuit panel, two of the three judges adhered to the panel'sunanimous earlier decision and distinguished Edelman. 319F. 3d 1346 (2003). Unlike the civil rights statute in Edelman, the Court of Appeals majority said, a "remedialscheme" in which laypersons often initiate the process,EAJA is directed to attorneys, who do not need "paternalistic protection." 319 F. 3d, at 1353 (internal quotation marksomitted). The Federal Circuit's majority further observedthat the two requirements at issue in Edelman--the timelyfiling of a discrimination charge and the verification of thatcharge--appear in separate statutory provisions. In contrast, EAJA's 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutoryprovision. 319 F. 3d, at 1353. The majority also distinguished Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757 (2001), in which541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN412 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtwe held that a pro se litigant's failure to hand sign a timelyfiled notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect. This Court had noted in Becker, the FederalCircuit majority pointed out, that the timing and signaturerequirements there at issue were found in separate rules.See 319 F. 3d, at 1353. The Federal Circuit's opinion nextdistinguished Edelman's verification requirement and Becker's signature requirement from EAJA's no-substantial-justification-allegati on requirement on this additionalground: "[The] . . . substantial justification [allegation] is nota pro forma requirement," for it "requires an applicant toanalyze the case record" and "is one portion of the basis ofthe award itself." 319 F. 3d, at 1353. Reiterating that theno-substantial-justification allegation is "jurisdictional," theFederal Circuit held that Scarborough's "[n]oncompliance[was] fatal" and dismissed the application. Id., at 1355.Chief Judge Mayer dissented. The no-substantialjustification allegation, he found, "is akin to the verificationrequirement of Edelman and the signature requirement ofBecker." Id., at 1356. In addition to the pathmarkingEdelman and Becker decisions, he regarded this case as"substantially the same case as Bazalo." 319 F. 3d, at 1356.In light of EAJA's purpose "to eliminate the financial disincentive for those who would defend against unjustified governmental action and thereby deter it," Chief Judge Mayerconcluded, "it is apparent that Congress did not intend theEAJA application process to be an additional deterrent tothe vindication of rights because of a missing averment."Ibid.We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 986 (2003), in view of thedivision of opinion among the Circuits on the questionwhether an EAJA application may be amended, outside the30-day period, to allege that the Government's position in theunderlying litigation was not substantially justified, compareSingleton, 231 F. 3d 853, with 319 F. 3d 1346. We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN413Cite as: 541 U. S. 401 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIIAWe clarify, first, that the question before us--whetherScarborough is time barred by $ 2412(d)(1)(B) from gaining the fee award authorized by $ 2412(d)(1)(A)--does notconcern the federal courts' "subject-matter jurisdiction."Rather, it concerns a mode of relief (costs including legalfees) ancillary to the judgment of a court that has plenary"jurisdiction of [the civil] action" in which the fee applicationis made. See $$ 2412(b) and (d)(1)(A) (costs including feesawardable "in any civil action" brought against the UnitedStates "in any court having jurisdiction of [that] action"); 38U. S. C. $ 7252(a) ("The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claimsshall have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of theBoard of Veterans' Appeals.").3 More particularly, the cur-rent dispute between Scarborough and the Government presents a question of time. The issue is not whether, butwhen, $$ 2412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee applicant to "allege that the position of the United States was not substan-tially justified." As we recently observed:"Courts, including this Court, . . . have more than oc-casionally [mis]used the term `jurisdictional' to describeemphatic time prescriptions in [claim processing]rules . . . . Classifying time prescriptions, even rigidones, under the heading `subject matter jurisdiction' canbe confounding. Clarity would be facilitated if courtsand litigants used the label `jurisdictional' not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating3 Scarborough had already invoked the CAVC's exclusive jurisdiction--by appealing the Board of Veterans' Appeals' July 1998 decision denyinghis claim for disability benefits--well before he applied for fees; this distinguishes his case from Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312(1988), on which the Government relies. See Brief for Respondent 11, 20,n. 3. Torres involved the omission of required content (each applicant'sname) in a notice of appeal, the filing that triggers appellate-court jurisdiction over the case. See 487 U. S., at 315, 317.541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN414 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtthe classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and thepersons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court'sadjudicatory authority." Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.443, 454-455 (2004) (citation, some internal quotationmarks, and brackets omitted).In short, $ 2412(d)(1)(B) does not describe what "classes ofcases,"id., at 455, the CAVC is competent to adjudicate;instead, the section relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court's adjudi-catory authority. Accordingly, as Kontrick indicates, theprovision's 30-day deadline for fee applications and itsapplication-content specifications are not properly typed"jurisdictional." BWe turn next to the reason why Congress required thefee applicant to "allege" that the Government's position "wasnot substantially justified, " $ 2412(d)(1)(B).4 Unlike the$ 2412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must show(his "prevailing party" status and "eligib[ility] to receive anaward," and "the amount sought, including an itemized statement" reporting "the actual time expended and the rate atwhich fees and other expenses were computed"), the required "not substantially justified" allegation imposes noproof burden on the fee applicant. It is, as its text conveys,nothing more than an allegation or pleading requirement.The burden of establishing "that the position of the UnitedStates was substantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(A) indicatesand courts uniformly have recognized, must be shoulderedby the Government. See, e. g., Pierce v. Underwood, 4874 All agree that $ 2412(d)(1)(B) requires a fee applicant to allege that theGovernment's position "was not substantially justified." In this regard,the dissent sees fire where there is no flame. The guides the dissent setsout, post, at 424-425, nn. 2 and 3--court rules and agency regulations--address only what the applicant must plead, not the question of time presented here.541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN415Cite as: 541 U.

No. 96-1005, at 10("[T]he strong deterrents to contesting Government actionthat currently exis[t] require that the burden of proof restwith the Government.").Congress did not, however, want the "substantially justified" standard to "be read to raise a presumption that theGovernment position was not substantially justified simplybecause it lost the case . . . ." Ibid. By allocating the burden of pleading "that the position of the United States wasnot substantially justified"--and that burden only--to the feeapplicant, Congress apparently sought to dispel any assumption that the Government must pay fees each time it loses.Complementarily, the no-substantial-justification-allegationrequirement serves to ward off irresponsible litigation, i. e.,unreasonable or capricious fee-shifting demands. As counsel for the Government stated at oral argument, allocatingthe pleading burden to fee applicants obliges them "to examine the Government's position and make a determination . . .whether it is substantially justified or not." Tr. of Oral Arg.31; see id., at 19 (petitioner recognizes that "the purposeof this allegation [is to make] a lawyer think twice"). Sounderstood, the applicant's burden to plead that the Government's position "was not substantially justified" is akin to thesignature requirement in Becker and the oath or affirmationrequirement in Edelman.In Becker, a pro se litigant had typed, but had neglectedto hand sign, his name, as required by Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 11(a), on his timely filed notice of appeal. 532U. S., at 760-761, 763; see supra, at 411-412. Although wecalled the rules on the timing and content of notices of appeal"linked jurisdictional provisions," Becker, 532 U. S., at 765(referring to Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3 and 4), we concluded541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN416 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtthat a litigant could add the signature required by Rule 11(a)even after the time for filing the notice had expired, 532U. S., at 766-767. Rule 11(a), we observed, provides that"omission of the signature" on any "pleading, written motion,[or] other paper" may be "corrected promptly after beingcalled to the attention of the attorney or party." See 532U. S., at 764. Permitting a late signature to perfect an appeal, we explained, was hardly pathbreaking, for "[o]theropinions of this Court are in full harmony with the view thatimperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal whereno genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from whatjudgment, to which appellate court." Id., at 767-768 (citingSmith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 245, 248-249 (1992), andFoman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 181 (1962)).The next Term, in Edelman, we described our decision inBecker as having allowed "relation back" of the late signature to the timely filed notice of appeal. 535 U. S., at 116.Edelman involved an EEOC regulation permitting a TitleVII discrimination charge timely filed with the agency tobe amended, outside the charge-filing period, to include anomitted, but required, verification. Id., at 109; see supra,at 411. "There is no reason," we observed in sustaining theregulation, "to think that relation back of the oath here isany less reasonable than relation back of the signature inBecker. Both are aimed at stemming the urge to litigateirresponsibly . . . ." 535 U. S., at 116.Becker and Edelman inform our judgment in this case.Like the signature and verification requirements, EAJA'sten-word "not substantially justified" allegation is a "thinktwice" prescription that "stem[s] the urge to litigate irresponsibly," Edelman, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, theallegation functions to shift the burden to the Governmentto prove that its position in the underlying litigation "wassubstantially justified," $ 2412(d)(1)(A). We note, too, thatthe allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the Government is aware, from the moment a fee appli541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN417Cite as: 541 U. S. 401 (2004)Opinion of the Courtcation is filed, that to defeat the application on the merits, itwill have to prove its position "was substantially justified."As Becker indicates, the lapse here "should not be fatalwhere no genuine doubt exists about who is app[lying] [forfees], from what judgment, to which . . . court." 532 U. S.,at 767. Moreover, because Scarborough's lawyer's statutorycontingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by anEAJA award, see 38 U. S. C. $ 5904(d)(1); Fee Agreements,note following 28 U. S. C. $ 2412, allowing the curativeamendment benefits the complainant directly, and is notfairly described as simply a boon for his counsel. Permitting amendment thus advances Congress' purpose, in enacting EAJA, to reduce the "emphasi[s], virtually to the exclusion of all other issues, [on] the cost of potential litigation" ina party's decision whether to challenge unjust governmentalaction. H. R. Rep. No. 96-1005, at 7.The Government, however, maintains that the relationback regime, as now codified in Rule 15(c) of the FederalRules of Civil Procedure, is out of place in this context, forthat Rule governs "pleadings," a term that does not encompass fee applications. Brief for Respondent 21; see Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2) (permitting relation back of amendments to pleadings when "the claim or defense asserted inthe amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in theoriginal [timely filed] pleading"). See also Rule 7(a) (enumerating permitted "pleadings"). Scarborough acknowledges that Rule 15(c) itself is directed to federal districtcourt "pleadings," but urges that this Court has approvedapplication of the relation-back doctrine in analogous settings. Brief for Petitioner 28. Most recently, as just related, we applied the doctrine in Becker and Edelman to,respectively, a notice of appeal and an EEOC discriminationcharge, neither of which is a "pleading" under the FederalRules. As the Government concedes, moreover, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 35-36, "relation back" was not an invention of the541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN418 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtfederal rulemakers. We applied the doctrine well before1938, the year the Federal Rules became effective. See,e. g., New York Central & Hudson River R. Co. v. Kinney,260 U. S. 340, 346 (1922); Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Renn,241 U. S. 290, 293-294 (1916); Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v.Wulf, 226 U. S. 570, 575-576 (1913). With a view to thenexisting practice, the original Rules Advisory Committee de-scribed "relation back" as "a well recognized doctrine." Advisory Committee's 1937 Note on Subd. (c) of Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 15, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 686. Commentators have observed that the doctrine Rule 15(c) embraces "has its rootsin the former federal equity practice and a number of statecodes." 6A C.

Kane, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 1496, p. 64 (2d ed. 1990).5The relation-back doctrine, we accordingly hold, properlyguides our determination that Scarborough's fee applicationcould be amended, after the 30-day filing period, to includethe "not substantially justified" allegation: The amended application "arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrenceset forth or attempted to be set forth" in the initial applica5 See, e. g., Fed. Equity Rule 19 (1912) ("The court may at any time, infurtherance of justice, upon such terms as may be just, permit any process,proceeding, pleading or record to be amended, or material supplementalmatter to be set forth in an amended or supplemental pleading. Thecourt, at every stage of the proceeding, must disregard any error or defectin the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties."); Ill. Rev.

Proc. 11(a), was not fatal to thepetitioners' cases in Edelman and Becker, so here, counsel'sinitial omission of the assertion that the Government's posi-tion lacked substantial justification is not beyond repair.6CThe Government insists most strenuously that $ 2412'swaiver of sovereign immunity from liability for fees is condi6 Scarborough also urges that, regardless of the availability of "relationback," $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s 30-day deadline does not apply to the nosubstantial-justification-allegation requirement. Brief for Petitioner 36-39. In support, Scarborough points out that Congress easily could haveplaced the allegation requirement in the first sentence of $ 2412(d)(1)(B),together with the 30-day deadline and the other application-content specifications. Congress' decision, instead, to set forth the allegation requirement in a separate, second sentence, which contains no time limitation,Scarborough asserts, is significant. Id., at 39. Moreover, Scarboroughcontends, the fact that $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s second sentence is structured differently from the section's first sentence (requiring the "party" to "allege,"rather than directing "the application" to "sho[w]") further indicates thatCongress viewed the "not substantially justified" allegation as separatefrom the fee application's requirements more closely linked to the filingdeadline. Id., at 38. We do not think that this question, as the Government suggests, was answered in Commissioner, INS v. Jean, 496 U. S. 154(1990). See Brief for Respondent 15, 24; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28, 45. In Jean,we held that a party who prevails in fee litigation under EAJA may recover fees for legal services rendered during the fee litigation even if someof the Government's positions regarding the proper fee were "substantially justified," i. e., the district court need not make a second finding ofno substantial justification before awarding fees for the fee contest itself.496 U. S., at 160-162. The sentence in Jean on which the Governmentrelies, stating that "[a] fee application must contain an allegation `that theposition of the United States was not substantially justified,' " id., at 160,like Jean's holding, did not concern the timing question we here confront.In any event, because our decision rests on the applicability of therelation-back doctrine, we do not further explore the debatable questionwhether $ 2412(d)(1)(B)'s 30-day deadline even applies to the "not substantially justified" allegation requirement.541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN420 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courttioned on the fee applicant's meticulous compliance with eachand every requirement of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) within 30 days offinal judgment. Brief for Respondent 18-19; Tr. of OralArg. 28, 31; see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 137 (1991)("EAJA renders the United States liable for attorney's feesfor which it would otherwise not be liable, and thus amountsto a partial waiver of sovereign immunity."). In the Government's view, a failure to allege that the position of theUnited States "was not substantially justified" before the30-day clock has run is as fatal as an omission of any other$ 2412(d)(1)(B) specification. Brief for Respondent 15; Tr. ofOral Arg. 45.7We observe, first, that the Federal Circuit's reading of$ 2412(d)(1)(B) is not as unyielding as the Government's. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that a fee application maybe amended, out of time, to show that the applicant "is eligible to receive an award," $ 2412(d)(1)(B). See Bazalo, 150F. 3d, at 1383-1384 (amendment made after 30-day filing period cured failure initially to establish that fee applicant's networth did not exceed $2 million). As earlier noted, seesupra, at 412, the dissenting judge in Scarborough's casefound Bazalo indistinguishable. 319 F. 3d, at 1355-1356(opinion of Mayer, C. J.).Our decisions in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,498 U. S. 89 (1990), and Franconia Associates v. UnitedStates, 536 U. S. 129 (2002), are enlightening on this issue.Irwin involved an untimely filed Title VII employment discrimination complaint against the Government. Althoughthe petitioner had missed the filing deadline, we held thatTitle VII's statutory time limits are subject to equitable7 The question whether a fee application may be amended after the 30-day filing period to cure an initial failure to make the "show[ings]" setforth in the first sentence of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) is not before us. We offer noview on the applicability of "relation back" in that situation.541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN421Cite as: 541 U.

See 536 U. S., at 145 (internal quotation marks andbrackets omitted); ibid. (refusing to adopt "special accrualrule" for commencement of limitations period against theGovernment).In those decisions, we recognized that "limitations princi-ples should generally apply to the Government `in the sameway that' they apply to private parties." Ibid. (quotingIrwin, 498 U. S., at 95). Once Congress waives sovereignimmunity, we observed, judicial application of a time prescription to suits against the Government, in the same waythe prescription is applicable to private suits, "amountsto little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver."Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95. We further stated in Irwin thatholding the Government responsible "is likely to be a realis-tic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practicallyuseful principle of interpretation." Ibid.9The Government nevertheless maintains thatIrwin andFranconia do not bear on this case, for "[$] 2412(d) author8 Although we held that equitable tolling could be applied in Title VIIclaims against the Government, we further determined that the doctrine'srequirements were not met on the specific facts of Irwin. The Irwin petitioner's excuse for the late complaint--his lawyer's absence from the officewhen the EEOC notice that triggered the complaint-filing deadline wasreceived--ranked "at best [as] a garden variety claim of excusable neglect." 498 U. S., at 96. In this case, we note, the Government extensively argues against recourse to Irwin's "rebuttable presumption" thatequitable tolling is available in litigation Congress has authorized againstthe United States. Id., at 95; see Brief for Respondent 32-41. Becauseour decision rests on other grounds, we express no opinion on the applicability of equitable tolling in the circumstances here presented.9 Indeed, in enacting EAJA, Congress expressed its belief that "at aminimum, the United States should be held to the same standards in litigating as private parties." H. R. Rep. No. 96-1418, p. 9 (1980).541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN422 SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPIOpinion of the Courtizes fee awards against the government under rules thathave no analogue in private litigation." Brief for Respondent 39. But it is hardly clear that Irwin demands a preciseprivate analogue. Litigation against the United States exists because Congress has enacted legislation creating rightsagainst the Government, often in matters peculiar to theGovernment's engagements with private persons--matterssuch as the administration of benefit programs. Becausemany statutes that create claims for relief against the UnitedStates or its agencies apply only to Government defendants,Irwin's reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable privatelitigation equivalent.In any event, $ 2412(d) is analogous to other fee-shiftingprovisions abrogating the general rule that each party to alawsuit pays his own legal fees. The provision resembles"prevailing party" fee-shifting statutes that are applicableto suits between private litigants. See, e. g., 15 U. S. C.$ 1692k(a)(3) (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act); 29 U. S. C.$ 2617(a)(3) (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993); 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(k) (Title VII); cf. Franconia, 536 U. S., at145 (comparing Tucker Act statute of limitations to "contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties [that] also tie the commencement ofthe limitations period to the date a claim `first accrues' ").We note, finally, that the Government has never arguedthat it will be prejudiced if Scarborough's "not substantiallyjustified" allegation is permitted to relate back to his timelyfiled fee application. Moreover, a showing of prejudiceshould preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in thefirst place. See Singleton, 231 F. 3d, at 858 ("The interestsof the government and the courts will be served, however,if district courts are empowered to . . . outright deny a request to supplement [a fee application] if the governmentwould be prejudiced."). In addition, EAJA itself has abuilt-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A) disallows fees where541US2 Unit: $U43 [05-10-06 14:36:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN423Cite as: 541 U.
