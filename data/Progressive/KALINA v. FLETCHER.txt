S. 118 (1997)Opinion of the Courtagainst respondent by filing three documents in the KingCounty Superior Court. Two of those documents--an information charging respondent with burglary and a motion foran arrest warrant--were unsworn pleadings. The burglarycharge was based on an alleged theft of computer equipmentfrom a school.Washington Criminal Rules require that an arrest warrantbe supported by an affidavit or "sworn testimony establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant." 1 To satisfy thatrequirement, petitioner supported her motion with a thirddocument--a "Certification for Determination of ProbableCause"--that summarized the evidence supporting thecharge. She personally vouched for the truth of the factsset forth in the certification under penalty of perjury.2Based on petitioner's certification, the trial court found probable cause and ordered that an arrest warrant be issued.Petitioner's certification contained two inaccurate factualstatements. After noting that respondent's fingerprints hadbeen found on a glass partition in the school, petitionerstated that respondent had "never been associated with theschool in any manner and did not have permission to enterthe school or to take any property." 3 In fact, he had installed partitions on the premises and was authorized toenter the school. She also stated that an employee of anelectronics store had identified respondent "from a photomontage" as the person who had asked for an appraisal of acomputer stolen from the school.4 In fact, the employee didnot identify respondent.51 Washington Criminal Rule 2.2(a); see Wash.

IIRespondent brought this action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, asamended, 42 U. S.

In determining immunity, we accept the allegations of respondent's complaint astrue. See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 261 (1993).Respondent's complaint focuses on the false statements madeby petitioner in the certification.6 Petitioner moved forsummary judgment on the ground that the three documentsthat she filed to commence the criminal proceedings and toprocure the arrest warrant were protected by "the doctrineof absolute prosecutorial immunity." 7 The District Courtdenied the motion, holding that she was not entitled to absolute immunity and that whether qualified immunity wouldapply was a question of fact.8 The Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit affirmed.The Ninth Circuit first noted that under our decision inMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335 (1986), "a police officer whosecures an arrest warrant without probable cause cannotassert an absolute immunity defense," and then observedthat petitioner's "actions in writing, signing and filing thedeclaration for an arrest warrant" were "virtually identicalto the police officer's actions in Malley." 93 F. 3d 653, 655-656 (1996). Relying on the functional approach endorsed inBuckley v.

Because wehave never squarely addressed the question whether a prose-cutor may be held liable for conduct in obtaining an arrestwarrant, we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 519U. S. 1148 (1997). We now affirm.IIISection 1983 is a codification of $ 1 of the Civil Rights Actof 1871.9 The text of the statute purports to create a damages remedy against every state official for the violationof any person's federal constitutional or statutory rights.10The coverage of the statute is thus broader than the pre-existing common law of torts. We have nevertheless recognized that Congress intended the statute to be construed inthe light of common-law principles that were well settled atthe time of its enactment. See Tenney v. Brandhove, 341U. S. 367 (1951); Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U. S. 325, 330 (1983).Thus, we have examined common-law doctrine when identi-fying both the elements of the cause of action and the defenses available to state actors.InImbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976), we held thata former prisoner whose conviction had been set aside incollateral proceedings could not maintain a $ 1983 actionagainst the prosecutor who had litigated the charges againsthim.

FLETCHEROpinion of the Courthaps even more importantly on the policy considerationsunderlying that precedent, we concluded that "a state prosecuting attorney who acted within the scope of his dutiesin initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution" was notamenable to suit under $ 1983. Id., at 410.Liberally construed, Imbler's complaint included not onlya charge that the prosecution had been wrongfully com-menced, but also a charge that false testimony had been offered as well as a charge that exculpatory evidence had beensuppressed. His constitutional claims were thus broaderthan any specific common-law antecedent. Nevertheless, re-lying on common-law decisions providing prosecutors withabsolute immunity from tort actions based on claims thatthe decision to prosecute was malicious and unsupported byprobable cause,11 as well as from actions for defamationbased on statements made during trial,12 we concluded that11 See 424 U. S., at 421-422. The cases that the Court cited were decided after 1871 and granted a broader immunity to public prosecutorsthan had been available in malicious prosecution actions against privatepersons who brought prosecutions at early common law. See Savile v.Roberts, 1 Ld. Raym. 374, 91 Eng. Rep. 1147 (K. B. 1699); Hill v. Miles, 9N. H. 9 (1837); M. Bigelow, Leading Cases on the Law of Torts 193-204(1875). However, these early cases were decided before the office of public prosecutor in its modern form was common. See Langbein, The Origins of Public Prosecution at Common Law, 17 Am. J. Legal Hist. 313, 316(1973); Kress, Progress and Prosecution, 423 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc.Sci. 99, 100-102 (1976); White v. Frank, 855 F. 2d 956, 962 (CA2 1988)(noting that "the availability of the malicious prosecution action has beencurtailed with the growth of the office of the public prosecutor"). Thus,the Court in Imbler drew guidance both from the first American casesaddressing the availability of malicious prosecution actions against publicprosecutors, and perhaps more importantly, from the policy considerationsunderlying the firmly established common-law rules providing absoluteimmunity for judges and jurors. See 424 U. S., at 423, n. 20 (discussingsimilarity in some functions performed by judges, jurors, and prosecutors);Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 347 (1872); Yates v. Lansing, 5 Johns. 282(N. Y. 1810) (Kent, C. J.); Note, Civil Liability of a District Attorney forQuasi-Judicial Acts, 73 U. Pa. L. Rev. 300, 303, n. 13 (1925).12 See 424 U. S., at 439-440 (White, J., concurring in judgment).522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN125Cite as: 522 U. S. 118 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthe statute should be construed to provide an analogousdefense against the claims asserted by Imbler. The policyconsiderations that justified the common-law decisions af-fording absolute immunity to prosecutors when performingtraditional functions applied equally to statutory claimsbased on the conduct of the same functions.Those considerations included both the interest in protecting the prosecutor from harassing litigation that would di-vert his time and attention from his official duties and theinterest in enabling him to exercise independent judgmentwhen "deciding which suits to bring and in conducting themin court." Id., at 424. The former interest would lend support to an immunity from all litigation against the occupantof the office whereas the latter is applicable only when theofficial is performing functions that require the exercise ofprosecutorial discretion. Our later cases have made it clearthat it is the interest in protecting the proper functioning ofthe office, rather than the interest in protecting its occupant,that is of primary importance.In Imbler, we did not attempt to define the outer limits ofthe prosecutor's absolute immunity, but we did recognizethat our rationale would not encompass some of his officialactivities. Thus, while we concluded that Pachtman's "activities were intimately associated with the judicial phase ofthe criminal process, and thus were functions to which thereasons for absolute immunity apply with full force," id., at430, we put to one side "those aspects of the prosecutor'sresponsibility that cast him in the role of an administratoror investigative officer rather than that of advocate," id., at430-431.Subsequent cases have confirmed the importance to thejudicial process of protecting the prosecutor when serving asan advocate in judicial proceedings. Thus, in Burns v. Reed,500 U. S. 478 (1991), after noting the consensus among theCourts of Appeals concerning prosecutorial conduct beforegrand juries, id., at 490, n. 6, we held that the prosecutor's522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN126 KALINA v. FLETCHEROpinion of the Courtappearance in court in support of an application for a searchwarrant and the presentation of evidence at that hearingwere protected by absolute immunity, id., at 492. And inBuckley, we categorically stated that "acts undertaken by aprosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceed-ings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role asan advocate for the State, are entitled to the protections ofabsolute immunity." 509 U. S., at 273.In both of those cases, however, we found the defense un-available when the prosecutor was performing a differentfunction. In Burns, the provision of legal advice to the po-lice during their pretrial investigation of the facts was protected only by qualified, rather than absolute, immunity.500 U. S., at 492-496. Similarly, in Buckley, the prosecutorwas not acting as an advocate either when he held a pressconference, 509 U. S., at 276-278, or when he allegedly fabricated evidence concerning an unsolved crime. With refer-ence to the latter holding, we explained:"There is a difference between the advocate's role inevaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as heprepares for trial, on the one hand, and the detective'srole in searching for the clues and corroboration thatmight give him probable cause to recommend that asuspect be arrested, on the other hand. When a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or police officer, it is `neither ap-propriate nor justifiable that, for the same act, immunityshould protect the one and not the other.' Hampton v.Chicago, 484 F. 2d 602, 608 (CA7 1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 415 U. S. 917 (1974).Thus, if a prosecutor plans and executes a raid on a sus-pected weapons cache, he `has no greater claim to complete immunity than activities of police officers allegedlyacting under his direction.' 484 F. 2d, at 608-609."Id., at 273-274.522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 522 U. S. 118 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThese cases make it clear that the absolute immunity thatprotects the prosecutor's role as an advocate is not groundedin any special "esteem for those who perform these func-tions, and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office, but because any lesser degree of immunity could impairthe judicial process itself."Malley, 475 U. S., at 342. Thus,in determining immunity, we examine "the nature of thefunction performed, not the identity of the actor who per-formed it." Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229 (1988).13This point is perhaps best illustrated by the determinationthat the senior law enforcement official in the Nation--theAttorney General of the United States--is protected only byqualified, rather than absolute, immunity when engaged inthe performance of national defense functions rather thanprosecutorial functions. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511(1985).InMalley we considered, and rejected, two theories onwhich immunity might have been accorded to a police officerwho had caused an unconstitutional arrest by presenting ajudge with a complaint and supporting affidavit that failedto establish probable cause. His first argument, that hisfunction was comparable to that of a complaining witness,actually militated against his claim because such witnesseswere subject to suit at common law.1413 Examining the nature of the function performed is not a recent innovation. In Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 348 (1880), we stated"[w]hether the act done by [a judge] was judicial or not is to be determinedby its character, and not by the character of the agent." See also Bradleyv. Fisher, 13 Wall., at 347 (examining "the character of the act" performedby a judge).14 We noted that:"[C]omplaining witnesses were not absolutely immune at common law. In1871, the generally accepted rule was that one who procured the issuanceof an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint could be held liable ifthe complaint was made maliciously and without probable cause. Givenmalice and the lack of probable cause, the complainant enjoyed no immu522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 KALINA v. FLETCHEROpinion of the CourtHis second argument rested on the similarity between hisconduct and the functions often performed by prosecutors.As we explained:"As an alternative ground for claiming absolute immu-nity, petitioner draws an analogy between an officer requesting a warrant and a prosecutor who asks a grandjury to indict a suspect. Like the prosecutor, petitionerargues, the officer must exercise a discretionary judg-ment based on the evidence before him, and like theprosecutor, the officer may not exercise his best judg-ment if the threat of retaliatory lawsuits hangs overhim. Thus, petitioner urges us to read $ 1983 as giv-ing the officer the same absolute immunity enjoyed bythe prosecutor. Cf. Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409(1976).. . . . .". . . We intend no disrespect to the officer applyingfor a warrant by observing that his action, while a vitalpart of the administration of criminal justice, is furtherremoved from the judicial phase of criminal proceedingsthan the act of a prosecutor in seeking an indictment.Furthermore, petitioner's analogy, while it has someforce, does not take account of the fact that the prosecutor's act in seeking an indictment is but the first stepin the process of seeking a conviction. Exposing theprosecutor to liability for the initial phase of his prosecu-torial work could interfere with his exercise of independent judgment at every phase of his work, since theprosecutor might come to see later decisions in terms oftheir effect on his potential liability. Thus, we shieldthe prosecutor seeking an indictment because any lesserimmunity could impair the performance of a centralactor in the judicial process." 475 U. S., at 341-343.nity. The common law thus affords no support for petitioner." Malleyv. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340-341 (1986) (footnote omitted).522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 522 U. S. 118 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThese cases make it quite clear that petitioner's activities inconnection with the preparation and filing of two of the threecharging documents--the information and the motion for anarrest warrant--are protected by absolute immunity. Indeed, except for her act in personally attesting to the truthof the averments in the certification, it seems equally clearthat the preparation and filing of the third document in thepackage was part of the advocate's function as well. Thecritical question, however, is whether she was acting as acomplaining witness rather than a lawyer when she executedthe certification "[u]nder penalty of perjury." We now turnto that question. IVThe Fourth Amendment requires that arrest warrants bebased "upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation"--a requirement that may be satisfied by an indictmentreturned by a grand jury, but not by the mere filing of criminal charges in an unsworn information signed by the prosecutor. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 117 (1975); see alsoCoolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971). Accordingly, since most prosecutions in Washington are commencedby information, Washington law requires, in compliance withthe constitutional command, that an arrest warrant be sup-ported by either an affidavit "or sworn testimony establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant." 15 The "Certifica-tion for Determination of Probable Cause" executed bypetitioner was designed to satisfy those requirements.Although the law required that document to be sworn orcertified under penalty of perjury, neither federal nor statelaw made it necessary for the prosecutor to make that certification. In doing so, petitioner performed an act that any15 Washington Criminal Rule 2.2(a) (1995) provides:"A warrant of arrest must be supported by an affidavit, . . . or sworntestimony establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. . . . The courtmust determine there is probable cause . . . before issuing the warrant. "522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 KALINA v. FLETCHEROpinion of the Courtcompetent witness might have performed. Even if she mayhave been following a practice that was routinely employedby her colleagues and predecessors in King County, Wash-ington, that practice is surely not prevalent in other parts ofthe country and is not even mandated by law in King County.Neither petitioner noramici argue that prosecutors rou-tinely follow the King County practice.16 Indeed, tradition,as well as the ethics of our profession, generally instructcounsel to avoid the risks associated with participating asboth advocate and witness in the same proceeding.17Nevertheless, petitioner argues that the execution of thecertificate was just one incident in a presentation that,viewed as a whole, was the work of an advocate and wasintegral to the initiation of the prosecution. That character-ization is appropriate for her drafting of the certification, herdetermination that the evidence was sufficiently strong tojustify a probable-cause finding, her decision to file charges,and her presentation of the information and the motion tothe court. Each of those matters involved the exercise ofprofessional judgment; indeed, even the selection of theparticular facts to include in the certification to provide theevidentiary support for the finding of probable cause re-quired the exercise of the judgment of the advocate. Butthat judgment could not affect the truth or falsity of thefactual statements themselves. Testifying about facts is thefunction of the witness, not of the lawyer. No matter how16 Amicus Curiae United States points out that federal prosecutors typically do not personally attest to the facts in an affidavit filed in support ofan application for an arrest warrant, but "[i]nstead a law enforcementagent ordinarily attests to those facts." Brief 7. Amici Curiae ThirtyNine Counties of the State of Washington state that local court rules inonly two counties in Washington require the prosecutor to file an additional document beyond an information. Brief 2.17 See, e. g., Washington Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7 (1995) ("A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer . . . is likely tobe a necessary witness," unless four narrow exceptions apply); ABA ModelRules of Professional Conduct 3.7 (1992).522US1 Unit: $U10 [01-28-00 16:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 522 U. S. 118 (1997)Scalia, J., concurringbrief or succinct it may be, the evidentiary component of anapplication for an arrest warrant is a distinct and essentialpredicate for a finding of probable cause. Even when theperson who makes the constitutionally required "Oath or affirmation" is a lawyer, the only function that she performsin giving sworn testimony is that of a witness.Finally, petitioner argues that denying her absolute immunity will have a "chilling effect" on prosecutors in the admin-istration of justice.18 We are not persuaded.It may well be true that prosecutors in King County mayabandon the practice of routinely attesting to the factsrecited in a "Certification for Determination of ProbableCause" and pattern their procedures after those employed inother parts of the Nation. Petitioner presents no evidencethat the administration of justice is harmed where the KingCounty practice is not followed. In other respects, however,her argument addresses concerns that are not affected byour decision because we merely hold that $ 1983 may providea remedy for respondent insofar as petitioner performed thefunction of a complaining witness. We do not depart fromour prior cases that have recognized that the prosecutor isfully protected by absolute immunity when performing thetraditional functions of an advocate. See Imbler, 424 U. S.,at 431; Buckley, 509 U. S., at 273.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit is
