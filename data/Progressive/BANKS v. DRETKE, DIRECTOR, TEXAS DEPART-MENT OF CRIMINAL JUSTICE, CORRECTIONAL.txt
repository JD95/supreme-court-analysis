App. 361, n. 1; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4 (bothsources' internal quotation marks omitted). Despite thatundertaking, the State withheld evidence that would haveallowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses. The State did not disclose that one of those witnesses was a paid police informant, nor did it disclose apretrial transcript revealing that the other witness' trial testimony had been intensively coached by prosecutors and lawenforcement officers.Furthermore, the prosecution raised no red flag when theinformant testified, untruthfully, that he never gave the police any statement and, indeed, had not talked to any policeofficer about the case until a few days before the trial. Instead of correcting the informant's false statements, theprosecutor told the jury that the witness "ha[d] been openand honest with you in every way," App. 140, and that histestimony was of the "utmost significance," id., at 146. Similarly, the prosecution allowed the other key witness toconvey, untruthfully, that his testimony was entirely unrehearsed. Through direct appeal and state collateral reviewproceedings, the State continued to hold secret the key witnesses' links to the police and allowed their false statementsto stand uncorrected.Ultimately, through discovery and an evidentiary hearingauthorized in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the longsuppressed evidence came to light. The District Courtgranted Banks relief from the death penalty, but the Courtof Appeals reversed. In the latter court's judgment, Bankshad documented his claims of prosecutorial misconduct toolate and in the wrong forum; therefore he did not qualifyfor federal-court relief.

Id., at 8, 141.1 A prelim-inary autopsy revealed that Whitehead had been shot threetimes. Id., at 10. Bowie County Deputy Sheriff WillieHuff, lead investigator of the death, learned from two witnesses that Whitehead had been in the company of peti-tioner, 21-year-old Delma Banks, Jr., late on the evening ofApril 11.

A4 (bothsources' internal quotation marks omitted).The guilt phase of Banks's trial spanned two days in Sep-tember 1980. See Brief for Petitioner 2; App. to Pet. forCert. C3. Witnesses testified to seeing Banks and White-head together on April 11 in Whitehead's green Mustang,and to hearing gunshots in Pocket Park at 4 a.m. on April12. Banks v. State, 643 S. W. 2d, at 131. Charles Cook testified that Banks arrived in Dallas in a green Mustang atabout 8:15 a.m. on April 12, and stayed with Cook until April14. App. 42-43, 47-53. Cook gave the following account ofBanks's visit. On the morning of his arrival, Banks hadblood on his leg and told Cook "he [had] got into it on thehighway with a white boy." Id., at 44. That night, Banksconfessed to having "kill[ed] the white boy for the hell of itand take[n] his car and come to Dallas." Id., at 48. Duringtheir ensuing conversation, Cook first noticed that "[Banks]had a pistol." Id., at 49. Two days later, Banks left Dallasby bus. Id., at 52-53. The next day, Cook abandoned theMustang in West Dallas and sold Banks's gun to a neighbor.Id., at 54. Cook further testified that, shortly before thepolice arrived at his residence to question him, Banks hadrevisited him and requested the gun. Id., at 57.On cross-examination, Cook three times represented thathe had not talked to anyone about his testimony. Id., at 59.In fact, however, Cook had at least one "pretrial practicesessio[n]" at which Huff and prosecutors intensively coachedCook for his appearance on the stand at Banks's trial. Id.,at 325, || 10, 381-390; Joint Lodging Material 1-36 (transcriptof pretrial preparatory session). The prosecution allowedCook's misstatements to stand uncorrected. In its guilt540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN678 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtphase summation, the prosecution told the jury "Cookbrought you absolute truth." App. 84.In addition to Cook, Robert Farr was a key witness forthe prosecution. Corroborating parts of Cook's account,Farr testified to traveling to Dallas with Banks to retrieveBanks's gun. Id., at 34-35. On cross-examination, defensecounsel asked Farr whether he had "ever taken any moneyfrom some police officers," or "give[n] any police officers astatement." Id., at 37-38. Farr answered no to both questions; he asserted emphatically that police officers had notpromised him anything and that he had "talked to no oneabout this [case]" until a few days before trial. Ibid. Theseanswers were untrue, but the State did not correct them.Farr was the paid informant who told Deputy Sheriff Huffthat Banks would travel to Dallas in search of a gun. Id.,at 329; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4, A9. In a 1999 affidavit,Farr explained:"I assumed that if I did not help [Huff] with his investigation of Delma that he would have me arrested for drugcharges. That's why I agreed to help [Huff]. I wasafraid that if I didn't help him, I would be arrested. . . ."Willie Huff asked me to help him find Delma's gun.I told [Huff] that he would have to pay me money rightaway for my help on the case. I think altogether hegave me about $200.00 for helping him. He paid mesome of the money before I set Delma up. He paid methe rest after Delma was arrested and charged withmurder. . . ."In order to help Willie Huff, I had to set Delma up.I told Delma that I wanted to rob a pharmacy to getdrugs and that I needed his gun to do it. I did notreally plan to commit a robbery but I told Delma this sothat he would give me his gun. . . . I convinced Delmato drive to Dallas with me to get the gun."

Banks was convicted of murder committed in thecourse of a robbery, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.$ 19.03(a)(2) (1974). See App. to Pet. for Cert. C3.2The penalty phase ran its course the next day. Ibid.Governed by the Texas statutory capital murder scheme applicable in 1980, the jury decided Banks's sentence by an-swering three "special issues." App. 142-143.3 "If the juryunanimously answer[ed] `yes' to each issue submitted, thetrial court [would be obliged to] sentence the defendant todeath." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 310 (1989) (con-struing Texas' sentencing scheme); Tex. Code Crim. Proc.Ann., Arts. 37.071(c)-(e) (Vernon Supp. 1980). The criticalquestion at the penalty phase in Banks's case was: "Do youfind from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that thereis a probability that the defendant, Delma Banks, Jr., wouldcommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?" App. 143 (internal quotationmarks omitted).On this question, the State offered two witnesses, VetranoJefferson and Robert Farr. Id., at 104-113. Jefferson testi-fied that, in early April 1980, Banks had struck him across2 "A person commits an offense if he commits murder . . . and . . . theperson intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing orattempting to commit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated rape, orarson." Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 19.03(a)(2) (1974).3 As set forth in Texas law, the three special issues were:"(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of thedeceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectationthat the death of the deceased or another would result;"(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society;and"(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant inkilling the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, ifany, by the deceased."

DRETKEOpinion of the Courtthe face with a gun and threatened to kill him. Id., at 104-106. Farr's testimony focused once more on the trip to Dallas to fetch Banks's gun. The gun was needed, Farr asserted, because "[w]e [Farr and Banks] were going to pullsome robberies." Id., at 108. According to Farr, Banks"said he would take care of it" if "there was any troubleduring these burglaries." Id., at 109. When the prosecution asked: "How did [Banks] say he would take care of it?"Farr responded: "[Banks] didn't go into any specifics, but hesaid it would be taken care of." Ibid.On cross-examinati on, defense counsel twice askedwhether Farr had told Deputy Sheriff Huff of the Dallas trip.Ibid. The State remained silent as Farr twice perjuriouslytestified: "No, I did not." Ibid. Banks's counsel also inquired whether Farr had previously attempted to obtain prescription drugs by fraud, and, "up tight over that," would"testify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear." Id., at 110.Farr first responded: "Can you prove it?" Ibid. Instructedby the court to answer defense counsel's questions, Farragain said: "No, I did not . . . ." Ibid.Two defense witnesses impeached Farr, but were, in turn,impeached themselves. James Kelley testified to Farr's attempts to obtain drugs by fraud; the prosecution impeachedKelley by eliciting his close relationship to Banks's girlfriend. Id., at 124-129. Later, Kelley admitted to beingdrunk while on the stand. App. to Pet. for Cert. A13. Former Arkansas police officer Gary Owen testified that Farr,as a police informant in Arkansas, had given false information; the prosecution impeached Owen by bringing out hispending application for employment by defense counsel's private investigator. App. 129-131.Banks's parents and acquaintances testified that Bankswas a "respectful, churchgoing young man." App. to Pet.for Cert. A7; App. 137-139. Thereafter, Banks took thestand. He affirmed that he had "never before been con540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN681Cite as: 540 U. S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courtvicted of a felony." Id., at 134.4 Banks admitted strikingVetrano Jefferson in April 1980, and traveling to Dallas toobtain a gun in late April 1980. Id., at 134-136. He denied,however, any intent to participate in robberies, assertingthat Farr alone had planned to commit them. Id., at 136-137. The prosecution suggested on cross-examination thatBanks had been willing "to supply [Farr] the means and pos-sible death weapon in an armed robbery case."Id., at 137.Banks conceded as much. Ibid.During summation, the prosecution intimated that Bankshad not been wholly truthful in this regard, suggesting that"a man doesn't travel two hundred miles, or whatever thedistance is from here [Texarkana] to Dallas, Texas, to supplya person with a weapon." Id., at 143. The State homed inon Farr's testimony that Banks said he would "take care" ofany trouble arising during the robbery:"[Farr] said, `Man, you know, what i[f] there's trouble?'And [Banks] says, `Don't worry about it. I'll take careof it.' I think that speaks for itself, and I think youknow what that means. . . . I submit to you beyond areasonable doubt that the State has again met its burdenof proof, and that the answer to question number two[propensity to commit violent criminal acts] should alsobe yes."Id., at 140, 144. See also id., at 146-147.Urging Farr's credibility, the prosecution called the jury'sattention to Farr's admission, at trial, that he used narcotics.Id., at 36, 140. Just as Farr had been truthful about hisdrug use, the prosecution suggested, he was also "open andhonest with [the jury] in every way" in his penalty-phasetestimony.Id., at 140. Farr's testimony, the prosecutionemphasized, was "of the utmost significance" because it4 Banks, in fact, had no criminal record at all. App. 255, || 115; App. toPet. for Cert. C23. He also "had no history of violence or alcohol abuseand seemed to possess a self-control that would suggest no particular riskof future violence."

Banks's effort to impeach Farr was ineffective,the prosecution further urged, because defense witness "Kelley kn[ew] nothing about the murder," and defense witnessOwen "wish[ed] to please his future employers." Id., at 148.The jury answered yes to the three special issues, and thejudge sentenced Banks to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Banks's direct appeal. 643 S. W. 2d, at135. Banks's first two state postconviction motions raisedissues not implicated here; both were denied. Ex parteBanks, No. 13568-01 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984); Ex parteBanks, 769 S. W. 2d 539, 540 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).Banks's third state postconviction motion, filed January 13,1992, presented questions later advanced in federal court andreiterated in the petition now before us. App. 150. Banksalleged "upon information and belief " that "the prosecutionknowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence as required by [Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.

App. 180, || 114 (internal quotation marks omitted).In support of this third state-court postconviction plea,Banks attached an unsigned affidavit from his girlfriend,Farr's sister-in-law Demetra Jefferson, which stated thatFarr "was well-connected to law enforcement people," andconsequently managed to stay out of "trouble" for illegallyobtaining prescription drugs. Id., at 195, || 7. Banks alleged as well that during the guilt phase of his trial, theState deliberately withheld information "critical to the jury'sassessment of Cook's credibility," including the "generous5 Brady v.

Thesuperintending Magistrate Judge allowed limited discoveryregarding Cook, but found insufficient justification for inquir-ies concerning Farr.Id., at 294-295.Banks renewed his discovery and evidentiary hearing requests in February 1999. Id., at 2, 300-331. This time,he proffered affidavits from both Farr and Cook to back uphis claims that, as to each of these two key witnesses, theprosecution had wrongly withheld crucial exculpatory andimpeaching evidence.

Brief for Petitioner 37-38;Tr. of June 7-8, 1999, Federal Evidentiary Hearing (EDTex.), p. 30 (hereinafter Federal Evidentiary Hearing).One item lodged in the District Attorney's files, turnedover to Banks pursuant to the Magistrate Judge's disclosureorder, was a 74-page transcript of a Cook interrogation.App. to Pet. for Cert. A10. The interrogation, conductedby Bowie County law enforcement officials and prosecutors,occurred in September 1980, shortly before the Banks trial.Ibid. The transcript revealed that the State's representatives had closely rehearsed Cook's testimony. In particular,the officials told Cook how to reconcile his testimony withaffidavits to which he had earlier subscribed recountingBanks's visits to Dallas. See, e. g., Joint Lodging Material24 ("Your [April 1980] statement is obviously screwedup."); id., at 26 ("[T]he way this statement should read isthat . . . ."); id., at 32 ("[L]et me tell you how this is going towork."); id., at 36 ("That's not in your [earlier] statement.").Although the transcript did not bear on Banks's claim thatthe prosecution had a deal with Cook, it provided compellingevidence that Cook's testimony had been tutored by Banks'sprosecutors. Without objection at the hearing, the Magistrate Judge admitted the September 1980 transcript into evidence.

Id., at65-68. In a posthearing brief and again in proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Banks emphasized thesuppression of the September 1980 transcript, noting theprosecution's obligation to disclose material, exculpatory evidence, and the assurance in this case that Banks would re-ceive "all [the] discovery to which [Banks was] entitled."App. 360-361, and n. 1, 378-379 (internal quotation marksomitted);supra, at 677.In a May 11, 2000, report and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommended a writ of habeas corpus withrespect to Banks's death sentence, but not his conviction.App. to Pet. for Cert. C54. "[T]he State's failure to discloseFarr's informant status, coupled with trial counsel's dismalperformance during the punishment phase," the MagistrateJudge concluded, "undermined the reliability of the jury'sverdict regarding punishment." Id., at C44. Finding noconvincing evidence of a deal between the State and Cook,however, she recommended that the guilt-phase verdict remain undisturbed. Id., at C46.Banks moved to alter or amend the Magistrate Judge'sreport on the ground that it left unresolved a fully airedquestion, i. e., whether Banks's rights were violated by theState's failure to disclose to the defense the prosecution'seve-of-trial interrogation of Cook. App. 398. That interrogation, Banks observed, could not be reconciled with Cook'sinsistence at trial that he had talked to no one about histestimony. Id., at 400, n. 17; see supra, at 677.The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's reportand denied Banks's motion to amend the report. App. toPet. for Cert. B6; App. 421-424.

When the transcript surfaced inresponse to the Magistrate Judge's 1999 disclosure order,Banks raised that newly discovered, long withheld documentin his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and,again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge's report.Id., at 423. The District Court concluded, however, thatBanks had not properly pleaded a Brady claim predicated onthe withheld Cook rehearsal transcript. App. 422. WhenthatBrady claim came to light, the District Court reasoned,Banks should have moved to amend or supplement his 1996federal habeas petition specifically to include the 1999 discovery as a basis for relief. App. 423. Banks urged that aBrady claim based on the September 1980 transcript hadbeen aired by implied consent; under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 15(b), he contended, the claim should have beentreated as if raised in the pleadings. App. 433.8 Bankssought, and the District Court denied, a certificate of appealability on this question. Id., at 433, 436.In an August 20, 2003, unpublished per curiam opinion,the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court to the extent that it granted reliefon the Farr Brady claim and denied a certificate of appealability on the Cook Brady claim.

Rule 11 of the RulesGoverning Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts provides that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply "to the extent thatthey are not inconsistent with [habeas] rules."9 The Fifth Circuit noted correctly that under Lindh v.

App. to Pet.for Cert. A19-A20. For that reason, the court held, the evidentiary proceeding ordered by the Magistrate Judge wasunwarranted.Ibid. The Court of Appeals expressed nodoubt that the prosecution had suppressed, prior to the federal habeas proceeding, Farr's informant status and his partin the fateful trip to Dallas. But Banks was not appropriately diligent in pursuing his state-court application, theCourt of Appeals maintained. In the Fifth Circuit's view,Banks should have at that time attempted to locate Farr andquestion him; similarly, he should have asked to interviewDeputy Sheriff Huff and other officers involved in investigating the crime. Id., at A19, A22. If such efforts had provedunavailing, the Court of Appeals suggested, Banks mighthave applied to the state court for assistance. Id., at A19.Banks's lack of diligence in pursuing his 1992 state-courtplea, the Court of Appeals concluded, rendered the evidenceuncovered in the federal habeas proceeding procedurallybarred. Id., at A22-A23.In any event, the Fifth Circuit further concluded, Farr'sstatus as an informant was not "materia[l]" for Brady purposes. App. to Pet. for Cert. A32-A33. Banks had impeached Farr at trial by bringing out that he had been apolice informant in Arkansas, and an unreliable one at that.Id., at A28, A32-A33; supra, at 680.

Turn-ing to the tenability of those claims, we consider first Banks'sFarr Brady claim as it trains on his death sentence, see App.to Pet. for Cert. B6 (District Court granted habeas solelywith respect to the capital sentence), and next, Banks's CookBrady claim.10 Our disposition of the Farr Brady claim, and our conclusion that a writof habeas corpus should issue with respect to the death sentence, renderit unnecessary to address Banks's claim of ineffective assistance of counselat the penalty phase; any relief he could obtain on that claim would becumulative.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN690 BANKS v.

Lundy,455 U. S. 509, 520 (1982). Banks alleged in his January 1992state-court application for a writ of habeas corpus that theprosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence involving Farr in violation of Banks's due processrights. App. 180. Banks thus satisfied the exhaustion requirement as to the legal ground for his Farr Brady claim.11In state postconviction court, however, Banks failed toproduce evidence establishing that Farr had served as a police informant in this case. As support for his Farr Bradyclaim, Banks appended to his state-court application only Demetra Jefferson's hardly probative statement that Farr "waswell-connected to law enforcement people." App. 195, || 7;see supra, at 682. In the federal habeas forum, therefore,it was incumbent on Banks to show that he was not barred,by reason of the anterior state proceedings, from producing evidence to substantiate his Farr Brady claim. Banks"[would be] entitled to an evidentiary hearing [in federalcourt] if he [could] show cause for his failure to develop the11 Banks's federal habeas petition, the Court of Appeals said, stated aclaim, only under Brady, that material exculpatory or impeachment evidence had been suppressed, not a claim under Napue v.

In its view, the Court of Appeals explained, aBrady claim is distinct from a Giglio claim, App. to Pet. for Cert. A30;thus the two did not fit under one umbrella. But cf. United States v.Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 679-680, n. 8 (1985); United States v. Agurs, 427U. S. 97, 103-104 (1976). On brief, the parties debate the issue. Brief forPetitioner 23-25; Brief for Respondent 21-22, n. 21. Because we concludethat Banks qualifies for relief under Brady, we need not decide whether aGiglio claim, to warrant adjudication, must be separately pleaded.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN691Cite as: 540 U.

S.1, 11 (1992).Brady, we reiterate, held that "the suppression by theprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon requestviolates due process where the evidence is material either toguilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or badfaith of the prosecution." 373 U. S., at 87. We set out inStrickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281-282 (1999), the threecomponents or essential elements of a Brady prosecutorialmisconduct claim: "The evidence at issue must be favorableto the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because itis impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed bythe State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudicemust have ensued." 527 U. S., at 281-282. "[C]ause andprejudice" in this case "parallel two of the three componentsof the alleged Brady violation itself." Id., at 282. Corresponding to the second Brady component (evidence suppressed by the State), a petitioner shows "cause" when thereason for his failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the State's suppression of the relevant evidence;coincident with the third Brady component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the "cause and prejudice" requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is "material"for Brady purposes. 527 U. S., at 282. As to the firstBrady component (evidence favorable to the accused), beyond genuine debate, the suppressed evidence relevant here,Farr's paid informant status, qualifies as evidence advantageous to Banks. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A26 (Court ofAppeals' recognition that "Farr's being a paid informantwould certainly be favorable to Banks in attacking Farr'stestimony"). Thus, if Banks succeeds in demonstrating"cause and prejudice," he will at the same time succeed inestablishing the elements of his Farr Brady death penaltydue process claim.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN692 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the CourtBOur determination as to "cause" for Banks's failure to de-velop the facts in state-court proceedings is informed byStrickler.12 In that case, Virginia prosecutors told the peti-tioner, prior to trial, that "the prosecutor's files were opento the petitioner's counsel," thus "there was no need fora formal[Brady] motion." 527 U. S., at 276, n. 14 (quot-ing App. in Strickler v. Greene, O. T. 1998, No. 98-5864,pp. 212-213 (brackets in original)). The prosecution filegiven to the Strickler petitioner, however, did not includeseveral documents prepared by an "importan[t]" prosecutionwitness, recounting the witness' initial difficulty recallingthe events to which she testified at the petitioner's trial.527 U. S., at 273-275, 290. Those absent-from-the-file documents could have been used to impeach the witness. Id., at273. In state-court postconviction proceedings, theStrick-ler petitioner had unsuccessfully urged ineffective assistanceof trial counsel based on counsel's failure to move, pretrial,for Brady material. Answering that plea, the State asserted that a Brady motion would have been superfluous, forthe prosecution had maintained an open file policy pursuantto which it had disclosed all Brady material. 527 U. S., at276, n. 14, 278.This Court determined that in the federal habeas proceed-ings, theStrickler petitioner had shown cause for his failureto raise a Brady claim in state court. 527 U. S., at 289.Three factors accounted for that determination:"(a) the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence;(b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution's openfile policy as fulfilling the prosecution's duty to disclosesuch evidence; and (c) the [State] confirmed petitioner'sreliance on the open file policy by asserting during state12 Surprisingly, the Court of Appeals' per curiam opinion did not referto Strickler v.

S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courthabeas proceedings that petitioner had already receivedeverything known to the government." Ibid. (internalquotation marks omitted).13This case is congruent with Strickler in all three respects.First, the State knew of, but kept back, Farr's arrangementwith Deputy Sheriff Huff. App. to Pet. for Cert. C43; Tr. ofOral Arg. 33; cf. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 437 (1995)(prosecutors are responsible for "any favorable evidenceknown to the others acting on the government's behalf in thecase, including the police"). Second, the State asserted, onthe eve of trial, that it would disclose all Brady material.App. 361, n. 1; see supra, at 677. As Strickler instructs,Banks cannot be faulted for relying on that representation.See 527 U. S., at 283-284 (an "open file policy" is one factorthat "explain[s] why trial counsel did not advance [a Brady]claim").Third, in his January 1992 state habeas application, Banksasserted that Farr was a police informant and Banks's arrest,"a set-up." App. 180, || 114 (internal quotation marks omitted). In its answer, the State denied Banks's assertion.Id., at 234; see supra, at 683. The State thereby "confirmed" Banks's reliance on the prosecution's representationthat it had fully disclosed all relevant information its filecontained. 527 U. S., at 289; see id., at 284 (state habeascounsel, as well as trial counsel, could reasonably rely on theState's representations). In short, because the State persisted in hiding Farr's informant status and misleadinglyrepresented that it had complied in full with its Brady disclosure obligations, Banks had cause for failing to investigate,in state postconviction proceedings, Farr's connections toDeputy Sheriff Huff.13 We left open the question "whether any one or two of these factorswould be sufficient to constitute cause." Strickler, 527 U. S., at 289. Weneed not decide that question today.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN694 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the CourtOn the question of "cause," moreover, Banks's case isstronger than was the petitioner's inStrickler in a notablerespect. As a prosecution witness in the guilt and penaltyphases of Banks's trial, Farr repeatedly misrepresented hisdealings with police; each time Farr responded untruthfully,the prosecution allowed his testimony to stand uncorrected.See supra, at 678-680. Farr denied taking money from orbeing promised anything by police officers, App. 37; he twicedenied speaking with police officers,id., at 38, and twice denied informing Deputy Sheriff Huff about Banks's trip toDallas,id., at 109. It has long been established that theprosecution's "deliberate deception of a court and jurors bythe presentation of known false evidence is incompatiblewith rudimentary demands of justice." Giglio v. UnitedStates, 405 U. S. 150, 153 (1972) (quoting Mooney v. Holohan,294 U. S. 103, 112 (1935) (per curiam) (internal quotationmarks omitted)). If it was reasonable for Banks to rely onthe prosecution's full disclosure representation, it was alsoappropriate for Banks to assume that his prosecutors wouldnot stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospectsfor gaining a conviction. See Berger v. United States, 295U. S. 78, 88 (1935); Strickler, 527 U. S., at 284.14The State presents three main arguments for distinguishing Strickler on the issue of "cause," two of them endorsed14 In addition, Banks could have expected disclosure of Farr's informantstatus as a matter of state law if Farr in fact acted in that capacity.Under Texas law applicable at the time of Banks's trial, the State had anobligation to disclose the identity of an informant when "the informant . . .was present at the time of the offense or arrest . . . [or] was otherwiseshown to be a material witness to the transaction . . . ." Kemner v. State,589 S. W. 2d 403, 408 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979) (quoting Carmouche v. State,540 S. W. 2d 701, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976)); cf. Tex. Rule Evid. 508(c)(1)(2003) ("No privilege exists [for the identity of an informer] . . . if theinformer appears as a witness for the public entity."). Farr was presentwhen Banks was arrested. App. 443, || 10. Further, as the prosecutionnoted in its penalty-phase summation, Farr's testimony was not only material, but "of the utmost significance." Id., at 146.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN695Cite as: 540 U. S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courtby the Court of Appeals. Brief for Respondent 15-20; App.to Pet. for Cert. A19, A22-A23; see supra, at 687-688. Weconclude that none of these arguments accounts adequatelyfor the State's concealment and misrepresentation regardingFarr's link to Deputy Sheriff Huff. The State first suggeststhat Banks's failure, during state postconviction proceedings,to "attempt to locate Farr and ascertain his true status," orto "interview the investigating officers, such as Deputy Huff,to ascertain Farr's status," undermines a finding of cause;the Fifth Circuit agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. A22; Brieffor Respondent 18-20. In the State's view, "[t]he question[of cause] revolves around Banks's conduct," particularly hislack of appropriate diligence in pursuing the FarrBradyclaim before resorting to federal court. Brief for Respond-ent 14.15We rejected a similar argument in Strickler. There, theState contended that examination of a witness' trial testimony, alongside a letter the witness published in a localnewspaper, should have alerted the petitioner to the exist-ence of undisclosed interviews of the witness by the police.527 U. S., at 284, and n. 26. We found this contention insub-stantial. In light of the State's open file policy, we noted, "itis especially unlikely that counsel would have suspected thatadditional impeaching evidence was being withheld."Id.,at 285. Our decisions lend no support to the notion thatdefendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosedBrady material when the prosecution represents that all such materialhas been disclosed. As we observed inStrickler, defensecounsel has no "procedural obligation to assert constitutionalerror on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial15 The Court of Appeals also stated that, because "the State did notrespond" to Banks's "Farr-was-an-informant contention" in its answer tothe January 1992 state habeas application, Banks should have "furtherinvestigate[d]." App. to Pet. for Cert. A22. The Fifth Circuit's error inthis regard is apparent. As earlier recounted, see supra, at 683, theState's answer indeed did deny Banks's allegation.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN696 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtmisstep may have occurred." 527 U. S., at 286-287. The"cause" inquiry, we have also observed, turns on events orcircumstances "external to the defense." Amadeo v. Zant,486 U. S. 214, 222 (1988) (quotingMurray v. Carrier, 477U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).The State here nevertheless urges, in effect, that "theprosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has theburden to . . . discover the evidence," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35, solong as the "potential existence" of a prosecutorial misconduct claim might have been detected, id., at 36. A rule thusdeclaring "prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek," is nottenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process. "Ordinarily, we presume that public officials have properly discharged their official duties." Bracyv. Gramley, 520 U. S. 899, 909 (1997) (quoting United Statesv. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have several timesunderscored the "special role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials." Strickler,527 U. S., at 281; accord Kyles, 514 U. S., at 439-440; UnitedStates v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 675, n. 6 (1985); Berger, 295U. S., at 88. See also Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S.438, 484 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Courts, litigants,and juries properly anticipate that "obligations [to refrainfrom improper methods to secure a conviction] . . . plainlyrest[ing] upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfullyobserved." Berger, 295 U. S., at 88. Prosecutors' dishonest conduct or unwarranted concealment should attract nojudicial approbation. See Kyles, 514 U. S., at 440 ("Theprudence of the careful prosecutor should not . . . bediscouraged.").The State's second argument is a variant of the first. Specifically, the State argues, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that Banks cannot show cause because in the 1992state-court postconviction proceedings, he failed to move forinvestigative assistance enabling him to inquire into Farr's540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN697Cite as: 540 U. S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courtpolice connections, connections he then alleged, but failed toprove. Brief for Respondent 15-16; App. to Pet. for Cert.A19; see 1977 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 789, $ 2(d) (as amended)(instructing postconviction court to "designat[e] the issues offact to be resolved," and giving the court discretion to "orderaffidavits, depositions, interrogatories, and hearings").Armed in 1992 only with Demetra Jefferson's declarationthat Farr was "well-connected to law enforcement people,"App. 195, || 7; see supra, at 682, Banks had little to profferin support of a request for assistance from the state postconviction court. We assign no overriding significance toBanks's failure to invoke state-court assistance to which hehad no clear entitlement. Cf.Strickler, 527 U. S., at 286("Proper respect for state procedures counsels against a re-quirement that all possible claims be raised in state collateralproceedings, even when no known facts support them.").16Finally, relying onRoviaro v. United States, 353 U. S. 53(1957), the State asserts that "disclosure [of an informant'sidentity] is not automatic," and, "[c]onsequently, it wasBanks's duty to move for disclosure of otherwise privilegedmaterial." Brief for Respondent 17-18, n. 15. We need notlinger over this argument. The issue of evidentiary law inRoviaro was whether (or when) the Government is obligedto reveal the identity of an undercover informer the Government does not call as a trial witness. 353 U. S., at 55-56.The Court there stated that no privilege obtains "[w]herethe disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the contents ofhis communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense ofan accused." Id., at 60-61. Accordingly, even though theinformer inRoviaro did not testify, we held that disclosure16 Furthermore, rather than conceding the need for factual developmentof the Farr Brady claim in state postconviction court, the State assertedthat Banks's prosecutorial misconduct claims were meritless and procedurally barred in that tribunal. App. 234, 240. Having taken that positionin 1992, the State can hardly fault Banks now for failing earlier to requestassistance the State certainly would have opposed.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN698 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtof his identity was necessary because he could have "ampli-f[ied] or contradict[ed] the testimony of government witnesses." Id., at 64.Here, the State elected to call Farr as a witness. Indeed,he was a key witness at both guilt and punishment phases ofBanks's capital trial. Farr's status as a paid informant wasunquestionably "relevant"; similarly beyond doubt, disclo-sure of Farr's status would have been "helpful to [Banks's]defense." Id., at 60-61. Nothing in Roviaro, or any otherdecision of this Court, suggests that the State can examinean informant at trial, withholding acknowledgment of his in-formant status in the hope that defendant will not catch on,so will make no disclosure motion.In summary, Banks's prosecutors represented at trial andin state postconviction proceedings that the State had heldnothing back. Moreover, in state postconviction court, theState's pleading denied that Farr was an informant. App.234;supra, at 683. It was not incumbent on Banks to provethese representations false; rather, Banks was entitled totreat the prosecutor's submissions as truthful. Accordingly,Banks has shown cause for failing to present evidence instate court capable of substantiating his Farr Brady claim.CUnless suppressed evidence is "material for Brady pur-poses, [its] suppression [does] not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome [a] procedural default." Strickler, 527U. S., at 282 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our touchstone on materiality is Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419 (1995).Kyles instructed that the materiality standard for Bradyclaims is met when "the favorable evidence could reasonablybe taken to put the whole case in such a different light asto undermine confidence in the verdict." 514 U. S., at 435.See also id., at 434-435 ("A defendant need not demonstratethat after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of theundisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN699Cite as: 540 U. S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto convict."); accord Strickler, 527 U. S., at 290. In short,Banks must show a "reasonable probability of a differentresult." Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434 (internal quotation marksomitted) (citingBagley, 473 U. S., at 678).As the State acknowledged at oral argument, Farr was"paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to the indictment." Tr. of Oral Arg. 34. Farr's declaration, presentedto the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks,initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate the commission of robberies. See App. 442-443, |||| 7-8; supra, at678. Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Sheriff Huff 'srequest, the Dallas excursion to fetch Banks's gun, the pros-ecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banksplanned to "continue" committing violent acts. App. 147.17Farr's admission of his instigating role, moreover, wouldhave dampened the prosecution's zeal in urging the jury tobear in mind Banks's "planning and acquisition of a gun tocommit robbery," or Banks's "planned violence." Ibid.; seeTr. of Oral Arg. 50.1817 It bears reiteration here that Banks had no criminal record, id., at255, || 115, "no history of violence or alcohol abuse," nothing indicative of"[any] particular risk of future violence," App. to Pet. for Cert. C23.It also appears that the remaining prosecution witness in the penaltyphase, Vetrano Jefferson, had omitted crucial details from his 1980 testimony. In his September 1980 testimony, Vetrano Jefferson said thatBanks had struck him with a pistol in early April 1980. App. 104-105;supra, at 679-680. In the federal habeas proceeding, Vetrano Jeffersonelaborated that he, not Banks, had initiated that incident by making "disrespectful comments" about Demetra Jefferson, Banks's girlfriend. App.337, || 4. Vetrano Jefferson recounted that he "grew angry" when Banksobjected to the comments, and only then did a fight ensue, in the courseof which Banks struck Vetrano Jefferson. Ibid.18 On brief and at oral argument, the State suggests that "the damagingevidence was Banks's willing abetment of Farr's commission of a violentcrime, not Banks's own intent to commit such an act." Brief for Respondent 25 (emphasis in original); Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. See also post, at 707-708(Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In the penaltyphase summation, however, the prosecution highlighted Banks's propen540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN700 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the CourtBecause Banks had no criminal record, Farr's testimonyabout Banks's propensity to commit violent acts was crucialto the prosecution. Without that testimony, the State couldnot have underscored, as it did three times in the penaltyphase, that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to"take care" of trouble arising during the robberies. App.140, 144, 146-147; see supra, at 681. The stress placed bythe prosecution on this part of Farr's testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the State's suggestion that"Farr's testimony was adequately corroborated." Brief forRespondent 22-25. The prosecution's penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance theState attached to Farr's testimony. What Farr told the jury,the prosecution urged, was "of the utmost significance" toshow "[Banks] is a danger to friends and strangers, alike."App. 146.In Strickler, 527 U. S., at 289, although the Court found"cause" for the petitioner's procedural default of a Bradyclaim, it found the requisite "prejudice" absent, 527 U. S.,at 292-296. Regarding "prejudice," the contrast betweenStrickler and Banks's case is marked. The witness whoseimpeachment was at issue in Strickler gave testimony thatwas in the main cumulative, id., at 292, and hardly significantsity to commit violent criminal acts, see App. 140, 144, 146-147, not hisfacilitation of others' criminal acts, see id., at 141 ("[Banks] says, `I thoughtI would give [the gun] to them so they could do the robberies.' I don'tbelieve you [the jury] believe that."); id., at 143 ("a man doesn't travel twohundred miles . . . to supply [another] person with a weapon"). The special issue the prosecution addressed focused on what acts Banks wouldcommit, not what harms he might facilitate: "Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant, Delma Banks, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence thatwould constitute a continuing threat to society?" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added). It is therefore unsurprisingthat the prosecution did not rest on Banks's facilitation of others' criminalacts in urging the jury to answer the second special issue (propensity tocommit violent criminal acts) in the affirmative.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN701Cite as: 540 U. S. 668 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto one of the "two predicates for capital murder: [armed]robbery,"id., at 294. Other evidence in the record, theCourt found, provided strong support for the conviction evenif the witness' testimony had been excluded entirely: Unlikethe Banks prosecution, in Strickler, "considerable forensicand other physical evidence link[ed] [the defendant] to thecrime" and supported the capital murder conviction. Id., at293. Most tellingly, the witness' testimony in Strickler "didnot relate to [the petitioner's] eligibility for the death sentence"; it "was not relied upon by the prosecution at all dur-ing its closing argument at the penalty phase."Id., at 295.In contrast, Farr's testimony was the centerpiece of Banks'sprosecution's penalty-phase case.Farr's trial testimony, critical at the penalty phase, wascast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding. See supra, at 678, 684. In the guilt phase ofBanks's trial, Farr had acknowledged his narcotics use.App. 36. In the penalty phase, Banks's counsel asked Farrif, "drawn up tight over" previous drug-related activity, hewould "testify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear"; Farrdenied this. Id., at 110; supra, at 680. Farr's declarationsupporting Banks's federal habeas petition, however, vividlycontradicts that denial: "I assumed that if I did not help[Huff] . . . he would have me arrested for drug charges."App. 442, || 6. Had jurors known of Farr's continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Sheriff Huff 's favor, in addition tohis receipt of funds to "set [Banks] up," id., at 442, || 7, theymight well have distrusted Farr's testimony, and, insofar asit was uncorroborated, disregarded it.The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truthpromoting precautions that generally accompany the testimony of informants. This Court has long recognized the"serious questions of credibility" informers pose. On Lee v.United States, 343 U. S. 747, 757 (1952).

J. 1381, 1385 (1996) ("Jurors suspect[informants'] motives from the moment they hear about themin a case, and they frequently disregard their testimony alto-gether as highly untrustworthy and unreliable . . . ."). Wehave therefore allowed defendants "broad latitude to probe[informants'] credibility by cross-examination" and havecounseled submission of the credibility issue to the jury"with careful instructions." On Lee, 343 U. S., at 757; accordHoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293, 311-312 (1966). Seealso 1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Prac-tice and Instructions, Criminal $ 15.02 (5th ed. 2000) ( juryinstructions from the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth,Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits on special caution appropriatein assessing informant testimony).The State argues that "Farr was heavily impeached [attrial]," rendering his informant status "merely cumulative."Tr. of Oral Arg. 49; see Brief for Respondent 26-28; post, at709, n. 3. The record suggests otherwise. Neither witnesscalled to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant toFarr's part in Banks's trial. App. 124-133; id., at 129 (prosecutor noted that Kelley lacked "personal knowledge withregard to this case on trial"). The impeaching witnesses,Kelley and Owen, moreover, were themselves impeached, asthe prosecution stressed on summation. See id., at 141, 148;supra, at 680, 682. Further, the prosecution turned to itsadvantage remaining impeachment evidence concerningFarr's drug use. On summation, the prosecution suggestedthat Farr's admission "that he used dope, that he shot," demonstrated that Farr had been "open and honest with [thejury] in every way." App. 140; supra, at 681.At least as to the penalty phase, in sum, one can hardly beconfident that Banks received a fair trial, given the jury'signorance of Farr's true role in the investigation and trial ofthe case. See Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434 ("The question is notwhether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN703Cite as: 540 U.

On the recordbefore us, one could not plausibly deny the existence of therequisite "reasonable probability of a different result" hadthe suppressed information been disclosed to the defense.Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Bagley, 473U. S., at 678); Strickler, 527 U. S., at 290. Accordingly, as tothe suppression of Farr's informant status and its bearing on"the reliability of the jury's verdict regarding punishment,"App. to Pet. for Cert. C44;supra, at 686, all three elementsof a Brady claim are satisfied.IIIBoth the District Court and the Court of Appeals deniedBanks a certificate of appealability with regard to his CookBrady claim, which rested on the prosecution's suppressionof the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript. App.422-423; App. to Pet. for Cert. A52, A78; supra, at 687, 689.See also Joint Lodging Material 1-36. The District Courtand the Fifth Circuit concluded that Banks had not properlypleaded this claim because he had not sought leave to amendhis petition, but had stated the claim only in other submis-sions, i. e., in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions oflaw, and, again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge'sreport. App. 422-423, 432-433; App. to Pet. for Cert. A51-A52; supra, at 687, 689. Banks contended, unsuccessfully,that evidence substantiating the CookBrady claim had beenaired before the Magistrate Judge; therefore the claimshould have been treated as if raised in the pleadings, asFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) instructs. See App.to Pet. for Cert. A51-A52; supra, at 687, n. 8 (setting outtext of Rule 15(b)). The Fifth Circuit stated its position onthis point somewhat obliquely, but appears to have viewedRule 15(b) as inapplicable in habeas proceedings; the Statenow concedes, however, that the question whether Rule 15(b)extends to habeas proceedings is one "jurists of reason would540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN704 BANKS v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtfind . . . debatable." Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. A52(quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000)), withTr. of Oral Arg. 45-46. We conclude that a certificate ofappealability should have issued.We have twice before referenced Rule 15(b)'s applicationin federal habeas proceedings. In Harris v. Nelson, 394U. S. 286, 294, n. 5 (1969), we noted that Rule 15(b)'s usein habeas proceedings is "noncontroversial." InWithrow v.Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 696, and n. 7 (1993), we similarlyassumed Rule 15(b)'s application to habeas petitions. There,however, the District Court had granted a writ of habeascorpus on a claim neither pleaded, considered at "an eviden-tiary hearing," nor "even argu[ed]" by the parties. Id., at695. Given those circumstances, we held that there hadbeen no trial of the claim by implied consent; the respondentwarden, we observed, "was manifestly prejudiced by the Dis-trict Court's failure to afford her an opportunity to presentevidence bearing on th[e] claim's resolution." Id., at 696.Here, in contrast, the issue of the undisclosed Cook interrogation transcript was indeed aired before the MagistrateJudge, and the transcript itself was admitted into evidencewithout objection. See supra, at 685.19The Court of Appeals found no authority for equating "anevidentiary hearing . . . with a trial" for Rule 15(b) purposes.App. to Pet. for Cert. A52. We see no reason why an evidentiary hearing should not qualify so long as the respondentgave "any sort of consent" and had a full and fair "opportu19 See Federal Evidentiary Hearing 56-73. Examining one of Banks'sprosecutors, counsel for Banks twice asked if Cook had been "instructed. . . on how to testify." Id., at 56. See also id., at 63-64 ("Texarkana lawenforcement did not instruct Mr. Cook how to testify in this case. Is thatyour testimony today?"). To show that Cook had been coached, Banks'scounsel called attention to discrepancies between portions of the September 1980 transcript and Cook's trial testimony. Id., at 65-68. Concluding his examination, Banks's counsel emphasized the prosecution's duty todisclose the September 1980 transcript once Cook, while on the stand,stated that he had not been coached. Id., at 73-74; App. 59; supra, at 677.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN705Cite as: 540 U.

Nor do we find convincing theFifth Circuit's view that applying Rule 15(b) in habeas pro-ceedings would undermine the State's exhaustion and procedural default defenses. Ibid. Under pre-AEDPA law,there was no inconsistency between Rule 15(b) and thosedefenses. That is doubtless why this Court's pre-AEDPAcases assumed Rule 15(b)'s application in habeas proceedings. See ibid.; Harris, 394 U. S., at 294, n. 5.20 We note inthis regard that, while AEDPA forbids a finding that exhaustion has been waived unless the State expressly waives therequirement, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(3), under pre-AEDPA law,exhaustion and procedural default defenses could be waivedbased on the State's litigation conduct. SeeGray v. Nether-land, 518 U. S. 152, 166 (1996) (failure to raise proceduraldefault in federal habeas court means the defense is lost);Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 135 (1987) ("if a full trialhas been held in the district court and it is evident that amiscarriage of justice has occurred, it may . . . be appropriatefor the court of appeals to hold that the nonexhaustion de-fense has been waived").To obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must"demonstrat[e] that jurists of reason could disagree with thedistrict court's resolution of his constitutional claims or thatjurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate todeserve encouragement to proceed further." Miller-El v.Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 327 (2003). At least as to the appli-cation of Rule 15(b), this case surely fits that description. Acertificate of appealability, therefore, should have issued.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the20 Banks's case provides no occasion to consider Rule 15(b)'s applicationunder the AEDPA regime.540US2 Unit: $U23 [10-28-05 16:16:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN706 BANKS v.
