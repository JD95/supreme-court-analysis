An amendment to a Texas statute that went into effect onSeptember 1, 1993, authorized conviction of certain sexualoffenses on the victim's testimony alone. The previous stat-ute required the victim's testimony plus other corroboratingevidence to convict the offender. The question presentedis whether that amendment may be applied in a trial foroffenses committed before the amendment's effective datewithout violating the constitutional prohibition against state"ex post facto" laws. IIn 1996, a Texas grand jury returned a 15-count indictmentcharging petitioner with various sexual offenses against hisstepdaughter. The alleged conduct took place over morethan four years, from February 1991 to March 1995, whenthe victim was 12 to 16 years old. The conduct ceased afterthe victim told her mother what had happened. Petitionerwas convicted on all 15 counts. The two most serious countscharged him with aggravated sexual assault, and petitionerwas sentenced to life imprisonment on those two counts.*Robert P. Marcovitch and Barbara Bergman filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urgingreversal.A brief of amici curiae urging affirmance was filed for the State ofKansas et al. by Carla J.

S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFor each of the other 13 offenses (5 counts of sexual assaultand 8 counts of indecency with a child), petitioner receivedconcurrent sentences of 20 years.Until September 1, 1993, the following statute was in effect in Texas:"A conviction under Chapter 21, Section 22.011, orSection 22.021, Penal Code, is supportable on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim of the sexual of-fense if the victim informed any person, other thanthe defendant, of the alleged offense within six monthsafter the date on which the offense is alleged to haveoccurred. The requirement that the victim inform an-other person of an alleged offense does not apply if thevictim was younger than 14 years of age at the time ofthe alleged offense." Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.38.07 (Vernon 1983).1We emphasize three features of this law that are critical topetitioner's case.The first is the so-called "outcry or corroboration" require-ment. Under that provision, a victim's testimony can support a conviction for the specified offenses only if (1) thattestimony is corroborated by other evidence, or (2) the victiminformed another person of the offense within six monthsof its occurrence (an "outcry"). The second feature is the"child victim" provision, which is an exception to the outcryor corroboration requirement. According to this provision,if the victim was under 14 years old at the time of the allegedoffense, the outcry or corroboration requirement does notapply and the victim's testimony alone can support a con-viction--even without any corroborating evidence or outcry.The third feature is that Article 38.07 establishes a suffi1 The chapter and sections to which this statute refers cover all thecharges contained in the 15-count indictment against petitioner. Chapter21 includes the offense of indecency with a child; $ 22.011 covers sexualassault; $ 22.021 criminalizes aggravated sexual assault.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN518 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courtciency of the evidence rule respecting the minimum quantumof evidence necessary to sustain a conviction. If the statute's requirements are not met (for example, by introducingonly the uncorroborated testimony of a 15-year-old victimwho did not make a timely outcry), a defendant cannot beconvicted, and the court must enter a judgment of acquittal.See Leday v. State, 983 S. W. 2d 713, 725 (Tex. Crim. App.1998);Scoggan v. State, 799 S. W. 2d 679, 683 (Tex. Crim.App. 1990). Conversely, if the requirements are satisfied,a conviction, in the words of the statute, "is supportable,"and the case may be submitted to the jury and a convictionsustained. See Vickery v. State, 566 S. W. 2d 624, 626-627(Tex. Crim. App. 1978); see also Burnham v. State, 821 S. W.2d 1, 3 (Tex. Ct. App. 1991).2Texas amended Article 38.07, effective September 1, 1993.The amendment extended the child victim exception tovictims under 18 years old.3 For four of petitioner's counts,2 Texas courts treat Article 38.07 as a sufficiency of the evidence rule,rather than as a rule concerning the competency or admissibility of evidence. Ordinarily, when evidence that should have been excluded is erroneously admitted against a defendant, the trial court's error is remediedon appeal by reversing the conviction and remanding for a new trial.See, e. g., Miles v. State, 918 S. W. 2d 511, 512 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996);Beltran v. State, 728 S. W. 2d 382, 389 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). A trialcourt's failure to comply with the requirements of Article 38.07, by contrast, results not in a remand for a new trial, but in the reversal of conviction and remand for entry of an order of acquittal. See, e. g., Scoggan,799 S. W. 2d, at 683. At oral argument, Texas agreed that the foregoingis an accurate description of Texas law. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29, 32,40-41.3 The new statute read in full:"A conviction under Chapter 21, Section 22.011, or Section 22.021, PenalCode, is supportable on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim of thesexual offense if the victim informed any person, other than the defendant,of the alleged offense within one year after the date on which the offenseis alleged to have occurred. The requirement that the victim inform another person of an alleged offense does not apply if the victim was youngerthan 18 years of age at the time of the alleged offense." Tex. Code Crim.Proc. Ann., Art. 38.07, as amended by Act of May 29, 1993, 73d Leg., Reg.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN519Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthat amendment was critical. The "outcry or corroboration" requirement was not satisfied for those convictions; 4they rested solely on the victim's testimony. Accordingly,the verdicts on those four counts stand or fall dependingon whether the child victim exception applies. Under theold law, the exception would not apply, because the victimwas more than 14 years old at the time of the alleged offenses. Under the new law, the exception would apply, because the victim was under 18 years old at that time. Inshort, the validity of four of petitioner's convictions dependson whether the old or new law applies to his case, which, inturn, depends on whether the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits the application of the new version of Article 38.07 tohis case.As mentioned, only 4 of petitioner's 15 total convictionsare implicated by the amendment to Article 38.07; the other11 counts--including the 2 convictions for which petitionerreceived life sentences--are uncontested. Six counts areuncontested because they were committed when the victimwas under 14 years old, so his convictions stand even underthe old law; the other five uncontested counts were committed after the new Texas law went into effect, so therecould be no ex post facto claim as to those convictions. SeeSess., ch. 900, $ 12.01, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3765, 3766, and Act of May 10,1993, 73d Leg., Reg. Sess., ch. 200, $ 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 387, 388.4 The victim did not make an outcry until March 1995, more than sixmonths after the alleged offenses. Although the 1993 amendment to Article 38.07 extended the outcry period from six months to one year, see n. 3,supra, the victim's outcry did not come within that time period either.Accordingly, that change in the outcry provision is immaterial to this case.The State argues that there is evidence corroborating the victim's testimony, so it does not help petitioner even if the old law applies. See Brieffor Respondent 4, n. 2. Before the state court, however, petitioner argued that "there was nothing to corroborate [the victim's] version ofevents," 963 S. W. 2d 833, 836 (Tex. Ct. App. 1998), and that court acceptedthe contention as correct for the purposes of its decision. We do thesame here.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN520 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the CourtWeaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 31 (1981) ("The critical ques-tion [for an ex post facto violation] is whether the lawchanges the legal consequences of acts completed before itseffective date"). What are at stake, then, are the four convictions on counts 7 through 10 for offenses committed be-tween June 1992 and July 1993 when the victim was 14 or 15years old and the new Texas law was not in effect.Petitioner appealed his four convictions to the Court ofAppeals for the Second District of Texas in Fort Worth.See 963 S. W. 2d 833 (1998). Petitioner argued that underthe pre-1993 version of Article 38.07, which was the law ineffect at the time of his alleged conduct, those convictionscould not stand, because they were based solely on the vic-tim's testimony, and the victim was not under 14 years oldat the time of the offenses, nor had she made a timely outcry.The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument.Under the 1993 amendment to Article 38.07, the court ob-served, petitioner could be convicted on the victim's testimony alone because she was under 18 years old at the timeof the offenses. The court held that applying this amendment retrospectively to petitioner's case did not violate theEx Post Facto Clause:"The statute as amended does not increase the punish-ment nor change the elements of the offense that theState must prove. It merely `removes existing restric-tions upon the competency of certain classes of personsas witnesses' and is, thus, a rule of procedure. Hopt v.Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 . . . (1884)."

TEXASOpinion of the Courtphrase "ex post facto" referred only to certain types of crimi-nal laws. Justice Chase cataloged those types as follows:"I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws,within the words and the intent of the prohibition.1st. Every law that makes an action done before thepassing of the law, and which was innocent when done,criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every lawthat aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was,when committed. 3d. Every law that changes thepunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, thanthe law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th.Every law that alters thelegal rules of evidence, andreceives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence,in order to convict the offender." Id., at 390 (emphasisin original).9It is the fourth category that is at issue in petitioner's case.The common-law understanding explained by Justice Chasedrew heavily upon the authoritative exposition of one ofthe great scholars of the common law, Richard Wooddeson.See id., at 391 (noting reliance on Wooddeson's treatise).109 Elsewhere in his opinion, Justice Chase described his taxonomy ofex post facto laws as follows:"Sometimes [ex post facto laws] respected the crime, by declaring actsto be treason, which were not treason, when committed; at other times,they violated the rules of evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof)by admitting one witness, when the existing law required two; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath of the wife against the husband; or other testimony, which the courts of justice would not admit;at other times they inflicted punishments, where the party was not, bylaw, liable to any punishment; and in other cases, they inflicted greaterpunishment, than the law annexed to the offence." 3 Dall., at 389 (emphasis deleted).10 Wooddeson was well known for his treatise on British common law,A Systematical View of the Laws of England, which collected variouslectures he delivered as the Vinerian Professor and Fellow of MagdalenCollege at Oxford. Though not as well known today, Justice Chase noted529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the CourtWooddeson's classification divided ex post facto laws intothree general categories: those respecting the crimes themselves; those respecting the legal rules of evidence; andthose affecting punishment (which he further subdividedinto laws creating a punishment and those making an ex-isting punishment more severe).11 See 2 R. Wooddeson, ASystematical View of the Laws of England 625-640 (1792)(Lecture 41) (hereinafter Wooddeson). Those three categories (the last of which was further subdivided) correlateprecisely toCalder's four categories. Justice Chase alsoused language in describing the categories that corresponds directly to Wooddeson's phrasing.12 Finally, in fourthat Wooddeson was William Blackstone's successor, 3 Dall., at 391 (Blackstone held the Vinerian chair at Oxford until 1766), and his treatise wasrepeatedly cited in the years following the ratification by lawyers appearing before this Court and by the Court itself. See, e. g., Trusteesof Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 562-563 (1819) (argument of Daniel Webster); id., at 668, 676 (Story, J.); Town of Pawlet v.Clark, 9 Cranch 292, 326, 329 (1815) (Story, J.); The Nereide, 9 Cranch 388,449 (1815) (Story, J.); Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall. 14, 16-17 (1800) (argumentsof Edward Tilghman, Jared Ingersoll, and Alexander Dallas); Hannum v.Spear, 2 Dall. 291 (Err. App. Pa. 1795); Glass v. Sloop Betsey, 3 Dall. 6,8 (1794).11 Specifically, in the former category Wooddeson included those lawsthat make "some innovation, or creat[e] some forfeiture or disability, notincurred in the ordinary course of law." 2 R. Wooddeson, A SystematicalView of the Laws of England 638 (1792). In the latter category, he placedthose laws that "imposed a sentence more severe than could have beenawarded by the inferior courts." Id., at 639. As examples of the formercategory Wooddeson cited the bills passed by Parliament that banishedLord Clarendon in 1669 and Bishop Atterbury in 1723. Those punishments were considered "innovation[s] . . . not incurred in the ordinarycourse of law" because banishment, at those times, was simply not a formof penalty that could be imposed by the courts. Ibid. See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 569 (1938); Craies, The Compulsion ofSubjects to Leave the Realm, 6 L. Q. Rev. 388, 396 (1890).12 See 2 Wooddeson 631 (referring to laws that "respec[t] the crime,determining those things to be treason, which by no prior law or adjudication could be or had been so declared"); id., at 633-634 (referring tolaws "respecting . . . the rules of evidence [rectifying] a deficiency of529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN524 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courtfootnotes in Justice Chase's opinion, he listed examples ofvarious Acts of Parliament illustrating each of the four categories. See 3 Dall., at 389, nn. *, #, ##, \Delta .13 Each of theseexamples is exactly the same as the ones Wooddeson himselfused in his treatise. See 2 Wooddeson 629 (case of the Earlof Strafford); id., at 634 (case of Sir John Fenwick); id., at638 (banishments of Lord Clarendon and of Bishop Atter-bury);id., at 639 (Coventry Act).Calder's four categories, which embraced Wooddeson'sformulation, were, in turn, soon embraced by contempo-rary scholars. Joseph Story, for example, in writing on theEx Post Facto Clause, stated:"The general interpretation has been, and is, . . . thatthe prohibition reaches every law, whereby an act isdeclared a crime, and made punishable as such, whenit was not a crime, when done; or whereby the act, ifa crime, is aggravated in enormity, or punishment; orwhereby different, or less evidence, is required to convict an offender, than was required, when the act wascommitted." 3 Commentaries on the Constitution ofthe United States $ 1339, p. 212 (1833).James Kent concurred in this understanding of the Clause:"[T]he words ex post facto laws were technical expres-sions, and meant every law that made an act done before the passing of the law, and which was innocentwhen done, criminal; or which aggravated a crime, andlegal proof" created when only one witness was available but "a statutethen lately made requiring two witnesses" had been in effect); id., at638 (describing "acts of parliament, which principally affect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law"); id., at 639 (referringto instances where "the legislature . . . imposed a sentence more severethan could have been awarded by the inferior courts"). Cf. n. 9, supra.13 The instances cited were the case of the Earl of Strafford, the caseof Sir John Fenwick, the banishments of Lord Clarendon and of BishopAtterbury, and the Coventry Act.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 529 U.

SeeLynce v. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433, 441, n. 13(1997); Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293 (1977); Malloyv. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183-184 (1915); Mallett v.North Carolina, 181 U.

State courts, too, in the years followingCalder, adopted Justice Chase's four-category formulation.See Boston & Gunby v. Cummins, 16 Ga. 102, 106 (1854);Martindale v. Moore, 3 Blackf. 275, 277 (Ind. 1833); Davisv. Ballard, 24 Ky. 563, 578 (1829); Strong v. State, 1 Blackf.193, 196 (Ind. 1822); Dickinson v. Dickinson, 7 N. C. 327, 330(1819); see also Woart v. Winnick, 3 N. H. 473, 475 (Super.Ct. 1826).1414 The reception given the four categories contrasts with that givento Calder's actual holding--that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only tocriminal laws, not to civil laws. The early criticism levied against thatholding, see, e. g., Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 416, 681-687 (App. I)529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the CourtIIIAs mentioned earlier, Justice Chase and Wooddeson bothcited several examples ofex post facto laws, and, in particu-lar, cited the case of Sir John Fenwick as an example of thefourth category. To better understand the type of law thatfalls within that category, then, we turn to Fenwick's casefor preliminary guidance.Those who remained loyal to James II after he was deposed by King William III in the Revolution of 1688 thoughttheir opportunity for restoration had arrived in 1695, following the death of Queen Mary. 9 T. Macaulay, History ofEngland 31 (1899) (hereinafter Macaulay). Sir John Fenwick, along with other Jacobite plotters including GeorgePorter and Cardell Goodman, began concocting their schemein the spring of that year, and over the next several monthsthe original circle of conspirators expanded in number.Id.,at 32, 47-48, 109-110. Before the conspirators could carryout their machinations, however, three members of thegroup disclosed the plot to William. Id., at 122-125. Oneby one, the participants were arrested, tried, and convictedof treason. Id., at 127-142. Fenwick, though, remained inhiding while the rest of the cabal was brought to justice.During that time, the trials of his accomplices revealed thatthere were only two witnesses among them who couldprove Fenwick's guilt, Porter and Goodman.Id., at 170-171. As luck would have it, an act of Parliament proclaimedthat two witnesses were necessary to convict a person ofhigh treason. See An Act for Regulateing of Tryals in(1829) (Johnson, J., concurring); Stoddart v. Smith, 5 Binn. 355, 370(Pa. 1812) (Brackenridge, J.), was absent with respect to the four categories. Although Justice Chase's opinion may have somewhat dampenedthe appetite for further debate in the courts, that consideration would notnecessarily have an effect on scholarly discourse, nor does it explain whyjudges would be reluctant to express criticism of the four categories, yetharbor no compunction when it came to criticizing the actual holding ofthe Court.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 529 U.

Fenwick senthis agent to attempt a bribe, which Porter initially acceptedin exchange for leaving for France. But then Porter simplypocketed the bribe, turned in Fenwick's agent (who waspromptly tried, convicted, and pilloried), and proceeded totestify against Fenwick (along with Goodman) before a grandjury. Id., at 171-173. When the grand jury returned anindictment for high treason, Fenwick attempted to flee thecountry himself, but was apprehended and brought beforethe Lord Justices in London. Sensing an impending conviction, Fenwick threw himself on the mercy of the courtand offered to disclose all he knew of the Jacobite plotting,aware all the while that the judges would soon leave thecity for their circuits, and a delay would thus buy him a fewweeks time. Id., at 173-174.Fenwick was granted time to write up his confession, butrather than betray true Jacobites, he concocted a confessioncalculated to accuse those loyal to William, hoping to introduce embarrassment and perhaps a measure of instabilityto the current regime. Id., at 175-178. William, however,at once perceived Fenwick's design and rejected the confession, along with any expectation of mercy. Id., at 178-15 That Act read, in relevant part:"And bee it further enacted That . . . noe Person or Persons whatsoevershall bee indicted tryed or attainted of High Treason . . . but by and uponthe Oaths and Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses either both of them tothe same Overtact or one of them to one and another of them to anotherOvertact of the same Treason unlesse the Party indicted and arraigned ortryed shall willingly without violence in open Court confesse the sameor shall stand Mute or refuse to plead or in cases of High Treason shallperemptorily challenge above the Number of Thirty five of the Jury . . . ."529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Court180, 194. Though his contrived ploy for leniency was unsuccessful in that respect, it proved successful in another:during the delay, Fenwick's wife had succeeded in bribingGoodman, the other witness against him, to leave the country.

TEXASOpinion of the CourtHouse of Lords, and the King gave his assent. Id., at 214-225; see also An Act to Attaint Sir John Fenwick Baronet ofHigh Treason, 8 Will. III, ch. 4 (1696). On January 28, 1697,Sir John Fenwick was beheaded. 9 Macaulay 226-227.IVArticle 38.07 is unquestionably a law "that alters the legalrules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony,than the law required at the time of the commission of theoffence, in order to convict the offender." Under the lawin effect at the time the acts were committed, the prose-cution's case was legally insufficient and petitioner was entitled to a judgment of acquittal, unless the State couldproduce both the victim's testimonyand corroborativeevidence. The amended law, however, changed the quantum of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction; under thenew law, petitioner could be (and was) convicted on the victim's testimony alone, without any corroborating evidence.Under any commonsense understanding of Calder's fourthcategory, Article 38.07 plainly fits. Requiring only the vic-tim's testimony to convict, rather than the victim's testimony plus other corroborating evidence is surely "less tes-timony required to convict" in any straightforward senseof those words.Indeed, the circumstances of petitioner's case parallel thoseof Fenwick's case 300 years earlier. Just as the relevant lawin Fenwick's case required more than one witness' testimonyto support a conviction (namely, the testimony of a secondwitness), Texas' old version of Article 38.07 required morethan the victim's testimony alone to sustain a conviction(namely, other corroborating evidence).20 And just like Fenof the Treason. . . . Then this is a Law; ex post facto, and that hath beenalways condemned . . .").20 Texas argues that the corroborative evidence required by Article 38.07"need not be more or different from the victim's testimony; it may beentirely cumulative of the victim's testimony." Brief for Respondent 19;529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwick's bill of attainder, which permitted the House of Com-mons to convict him with less evidence than was otherwiserequired, Texas' retrospective application of the amendmentto Article 38.07 permitted petitioner to be convicted withless than the previously required quantum of evidence. Itis true, of course, as the Texas Court of Appeals observed,that "[t]he statute as amended does not increase the punish-ment nor change the elements of the offense that the Statemust prove." 963 S. W. 2d, at 836. But that observationsimply demonstrates that the amendment does not fit withinCalder's first and third categories. Likewise, the dissent'sremark that "Article 38.07 does not establish an elementof the offense," post, at 559, only reveals that the law doesnot come withinCalder's first category. The fact that theamendment authorizes a conviction on less evidence thanpreviously required, however, brings it squarely within thefourth category.VThe fourth category, so understood, resonates harmoni-ously with one of the principal interests that theEx PostFacto Clause was designed to serve, fundamental justice.21see also post, at 561, n. 6 (dissenting opinion). The trouble with that argument is that the same was true in Fenwick's case. The relevant statute there required the "Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses either bothof them to the same Overtact or one of them to one and another of themto another Overtact of the same Treason." See n. 15, supra (emphasisadded).21 The Clause is, of course, also aimed at other concerns, "namely, thatlegislative enactments give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed," Miller v. Florida,482 U. S. 423, 430 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted), and at reinforcing the separation of powers, see Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24,29, n. 10 (1981). But those are not its only aims, and the absence of areliance interest is not an argument in favor of abandoning the categoryitself. If it were, the same conclusion would follow for Calder's third category (increases in punishment), as there are few, if any, reliance interestsin planning future criminal activities based on the expectation of less severe repercussions.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the CourtJustice Chase viewed all ex post facto laws as "manifestlyunjust and oppressive." Calder, 3 Dall., at 391. Likewise,Blackstone condemned them as "cruel and unjust," 1 Com-mentaries on the Laws of England 46 (1765), as did everystate constitution with a similar clause, see n. 25, infra. AsJustice Washington explained in characterizing "[t]he injustice and tyranny" of ex post facto laws:"Why did the authors of the constitution turn their attention to this subject, which, at the first blush, wouldappear to be peculiarly fit to be left to the discretion ofthose who have the police and good government of theState under their management and control? The onlyanswer to be given is, because laws of this characterare oppressive, unjust, and tyrannical; and, as such, arecondemned by the universal sentence of civilized man."Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 266 (1827).In short, the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed as "an additional bulwark in favour of the personal security of the subject," Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (Chase, J.), to protect against"the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny,"The Federalist No. 84, p. 512 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton), that were "often used to effect the most detestable pur-poses,"Calder, 3 Dall., at 396 (Paterson, J.).Calder's fourth category addresses this concern precisely.A law reducing the quantum of evidence required to convictan offender is as grossly unfair as, say, retrospectively elimi-nating an element of the offense, increasing the punishmentfor an existing offense, or lowering the burden of proof(seeinfra, at 540-544). In each of these instances, the government subverts the presumption of innocence by reducingthe number of elements it must prove to overcome that presumption; by threatening such severe punishment so as toinduce a plea to a lesser offense or a lower sentence; or bymaking it easier to meet the threshold for overcoming thepresumption. Reducing the quantum of evidence necessary529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtto meet the burden of proof is simply another way of achieving the same end.22 All of these legislative changes, in asense, are mirror images of one another. In each instance,the government refuses, after the fact, to play by its ownrules, altering them in a way that is advantageous only tothe State, to facilitate an easier conviction. There is plainlya fundamental fairness interest, even apart from any claimof reliance or notice, in having the government abide by therules of law it establishes to govern the circumstances underwhich it can deprive a person of his or her liberty or life.23Indeed, Fenwick's case is itself an illustration of this principle. Fenwick could claim no credible reliance interest inthe two-witness statute, as he could not possibly have knownthat only two of his fellow conspirators would be able totestify as to his guilt, nor that he would be successful inbribing one of them to leave the country. Nevertheless,Parliament had enacted the two-witness law, and there was22 Lowering the burden of persuasion, to be sure, is not precisely thesame thing as lowering (as a matter of law) the amount of evidence necessary to meet that burden. But it does not follow, as the dissent appearsto think, that only the former subverts the presumption of innocence.Post, at 560-561 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).23 We do not mean to say that every rule that has an effect on whethera defendant can be convicted implicates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Ordinary rules of evidence, for example, do not violate the Clause. See infra,at 543-547. Rules of that nature are ordinarily evenhanded, in the sensethat they may benefit either the State or the defendant in any given case.More crucially, such rules, by simply permitting evidence to be admittedat trial, do not at all subvert the presumption of innocence, because theydo not concern whether the admissible evidence is sufficient to overcomethe presumption. Therefore, to the extent one may consider changes tosuch laws as "unfair" or "unjust," they do not implicate the same kindof unfairness implicated by changes in rules setting forth a sufficiency ofthe evidence standard. Moreover, while the principle of unfairness helpsexplain and shape the Clause's scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws under the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force. Cf. W. S.Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int'l, 493 U. S. 400,409 (1990).529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courta profound unfairness in Parliament's retrospectively altering the very rules it had established, simply because thoserules prevented the conviction of the traitor--notwithstanding the fact that Fenwick could not truly claim to be "innocent." (At least one historian has concluded that his guiltwas clearly established, see 9 Macaulay 203-204, and the debate in the House of Commons bears out that conclusion,see, e. g., Proceedings 219, 230, 246, 265, 289.) Moreover, thepertinent rule altered in Fenwick's case went directly tothe general issue of guilt, lowering the minimum quantumof evidence required to obtain a conviction. The Framers,quite clearly, viewed such maneuvers as grossly unfair, andadopted the Ex Post Facto Clause accordingly.24VIThe United States as amicus asks us to revisit the accuracy of the fourth category as an original matter. Noneof its reasons for abandoning the category is persuasive.24 Fenwick's case also illustrates how such ex post facto laws can operate similarly to retrospective increases in punishment by adding to thecoercive pressure to accept a plea bargain. When Fenwick was firstbrought before the Lord Justices, he was given an opportunity to makea confession to the King. Though he squandered the opportunity by authoring a plain contrivance, Fenwick could have reasonably assumed thata sincere confession would have been rewarded with leniency--the functional equivalent of a plea bargain. See 9 Macaulay 125. When the billof attainder was taken up by the House of Commons, there is evidencethat this was done to pressure Fenwick into making the honest confessionhe had failed to make before. See, e. g., Proceedings 197 (" 'Tis a Matterof Blood, 'tis true, but I do not aim at this Gentleman's Life in it . . . allI Propose by it, is to get his Confession"); id., at 235 ("[W]e do not aim atSir John Fenwick's Blood, (God forbid we should) but at his Confession");id., at 255 ("Why, give me leave to say to you, 'tis a new way not knownin England, that you will Hang a Man unless he will Confess or giveEvidence . . ."). And before the House of Lords, Fenwick was explicitlythreatened that unless he confessed, they would proceed to consider thebill against him. 9 Macaulay 218.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN535Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the CourtFirst, pointing to Blackstone's Commentaries and a hand-ful of state constitutions cited by Justice Chase in Calder,see 3 Dall., at 391-392, the United States asserts that JusticeChase simply got it wrong with his four categories. Blackstone wrote: "There is still a more unreasonable methodthan this, which is called making of laws ex post facto; whenafter an action is committed, the legislator then for the firsttime declares it to have been a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it . . . ."1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, at 46 (emphasisin original). The ex post facto clauses in Ratification-erastate constitutions to which Justice Chase cited are of apiece.25 The United States directs our attention to the factthat none of these definitions mentions Justice Chase'sfourth category.All of these sources, though, are perfectly consistent withJustice Chase's first category of ex post facto laws. None ofthem is incompatible with his four-category formulation, unless we accept the premise that Blackstone and the stateconstitutions purported to express the exclusive definition ofan ex post facto law. Yet none appears to do so on its face.And if those definitions were read as exclusive, the United25 Massachusetts' clause read as follows: "Laws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not beendeclared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government." Constitutionof Massachusetts, Pt. I, Art. 24 (1780), in 5 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 95 (1975) (hereinafter Swindler).The Constitutions of Maryland and North Carolina used identical words:"That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existenceof such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust,and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to bemade." Maryland Constitution, A Declaration of Rights, Art. 15 (1776),in 4 Swindler 373; North Carolina Constitution, A Declaration of Rights,Art. 24 (1776), in 7 Swindler 403. And Delaware's Declaration of Rightsand Fundamental Rules, Art. 11 (1776), in 2 Swindler 198, stated, "Thatretrospective Laws, punishing Offenses committed before the Existenceof such Laws, are oppressive and unjust and ought not to be made."529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN536 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the CourtStates' argument would run up against a more troubling obstacle, namely, that neither Blackstone nor the state constitutions mention Calder's third category either (increases inpunishment). The United States, in effect, asks us to abandon two of Calder's categories based on the unsupportedsupposition that the Blackstonian and state constitutionaldefinitions were exclusive, and upon the implicit premise thatneither Wooddeson, Chase, Story, Kent, nor subsequentcourts (state and federal) realized that was so. We thinkthat simply stating the nature of the request demonstrateswhy it must be rejected.26Next, the United States contends Justice Chase was mistaken to cite the case of Sir John Fenwick as an example of an ex post facto law, because it was actually a bill ofattainder. Fenwick was indeed convicted by a bill of attainder, but it does not follow that his case cannot also bean example of an ex post facto law. Clearly, Wooddesonthought it was, see 2 Wooddeson 641, as did the House ofCommons, see n. 19, supra, and we are aware of no rulestating that a single historical event can explain one, butnot two, constitutional Clauses (actually, three Clauses, seeArt. III, $ 3 (Treason Clause)). We think the United States'observation simply underscores the kinship between billsof attainder and ex post facto laws, see Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 468, n. 30 (1977);United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 323 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also Z. Chafee, Three HumanRights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 92-93 (1956) (herein26 Nor does it help much to cite Justice Iredell's statement that ex postfacto laws include those that "inflict a punishment for any act, which wasinnocent at the time it was committed; [or] increase the degree of punishment previously denounced for any specific offence," Calder v. Bull,3 Dall. 386, 400 (1798). The argument still requires us to believe thatJustice Iredell--and only Justice Iredell--got it right, and that all otherauthorities (now including Blackstone and the state constitutions) somehow missed the point.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN537Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtafter Chafee), which may explain why the Framers twiceplaced their respective prohibitions adjacent to one another.And if the United States means to argue that category fourshould be abandoned because its illustrative example was abill of attainder, this would prove entirely too much, becauseall of the specific examples listed by Justice Chase werepassed as bills of attainder.27Finally, both Texas and the United States argue that wehave already effectively cast out the fourth category in Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990). Collins held no suchthing. That case began its discussion of the Ex Post FactoClause by quoting verbatim Justice Chase's "now familiaropinion in Calder" and his four-category definition. Id., at41-42. After noting that "[e]arly opinions of the Court por-trayed this as an exclusive definition of ex post facto laws,"id., at 42, the Court then quoted from our opinion in Beazellv. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925):" `It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well knownthat their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously com-mitted, which was innocent when done; which makesmore burdensome the punishment for a crime, after itscommission, or which deprives one charged with crimeof any defense available according to law at the timewhen the act was committed, is prohibited asex post27 See An Act for the Attainder of Thomas Earle of Strafford of HighTreason, 16 Car.

While thebills against the Earl of Clarendon and Bishop Atterbury appear to bebills of pains and penalties, see Chafee 117, 136, as does the Coventry Act,see 2 Wooddeson 638-639, those are simply a subspecies of bills of attainder, the only difference being that the punishment was something lessthan death.

S., at 42 (quoting Beazell, 269U. S., at 169-170).Collins then observed in a footnote: "The Beazell definitionomits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, toalterations in the `legal rules of evidence.' As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intendedto prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trialsfor crimes committed before the changes." 497 U. S., at 43,n. 3 (citations omitted). Collins then commented that "[t]heBeazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of theoriginal understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause." Id.,at 43.It seems most accurate to say that Collins is rathercryptic. While calling Calder's four categories the "exclusive definition" of ex post facto laws, it also calls Beazell'sdefinition a "faithful" rendition of the "original understanding" of the Clause, even though that quotation omitted category four. And while Collins quotes a portion of Beazellomitting the fourth category, the immediately precedingparagraph in Beazell explains that the law at issue in thatcase did not change "[t]he quantum and kind of proof required to establish guilt," 269 U. S., at 170, a statement distinguishing, rather than overruling, Calder's fourth category.If Collins had intended to resurrect a long forgotten original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause shorn of thefourth category, we think it strange that it would have doneso in a footnote. Stranger still would be its reliance on asingle case from 1925, which did not even implicate, let alonepurport to overrule, the fourth category, and which did noteven mention Fenwick's case. But this Court does not discard longstanding precedent in this manner. Further still,Collins itself expressly overruled two of our prior cases;if the Court that day were intent on overruling part ofCalder as well, it surely would have said so directly, ratherthan act in such an ambiguous manner.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN539Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the CourtThe better understanding of Collins' discussion of theEx Post Facto Clause is that it eliminated a doctrinal hitchthat had developed in our cases, which purported to definethe scope of the Clause along an axis distinguishing between laws involving "substantial protections" and thosethat are merely "procedural." Both Kring v. Missouri, 107U. S. 221 (1883), and Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343(1898)--the two cases Collins overruled--relied on justthat distinction. In overruling them, the Court correctlypointed out, "the prohibition which may not be evaded isthe one defined by the Calder categories." 497 U. S., at 46.Accordingly, Collins held that it was a mistake to stray beyond Calder's four categories, not that the fourth categorywas itself mistaken.28VIITexas next argues that even if the fourth category exists,it is limited to laws that retrospectively alter the burdenof proof (which Article 38.07 does not do). See also post, at572 (dissenting opinion). It comes to this conclusion on thebasis of two pieces of evidence. The first is our decision inCummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867). The second concerns Texas' historical understanding of Fenwick's case.28 The dissent would have us dismiss our numerous and repeated invocations of the fourth category, see supra, at 525, because they were merely"mechanical . . . recitation[s]" in cases that did not depend on the fourthcategory. Post, at 568. Instead, the dissent would glean original meaning from Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), and Collins v. Youngblood,497 U. S. 37 (1990). Post, at 567-568. First of all, the dissent is factuallymistaken; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867), relied on the fourthcategory in invalidating the laws at issue there. See infra this page and540-541. And Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884) (discussedinfra, at 542-547), specifically distinguished category four. See post, at570-571 ("Hopt . . . retain[ed] Calder's fourth category"). Second, asmentioned above, neither Beazell nor Collins relied on the fourth category,so it is not apparent why the dissent would place so much emphasis onthose two cases that did not depend on category four.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN540 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the CourtCummings v. Missouri addressed an ex post facto chal-lenge to certain amendments to the Missouri State Constitution made in 1865. When read together, those amend-ments listed a series of acts deemed criminal (all dealingwith the giving of aid or comfort to anyone engaged in armedhostility against the United States), and then declared thatunless a person engaged in certain professions (e. g., lawyersand clergymen) swore an oath of loyalty, he "shall, on con-viction [for failing to swear the oath], be punished" by a fine,imprisonment, or both. Id., at 279-281. We held that theseprovisions violated theEx Post Facto Clause.Writing for the Court, Justice Field first observed that"[b]y an ex post facto law is meant one which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time itwas committed; or imposes additional punishment to thatthen prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by whichless or different testimony is sufficient to convict than wasthen required." Id., at 325-326. The Court then heldthe amendments violated the Ex Post Facto Clause in allthese respects: some of the offenses deemed criminal bythe amendments were not criminal acts before then, id., at327-328; other acts were previously criminal, but now theycarried a greater criminal sanction, id., at 328; and, mostimportantly for present purposes, the amendments permitted conviction on less testimony than was previouslysufficient, because they "subvert the presumptions of innocence, and alter the rules of evidence, which heretofore,under the universally recognized principles of the commonlaw, have been supposed to be fundamental and unchangeable," ibid. The Court continued: "They assume that theparties are guilty; they call upon the parties to establishtheir innocence; and they declare that such innocence can beshown only in one way--by an inquisition, in the form of anexpurgatory oath, into the consciences of the parties." Ibid.It is correct that Cummings held Missouri's constitutionalamendments invalid under the fourth category because529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN541Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthey reversed the burden of proof. But Cummings nowheresuggests that a reversal of the burden of proof is all thefourth category encompasses. And we think there is nogood reason to draw a line between laws that lower theburden of proof and laws that reduce the quantum of evi-dence necessary to meet that burden; the two types of lawsare indistinguishable in all meaningful ways relevant toconcerns of theEx Post Facto Clause. See supra, at 530-534; see also Cummings, 4 Wall., at 325 ("The legal resultmust be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannotbe done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance,not shadows").As for Texas' second piece of evidence, it asserts that thelaw in Fenwick's case, requiring two witnesses to convict aperson for high treason, traces its origins to the ancientRoman law concept known as the "rule of number," underwhich "the probative value of testimony would be increased if others testifying to the same facts swore anoath." Brief for Respondent 20. The "less testimony" towhich Fenwick's case refers, the argument runs, concernslowering the probative value required to convict,i. e., a re-duction in the burden of proof.Even if that historical argument were correct, the sameresponse to Texas' Cummings-based argument is applicable.But we think the historical premise is mistaken. If the tes-timony of one witness rather than two truly reflected a lesscredible showing, and if the House of Commons truly thoughtit labored under a lesser burden of proof, then one wouldexpect some sort of reference to that in Fenwick's case. Yetthe few direct references to the burden of proof that weremade during the debates are to the contrary; they indicatesomething roughly the equivalent of a beyond-a-reasonabledoubt standard.29 And at least one Member expressly de29 See, e. g., Proceedings 75 ("If upon what I hear, I am of Opinion, heis notoriously Guilty, I shall freely pass the Bill.

TEXASOpinion of the Courtclared that the number of witnesses testifying bore norelationship to the overall credibility of the Crown's case.30It also appears that "[a]fter the middle of the 1600s therenever was any doubt that the common law of England injury trials rejected entirely" the Roman law concept of therule of number. Wigmore, Required Numbers of Witnesses;A Brief History of the Numerical System in England, 15Harv. L. Rev. 83, 93 (1901). Though the treason statute atissue in Fenwick's case, and related antecedent acts, havea superficial resemblance to the rule of number, those actsin fact reflected a concern with prior monarchical abusesrelating to the specific crime of treason, rather than anyvestigial belief that the number of witnesses is a proxy forprobative value.Id., at 100-101; see also 7 J. Wigmore,Evidence $ 2037, pp. 353-354 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1978).VIIITexas argues (following the holding of the Texas Courtof Appeals) that the present case is controlled by Hopt v.Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884), and Thompson v.Missouri, 171 U. S. 380 (1898). In Hopt, the defendant wasconvicted of murder. At trial, the prosecution introducedthe testimony of a convicted felon that tended to inculpatethe defendant. Hopt objected to the competency of the witness on the basis of a law in place at the time of the allegedmurder, which stated: " `[T]he rules for determining the competency of witnesses in civil actions are applicable also tocriminal actions . . . .' " The relevant civil rules, in turn,specified that " `all persons, without exception, . . . may bewitnesses in any action or proceeding,' " but " `personsagainst whom judgment has been rendered upon a conviction[where you doubt, do nothing], I shall not be for it . . ."). See also Coffinv. United States, 156 U. S. 432, 456 (1895).30 "[O]ne single Witness, if credited by Twelve Jury-men, is sufficient;and an Hundred Witnesses, if not so credited, is not sufficient to Convicta Person of a Capital Crime."

S., at 587-588.After the date of the alleged offense, but prior to defendant'strial, the last provision (excluding convicted felons frombeing witnesses) was repealed.The defendant argued that the retrospective application ofthe felon witness-competency provision violated the Ex PostFacto Clause. Because of the emphasis the parties (and thedissent) have placed onHopt, it is worth quoting at lengththis Court's explanation for why it rejected the defendant'sargument:"Statutes which simply enlarge the class of persons whomay be competent to testify in criminal cases are notex post facto in their application to prosecutions forcrimes committed prior to their passage; for they donot attach criminality to any act previously done, andwhich was innocent when done; nor aggravate any crimetheretofore committed; nor provide a greater punish-ment therefor than was prescribed at the time of itscommission; nor do they alter the degree, or lessen theamount or measure, of the proof which was made neces-sary to conviction when the crime was committed."The crime for which the present defendant wasindicted, the punishment prescribed therefor, and thequantity or the degree of proof necessary to establishhis guilt, all remained unaffected by the subsequentstatute. Any statutory alteration of the legal rules ofevidence which would authorize conviction upon lessproof, in amount or degree, than was required whenthe offence was committed, might, in respect of thatoffence, be obnoxious to the constitutional inhibitionupon ex post facto laws. But alterations which do notincrease the punishment, nor change the ingredients ofthe offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establishguilt, but--leaving untouched the nature of the crimeand the amount or degree of proof essential to convic-tion--only remove existing restrictions upon the compe529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN544 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courttency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, relateto modes of procedure only, in which no one can besaid to have a vested right, and which the State, upongrounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure.Such regulations of the mode in which the facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury, can bemade applicable to prosecutions or trials thereafter had,without reference to the date of the commission of theoffence charged." Id., at 589-590 (emphases added).Thompson v. Missouri, also relied upon by Texas, involveda similar ex post facto challenge to the retrospective application of a law permitting the introduction of expert handwriting testimony as competent evidence, where the rulein place at the time of the offense did not permit such evidence to be introduced. Mainly on the authority of Hopt,the Court rejected Thompson's ex post facto challenge aswell.Texas' reliance on Hopt is misplaced. Article 38.07 issimply not a witness competency rule.31 It does not "simply enlarge the class of persons who may be competent totestify," and it does not "only remove existing restrictionsupon the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses." 110 U. S., at 589-590. Both before and after theamendment, the victim's testimony was competent evidence.Texas Rule of Criminal Evidence 601(a) already prescribesthat "[e]very person is competent to be a witness exceptas otherwise provided in these rules," and Rule 601(a)(2)already contains its own provision respecting child wit31 We recognize that the Court of Appeals stated Article 38.07 "merely`removes existing restrictions upon the competency of certain classes ofpersons as witnesses,' " 963 S. W. 2d, at 836 (quoting Hopt, 110 U. S., at590); see supra, at 520. Whether a state law is properly characterized asfalling under the Ex Post Facto Clause, however, is a federal questionwe determine for ourselves. Cf. Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397,400 (1937).529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN545Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtnesses.32 As explained earlier, see supra, at 517-518, 531-533, Article 38.07 is a sufficiency of the evidence rule. Assuch, it does not merely "regulat[e] . . . the mode in whichthe facts constituting guilt may be placed before the jury,"(Rule 601(a) already does that), but governs the sufficiencyof those facts for meeting the burden of proof. Indeed, Hoptexpressly distinguished witness competency laws from thoselaws that "alter the degree, or lessen the amount or measure,of the proof which was made necessary to conviction whenthe crime was committed." 110 U. S., at 589; see alsoid.,at 590 (felon witness law "leav[es] untouched . . . the amountor degree of proof essential to conviction").It is profitable, in this respect, to compare the statutes inHopt and Thompson with the text of Article 38.07. The lawin Hopt proscribed a " `rul[e] for determining the competencyof witnesses' " that stated " `persons . . . convict[ed of a]felony . . . shall not be witnesses.' " 110 U. S., at 587-588.The statute in Thompson, similarly, specified that " `com-parison of a disputed writing . . . shall be permitted to bemade by witnesses, and such writings . . . may be submittedto the court and jury as evidence.' " 171 U. S., at 381. Article 38.07, however, speaks in terms of whether "[a] convic32 That subsection contains an exception for "[c]hildren or other persons who, after being examined by the court, appear not to possess sufficient intellect to relate transactions with respect to which they areinterrogated."It is also worth observing that before 1986, Rule 601(a) was codified asTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.06 (Vernon 1979)--the section immediately preceding the law at issue in this case. (The provision thenread: "All persons are competent to testify in criminal cases," and contained a similar exception for child witnesses.) We think it fair to inferthat Texas was well aware of the differences in the language used in theseadjacent provisions, and understood that the laws served two differentfunctions. The dissent views Article 38.07 as an exception to the generalrule of former Article 38.06. It finds it logical that the exception wouldbe placed next to the general rule, post, at 564, n. 8, but does not suggesta reason why it would be logical for the supposed exception to be phrasedin language so utterly different from the general rule.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN546 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courttion . . . is supportable on" certain evidence. It is Rule601(a), not Article 38.07, that addresses who is "competent totestify." We think the differences in these laws are plain.33Moreover, a sufficiency of the evidence rule resonates withthe interests to which the Ex Post Facto Clause is addressedin a way that a witness competency rule does not. In particular, the elements of unfairness and injustice in subvertingthe presumption of innocence are directly implicated byrules lowering the quantum of evidence required to convict.Such rules willalways run in the prosecution's favor, be-cause they always make it easier to convict the accused.This is so even if the accused is not in fact guilty, becausethe coercive pressure of a more easily obtained convictionmay induce a defendant to plead to a lesser crime ratherthan run the risk of conviction on a greater crime. Witnesscompetency rules, to the contrary, do not necessarily runin the State's favor. A felon witness competency rule, forexample, might help a defendant if a felon is able to relatecredible exculpatory evidence.Nor do such rules necessarily affect, let alone subvert,the presumption of innocence. The issue of the admissibilityof evidence is simply different from the question whetherthe properly admitted evidence is sufficient to convict thedefendant. Evidence admissibility rules do not go to thegeneral issue of guilt, nor to whether a conviction, as amatter of law, may be sustained. Prosecutors may satisfyall the requirements of any number of witness competency33 The dissent seems unwilling to concede this distinction. Though itadmits that under Article 38.07 the uncorroborated victim is "not literallyforbidden from testifying," post, at 563, it also insists that testimony is"inadmissible," post, at 571, and that "the jury will not be permitted toconsider it," post, at 555, n. 3. See also post, at 557, 565 (referring toArticle 38.07 as a rule about witness "credibility"); post, at 556, 570, 575(referring to Texas' law as a rule of "admissibility"); post, at 553, 557, 563,564, and n. 8, 575 (referring to the law as one about "competency"). Wethink it is clear from the text of Article 38.07 and Rule 601, however, thatthe victim's testimony alone is not inadmissible; it is just insufficient.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN547Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtrules, but this says absolutely nothing about whether theyhave introduced a quantum of evidence sufficient to convictthe offender. Sufficiency of the evidence rules (by defini-tion) do just that--they inform us whether the evidence introduced is sufficient to convict as a matter of law (which isnot to say the jury must convict, but only that, as a matterof law, the case may be submitted to the jury and the jurymay convict). In the words of Article 38.07, "[a] conviction . . . is supportable" when its requirements are met.IXThe dissent contends that Article 38.07 is not a sufficiencyof the evidence rule. It begins its argument by describingat length how the corroboration requirement "is premised ona legislative judgment that accusations made by sexual assault victims above a certain age are not independentlytrustworthy." Post, at 556; see also post, at 557-559. Butit does not follow from that premise that Article 38.07 cannotbe a sufficiency of the evidence rule. Surely the legislaturecan address trustworthiness issues through witness compe-tency rules and sufficiency of the evidence rules alike. Indeed, the statutory history to which the dissent points cutsagainst its own argument. Article 38.07's statutory antecedent, the dissent says, was a "replac[ement]" for the oldcommon-law rule that seduced females were " `incompetent' "as witnesses. Post, at 557, 558. In 1891, Texas substituteda law stating that " `the female alleged to have been seducedshall be permitted to testify; but no conviction shall be hadupon the testimony of the said female,unless the same iscorroborated . . . .' " Post, at 558 (emphasis added). Thatstatute was recodified as Article 38.07 in 1965, was repealedin 1973, and then replaced in 1975 by another version of Article 38.07. As reenacted, the law's language changed from"no conviction shall be had" to its current language that "[a]conviction . . . is supportable." We think this legislative his-tory, to the extent it is relevant for interpreting the current529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN548 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courtlaw, demonstrates that Texas perceived the issue of witnesstrustworthiness asboth an admissibility issue and as a sufficiency question; that it long ago abandoned its rule that vic-tims of these types of crimes are incompetent as witnesses;and that Article 38.07 codifies Texas' sufficiency of the evi-dence solution to the trustworthiness issue.Next, the dissent argues that under Texas' law "the prosecution need not introduce the victim's testimony at all, muchless any corroboration of that testimony."Post, at 559. Instead, "[u]nder both the old and new versions of the statute,a conviction could be sustained on the testimony of a singlethird-party witness, on purely circumstantial evidence, orin any number of other ways." Ibid. Because other avenues of prosecution--besides the victim's testimony (with orwithout corroboration or outcry)--remain available to theState, Article 38.07 "did not change the quantity of proofnecessary to convict in every case." Post, at 560 (emphasisadded in part and deleted in part); see also post, at 561 ("Article 38.07 has never dictated what it takes in all cases . . .for evidence to be sufficient to convict" (emphasis added)).Accordingly, the dissent urges, more evidence (in the formof corroboration) is not really required under Article 38.07.See post, at 560-561, 574. It is unclear whether the dissent'sargument is that laws cannot be sufficiency of the evidencerules unless they apply to every conviction for a particularcrime, or whether the dissent means that sufficiency rulesnot applicable in every prosecution for a particular crime donot fall within Calder's fourth category, which refers to lesstestimony "required . . . in order to convict the offender."3 Dall., at 390 (emphasis added in part and deleted in part).Either way, the argument fails.Fenwick's case once again provides the guide. The dissent agrees that "[t]he treason statute in effect at the timeof John Fenwick's conspiracy, like the Treason Clause ofour Constitution, embodied . . . a quantitative sufficiency[of the evidence] rule." Post, at 573. But, it argues, Fen529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN549Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwick's law and the Treason Clause are different from Article38.07; with the first two laws, "two witnesses [were] necessary to support a conviction," ibid. (emphasis added),whereas with Article 38.07, the victim's testimony plus corroboration is not "necessary to convict in every case," post,at 560 (emphasis added). But a closer look at Fenwick's lawand at the Treason Clause shows that this supposed distinction is simply incorrect. Fenwick's law stated that noperson could be convicted of high treason "but by andupon the Oaths and Testimony of Two lawfull Witnesses . . .unlesse the Party indicted and arraigned or tryed shallwillingly without violence in open Court confesse thesame or shall stand Mute or refuse to plead . . ." Seen. 15, supra (emphasis added). And the Treason Clause, ofcourse, states that "No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the sameovert Act, or on Confession in open Court." U. S. Const.,Art. III, $ 3 (emphasis added). Plainly, in neither instancewere two witnesses "necessary to support a conviction," asthe dissent claims. Accordingly, its assertion that Article38.07 "is nothing like the two-witness rule on which Fenwickvainly relied" appears erroneous, as does its accusation thatour reliance on Fenwick's case "simply will not wash." Post,at 573.34The dissent's final argument relies upon Hopt and runssomething like this. The "effect" of Article 38.07, it claims,is the same, in certain cases, as a witness credibility rule.See post, at 559, 563-566, 575. However differently Hopt34 Perhaps one can draw a distinction between convictions based on confessions in open court and convictions based on third-party evidence andthe like (though how such a distinction would comport with the languageof the fourth category is not apparent). For example, an accused's confession might be thought to be outside of the State's control. But see n. 24,supra. It is not clear at all, though, that the availability of evidence otherthan the victim's testimony is any more within the State's control than isthe defendant's confession.529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN550 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courttype laws and Article 38.07 may seem to operate on theirface, in practical application (at least in certain instances)their consequences are no different, and, accordingly, theyought to be treated alike. For example, if there were arule declaring a victim to be incompetent to testify unlessshe was under a certain age at the time of the offense, orhad made an outcry within a specified period of time, or hadother corroborating evidence, and the prosecution attemptedto rest its case on the victim's testimony alone without satisfying those requirements, the end result would be a judg-ment of acquittal.Post, at 564-565. Likewise, under Article 38.07, if the prosecution attempts to rest its case on thevictim's testimony alone without satisfying the Article's requirements, the result would also be an acquittal. Thus,Hopt-type laws and Article 38.07 should be treated the sameway for ex post facto purposes.This argument seeks to make Hopt controlling by ignoringwhat the case says. Hopt specifically distinguished lawsthat "alter the degree, or lessen the amount or measure,of the proof " required to convict from those laws thatmerely respect what kind of evidence may be introducedat trial. See supra, at 545. The above argument, though,simply denies any meaningful distinction between thosetypes of laws, on the premise that they produce the sameresults in some situations. See post, at 563 ("Such a victimis of course not literally forbidden from testifying, but thatcannot make the difference for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes between a sufficiency of the evidence rule and a witness competency rule"); post, at 571 ("Hopt cannot meaningfully be distinguished from the instant case"). In short,the argument finds Hopt controlling by erasing the case'scontrolling distinction.The argument also pays no heed to the example laid downby Fenwick's case. Surely we can imagine a witness competency rule that would operate in a manner similar to thelaw in that case (e. g., a witness to a treasonous act is not529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN551Cite as: 529 U. S. 513 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcompetent to testify unless corroborated by another witness). Plainly, the imagined rule does not mean that Fenwick's case is not an example of an ex post facto law. But ifthat is so, why should it be any different for Article 38.07?Just as we can imagine a witness competency rule that wouldoperate similarly to the statute in Fenwick's case, the aboveargument imagines a witness competency rule that operatessimilarly to Article 38.07. If the former does not change ourview of the law in Fenwick's case, why should the latterchange our view in the present circumstances?Moreover, the argument fails to account for what Calder'sfourth category actually says, and tells only half the story ofwhat a witness competency rule does. As for what Caldersays, the fourth category applies to "[e]very law that altersthe legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different,testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender." 3 Dall.,at 390 (emphasis deleted). The last six words are crucial.The relevant question is whether the law affects the quantum of evidence required to convict; a witness competencyrule that (in certain instances at least) has the practicaleffect of telling us what evidence would result in acquittaldoes not really speak to Calder's fourth category.As for relating only half the story, the dissent's argumentrests on the assertion that sometimes a witness competencyrule will result in acquittals in the same instances in whichArticle 38.07 would also demand an acquittal. That may beconceded, but it is only half the story--and, as just noted,not the most relevant half. The other half concerns what awitness competency rule has to say about the evidence"required . . . in order to convict the offender." The answeris, nothing at all. As mentioned earlier, see supra, at 546-547, prosecutors may satisfy all the requirements of anynumber of witness competency rules, but this says absolutelynothing about whether they have introduced a quantum of529US2 Unit: $U52 [09-26-01 10:36:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN552 CARMELL v. TEXASOpinion of the Courtevidence sufficient to convict the offender. Sufficiency of theevidence rules, however, tell us precisely that.35XFor these reasons, we hold that petitioner's convictions oncounts 7 through 10, insofar as they are not corroborated byother evidence, cannot be sustained under the Ex Post FactoClause, because Texas' amendment to Article 38.07 fallswithin Calder's fourth category. It seems worth remem-bering, at this point, Joseph Story's observation about theClause:" `If the laws in being do not punish an offender, let himgo unpunished; let the legislature, admonished of the35 The dissent contends that the witness competency rule "would produce the same results" as a sufficiency rule, post, at 564-565 (emphasis deleted), and above we have been willing to assume as much for argument'ssake. But the dissent's statement is not entirely correct. It would notbe the witness competency rule that would produce the same result, butthat rule in combination with the normally operative sufficiency rule.Failure to comply with the requirements of Article 38.07, by contrast,would mean that the evidence is insufficient to convict by the force of thatlaw alone. That difference demonstrates the very distinction betweenwitness competency rules and sufficiency of the evidence rules, points toprecisely the distinction that Hopt drew, and illustrates why (contrary tothe dissent's contention) our conclusion about Article 38.07 does not applyto "countless evidentiary rules." Post, at 571.That is also why the dissent's statement that we have been "misdirected" by the plain text of Article 38.07 is wrong. Post, at 564. Thedissent asserts that "any evidence" admitted under an applicable ruleof evidence could "potentially" support a conviction, ibid., and thereforeArticle 38.07's explicit specification that a conviction "is supportable" ifits requirements are met does not distinguish it from ordinary rules ofevidence. Once again, we point out that whether certain evidence cansupport a conviction is not determined by the rule of admissibility itself,but by some other, separate, normally operative sufficiency of the evidence rule. The distinction the dissent finds illusive is that Article 38.07itself determines the evidence's sufficiency (that is why it is a sufficiencyof the evidence rule), while witness competency rules and other ordinaryrules of evidence do not (because they are admissibility rules, not sufficiency rules).
