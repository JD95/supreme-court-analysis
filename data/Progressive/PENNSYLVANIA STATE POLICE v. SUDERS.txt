Plaintiff-respondent Nancy Drew Suders alleged sexuallyharassing conduct by her supervisors, officers of the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), of such severity she was forced toresign. The question presented concerns the proof burdensparties bear when a sexual harassment/constructive dis-charge claim of that character is asserted under Title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.To establish hostile work environment, plaintiffs like Suders must show harassing behavior "sufficiently severe orpervasive to alter the conditions of [their] employment."Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.

Beyond that, we hold, to establish "constructive discharge," the plaintiff must make afurther showing: She must show that the abusive workingenvironment became so intolerable that her resignation qual-ified as a fitting response. An employer may defend againstsuch a claim by showing both (1) that it had installeda readily accessible and effective policy for reporting andresolving complaints of sexual harassment, and (2) thatthe plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of thatemployer-provided preventive or remedial apparatus. Thisaffirmative defense will not be available to the employer,however, if the plaintiff quits in reasonable response to anemployer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing heremployment status or situation, for example, a humiliatingdemotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position inwhich she would face unbearable working conditions. In soruling today, we follow the path marked by our 1998 decisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742,and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775.IBecause this case was decided against Suders in the Dis-trict Court on the PSP's motion for summary judgment, werecite the facts, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, inthe light most favorable to Suders.1 In March 1998, the PSPhired Suders as a police communications operator for the Mc-Connellsburg barracks. Suders v. Easton, 325 F. 3d 432, 436(CA3 2003). Suders' supervisors were Sergeant Eric D.Easton, Station Commander at the McConnellsburg barracks, Patrol Corporal William D. Baker, and Corporal EricB. Prendergast.Ibid. Those three supervisors subjected1 The PSP, we note, "vigorously dispute[s]" the truth of Suders' allegations, contending that some of the incidents she describes "never happenedat all," while "others took place in a context quite different from thatsuggested by [Suders]."

S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the CourtSuders to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment thatceased only when she resigned from the force. Ibid.Easton "would bring up [the subject of] people having sexwith animals" each time Suders entered his office. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). He told Prendergast, infront of Suders, that young girls should be given instructionin how to gratify men with oral sex. Ibid. Easton alsowould sit down near Suders, wearing spandex shorts, andspread his legs apart. Ibid. Apparently imitating a movepopularized by television wrestling, Baker repeatedly madean obscene gesture in Suders' presence by grabbing his geni-tals and shouting out a vulgar comment inviting oral sex.Id., at 437. Baker made this gesture as many as five-to-tentimes per night throughout Suders' employment at the barracks. Ibid. Suders once told Baker she " `d[id]n't think[he] should be doing this' "; Baker responded by jumping ona chair and again performing the gesture, with the accompa-nying vulgarity.Ibid. Further, Baker would "rub his rearend in front of her and remark `I have a nice ass, don't I?' "Ibid. Prendergast told Suders " `the village idiot could doher job' "; wearing black gloves, he would pound on furnitureto intimidate her. Ibid.2In June 1998, Prendergast accused Suders of taking amissing accident file home with her. Id., at 438. After thatincident, Suders approached the PSP's Equal EmploymentOpportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, and told her she"might need some help."Ibid. Smith-Elliott gave Sudersher telephone number, but neither woman followed up on theconversation. Ibid. On August 18, 1998, Suders contactedSmith-Elliott again, this time stating that she was being harassed and was afraid. Ibid. Smith-Elliott told Suders to2 In addition, the supervisors made derogatory remarks about Suders'age, e. g., stating " `a 25-year-old could catch on faster' " than she could,325 F. 3d, at 436, and calling her " `momma,' " id., at 437. They furtherharassed her for having political influence. Ibid. Suders' age andpolitical-affiliation discrimination claims are not before us.542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtfile a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the nec-essary form. Smith-Elliott's response and the manner inwhich it was conveyed appeared to Suders insensitive andunhelpful.Ibid.Two days later, Suders' supervisors arrested her for theft,and Suders resigned from the force. The theft arrest occurred in the following circumstances. Suders had severaltimes taken a computer-skills exam to satisfy a PSP job re-quirement.Id., at 438-439. Each time, Suders' supervisors told her that she had failed. Id., at 439. Suders oneday came upon her exams in a set of drawers in the women'slocker room. She concluded that her supervisors had neverforwarded the tests for grading and that their reports of herfailures were false. Ibid. Regarding the tests as her property, Suders removed them from the locker room. Ibid.;App. 11, 119-120. Upon finding that the exams had beenremoved, Suders' supervisors devised a plan to arrest herfor theft. 325 F. 3d, at 438-439. The officers dusted thedrawer in which the exams had been stored with a theftdetection powder that turns hands blue when touched. Id.,at 439. As anticipated by Easton, Baker, and Prendergast,Suders attempted to return the tests to the drawer, whereupon her hands turned telltale blue. Ibid. The supervisorsthen apprehended and handcuffed her, photographed herblue hands, and commenced to question her. Ibid. Sudershad previously prepared a written resignation, which shetendered soon after the supervisors detained her. Ibid.Nevertheless, the supervisors initially refused to release her.Instead, they brought her to an interrogation room, gave herwarnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),and continued to question her. 325 F. 3d, at 439. Suders reiterated that she wanted to resign, and Easton thenlet her leave. Ibid. The PSP never brought theft chargesagainst her.In September 2000, Suders sued the PSP in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN137Cite as: 542 U.

App. 1, 12-13.3 At the close ofdiscovery, the District Court granted the PSP's motion forsummary judgment. Suders' testimony, the District Courtrecognized, sufficed to permit a trier of fact to conclude thatthe supervisors had created a hostile work environment.App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a. The court nevertheless held thatthe PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors' conduct. Id., at 80a.In so concluding, the District Court referred to our 1998decision in Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775. See App.to Pet. for Cert. 77a-78a. InFaragher, along with Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, decided thesame day, the Court distinguished between supervisor harassment unaccompanied by an adverse official act and super-visor harassment attended by "a tangible employment action." Id., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808. Bothdecisions hold that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that "culminates in a tangible employmentaction, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524U. S., at 808. But when no tangible employment action istaken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise anaffirmative defense to liability, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence: "The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonablecare to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassingbehavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably3 Suders raised several other claims that are not at issue here, includingclaims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),81 Stat. 602, 29 U.

S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524U. S., at 807.Suders' hostile work environment claim was untenable asa matter of law, the District Court stated, because she "unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSP's internal procedures for reporting any harassment." App. to Pet. for Cert.80a. Resigning just two days after she first mentioned anything about harassment to Equal Employment OpportunityOfficer Smith-Elliott, the court noted, Suders had "nevergiven [the PSP] the opportunity to respond to [her] com-plaints."Ibid. The District Court did not address Suders'constructive discharge claim.4The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed andremanded the case for disposition on the merits. 325 F. 3d,at 462. The Third Circuit agreed with the District Courtthat Suders had presented evidence sufficient for a trier offact to conclude that the supervisors had engaged in a "pattern of sexual harassment that was pervasive and regular."Id., at 442. But the appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two fundamental respects. First, the Courtof Appeals held that, even assuming the PSP could assertthe affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher,4 The District Court disposed of all other claims in the PSP's favor. Thecourt granted the PSP summary judgment on Suders' Title VII retaliationclaim, observing that Suders did not engage in any protected activity, e. g.,she did not file a discrimination claim, prior to her resignation. Id., at80a-81a. It dismissed Suders' ADEA and PHRA claims against the PSPon sovereign immunity grounds, id., at 72a-73a, and her Title VII andADEA claims against the individual defendants on the ground that thosestatutes do not provide for individual liability, id., at 70a-72a. The courtalso dismissed the PHRA claims against the individual defendants becauseSuders had failed to respond to the defendants' assertions of immunity.Id., at 73a-74a. Suders did not raise any of the above claims on appeal.See Brief for Appellant in No. 01-3512 (CA3), p. 2; Brief for Appellees inNo. 01-3512, p. 4.542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Courtgenuine issues of material fact existed concerning the effec-tiveness of the PSP's "program . . . to address sexual harassment claims." 325 F. 3d, at 443. Second, the appeals courtheld that the District Court erred in failing to recognize thatSuders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due tothe hostile work environment. Ibid.5A plaintiff alleging constructive discharge in violation ofTitle VII, the Court of Appeals stated, must establish:"(1) he or she suffered harassment or discrimination sointolerable that a reasonable person in the same positionwould have felt compelled to resign . . . ; and (2) theemployee's reaction to the workplace situation--that is,his or her decision to resign--was reasonable given thetotality of circumstances . . . ."Id., at 445.Viewing the complaint in that context, the court determinedthat Suders had raised genuine issues of material fact relating to her claim of constructive discharge. Id., at 446.The Court of Appeals then made the ruling challengedhere: It held that "a constructive discharge, when proved,constitutes a tangible employment action."Id., at 447.Under Ellerth and Faragher, the court observed, such anaction renders an employer strictly liable and precludes em-ployer recourse to the affirmative defense announced inthose decisions. 325 F. 3d, at 447. The Third Circuit recog-nized that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and SixthCircuits had ruled otherwise. A constructive discharge re-sulting from a supervisor-created hostile work environment,both Circuits had held, does not qualify as a tangible employ-ment action, and therefore does not stop an employer from5 Although Suders' complaint did not expressly mention constructive discharge, the Third Circuit found "[t]he allegations of constructive discharge. . . apparent on the face of Suders's [pleading]." 325 F. 3d, at 443; seeibid. ("In the very first paragraph, Suders alleged that she was `forced tosuffer a termination of employment because she would not yield to sexualsuggestions [and] innuendoes . . . .' " (quoting Introductory Statement toSuders' complaint, reprinted in this Court at App. 6)).542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtinvoking the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. 325 F.3d, at 452-453 (citingCaridad v. Metro-North CommuterR. Co., 191 F. 3d 283, 294 (CA2 1999), and Turner v. Dowbrands, Inc., No. 99-3984, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (CA6, June 26,2000) (unpublished)). The Third Circuit, however, reasonedthat a constructive discharge " `constitutes a significantchange in employment status' by ending the employeremployee relationship" and "also inflicts the same type of`direct economic harm' " as the tangible employment actionsEllerth and Faragher offered by way of example (discharge,demotion, undesirable reassignment). 325 F. 3d, at 460(quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761, 762). Satisfied that Suders had "raised genuine issues of material fact as to herclaim of constructive discharge," and that the PSP was "precluded from asserting the affirmative defense to liability advanced in support of its motion for summary judgment," theCourt of Appeals remanded Suders' Title VII claim for trial.325 F. 3d, at 461.This Court granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1046 (2003), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits on the questionwhether a constructive discharge brought about by supervisor harassment ranks as a tangible employment action andtherefore precludes assertion of the affirmative defense articulated in Ellerth and Faragher. Compare 325 F. 3d, at461 (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangible employment action); Jaros v. LodgeNet Entertainment Corp., 294F. 3d 960, 966 (CA8 2002) (same), with Caridad, 191 F. 3d, at294 (constructive discharge does not qualify as a tangibleemployment action); Turner, 2000 WL 924599, *1 (same), andReed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F. 3d 27, 33(CA1 2003) (constructive discharge qualifies as a tangibleemployment action only when effected through a supervisor's official act); Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F. 3d 317, 336(CA7 2003) (same). We conclude that an employer does nothave recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defensewhen a supervisor's official act precipitates the constructive542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN141Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Courtdischarge; absent such a "tangible employment action," however, the defense is available to the employer whose supervisors are charged with harassment. We therefore vacate theThird Circuit's judgment and remand the case for furtherproceedings.IIAUnder the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee'sreasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes. See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 838-839 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafterLindemann & Grossman). The inquiry is objective: Didworking conditions become so intolerable that a reasonableperson in the employee's position would have felt compelledto resign? See C. Weirich et al., 2002 Cumulative Supplement to Lindemann & Grossman 651-652, and n. 1 (collectingcases) (hereinafter Weirich).The constructive discharge concept originated in thelabor-law field in the 1930's; the National Labor RelationsBoard (NLRB) developed the doctrine to address situationsin which employers coerced employees to resign, often bycreating intolerable working conditions, in retaliation for employees' engagement in collective activities. Lieb, Constructive Discharge Under Section 8(a)(3) of the NationalLabor Relations Act: A Study in Undue Concern Over Motives, 7 Indus. Rel. L. J. 143, 146-148 (1985); see In re Sterling Corset Co., 9 N. L. R. B. 858, 865 (1938) (first case to useterm "constructive discharg[e]"). Over the next two decades, Courts of Appeals sustained NLRB constructive discharge rulings. See, e. g., NLRB v. East Texas MotorFreight Lines, 140 F. 2d 404, 405 (CA5 1944) (first Circuitcase to hold supervisor-caused resignation an unfair laborpractice); NLRB v. Saxe-Glassman Shoe Corp., 201 F. 2d 238,243 (CA1 1953) (first Circuit case to allow backpay award for542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN142 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtconstructive discharge). By 1964, the year Title VII wasenacted, the doctrine was solidly established in the federalcourts. See Comment, That's It, I Quit: Returning to FirstPrinciples in Constructive Discharge Doctrine, 23 BerkeleyJ. Emp. & Lab. L. 401, 410 (2002).The Courts of Appeals have recognized constructive discharge claims in a wide range of Title VII cases. See, e. g.,Robinson, 351 F. 3d, at 336-337 (sexual harassment); Moorev.KUKA Welding Systems & Robot Corp., 171 F. 3d 1073,1080 (CA6 1999) (race); Bergstrom-Ek v. Best Oil Co., 153F. 3d 851, 858-859 (CA8 1998) (pregnancy);Amirmokri v.Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 60 F. 3d 1126, 1132-1133 (CA41995) (national origin); Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F. 2d 340,343 (CA10 1986) (sex); Young v. Southwestern Sav. & LoanAssn., 509 F. 2d 140, 143-144 (CA5 1975) (religion). See alsoGoss v. Exxon Office Systems Co., 747 F. 2d 885, 887 (CA31984) ("[A]pplication of the constructive discharge doctrineto Title VII cases has received apparently universal recognition among the courts of appeals which have addressed thatissue."); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law $ 59.05[8](2003) (collecting cases). And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency chargedwith implementing Title VII, has stated: An employer "isresponsible for a constructive discharge in the same mannerthat it is responsible for the outright discriminatory discharge of a charging party." 2 EEOC Compliance Manual$612.9(a) (2002).Although this Court has not had occasion earlier to holdthat a claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII,we have recognized constructive discharge in the labor-lawcontext, see Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 894 (1984)(NLRB may find employer engaged in unfair labor practice"when, for the purpose of discouraging union activity, . . .[the employer] creates working conditions so intolerable thatthe employee has no option but to resign--a so-called `constructive discharge.' "). Furthermore, we have stated that542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN143Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Court"Title VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alter-ations in the terms or conditions of employment." Ellerth,524 U. S., at 752. See also Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.Vinson, 477 U. S., at 64 ("The phrase `terms, conditions, orprivileges of employment' [in Title VII] evinces a congres-sional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparatetreatment of men and women in employment." (some inter-nal quotation marks omitted)). We agree with the lowercourts and the EEOC that Title VII encompasses employerliability for a constructive discharge.BThis case concerns an employer's liability for one subsetof Title VII constructive discharge claims: constructive discharge resulting from sexual harassment, or "hostile workenvironment," attributable to a supervisor. Our startingpoint is the framework Ellerth and Faragher established togovern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors.6 As earlier noted, see supra, at 137-138, those deci-sions delineate two categories of hostile work environmentclaims: (1) harassment that "culminates in a tangible employ-ment action," for which employers are strictly liable, Ellerth,524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 808, and(2) harassment that takes place in the absence of a tangibleemployment action, to which employers may assert an af-firmative defense, Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765; accord Faragher,524 U. S., at 807. With the background set out above inmind, we turn to the key issues here at stake: Into whichEllerth/Faragher category do hostile-environment construc-tive discharge claims fall--and what proof burdens do theparties bear in such cases.InEllerth and Faragher, the plaintiffs-employees soughtto hold their employers vicariously liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors, even though the plaintiffs "suf6 Ellerth and Faragher expressed no view on the employer liabilitystandard for co-worker harassment. Nor do we.542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN144 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtfer[ed] no adverse, tangible job consequences." Ellerth, 524U. S., at 747. Setting out a framework for employer liabilityin those decisions, this Court noted that Title VII's definitionof "employer" includes the employer's "agent[s]," 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e(b). See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 754. We viewed thatdefinition as a direction to "interpret Title VII based onagency principles." Ibid. The Restatement (Second) ofAgency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement), the Court noted,states (in its black-letter formulation) that an employer isliable for the acts of its agent when the agent " `was aided inaccomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.' " Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758 (quoting Restatement$ 219(2)(d)); accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801.We then identified "a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisortakes a tangible employment action against the subordinate." Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. A tangible employmentaction, the Court explained, "constitutes a significant changein employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits."Id., at 761. Unlike injuries that could equally be inflictedby a co-worker, we stated, tangible employment actions "fallwithin the special province of the supervisor," who "has beenempowered by the company as . . . [an] agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or hercontrol." Id., at 762. The tangible employment action, theCourt elaborated, is, in essential character, "an official act ofthe enterprise, a company act." Ibid. It is "the means bywhich the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates." Ibid. Often, the supervisor will "use [the company's] internal processes" and thereby"obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise." Ibid. Ordinarily, the tangible employment decision "is documented inofficial company records, and may be subject to review by542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN145Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Courthigher level supervisors." Ibid. In sum, we stated, "whena supervisor takes a tangible employment action against asubordinate[,] . . . it would be implausible to interpret agencyprinciples to allow an employer to escape liability."Id., at762-763.When a supervisor's harassment of a subordinate does notculminate in a tangible employment action, the Court nextexplained, it is "less obvious" that the agency relation is thedriving force.Id., at 763. We acknowledged that a supervisor's "power and authority invests his or her harassing con-duct with a particular threatening character, and in thissense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation."Ibid. But we also recognized that "there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the sameacts a coemployee would commit, and there may be somecircumstances where the supervisor's status [would] mak[e]little difference." Ibid.An "aided-by-the-agency-relation" standard, the Courtsuggested, was insufficiently developed to press into serviceas the standard governing cases in which no tangible employment action is in the picture. Looking elsewhere forguidance, we focused on Title VII's design "to encourage thecreation of antiharassment policies and effective grievancemechanisms." Id., at 764. The Court reasoned that tyingthe liability standard to an employer's effort to install effective grievance procedures would advance Congress' purpose"to promote conciliation rather than litigation" of Title VIIcontroversies. Ibid. At the same time, such linkage of liability limitation to effective preventive and corrective measures could serve Title VII's deterrent purpose by "encourag[ing] employees to report harassing conduct before itbecomes severe or pervasive." Ibid. Accordingly, we heldthat when no tangible employment action is taken, the employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing, as an affirmative defense, both that"the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and cor542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN146 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtrect promptly any sexually harassing behavior," and that"the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities providedby the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Id., at 765;accord Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807.Ellerth and Faragher also clarified the parties' respectiveproof burdens in hostile environment cases. Title VII, theCourt noted, "borrows from tort law the avoidable consequences doctrine," Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764, under whichvictims have "a duty `to use such means as are reasonableunder the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages'that result from violations of the statute,"Faragher, 524U. S., at 806 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219,231, n. 15 (1982)). The Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defenseaccommodates that doctrine by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm. But both decisions placethe burden squarely on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm. Ellerth,524 U. S., at 765; accordFaragher, 524 U. S., at 807; cf. C.McCormick, Law of Damages 130 (1935) (defendant has burden of persuading factfinder "plaintiff could reasonably havereduced his loss or avoided injurious consequences").71The constructive discharge here at issue stems from, andcan be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassmentor hostile work environment. For an atmosphere of sexualharassment or hostility to be actionable, we reiterate, seesupra, at 133-134, the offending behavior "must be suffi-ciently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the vic7 The employer is in the best position to know what remedial proceduresit offers to employees and how those procedures operate.

A hostile-environment constructivedischarge claim entails something more: A plaintiff who advances such a compound claim must show working conditionsso intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. See, e. g., Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., 164 F. 3d 1151, 1160 (CA8 1999) ("[A]lthoughthere may be evidence from which a jury could find sexualharassment, . . . the facts alleged [for constructive dischargemust be] . . . so intolerable that a reasonable person wouldbe forced to quit."); Perry v. Harris Chernin, Inc., 126 F. 3d1010, 1015 (CA7 1997) ("[U]nless conditions are beyond `ordinary' discrimination, a complaining employee is expected toremain on the job while seeking redress.").8Suders' claim is of the same genre as the hostile work environment claims the Court analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher.9Essentially, Suders presents a "worse case" harassment sce8 As earlier noted, see supra, at 141, a prevailing constructive dischargeplaintiff is entitled to all damages available for formal discharge. Theplaintiff may recover postresignation damages, including both backpayand, in fitting circumstances, frontpay, see 1 Lindemann & Grossman 838;Weirich 651, as well as the compensatory and punitive damages now provided for Title VII claims generally, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1); Pollard v.E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 532 U. S. 843, 848 (2001) (noting expandedremedies under Civil Rights Act of 1991).9 Both the Ellerth and Faragher plaintiffs resigned from their posts;plaintiff Ellerth expressly alleged constructive discharge. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 748-749 (1998); Faragher v.Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 783 (1998). Although Ellerth's constructivedischarge claim was not before this Court, the decision's omission of constructive discharge from its examples of tangible employment actions isconspicuous. See 524 U. S., at 761; Brief for Chamber of Commerce of theUnited States as Amicus Curiae 10 ("[T]his Court's omission of constructive discharge in its discussion of tangible employment actions was widelyregarded as a purposeful one."). Tellingly, we stated that Ellerth "ha[d]not alleged she suffered a tangible employment action," despite the factthat her complaint alleged constructive discharge. 524 U. S., at 766.542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN148 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtnario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point. Likethe harassment considered in our pathmarking decisions,harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may beeffected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisoryconduct, or official company acts. Unlike an actual termina-tion, which isalways effected through an official act of thecompany, a constructive discharge need not be. A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leaveand precipitating conduct: The former involves no official action; the latter, like a harassment claim without any con-structive discharge assertion, may or may not involve officialaction. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.To be sure, a constructive discharge is functionally thesame as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects. See supra, at 147, n. 8. As the Third Circuit observed, both "en[d] the employer-employee relationship,"and both "inflic[t] . . . direct economic harm." 325 F. 3d, at460 (internal quotation marks omitted). But when an official act does not underlie the constructive discharge, the Ellerth and Faragher analysis, we here hold, calls for extensionof the affirmative defense to the employer. As those leadingdecisions indicate, official directions and declarations are theacts most likely to be brought home to the employer, themeasures over which the employer can exercise greatest control. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Absent "an official actof the enterprise," ibid., as the last straw, the employer ordinarily would have no particular reason to suspect that a resignation is not the typical kind daily occurring in the workforce. And as Ellerth and Faragher further point out, anofficial act reflected in company records--a demotion or areduction in compensation, for example--shows "beyondquestion" that the supervisor has used his managerial or controlling position to the employee's disadvantage. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. Absent such an official act, the extent to which the supervisor's misconduct has been aided bythe agency relation, as we earlier recounted, see supra, at542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN149Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Court145, is less certain. That uncertainty, our precedent estab-lishes, seesupra, at 145-146, justifies affording the employerthe chance to establish, through the Ellerth/Faragher af-firmative defense, that it should not be held vicariouslyliable.The Third Circuit drew the line differently. Under its formulation, the affirmative defense would be eliminated in allhostile-environment constructive discharge cases, but re-tained, asEllerth and Faragher require, in "ordinary" hostilework environment cases, i. e., cases involving no tangible em-ployment action. That placement of the line, anomalously,would make the graver claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge easier to prove than its lesser includedcomponent, hostile work environment. Moreover, the ThirdCircuit's formulation, that court itself recognized, wouldmake matters complex, indeed, more than a little confusingto jurors. Creation of a hostile work environment is a necessary predicate to a hostile-environment constructive discharge case. Juries would be so informed. Under theThird Circuit's decision, a jury, presumably, would be cautioned to consider the affirmative-defense evidence only inreaching a decision on the hostile work environment claim,and to ignore or at least downplay that same evidence indeciding the closely associated constructive discharge claim.It makes scant sense thus to alter the decisive instructionsfrom one claim to the next when the only variation betweenthe two claims is the severity of the hostile working conditions. Cf. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801 (affirming "the virtueof categorical clarity").We note, finally, two recent Court of Appeals decisionsthat indicate how the "official act" (or "tangible employmentaction") criterion should play out when constructive discharge is alleged. Both decisions advance the untangled approach we approve in this opinion. In Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., 333 F. 3d 27 (CA1 2003), the plaintiffclaimed a constructive discharge based on her supervisor's542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN150 PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERSOpinion of the Courtrepeated sexual comments and an incident in which he sexu-ally assaulted her. The First Circuit held that the allegedwrongdoing did not preclude the employer from assertingthe Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. As the court explained in Reed, the supervisor's behavior involved no officialactions. Unlike, "e. g., an extremely dangerous job assignment to retaliate for spurned advances," 333 F. 3d, at 33, thesupervisor's conduct inReed "was exceedingly unofficial andinvolved no direct exercise of company authority"; indeed, itwas "exactly the kind of wholly unauthorized conduct forwhich the affirmative defense was designed," ibid. In contrast, in Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F. 3d 317 (CA7 2003),after the plaintiff complained that she was sexually harassedby the judge for whom she worked, the presiding judge de-cided to transfer her to another judge, but told her that "herfirst six months [in the new post] probably would be `hell,' "and that it was in her " `best interest to resign.' " Id., at324. The Seventh Circuit held that the employer was pre-cluded from asserting the affirmative defense to the plaintiff 's constructive discharge claim. The Robinson plaintiff 'sdecision to resign, the court explained, "resulted, at least inpart, from [the presiding judge's] official actio[n] in transfer-ring" her to a judge who resisted placing her on his staff.Id., at 337. The courts in Reed and Robinson properly rec-ognized thatEllerth and Faragher, which divided the uni-verse of supervisor-harassment claims according to the presence or absence of an official act, mark the path constructivedischarge claims based on harassing conduct must follow.2In its summation, the Third Circuit qualified its holdingthat a constructive discharge itself "constitutes a tangibleemployment action within the meaning of Ellerth andFaragher." 325 F. 3d, at 462. The affirmative defense Ellerth and Faragher delineated, the court said, might be im-ported into the anterior issue whether "the employee's deci542US1 Unit: $U62 [10-25-06 13:51:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN151Cite as: 542 U. S. 129 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsion to resign was reasonable under the circumstances."325 F. 3d, at 462.10 As the Third Circuit expressed itsthinking:"[I]t may be relevant to a claim of constructive discharge whether an employer had an effective remedialscheme in place, whether an employer attempted to investigate, or otherwise to address, plaintiff 's complaints,and whether plaintiff took advantage of alternatives offered by antiharassment programs." Ibid.These considerations, the Third Circuit recognized, "are, ofcourse, the same considerations relevant to the affirmativedefense in Ellerth and Faragher." Ibid.The Third Circuit left open when and how the Ellerth/Faragher considerations would be brought home to the facttrier. It did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens. It simply relied on "the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none ofthe evidence relating to employers' antiharassment programsand to employees' exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial." 325 F. 3d, at 463.10 For similar expressions, see, e. g., Jaros v. LodgeNet EntertainmentCorp., 294 F. 3d 960, 965 (CA8 2002) (though not entitled to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, employer facing constructive dischargecomplaint may assert that plaintiff "did not give it a chance to respond toher [grievance]" in rebutting plaintiff's contention that conditions were sointolerable as to force her resignation); Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico,Inc., 304 F. 3d 7, 28 (CA1 2002) ("the jury reasonably can take into accounthow the employer responded to the plaintiff's complaints, if any," in deciding whether conditions were intolerable); Hartman v.

SUDERSThomas, J., dissentingWe see no cause for leaving the district courts thus un-guided. Following Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiff whoalleges no tangible employment action has the duty to miti-gate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege andprove that the plaintiff failed in that regard. See supra, at146. The plaintiff might elect to allege facts relevant to mitigation in her pleading or to present those facts in her casein chief, but she would do so in anticipation of the employer'saffirmative defense, not as a legal requirement.* * *We agree with the Third Circuit that the case, in its cur-rent posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders' hostile work environment and constructivedischarge claims.11 We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring the affirmative defense described inEllerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases. Accordingly, we vacate the Third Circuit'sjudgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
