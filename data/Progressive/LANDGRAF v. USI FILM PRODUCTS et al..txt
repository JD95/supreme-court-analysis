The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) creates aright to recover compensatory and punitive damages for certain violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.See Rev.

A fellow employee named John Williams repeatedlyharassed her with inappropriate remarks and physical contact. Petitioner's complaints to her immediate supervisorbrought her no relief, but when she reported the incidentsto the personnel manager, he conducted an investigation,reprimanded Williams, and transferred him to another de-partment. Four days later petitioner quit her job.Petitioner filed a timely charge with the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission).The Commission determined that petitioner had likely beenthe victim of sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., but concluded that her em-ployer had adequately remedied the violation. Accordingly,the Commission dismissed the charge and issued a notice ofright to sue.On July 21, 1989, petitioner commenced this action againstUSI, its corporate owner, and that company's successor ininterest.2 After a bench trial, the District Court found thatWilliams had sexually harassed petitioner causing her to suffer mental anguish. However, the court concluded that shehad not been constructively discharged. The court said:"Although the harassment was serious enough toestablish that a hostile work environment existed forLandgraf, it was not so severe that a reasonable per-son would have felt compelled to resign. This is particularly true in light of the fact that at the time Land-graf resigned from her job, USI had taken steps . . . toeliminate the hostile working environment arising fromthe sexual harassment. Landgraf voluntarily resigned2 Respondent Quantum Chemical Corporation owned the USI plantwhen petitioner worked there.

B-3-4.Because the court found that petitioner's employment wasnot terminated in violation of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief, and because Title VII did not thenauthorize any other form of relief, the court dismissed hercomplaint.On November 21, 1991, while petitioner's appeal was pending, the President signed into law the Civil Rights Act of1991. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argumentthat her case should be remanded for a jury trial on damagespursuant to the 1991 Act. Its decision not to remand restedon the premise that "a court must `apply the law in effect atthe time it renders its decision, unless doing so would resultin manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legisla-tive history to the contrary.'Bradley [v. School Bd. ofRichmond, 416 U. S. 696, 711 (1974)]." 968 F. 2d 427, 432(CA5 1992). Commenting first on the provision for a jurytrial in $ 102(c), the court stated that requiring the defendant"to retry this case because of a statutory change enactedafter the trial was completed would be an injustice and awaste of judicial resources. We apply procedural rules topending cases, but we do not invalidate procedures followedbefore the new rule was adopted." Id., at 432-433. Thecourt then characterized the provision for compensatory andpunitive damages in $ 102 as "a seachange in employer liabil-ity for Title VII violations" and concluded that it would beunjust to apply this kind of additional and unforeseeable obli-gation to conduct occurring before the effective date of theAct. Id., at 433. Finding no clear error in the DistrictCourt's factual findings, the Court of Appeals affirmed thejudgment for respondents.We granted certiorari and set the case for argument withRivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., post, p. 298. Our orderlimited argument to the question whether $ 102 of the 1991511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT250 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the CourtAct applies to cases pending when it became law. 507 U. S.908 (1993). Accordingly, for purposes of our decision, weassume that the District Court and the Court of Appealsproperly applied the law in effect at the time of the discriminatory conduct and that the relevant findings of factwere correct. We therefore assume that petitioner was thevictim of sexual harassment violative of Title VII, but thatthe law did not then authorize any recovery of damages eventhough she was injured. We also assume, arguendo, that ifthe same conduct were to occur today, petitioner would beentitled to a jury trial and that the jury might find that shewas constructively discharged, or that her mental anguish orother injuries would support an award of damages againsther former employer. Thus, the controlling question iswhether the Court of Appeals should have applied the lawin effect at the time the discriminatory conduct occurred, orat the time of its decision in July 1992.IIPetitioner's primary submission is that the text of the 1991Act requires that it be applied to cases pending on its enactment. Her argument, if accepted, would make the entireAct (with two narrow exceptions) applicable to conduct thatoccurred, and to cases that were filed, before the Act's effec-tive date. Although only $ 102 is at issue in this case, wepreface our analysis with a brief description of the scope ofthe 1991 Act.The 1991 Act is in large part a response to a series ofdecisions of this Court interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of1866 and 1964. Section 3(4), 105 Stat. 1071, note following42 U. S. C. $ 1981, expressly identifies as one of the Act's purposes "to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Courtby expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes inorder to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimi-nation." That section, as well as a specific finding in $ 2(2),identifies Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT251Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Court(1989), as a decision that gave rise to special concerns.3 Sec-tion 105 of the Act, entitled "Burden of Proof in DisparateImpact Cases," is a direct response to Wards Cove.Other sections of the Act were obviously drafted with "recent decisions of the Supreme Court" in mind. Thus, $ 101(which is at issue in Rivers, post, p. 298) amended the 1866Civil Rights Act's prohibition of racial discrimination in the"mak[ing] and enforce[ment] [of] contracts," 42 U. S. C. $ 1981(1988 ed., Supp. IV), in response toPatterson v. McLeanCredit Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989); $ 107 responds to PriceWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), by setting forthstandards applicable in "mixed motive" cases; $ 108 respondstoMartin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755 (1989), by prohibiting certain challenges to employment practices implementing consent decrees; $ 109 responds to EEOC v. Arabian AmericanOil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991), by redefining the term "employee" as used in Title VII to include certain United Statescitizens working in foreign countries for United States employers; $ 112 responds to Lorance v. AT&T Technologies,Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989), by expanding employees' rights tochallenge discriminatory seniority systems; $ 113 responds toWest Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83(1991), by providing that an award of attorney's fees mayinclude expert fees; and $ 114 responds to Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310 (1986), by allowing interest onjudgments against the United States.A number of important provisions in the Act, however,were not responses to Supreme Court decisions. For example, $ 106 enacts a new prohibition against adjusting test3 Section 2(2) finds that the Wards Cove decision "has weakened thescope and effectiveness of Federal civil rights protections," and $ 3(2)expresses Congress' intent "to codify" certain concepts enunciated in"Supreme Court decisions prior to Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490U. S. 642 (1989)." We take note of the express references to that casebecause it is the focus of $ 402(b), on which petitioner places particularreliance.

S. C. 2000e-5) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimi-nation (not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) prohibited under section703, 704, or 717 of the Act (42 U. S. C. 2000e-2 or 2000e-3), and provided that the complaining party cannot re-cover under section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42U. S. C. 1981), the complaining party may recover com-pensatory and punitive damages . . . in addition to anyrelief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, from the respondent.. . . . ."(c) Jury Trial.--If a complaining party seeks compensa-tory or punitive damages under this section--"(1) any party may demand a trial by jury."Before the enactment of the 1991 Act, Title VII affordedonly "equitable" remedies. The primary form of monetary relief available was backpay.4 Title VII's backpay rem4 We have not decided whether a plaintiff seeking backpay under TitleVII is entitled to a jury trial. See, e. g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc.,494 U. S. 545, 549, n. 1 (1990) (assuming without deciding no right to jurytrial); Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 572 (1990) (same).

C. $ 160(c), is a "make-whole" remedy that resemblescompensatory damages in some respects. See AlbemarlePaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418-422 (1975). However,the new compensatory damages provision of the 1991 Act is"in addition to," and does not replace or duplicate, the back-pay remedy allowed under prior law. Indeed, to preventdouble recovery, the 1991 Act provides that compensatorydamages "shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, orany other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964." $ 102(b)(2).Section 102 significantly expands the monetary relief po-tentially available to plaintiffs who would have been entitledto backpay under prior law. Before 1991, for example, monetary relief for a discriminatorily discharged employee gen-erally included "only an amount equal to the wages the employee would have earned from the date of discharge to thedate of reinstatement, along with lost fringe benefits such asvacation pay and pension benefits." United States v. Burke,504 U. S. 229, 239 (1992). Under $ 102, however, a Title VIIplaintiff who wins a backpay award may also seek compensatory damages for "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain,suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoymentof life, and other nonpecuniary losses." $ 102(b)(3). In adtioner does not argue that she had a right to jury trial even under pre-1991law, again we need not address this question.5 "If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in . . .an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may. . . order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with orwithout back pay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court deemsappropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more thantwo years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interimearnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person orpersons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable."

As this case illustrates,even if unlawful discrimination was proved, under prior lawa Title VII plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unlessthe discrimination was also found to have some concrete effect on the plaintiff 's employment status, such as a deniedpromotion, a differential in compensation, or termination.See Burke, 504 U. S., at 240. ("[T]he circumscribed remedies available under Title VII [before the 1991 Act] stand inmarked contrast not only to those available under traditionaltort law, but under other federal anti-discrimination statutes,as well"). Section 102, however, allows a plaintiff to recoverin circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1),7 even though the discrimination did not involve a discharge or a loss of pay. In short,to further Title VII's "central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination," Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U. S., at 421, $ 102 of the6 Section 102(b)(3) imposes limits, varying with the size of the employer,on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages that may beawarded to an individual plaintiff. Thus, the sum of such damagesawarded a plaintiff may not exceed $50,000 for employers with between14 and 100 employees; $100,000 for employers with between 101 and 200employees; $200,000 for employers with between 200 and 500 employees;and $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees.7 See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.

USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courttoed the 1990 legislation, however, citing the bill's "unfairretroactivity rules" as one reason for his disapproval.9 Congress narrowly failed to override the veto. See 136 Cong.Rec. S16589 (Oct. 24, 1990) (66 to 34 Senate vote in favorof override).The absence of comparable language in the 1991 Act cannot realistically be attributed to oversight or to unawarenessof the retroactivity issue. Rather, it seems likely that oneof the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991version was an agreementnot to include the kind of explicitretroactivity command found in the 1990 bill.The omission of the elaborate retroactivity provision of the1990 bill--which was by no means the only source of politicalcontroversy over that legislation--is not dispositive becauseit does not tell us precisely where the compromise was struckin the 1991 Act. The Legislature might, for example, havesettled in 1991 on a less expansive form of retroactivity that,unlike the 1990 bill, did not reach cases already finally de-cided. See n. 8,supra. A decision to reach only cases stillpending might explain Congress' failure to provide in thevested, where the time for seeking further judicial review of such judgment has otherwise expired pursuant to title 28 of the United States Code,the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Federal Rules of AppellateProcedure, shall be vacated in whole or in part if justice requires pursuantto rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or other appropriate authority, and consistent with the constitutional requirements ofdue process of law."9 See President's Message to the Senate Returning Without Approvalthe Civil Rights Act of 1990, 26 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1632-1634 (Oct.22, 1990), reprinted in 136 Cong. Rec. S16418, S16419 (Oct. 22, 1990). ThePresident's veto message referred to the bill's "retroactivity" only briefly;the Attorney General's Memorandum to which the President referred wasno more expansive, and may be read to refer only to the bill's specialprovision for reopening final judgments, see n. 8, supra, rather than itsprovisions covering pending cases. See Memorandum of the AttorneyGeneral to the President (Oct. 22, 1990) in App. to Brief for PetitionerA-13 ("And Section 15 unfairly applies the changes in the law made byS. 2104 to cases already decided") (emphasis added).511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Court1991 Act, as it had in 1990, that certain sections would applyto proceedings pending on specific preenactment dates. Ourfirst question, then, is whether the statutory text on whichpetitioner relies manifests an intent that the 1991 Act shouldbe applied to cases that arose and went to trial before itsenactment.IIIPetitioner's textual argument relies on three provisions ofthe 1991 Act: $$ 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c). Section 402(a),the only provision of the Act that speaks directly to the ques-tion before us, states:"Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Actand the amendments made by this Act shall take effectupon enactment."That language does not, by itself, resolve the question beforeus. A statement that a statute will become effective on acertain date does not even arguably suggest that it has anyapplication to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.1010 The history of prior amendments to Title VII suggests that the"effective-upon-enactment" formula would have been an especially inaptway to reach pending cases. When it amended Title VII in the EqualEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972, Congress explicitly provided:"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil RightsAct of 1964 shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with theCommission on the date of enactment of this Act and all charges filedthereafter." Pub. L. 92-261, $ 14, 86 Stat. 113. In contrast, in amendingTitle VII to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy in 1978, Congress provided:"Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendment made by this Actshall be effective on the date of enactment." $ 2(a), 92 Stat. 2076.The only Courts of Appeals to consider whether the 1978 amendmentsapplied to pending cases concluded that they did not.

USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the CourtPetitioner does not argue otherwise. Rather, she contendsthat the introductory clause of $ 402(a) would be superfluousunless it refers to $$ 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for pro-spective application in limited contexts.The parties agree that $ 402(b) was intended to exempta single disparate impact lawsuit against the Wards CovePacking Company. Section 402(b) provides:"(b) Certain Disparate Impact Cases.--Notwith-standing any other provision of this Act, nothing in thisAct shall apply to any disparate impact case for which acomplaint was filed before March 1, 1975, and for whichan initial decision was rendered after October 30, 1983."Section 109(c), part of the section extending Title VII tooverseas employers, states:"(c) Application of Amendments.--The amend-ments made by this section shall not apply with respectto conduct occurring before the date of the enactment ofthis Act."According to petitioner, these two subsections are the "otherprovisions" contemplated in the first clause of $ 402(a), andtogether create a strong negative inference that all sectionsof the Act not specifically declared prospective apply topending cases that arose before November 21, 1991.Before addressing the particulars of petitioner's argument,we observe that she places extraordinary weight on two com-paratively minor and narrow provisions in a long and complex statute. Applying the entire Act to cases arising frompreenactment conduct would have important consequences,including the possibility that trials completed before its enble to case arising before enactment); Sikora v. American Can Co., 622F. 2d 1116, 1119-1124 (CA3 1980) (same). If we assume that Congresswas familiar with those decisions, cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago,441 U. S. 677, 698-699 (1979), its choice of language in $ 402(a) wouldimply nonretroactivity.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT259Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtactment would need to be retried and the possibility thatemployers would be liable for punitive damages for conductantedating the Act's enactment. Purely prospective appli-cation, on the other hand, would prolong the life of a remedialscheme, and of judicial constructions of civil rights statutes,that Congress obviously found wanting. Given the highstakes of the retroactivity question, the broad coverage ofthe statute, and the prominent and specific retroactivity pro-visions in the 1990 bill, it would be surprising for Congressto have chosen to resolve that question through negative in-ferences drawn from two provisions of quite limited effect.Petitioner, however, invokes the canon that a court shouldgive effect to every provision of a statute and thus avoidredundancy among different provisions. See, e. g., Mackeyv. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,837, and n. 11 (1988). Unless the word "otherwise" in$ 402(a) refers to either $ 402(b) or $ 109(c), she contends, thefirst five words in $ 402(a) are entirely superfluous. Moreover, relying on the canon "[e]xpressio unius est exclusioalterius," see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 168 (1993),petitioner argues that because Congress provided specifically for prospectivity in two places ($$ 109(c) and 402(b)), weshould infer that it intended the opposite for the remainderof the statute.Petitioner emphasizes that $ 402(a) begins: "Except asotherwise specifically provided." A scan of the statute forother "specific provisions" concerning effective dates revealsthat $$ 402(b) and 109(c) are the most likely candidates.Since those provisions decree prospectivity, and since$ 402(a) tells us that the specific provisions are exceptions,$ 402(b) should be considered as prescribing a general rule ofretroactivity. Petitioner's argument has some force, but wefind it most unlikely that Congress intended the introductoryclause to carry the critically important meaning petitionerassigns it. Had Congress wished $ 402(a) to have such a de511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT260 LANDGRAF v.

S. 2104, 101stCong., 1st Sess. $ 15(a)(4) (1990).It is entirely possible that Congress inserted the "otherwise specifically provided" language not because it under-stood the "takes effect" clause to establish a rule of retroactivity to which only two "other specific provisions" wouldbe exceptions, but instead to assure that any specific timingprovisions in the Act would prevail over the general "takeeffect on enactment" command. The drafters of a complicated piece of legislation containing more than 50 separatesections may well have inserted the "except as otherwiseprovided" language merely to avoid the risk of an inadvertent conflict in the statute.11 If the introductory clause of$ 402(a) was intended to refer specifically to $$ 402(b), 109(c),or both, it is difficult to understand why the drafters chosethe word "otherwise" rather than either or both of the appropriate section numbers.We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's argument thatboth $$ 402(b) and 109(c) merely duplicate the "take effectupon enactment" command of $ 402(a) unless all other provisions, including the damages provisions of $ 102, apply topending cases. That argument depends on the assumptionthat all those other provisions must be treated uniformlyfor purposes of their application to pending cases basedon preenactment conduct. That thesis, however, is by no11 There is some evidence that the drafters of the 1991 Act did not devoteparticular attention to the interplay of the Act's "effective date" provisions. Section 110, which directs the EEOC to establish a "Technical Assistance Training Institute" to assist employers in complying with antidiscrimination laws and regulations, contains a subsection providing that it"shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act." $ 110(b).That provision and $ 402(a) are unavoidably redundant.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT261Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtmeans an inevitable one. It is entirely possible--indeed,highly probable--that, because it was unable to resolve theretroactivity issue with the clarity of the 1990 legislation,Congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolvedby the courts. Our precedents on retroactivity left doubtsabout what default rule would apply in the absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisionsmight apply to cases arising before enactment while othersmight not.12 Compare Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204 (1988), with Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974). See also Bennett v. New Jersey,470 U. S. 632 (1985). The only matters Congress did notleave to the courts were set out with specificity in $$ 109(c)and 402(b). Congressional doubt concerning judicial retroactivity doctrine, coupled with the likelihood that the routine"take effect upon enactment" language would require courtsto fall back upon that doctrine, provide a plausible explanation for both $$ 402(b) and 109(c) that makes neither provision redundant.Turning to the text of $ 402(b), it seems unlikely that theintroductory phrase ("Notwithstanding any other provisionof this Act") was meant to refer to the immediately preceding subsection. Since petitioner does not contend that anyother provision speaks to the general effective date issue, thelogic of her argument requires us to interpret that phrase tomean nothing more than "Notwithstanding $ 402(a)." Petitioner's textual argument assumes that the drafters selectedthe indefinite word "otherwise" in $ 402(a) to identify two12 This point also diminishes the force of petitioner's "expressio unius"argument. Once one abandons the unsupported assumption that Congress expected that all of the Act's provisions would be treated alike, andtakes account of uncertainty about the applicable default rule, $$ 109(c)and 402(b) do not carry the negative implication petitioner draws fromthem. We do not read either provision as doing anything more than definitively rejecting retroactivity with respect to the specific matters covered by its plain language.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT262 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtspecific subsections and the even more indefinite term "anyother provision" in $ 402(b) to refer to nothing more than$ 402(b)'s next-door neighbor--$ 402(a). Here again, peti-tioner's statutory argument would require us to assume thatCongress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey animportant and easily expressed message concerning the Act'seffect on pending cases.The relevant legislative history of the 1991 Act reinforcesour conclusion that $$ 402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) cannot bearthe weight petitioner places upon them. The 1991 bill asoriginally introduced in the House contained explicit retroac-tivity provisions similar to those found in the 1990 bill.13However, the Senate substitute that was agreed upon omit-ted those explicit retroactivity provisions.14 The legislativehistory discloses some frankly partisan statements about themeaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any generalagreement.15 The history reveals no evidence that Mem13 See, e. g., H. R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. $ 113 (1991), reprinted in 137Cong. Rec. H3924-H3925 (Jan. 3, 1991). The prospectivity proviso to thesection extending Title VII to overseas employers was first added to legislation that generally was to apply to pending cases. See H. R. 1, 102dCong., 1st Sess. $ 119(c) (1991), reprinted in 137 Cong. Rec. H3925-H3926(June 5, 1991). Thus, at the time its language was introduced, the provision that became $ 109(c) was surely not redundant.14 On the other hand, two proposals that would have provided explicitlyfor prospectivity also foundered. See 137 Cong. Rec. S3021, S3023 (Mar.12, 1991); id., at 13255, 13265-13266.15 For example, in an "interpretive memorandum" introduced on behalfof seven Republican sponsors of S. 1745, the bill that became the 1991 Act,Senator Danforth stated that "[t]he bill provides that, unless otherwisespecified, the provisions of this legislation shall take effect upon enactmentand shall not apply retroactively." Id., at 29047 (emphasis added). Senator Kennedy responded that it "will be up to the courts to determine theextent to which the bill will apply to cases and claims that were pendingon the date of enactment." Ibid. (citing Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974)). The legislative history reveals other partisanstatements on the proper meaning of the Act's "effective date" provisions.Senator Danforth observed that such statements carry little weight aslegislative history. As he put it:511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtbers believed that an agreement had been tacitly struck onthe controversial retroactivity issue, and little to suggestthat Congress understood or intended the interplay of$$ 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c) to have the decisive effect petitioner assigns them. Instead, the history of the 1991 Actconveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagreeabout whether and to what extent the Act would apply topreenactment conduct.Although the passage of the 1990 bill may indicate that amajority of the 1991 Congress also favored retroactive application, even the will of the majority does not become lawunless it follows the path charted in Article I, $ 7, cl. 2, ofthe Constitution. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946-951(1983). In the absence of the kind of unambiguous directivefound in $ 15 of the 1990 bill, we must look elsewhere forguidance on whether $ 102 applies to this case.IVIt is not uncommon to find "apparent tension" betweendifferent canons of statutory construction. As ProfessorLlewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional can-ons have equal opposites.16 In order to resolve the questionleft open by the 1991 Act, federal courts have labored to"[A] court would be well advised to take with a large grain of salt floordebate and statements placed in the Congressional Record whichpurport to create an interpretation for the legislation that is before us."137 Cong. Rec. S15325 (Oct. 29, 1991).16 See Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and theRules or Canons about How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev.395 (1950). Llewellyn's article identified the apparent conflict betweenthe canon that"[a] statute imposing a new penalty or forfeiture, or a new liability ordisability, or creating a new right of action will not be construed as havinga retroactive effect"and the countervailing rule that"[r]emedial statutes are to be liberally construed and if a retroactiveinterpretation will promote the ends of justice, they should receive suchconstruction."

USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtreconcile two seemingly contradictory statements found inour decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes inthe law. Each statement is framed as a generally applicablerule for interpreting statutes that do not specify their temporal reach. The first is the rule that "a court is to applythe law in effect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley,416 U. S., at 711. The second is the axiom that "[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law," and its interpretive corollarythat "congressional enactments and administrative rules willnot be construed to have retroactive effect unless their lan-guage requires this result."Bowen, 488 U. S., at 208.We have previously noted the "apparent tension" betweenthose expressions. See Kaiser Aluminum & ChemicalCorp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990); see also Bennett,470 U. S., at 639-640. We found it unnecessary in Kaiser toresolve that seeming conflict "because under either view,where the congressional intent is clear, it governs," and theprejudgment interest statute at issue in that case evinced"clear congressional intent" that it was "not applicable tojudgments entered before its effective date." 499 U. S., at837-838. In the case before us today, however, we have concluded that the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expressionof intent on $ 102's application to cases arising before theAct's enactment. We must, therefore, focus on the apparenttension between the rules we have espoused for handlingsimilar problems in the absence of an instruction fromCongress.We begin by noting that there is no tension between theholdings in Bradley and Bowen, both of which were unanimous decisions. Relying on another unanimous decision--Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268(1969)--we held in Bradley that a statute authorizing theaward of attorney's fees to successful civil rights plaintiffsapplied in a case that was pending on appeal at the time thestatute was enacted. Bowen held that the Department ofHealth and Human Services lacked statutory authority to511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 511 U.

Our opinion in Bowen did not purport tooverrule Bradley or to limit its reach. In this light, we turnto the "apparent tension" between the two canons mindful ofanother canon of unquestionable vitality, the "maxim not tobe disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion,are to be taken in connection with the case in which thoseexpressions are used." Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264,399 (1821).AAs Justice Scalia has demonstrated, the presumptionagainst retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older thanour Republic.17 Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to knowwhat the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly;settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.18 Forthat reason, the "principle that the legal effect of conductshould ordinarily be assessed under the law that existedwhen the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 855 (Scalia, J., concurring). In17 See Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827,842-844, 855-856 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring).

TheEx Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits retroac-tive application of penal legislation.19 Article I, $ 10, cl. 1,prohibits States from passing another type of retroactivelegislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of Contracts."The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legis-lature (and other government actors) from depriving privatepersons of vested property rights except for a "public use"and upon payment of "just compensation." The prohibitionson "Bills of Attainder" in Art. I, $$ 9-10, prohibit legislaturesfrom singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e. g., United Statesv.Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 456-462 (1965). The Due ProcessClause also protects the interests in fair notice and reposethat may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justi-fication sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retro-active application.Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co.,428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976).These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutesraise particular concerns. The Legislature's unmatchedpowers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenlyand without individualized consideration. Its responsivityto political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted touse retroactive legislation as a means of retribution againstunpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall ob-served in his opinion for the Court inWeaver v. Graham,450 U. S. 24 (1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only en19 Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress ($ 9, cl. 3), the other to the States ($ 10, cl. 1).

Absent a violation of one of those specific provisions,the potential unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is nota sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute itsintended scope.21 Retroactivity provisions often serve en20 See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 513-514 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct.

United States, 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3(1961) (retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penaltyagainst specific persons or classes of persons").James Madison argued that retroactive legislation also offered specialopportunities for the powerful to obtain special and improper legislativebenefits. According to Madison, "[b]ills of attainder, ex post facto laws,and laws impairing the obligation of contracts" were "contrary to the firstprinciples of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation," in part because such measures invited the "influential" to "speculat[e] on public measures," to the detriment of the "more industrious andless informed part of the community." The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J.Cooke ed. 1961). See Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive statute "may be passed with an exact knowledge of who will benefitfrom it").21 In some cases, however, the interest in avoiding the adjudication ofconstitutional questions will counsel against a retroactive application.For if a challenged statute is to be given retroactive effect, the regulatoryinterest that supports prospective application will not necessarily also sustain its application to past events. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 730 (1984); Usery v. Turner511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT268 LANDGRAF v.

However, a requirement thatCongress first make its intention clear helps ensure thatCongress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.While statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored, deciding when a statute operates "retroactively" is not alwaysa simple or mechanical task. Sitting on Circuit, JusticeStory offered an influential definition in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814), a case construing a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that broadly prohibits "retrospective"laws both criminal and civil.22 Justice Story first rejectedthe notion that the provision bars only explicitly retroactivelegislation, i. e., "statutes . . . enacted to take effect from atime anterior to their passage." Id., at 767. Such a construction, he concluded, would be "utterly subversive of allthe objects" of the prohibition. Ibid. Instead, the ban onretrospective legislation embraced "all statutes, which,though operating only from their passage, affect vestedElkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976). In this case the punitive damages provision may raise a question, but for present purposes we assumethat Congress has ample power to provide for retroactive application of$ 102.22 Article 23 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights provides: "Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws,therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes or thepunishment of offenses." At issue in the Society case was a new statutethat reversed a common-law rule by allowing certain wrongful possessorsof land, upon being ejected by the rightful owner, to obtain compensationfor improvements made on the land. Justice Story held that the new statute impaired the owner's rights and thus could not, consistently with Article 23, be applied to require compensation for improvements made beforethe statute's enactment. See 22 F. Cas., at 766-769.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtrights and past transactions." Ibid. "Upon principle," Jus-tice Story elaborated,"every statute, which takes away or impairs vestedrights acquired under existing laws, or creates a newobligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new dis-ability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective . . . ." Ibid.(citingCalder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), and Dash v. VanKleeck, 7 Johns. *477 (N. Y. 1811)).Though the formulas have varied, similar functional concep-tions of legislative "retroactivity" have found voice in thisCourt's decisions and elsewhere.23A statute does not operate "retrospectively" merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedatingthe statute's enactment, seeRepublic Nat. Bank of Miamiv.United States, 506 U. S. 80, 100 (1992) (Thomas, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment), or upsets expectations based in prior law.24 Rather, the court must ask23 See, e. g., Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423, 430 (1987) ("A law is retrospective if it `changes the legal consequences of acts completed before itseffective date' ") (quoting Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 31 (1981));Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.

S. 511, 519 (1885) (a retroactive statute is onethat "takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability"). See also Black's Law Dictionary 1184 (5th ed. 1979) (quoting JusticeStory's definition from Society); 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 41.01, p. 337 (5th rev. ed. 1993) ("The terms `retroactive' and`retrospective' are synonymous in judicial usage . . . . They describe actswhich operate on transactions which have occurred or rights and obligations which existed before passage of the act").24 Even uncontroversially prospective statutes may unsettle expectations and impose burdens on past conduct: a new property tax or zoningregulation may upset the reasonable expectations that prompted thoseaffected to acquire property; a new law banning gambling harms the person who had begun to construct a casino before the law's enactment or511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT270 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtwhether the new provision attaches new legal consequencesto events completed before its enactment. The conclusionthat a particular rule operates "retroactively" comes at theend of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connectionbetween the operation of the new rule and a relevant pastevent. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tendto have "sound . . . instinct[s]," see Danforth v. Groton WaterCo., 178 Mass. 472, 476, 59 N. E. 1033, 1034 (1901) (Holmes,J.), and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.Since the early days of this Court, we have declined togive retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rightsunless Congress had made clear its intent. Thus, in UnitedStates v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399 (1806), we refused to apply afederal statute reducing the commissions of customs collectors to collections commenced before the statute's enactmentbecause the statute lacked "clear, strong, and imperative"language requiring retroactive application, id., at 413 (opinion of Paterson, J.). The presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference tothe unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after thefact. Indeed, at common law a contrary rule applied to statutes that merely removed a burden on private rights by repealing a penal provision (whether criminal or civil); suchspent his life learning to count cards. See Fuller 60 ("If every time aman relied on existing law in arranging his affairs, he were made secureagainst any change in legal rules, the whole body of our law would beossified forever"). Moreover, a statute "is not made retroactive merelybecause it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation." Cox v. Hart,260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922). See Reynolds v. United States, 292 U. S. 443,444-449 (1934); Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Tranbarger, 238 U. S. 67, 73(1915).511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 511 U.

C. $ 109 (repealingcommon-law rule).The largest category of cases in which we have appliedthe presumption against statutory retroactivity has involvednew provisions affecting contractual or property rights, mat-ters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance.25 The presumption has not, however, been limited tosuch cases. At issue in Chew Heong v. United States, 112U. S. 536 (1884), for example, was a provision of the "ChineseRestriction Act" of 1882 barring Chinese laborers from reen-tering the United States without a certificate prepared whenthey exited this country. We held that the statute did notbar the reentry of a laborer who had left the United Statesbefore the certification requirement was promulgated. Jus-tice Harlan's opinion for the Court observed that the law ineffect before the 1882 enactment had accorded laborers aright to reenter without a certificate, and invoked the "uniformly" accepted rule against "giv[ing] to statutes a retro25 See, e. g., United States v.

While the great majority of ourdecisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties, we have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary obligations that fell only on thegovernment. See United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 276 U. S. 160(1928); White v. United States, 191 U. S. 545 (1903).511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT272 LANDGRAF v.

Id., at 559.Our statement in Bowen that "congressional enactmentsand administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result,"488 U. S., at 208, was in step with this long line of cases.26Bowen itself was a paradigmatic case of retroactivity inwhich a federal agency sought to recoup, under cost limitregulations issued in 1984, funds that had been paid to hospi-tals for services rendered earlier, seeid., at 207; our searchfor clear congressional intent authorizing retroactivity wasconsistent with the approach taken in decisions spanningtwo centuries.The presumption against statutory retroactivity had spe-cial force in the era in which courts tended to view legislativeinterference with property and contract rights circum-spectly. In this century, legislation has come to supply thedominant means of legal ordering, and circumspection hasgiven way to greater deference to legislative judgments.See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S., at15-16; Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S.398, 436-444 (1934). But while the constitutional impedi-ments to retroactive civil legislation are now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule. Becauseit accords with widely held intuitions about how statutesordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity willgenerally coincide with legislative and public expectations.Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself hasaffirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price26 See also, e. g., Greene v. United States, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964); Whitev. United States, 191 U. S. 545 (1903); United States v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760,762 (1878); Murray v. Gibson, 15 How. 421, 423 (1854); Ladiga v.

Such a requirementallocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policyjudgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes,and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate.BAlthough we have long embraced a presumption againststatutory retroactivity, for just as long we have recognizedthat, in many situations, a court should "apply the law ineffect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley, 416 U. S.,at 711, even though that law was enacted after the eventsthat gave rise to the suit. There is, of course, no conflictbetween that principle and a presumption against retroac-tivity when the statute in question is unambiguous. ChiefJustice Marshall's opinion in United States v. SchoonerPeggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801), illustrates this point. Becausea treaty signed on September 30, 1800, while the case waspending on appeal, unambiguously provided for the restora-tion of captured property "not yet definitively condemned,"id., at 107 (emphasis in original), we reversed a decree en-tered on September 23, 1800, condemning a French vesselthat had been seized in American waters. Our applicationof "the law in effect" at the time of our decision inSchoonerPeggy was simply a response to the language of the statute.Id., at 109.Even absent specific legislative authorization, applicationof new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestion-ably proper in many situations. When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief,application of the new provision is not retroactive. Thus, inAmerican Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184 (1921), we held that $ 20 of the Clayton Act,enacted while the case was pending on appeal, governed thepropriety of injunctive relief against labor picketing. In re-manding the suit for application of the intervening statute,511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT274 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtwe observed that "relief by injunction operates in futuro,"and that the plaintiff had no "vested right" in the decreeentered by the trial court. 257 U. S., at 201. See also, e. g.,Hall v. Beals, 396 U. S. 45, 48 (1969); Duplex Printing PressCo. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464 (1921).We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferringor ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay whenthe underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.Thus, in Bruner v. United States, 343 U. S. 112, 116-117(1952), relying on our "consisten[t]" practice, we ordered anaction dismissed because the jurisdictional statute underwhich it had been (properly) filed was subsequently repealed.27 See also Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S. 506,508-509 (1916);Assessors v. Osbornes, 9 Wall. 567, 575 (1870).Conversely, inAndrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co.,436 U. S. 604, 607-608, n. 6 (1978), we held that, becausea statute passed while the case was pending on appealhad eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement forfederal-question cases, the fact that respondent had failed toallege $10,000 in controversy at the commencement of theaction was "now of no moment." See also United States v.Alabama, 362 U. S. 602, 604 (1960) (per curiam); Stephensv. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 478 (1899). Applicationof a new jurisdictional rule usually "takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear thecase." Hallowell, 239 U. S., at 508. Present law normallygoverns in such situations because jurisdictional statutes"speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights orobligations of the parties,"Republic Nat. Bank of Miami,506 U. S., at 100 (Thomas, J., concurring).27 In Bruner, we specifically noted:"This jurisdictional rule does not affect the general principle that a statute is not to be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication. Compare UnitedStates v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co., 270 U. S. 1, 3 (1926), with Smallwoodv. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, 61 (1927)." 343 U.

S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the CourtChanges in procedural rules may often be applied in suitsarising before their enactment without raising concernsabout retroactivity. For example, in Ex parte Collett, 337U. S. 55, 71 (1949), we held that 28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a) governedthe transfer of an action instituted prior to that statute'senactment. We noted the diminished reliance interests inmatters of procedure. 337 U. S., at 71.28 Because rules ofprocedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after theconduct giving rise to the suit does not make application ofthe rule at trial retroactive. Cf. McBurney v. Carson, 99U. S. 567, 569 (1879).2928 While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibitapplication of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after thefact, we have upheld intervening procedural changes even if applicationof the new rule operated to a defendant's disadvantage in the particularcase. See, e. g., Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293-294 (1977); seealso Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S.167 (1925).29 Of course, the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not meanthat it applies to every pending case. A new rule concerning the filing ofcomplaints would not govern an action in which the complaint had alreadybeen properly filed under the old regime, and the promulgation of a newrule of evidence would not require an appellate remand for a new trial.Our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules reflect thecommonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarilydepends on the posture of the particular case. See, e. g., Order AmendingFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 495 U. S. 969 (1990) (amendmentsapplicable to pending cases "insofar as just and practicable"); OrderAmending Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 456 U. S. 1015 (1982) (same);Order Amending Bankruptcy Rules and Forms, 421 U. S. 1021 (1975)(amendments applicable to pending cases "except to the extent that in theopinion of the court their application in a particular proceeding then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice"). Contrary to JusticeScalia's suggestion, post, at 290, we do not restrict the presumptionagainst statutory retroactivity to cases involving "vested rights." (Neither is Justice Story's definition of retroactivity, quoted supra, at 269, sorestricted.) Nor do we suggest that concerns about retroactivity have noapplication to procedural rules.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT276 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the CourtPetitioner relies principally upon Bradley v. School Bd.of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974), and Thorpe v. HousingAuthority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268 (1969), in support ofher argument that our ordinary interpretive rules supportapplication of $ 102 to her case. In Thorpe, we held that anagency circular requiring a local housing authority to givenotice of reasons and opportunity to respond before evictinga tenant was applicable to an eviction proceeding commencedbefore the regulation issued. Thorpe shares much with boththe "procedural" and "prospective-relief " cases. See supra,at 273-275. Thus, we noted in Thorpe that new hearing procedures did not affect either party's obligations under thelease agreement between the housing authority and the petitioner, 393 U. S., at 279, and, because the tenant had "not yetvacated," we saw no significance in the fact that the housingauthority had "decided to evict her before the circular wasissued," id., at 283. The Court in Thorpe viewed the neweviction procedures as "essential to remove a serious impediment to the successful protection of constitutional rights."Ibid.30 Cf. Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 237 (1976) (percuriam) (citing Thorpe for propriety of applying new law toavoiding necessity of deciding constitutionality of old one).Our holding in Bradley is similarly compatible with theline of decisions disfavoring "retroactive" application of statutes. In Bradley, the District Court had awarded attorney's fees and costs, upon general equitable principles, toparents who had prevailed in an action seeking to desegregate the public schools of Richmond, Virginia. While the30 Thorpe is consistent with the principle, analogous to that at work inthe common-law presumption about repeals of criminal statutes, that thegovernment should accord grace to private parties disadvantaged by anold rule when it adopts a new and more generous one. Cf. DeGurules v.INS, 833 F. 2d 861, 862-863 (CA9 1987). Indeed, Thorpe twice citedUnited States v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217 (1934), which ordered dismissalof prosecutions pending when the National Prohibition Act was repealed.See Thorpe, 393 U. S., at 281, n. 38; id., at 282, n. 40.511US1 Unit: $U40 [11-04-99 07:33:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcase was pending before the Court of Appeals, Congress en-acted $ 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which authorized federal courts to award the prevailing parties inschool desegregation cases a reasonable attorney's fee. TheCourt of Appeals held that the new fee provision did notauthorize the award of fees for services rendered before theeffective date of the amendments. This Court reversed.We concluded that the private parties could rely on $ 718 tosupport their claim for attorney's fees, resting our decision"on the principle that a court is to apply the law in effect atthe time it renders its decision, unless doing so would resultin manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary." 416 U. S., at 711.Although that language suggests a categorical presumption in favor of application of all new rules of law, we nowmake it clear that Bradley did not alter the well-settled presumption against application of the class of new statutes thatwould have genuinely "retroactive" effect. Like the newhearing requirement in Thorpe, the attorney's fee provisionat issue in Bradley did not resemble the cases in which wehave invoked the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Attorney's fee determinations, we have observed, are"collateral to the main cause of action" and "uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial." Whitev. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U. S.445, 451-452 (1982). See also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,695, n. 24 (1978). Moreover, even before the enactment of$ 718, federal courts had authority (which the District Courtin Bradley had exercised) to award fees based upon equitableprinciples. As our opinion in Bradley made clear, it wouldbe difficult to imagine a stronger equitable case for an attorney's fee award than a lawsuit in which the plaintiff parentswould otherwise have to bear the costs of desegregatingtheir children's public schools. See 416 U. S., at 718 (notingthat the plaintiffs had brought the school board "into compliance with its constitutional mandate") (citing Brown v. Board511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT278 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtof Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954)). In light of the prioravailability of a fee award, and the likelihood that fees wouldbe assessed under pre-existing theories, we concluded thatthe new fee statute simply "d[id] not impose an additional orunforeseeable obligation" upon the school board. Bradley,416 U. S., at 721.In approving application of the new fee provision, Bradleydid not take issue with the long line of decisions applyingthe presumption against retroactivity. Our opinion distin-guished, but did not criticize, prior cases that had appliedthe antiretroactivity canon. See id., at 720 (citing Greene v.United States, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964); Claridge Apartments Co. v. Commissioner, 323 U. S. 141, 164 (1944), andUnion Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U. S.190, 199 (1913)). The authorities we relied upon in Bradleylend further support to the conclusion that we did not intendto displace the traditional presumption against applying stat-utes affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties to conduct arising before their enactment. See Kaiser, 494 U. S.,at 849-850 (Scalia, J., concurring). Bradley relied onThorpe and on other precedents that are consistent with apresumption against statutory retroactivity, including deci-sions involving explicitly retroactive statutes, see 416 U. S.,at 713, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160(1865)),31 the retroactive application of intervening judicialdecisions, see 416 U. S., at 713-714, n. 17 (citing, inter alia,Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 600, 607 (1935)),32 statutes31 In Bradley, we cited Schooner Peggy for the "current law" principle,but we recognized that the law at issue in Schooner Peggy had expresslycalled for retroactive application. See 416 U. S., at 712, n. 16 (describingSchooner Peggy as holding that Court was obligated to "apply the termsof the convention," which had recited that it applied to all vessels not yet"definitively condemned") (emphasis in convention).32 At the time Bradley was decided, it was by no means a truism to pointout that rules announced in intervening judicial decisions should normallybe applied to a case pending when the intervening decision came down.In 1974, our doctrine on judicial retroactivity involved a substantial measure of discretion, guided by equitable standards resembling the Bradley511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 511 U.

Whileit was accurate in 1974 to say that a new rule announced in a judicialdecision was only presumptively applicable to pending cases, we havesince established a firm rule of retroactivity.

USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the CourtWhen a case implicates a federal statute enacted after theevents in suit, the court's first task is to determine whetherCongress has expressly prescribed the statute's properreach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no needto resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the stat-ute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,i. e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed whenhe acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, orimpose new duties with respect to transactions alreadycompleted. If the statute would operate retroactively, ourtraditional presumption teaches that it does not governabsent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.VWe now ask whether, given the absence of guiding instruc-tions from Congress, $ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 isthe type of provision that should govern cases arising beforeits enactment. As we observedsupra, at 260-261, and n. 12,there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of the Act must be treated uniformly for such purposes.To the contrary, we understand the instruction that the provisions are to "take effect upon enactment" to mean thatcourts should evaluate each provision of the Act in light ofordinary judicial principles concerning the application of newrules to pending cases and preenactment conduct.Two provisions of $ 102 may be readily classified accordingto these principles. The jury trial right set out in $ 102(c)(1)is plainly a procedural change of the sort that would ordi-narily govern in trials conducted after its effective date. If$ 102 did no more than introduce a right to jury trial in Titleto remand to agency under Thorpe for administrative findings required bynew regulation because administrative record was already adequate forjudicial review); Hall v. Beals, 396 U. S. 45, 48 (1969) (in action for injunctive relief from state election statute, citing Thorpe as authority for considering intervening amendment of statute).511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT281Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the CourtVII cases, the provision would presumably apply to casestried after November 21, 1991, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.34 However, because $ 102(c) makesa jury trial available only "[i]f a complaining party seekscompensatory or punitive damages," the jury trial optionmust stand or fall with the attached damages provisions.Section 102(b)(1) is clearly on the other side of the line.That subsection authorizes punitive damages if the plaintiffshows that the defendant "engaged in a discriminatory prac-tice or discriminatory practices with malice or with recklessindifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrievedindividual." The very labels given "punitive" or "exemplary" damages, as well as the rationales that support them,demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions. Retroactive imposition of punitive damageswould raise a serious constitutional question. See TurnerElkhorn, 428 U. S., at 17 (Court would "hesitate to approvethe retrospective imposition of liability on any theory of deterrence . . . or blameworthiness"); De Veau v. Braisted, 363U. S. 144, 160 (1960) ("The mark of anex post facto law isthe imposition of what can fairly be designated punishmentfor past acts"). See also Louis Vuitton S. A. v. SpencerHandbags Corp., 765 F. 2d 966, 972 (CA2 1985) (retroactiveapplication of punitive treble damages provisions of Trade-mark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 "would present a potentialex post facto problem"). Before we entertained that ques-tion, we would have to be confronted with a statute thatexplicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment con-duct. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 contains no such explicit command.The provision of $ 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery ofcompensatory damages is not easily classified. It does not34 As the Court of Appeals recognized, however, the promulgation of anew jury trial rule would ordinarily not warrant retrial of cases that hadpreviously been tried to a judge. See n. 29, supra. Thus, customarypractice would not support remand for a jury trial in this case.511US1 Unit: $U40 [11-04-99 07:34:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSOpinion of the Courtmake unlawful conduct that was lawful when it occurred; aswe have noted, supra, at 252-255, $ 102 only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concernsabout a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact thatsuch discrimination was in many cases (although not thisone) already subject to monetary liability in the form ofbackpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend that the com-pensatory damages provisions smack of a "retributive" orother suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Con-gress' desire to afford victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules established more than ageneration ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At leastwith respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then,$ 102 is not in a category in which objections to retroactiveapplication on grounds of fairness have their greatest force.Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provisionwould operate "retrospectively" if it were applied to con-duct occurring before November 21, 1991. Unlike certainother forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintes-sentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may beintended less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victimswhole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not "compensate" by distribut-ing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particularemployers to pay for harms they caused. The introductionof a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legalchange that would have an impact on private parties' plan-ning.35 In this case, the event to which the new damages35 As petitioner and amici suggest, concerns of unfair surprise and upsetting expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employmentdiscrimination, which has been unlawful for more than a generation. However, fairness concerns would not be entirely absent if the damages provisions of $ 102 were to apply to events preceding its enactment, as the factsof this case illustrate. Respondent USI's management, when apprised ofthe wrongful conduct of petitioner's co-worker, took timely action to remedy the problem. The law then in effect imposed no liability on an employer who corrected discriminatory work conditions before the conditions511US1 Unit: $U40 [11-04-99 07:34:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 511 U. S. 244 (1994)Opinion of the Courtprovision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that provisionwould attach an important new legal burden to that conduct.The new damages remedy in $ 102, we conclude, is the kindof provision that does not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief,$ 102 can be seen as creating a new cause of action, and itsimpact on parties' rights is especially pronounced. Section102 confers a new right to monetary relief on persons likepetitioner who were victims of a hostile work environmentbut were not constructively discharged, and the novel prospect of damages liability for their employers. Because TitleVII previously authorized recovery of backpay in somecases, and because compensatory damages under $ 102(a) arein addition to any backpay recoverable, the new provisionalso resembles a statute increasing the amount of damagesavailable under a preestablished cause of action. Evenunder that view, however, the provision would, if applied incases arising before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly impose on employers found liable a "new disability" in respectto past events. See Society for Propagation of the Gospel,22 F. Cas., at 767. The extent of a party's liability, in thecivil context as well as the criminal, is an important legalbecame so severe as to result in the victim's constructive discharge. Assessing damages against respondents on a theory of respondeat superiorwould thus entail an element of surprise. Even when the conduct in question is morally reprehensible or illegal, a degree of unfairness is inherentwhenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past. Cf. Weaver, 450 U. S., at 28-30 (Ex Post Facto Clauseassures fair notice and governmental restraint, and does not turn on "anindividual's right to less punishment"). The new damages provisions of$ 102 can be expected to give managers an added incentive to take preventive measures to ward off discriminatory conduct by subordinates beforeit occurs, but that purpose is not served by applying the regime to preenactment conduct.511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT284 LANDGRAF v.

S. 306, 314-315 (1908) (construing statute restricting subcontractors' rights to recover damages fromprime contractors as prospective in absence of "clear,strong and imperative" language from Congress favoringretroactivity).37It will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that retroactive application of a new statutewould vindicate its purpose more fully.38 That consider37 We have sometimes said that new "remedial" statutes, like new "procedural" ones, should presumptively apply to pending cases. See, e. g.,Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S., at 71, and n. 38 ("Clearly, $ 1404(a) is a remedialprovision applicable to pending actions"); Beazell, 269 U. S., at 171 (ExPost Facto Clause does not limit "legislative control of remedies andmodes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance"). Whilethat statement holds true for some kinds of remedies, see supra, at 273-274 (discussing prospective relief), we have not classified a statute introducing damages liability as the sort of "remedial" change that shouldpresumptively apply in pending cases. "Retroactive modification" ofdamages remedies may "normally harbo[r] much less potential for mischiefthan retroactive changes in the principles of liability," Hastings v. EarthSatellite Corp., 628 F. 2d 85, 93 (CADC), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 905 (1980),but that potential is nevertheless still significant.38 Petitioner argues that our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett CountyPublic Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), supports application of $ 102 to hercase. Relying on the principle that "where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for suchinvasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good thewrong,' " id., at 66 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)), weheld in Franklin that the right of action under Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 included a claim for damages. Petitioner arguesthat Franklin supports her position because, if she cannot obtain damagespursuant to $ 102, she will be left remediless despite an adjudged violationof her right under Title VII to be free of workplace discrimination. However, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not a statute to which wewould apply the "traditional presumption in favor of all available remedies." 503 U. S., at 72. That statute did not create a "general right tosue" for employment discrimination, but instead specified a set of "circumscribed remedies." See United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 240 (1992).Until the 1991 amendment, the Title VII scheme did not allow for dam511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT286 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTSScalia, J., concurring in judgmentsation, however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumptionagainst retroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursuea single goal, and compromises necessary to their enactmentmay require adopting means other than those that wouldmost effectively pursue the main goal. A legislator whosupported a prospective statute might reasonably opposeretroactive application of the same statute. Indeed, there isreason to believe that the omission of the 1990 version's express retroactivity provisions was a factor in the passage ofthe 1991 bill. Section 102 is plainly not the sort of provisionthat must be understood to operate retroactively because acontrary reading would render it ineffective.The presumption against statutory retroactivity isfounded upon sound considerations of general policy andpractice, and accords with long held and widely shared ex-pectations about the usual operation of legislation. We aresatisfied that it applies to $ 102. Because we have found noclear evidence of congressional intent that $ 102 of the CivilRights Act of 1991 should apply to cases arising before itsenactment, we conclude that the judgment of the Court ofAppeals must be affirmed.
