In the latest chapter of this long-litigated original-jurisdiction case, the Quechan Tribe (Tribe) and the UnitedStates on the Tribe's behalf assert claims for increased rightsto water from the Colorado River. These claims are basedon the contention that the Fort Yuma (Quechan) Indian Res-ervation encompasses some 25,000 acres of disputed boundary lands not attributed to that reservation in earlier stagesof the litigation. In this decision, we resolve a thresholdquestion regarding these claims to additional water rights:Are the claims precluded by this Court's prior decision inArizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963) (Arizona I), orby a consent judgment entered by the United States ClaimsCourt in 1983? The Special Master has prepared a reportrecommending that the Court reject the first ground for preclusion but accept the second. We reject both grounds forpreclusion and remand the case to the Special Master forconsideration of the claims for additional water rights appur-tenant to the disputed boundary lands.IThis litigation began in 1952 when Arizona invoked ouroriginal jurisdiction to settle a dispute with California overthe extent of each State's right to use water from the Colo-rado River system. Nevada intervened, seeking a determination of its water rights, and Utah and New Mexico werejoined as defendants. The United States intervened andsought water rights on behalf of various federal establish-ments, including five Indian reservations: the ChemehueviIndian Reservation, the Cocopah Indian Reservation, theFort Yuma (Quechan) Indian Reservation, the ColoradoRiver Indian Reservation, and the Fort Mojave Indian Res-ervation. The Court appointed Simon Rifkind as SpecialMaster.The first round of the litigation culminated in our opinionin Arizona I. We agreed with Special Master Rifkind that530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN398 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtthe apportionment of Colorado River water was governed bythe Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, 43 U. S. C. $ 617et seq., and by contracts entered into by the Secretary of theInterior pursuant to the Act. We further agreed that theUnited States had reserved water rights for the five reserva-tions under the doctrine ofWinters v. United States, 207U. S. 564 (1908). See Arizona I, 373 U. S., at 565, 599-601.Because the Tribes' water rights were effective as of thetime each reservation was created, the rights were considered present perfected rights and given priority under theAct.Id., at 600. We also agreed with the Master that thereservations' water rights should be based on the amount ofpracticably irrigable acreage on each reservation and sustained his findings as to the relevant acreage for each reservation. Ibid. Those findings were incorporated in our decree of March 9, 1964, which specified the quantities andpriorities of the water entitlements for the States, theUnited States, and the Tribes. Arizona v. California, 376U. S. 340. The Court rejected as premature, however, Master Rifkind's recommendation to determine the disputedboundaries of the Fort Mojave and Colorado River IndianReservations; we ordered, instead, that water rights forthose two reservations "shall be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the eventthat the boundaries of the respective reservations are finallydetermined." Id., at 345.In 1978, the United States and the State parties jointlymoved this Court to enter a supplemental decree identifyingpresent perfected rights to the use of mainstream water ineach State and their priority dates. The Tribes then filedmotions to intervene, and the United States ultimatelyjoined the Tribes in moving for additional water rights forthe five reservations. Again, the Court deferred resolutionof reservation boundary disputes and allied water rightsclaims. The supplemental decree we entered in 1979 set outthe water rights and priority dates for the five reservations530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN399Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtunder the 1964 decree, but added that the rights for all fivereservations (including the Fort Yuma Indian Reservationat issue here) "shall continue to be subject to appropriateadjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in theevent that the boundaries of the respective reservations arefinally determined."Arizona v. California, 439 U. S. 419,421 (per curiam). The Court then appointed Senior CircuitJudge Elbert P. Tuttle as Special Master and referred to himthe Tribes' motions to intervene and other pending matters.Master Tuttle issued a report recommending that theTribes be permitted to intervene, and concluding that various administrative actions taken by the Secretary of theInterior constituted "final determinations" of reservationboundaries for purposes of allocating water rights under the1964 decree. (Those administrative actions included a 1978Secretarial Order, discussed in greater detail infra, at 404-405, which recognized the Quechan Tribe's entitlement tothe disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation.)Master Tuttle also concluded that certain lands within theundisputed reservation boundaries but for which the UnitedStates had not sought water rights in Arizona I--the socalled "omitted lands"--had in fact been practicably irrigableat the time of Arizona I and were thus entitled to water.On these grounds, Master Tuttle recommended that theCourt reopen the 1964 decree to award the Tribes additionalwater rights.In Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983) (ArizonaII), the Court permitted the Tribes to intervene, but otherwise rejected Master Tuttle's recommendations. The Secretary's determinations did not qualify as "final determinations" of reservation boundaries, we ruled, because theStates, agencies, and private water users had not had an opportunity to obtain judicial review of those determinations.Id., at 636-637. In that regard, we noted that Californiastate agencies had initiated an action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of California chal530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtlenging the Secretary's decisions, and that the United Stateshad moved to dismiss that action on various grounds, including sovereign immunity. "There will be time enough," theCourt stated, "if any of these grounds for dismissal are sustained and not overturned on appellate review, to determinewhether the boundary issues foreclosed by such action arenevertheless open for litigation in this Court." Id., at 638.The Court also held that the United States was barred fromseeking water rights for the lands omitted from presentationin the proceedings leading to Arizona I; "principles of resjudicata," we said, "advise against reopening the calculationof the amount of practicably irrigable acreage." 460 U. S.,at 626. In 1984, in another supplemental decree, the Courtagain declared that water rights for all five reservations"shall be subject to appropriate adjustments by agreementor decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries ofthe respective reservations are finally determined." Arizona v. California, 466 U. S. 144, 145.The District Court litigation proceeded with the participation of eight parties: the United States, the States of Arizonaand California, the Metropolitan Water District of SouthernCalifornia, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the Quechan, Fort Mojave, and Colorado River Indian Tribes. TheDistrict Court rejected the United States' sovereign immunity defense; taking up the Fort Mojave Reservation matter first, the court voided the Secretary's determination ofthat reservation's boundaries. Metropolitan Water Dist. ofS. Cal. v. United States, 628 F. Supp. 1018 (SD Cal. 1986).The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, accepted the United States' plea of sovereign immunity, andon that ground reversed and remanded with instructions todismiss the entire case. Specifically, the Court of Appealsheld that the Quiet Title Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2409a, preservedthe United States' sovereign immunity from suits challenging the United States' title "to trust or restricted Indianlands," $ 2409a(a), and therefore blocked recourse to the Dis530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN401Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courttrict Court by the States and state agencies. MetropolitanWater Dist. of S. Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139 (1987).We granted certiorari and affirmed the Ninth Circuit's judg-ment by an equally divided Court. California v. UnitedStates, 490 U. S. 920 (1989) (per curiam).The dismissal of the District Court action dispelled anyexpectation that a "final determination" of reservationboundaries would occur in that forum. The State partiesthen moved to reopen the 1964 decree, asking the Court todetermine whether the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation andtwo other reservations were entitled to claim additionalboundary lands and, if so, additional water rights. Neitherthe United States nor the Tribes objected to the reopeningof the decree, and the Court granted the motion.Arizonav. California, 493 U. S. 886 (1989). After the death in 1990of the third Special Master, Robert McKay, the Court ap-pointed Frank J. McGarr as Special Master. Special MasterMcGarr has now filed a report and recommendation (McGarrReport), a full understanding of which requires a discussionof issues and events specific to the Fort Yuma Indian Reser-vation. We now turn to those issues and events.IIThe specific dispute before us has its roots in an 1884 Exec-utive Order signed by President Chester A. Arthur, designating approximately 72 square miles of land along theColorado River in California as the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation (Reservation) for the benefit of the Quechan Tribe.The Tribe, which had traditionally engaged in farming, offered to cede its rights to a portion of the Reservation to theUnited States in exchange for allotments of irrigated land toindividual Indians. In 1893, the Secretary of the Interiorconcluded an agreement with the Tribe (1893 Agreement),which Congress ratified in 1894. The 1893 Agreement pro-vided for the Tribe's cession of a 25,000-acre tract of boundary lands on the Reservation. Language in the agreement,530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courthowever, could be read to condition the cession on the per-formance by the United States of certain obligations, including construction within three years of an irrigation canal,allotment of irrigated land to individual Indians, sale of certain lands to raise revenues for canal construction, and open-ing of certain lands to the public domain.Doubts about the validity and effect of the 1893 Agree-ment arose as early as 1935. In that year the constructionof the All-American Canal, which prompted the interstatedispute inArizona I, see 373 U. S., at 554-555, also sparkeda controversy concerning the Fort Yuma Reservation.When the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclama-tion sought to route the canal through the Reservation, theDepartment's Indian Office argued that the Bureau had topay compensation to the Tribe for the right-of-way. TheSecretary of the Interior submitted the matter to the De-partment's Solicitor, Nathan Margold. In 1936, SolicitorMargold issued an opinion (Margold Opinion) stating that,under the 1893 Agreement, the Tribe had unconditionallyceded the lands in question to the United States. 1 Dept. ofInterior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Affairs596, 600 (No. M-28198, Jan. 8, 1936). The Margold Opinionremained the position of the Federal Government for 42years.In 1946, Congress enacted the Indian Claims CommissionAct, 60 Stat. 1049, 25 U. S. C. $ 70 et seq. (1976 ed.), establish-ing an Article I tribunal with power to decide claims ofIndian tribes against the United States.1 See generally1 The Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Commission to resolveIndian claims solely by the payment of compensation. Section 2 of theAct gave the Commission jurisdiction over, among other things, claimsalleging that agreements between a tribe and the United States werevitiated by fraud, duress, or unconscionable consideration, 25 U. S. C.$ 70a(3) (1976 ed.), claims arising from the unlawful taking of Indian landsby the United States, $ 70a(4), and claims based upon fair and honorabledealings not recognized by law or equity, $ 70a(5). The Commission's"[f]inal determinations," $ 70r, were subject to review by the Court of530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the CourtUnited States v. Dann, 470 U. S. 39 (1985). The Tribe filedan action before the Commission in 1951, challenging the validity and effect of the 1893 Agreement. In that action, re-ferred to by the parties as Docket No. 320, the Tribe reliedprincipally on two mutually exclusive grounds for relief.First, the Tribe alleged that the 1893 Agreement was obtained through fraud, coercion, and/or inadequate consider-ation, rendering it "wholly nugatory." Petition for Loss ofReservation in Docket No. 320 (Ind. Cl. Comm'n), |||| 15-16,reprinted in Brief for United States in Support of Exception,pp. 11a-27a. At the very least, contended the Tribe, theUnited States had failed to perform the obligations enumerated in the 1893 Agreement, rendering the cession void.Id., at || 31. In either event, the Tribe claimed continuingtitle to the disputed lands and sought damages essentiallyfor trespass. Alternatively, the Tribe alleged that the 1893Agreement was contractually valid but constituted an uncompensated taking of tribal lands, an appropriation of landsfor unconscionable consideration, and/or a violation of standards of fair and honorable dealing, for which $$ 2(3)-(5) of theAct authorized recovery.Id., at |||| 19, 22, 25. According tothis theory of recovery, the 1893 Agreement had indeedvested in the United States unconditional title to the disClaims, $ 70s(b), and, if upheld, were submitted to Congress for payment,$ 70u. Section 15 authorized the Attorney General to represent theUnited States before the Commission and, "with the approval of theCommission, to compromise any claim presented to the Commission." 25U. S. C. $ 70n (1976 ed.). The Act provided that such compromises "shallbe submitted by the Commission to the Congress as a part of its reportas provided in section 70t of this title in the same manner as final determinations of the Commission, and shall be subject to the provisions of section70u of this title." Ibid. Section 22(a) of the Act provided that "[t]hepayment of any claim, after its determination in accordance with this chapter, shall be a full discharge of the United States of all claims and demandstouching any of the matters involved in the controversy." 25 U. S. C.$ 70u(a) (1976 ed.). Pursuant to statute, $ 70v, the Commission ceased itsoperations in 1978 and transferred its remaining cases to the Court ofClaims.530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN404 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtputed lands, and the Tribe sought damages as compensationfor that taking. During the more than quarter-century oflitigation in Docket No. 320, the Tribe vacillated betweenthese two grounds for relief, sometimes emphasizing one andsometimes the other. See Quechan Tribe of Fort YumaReservation v. United States, 26 Ind. Cl. Comm'n 15 (1971),reprinted in Brief for United States in Support of Exception,at 29a-34a.The Commission conducted a trial on liability, but stayedfurther proceedings in 1970 because legislation had been pro-posed in Congress that would have restored the disputedlands to the Tribe. The legislation was not enacted, and theCommission vacated the stay. In 1976, the Commissiontransferred the matter to the Court of Claims.In the meantime, the Tribe had asked the Department ofthe Interior to reconsider its 1936 Margold Opinion regarding the 1893 Agreement. In 1977, Interior Solicitor ScottAustin concluded, in accord with the 1936 opinion, that the1893 Agreement was valid and that the cession of the disputed lands had been unconditional. Opinion of the Solicitor, No. M-36886 (Jan. 18, 1977), 84 I. D. 1 (1977) (AustinOpinion). It soon became clear both to the Tribe and to interested Members of Congress, however, that the AustinOpinion had provoked controversy within the Department,and, after the election of President Carter, the Departmentrevisited the issue and reversed course. In 1978, withoutnotice to the parties, Solicitor Leo Krulitz issued an opinionconcluding that the 1893 Agreement had provided for a conditional cession of the disputed lands, that the conditions hadnot been met by the United States, and that "[t]itle to thesubject property is held by the United States in trust for theQuechan Tribe." Opinion of the Solicitor, No. M-36908 (Jan.2, 1979), 86 I. D. 3, 22 (1979) (Krulitz Opinion). On December 20, 1978, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order adopting the Krulitz Opinion and confirmingthe Tribe's entitlement to the disputed lands, with the ex530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpress exception of certain lands that the United States hadacquired pursuant to Act of Congress or had conveyed tothird parties.The 1978 Secretarial Order caused the United States tochange its position both in Docket No. 320, which was stillpending in the Claims Court, and in the present litigation.Because the Secretarial Order amounted to an admissionthat the 1893 Agreement had been ineffective to transfertitle and that the Tribe enjoyed beneficial ownership of thedisputed boundary lands, the United States no longer op-posed the Tribe's claim for trespass in Docket No. 320. Inthe present litigation, the Secretarial Order both promptedthe United States to file a water rights claim for the affectedboundary lands and provided the basis for the Tribe's intervention to assert a similar, albeit larger, water rights claim.See Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 632-633. Those water rightsclaims are the subject of the current proceedings.In August 1983, a few months after this Court decided inArizona II that the 1978 Secretarial Order did not constitutea final determination of reservation boundaries, see supra,at 399-400, the United States and the Tribe entered intoa settlement of Docket No. 320, which the Court of Claimsapproved and entered as its final judgment. Under theterms of that settlement, the United States agreed to paythe Tribe $15 million in full satisfaction of "all rights, claims,or demands which plaintiff [i. e., the Tribe] has asserted orcould have asserted with respect to the claims in Docket320." Final Judgment, Docket No. 320 (Aug. 11, 1983). Thejudgment further provided that "plaintiff shall be barredthereby from asserting any further rights, claims, or demands against the defendant and any future action on theclaims encompassed on Docket 320." Ibid. The UnitedStates and the Tribe also stipulated that the "final judgmentis based on a compromise and settlement and shall not beconstrued as an admission by either party for the purposesof precedent or argument in any other case." Ibid. Both530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtthe Tribe and the United States continue to recognize theTribe's entitlement to the disputed boundary lands.IIIMaster McGarr has issued a series of orders culminatingin the report and recommendation now before the Court.He has recommended that the Court reject the claims of theUnited States and the Tribe seeking additional water rightsfor the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation. The Master re-jected the State parties' contention that this Court'sArizonaI decision precludes the United States and the Tribe fromseeking water rights for the disputed boundary lands. Heconcluded, however, that the United States and the Tribe areprecluded from pursuing those claims by operation of the1983 Claims Court consent judgment. The State partieshave filed an exception to the first of these preclusion recom-mendations, and the United States and the Tribe have filedexceptions to the second. In Part III-A, infra, we considerthe exception filed by the State parties, and in Part III-Bwe address the exceptions filed by the United States and theTribe. The Special Master has also recommended that theCourt approve the parties' proposed settlements respectingthe Fort Mojave and Colorado River Indian Reservations.No party has filed an exception to those recommendations;we address them in Part III-C,infra.AThe States of Arizona and California, the Coachella ValleyWater District, and the Metropolitan Water District ofSouthern California (State parties) argued before SpecialMaster McGarr, and repeat before this Court, that the waterrights claims associated with the disputed boundary landsof the Fort Yuma Reservation are precluded by the finalityrationale this Court employed in dismissing the "omittedlands" claims inArizona II. See supra, at 399-400. Ac-cording to the State parties, the United States could have530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN407Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtraised a boundary lands claim for the Fort Yuma Reservationin the Arizona I proceedings based on facts known at thattime, just as it did for the Fort Mojave and Colorado RiverReservations, but deliberately decided not to do so, just asit did with respect to the "omitted lands." In Arizona II,this Court rejected the United States' claim for water rightsfor the "omitted lands," emphasizing that "[c]ertainty ofrights is particularly important with respect to water rightsin the Western United States" and noting "the strong interest in finality in this case." 460 U. S., at 620. Observing that the 1964 decree determined "the extent of irrigableacreage within the uncontested boundaries of the reservations," id., at 621, n. 12, the Court refused to reconsiderissues "fully and fairly litigated 20 years ago," id., at 621.The Court concomitantly held that the Tribes were boundby the United States' representation of them in Arizona I.460 U. S., at 626-627.The Special Master rejected the State parties' preclusionargument. He brought out first the evident reason why theUnited States did not assert water rights claims for the FortYuma Reservation boundary lands in Arizona I. At thatpoint in time, the United States was bound to follow the 1936Margold Opinion, see supra, at 402, which maintained thatthe Tribe had no claim to those lands. "[I]t is clear," theMaster stated, "that the later Secretary of the Interior opinion arbitrarily changing [the Margold] decision was a circumstance not known in 1964, thus constituting an exception tothe application of the rule of res adjudicata." Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 4, pp. 6-7(Sept. 6, 1991). Characterizing the question as "close," theMaster went on to conclude that "the Tribe is not precludedfrom asserting water rights based on boundary land claimson [sic] this proceeding, because although the U. S. on behalfof the Tribe failed to assert such claims in the proceedingleading to the 1964 decree, a later and then unknown circum530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtstance bars the application of the doctrine of res judicata tothis issue." Id., at 7.While the Special Master correctly recognized the rele-vance of the Margold Opinion to the litigating stance of theUnited States, he ultimately relied on an improper ground inrejecting the State parties' preclusion argument. The Department of the Interior's 1978 Secretarial Order recogniz-ing the Tribe's beneficial ownership of the boundary lands,see supra, at 404-405, does not qualify as a "later and thenunknown circumstance" that can overcome otherwise applicable preclusion principles. The 1978 Order did not changethe underlying facts in dispute; it simply embodied one party's changed view of the import of unchanged facts. More-over, the Tribe can hardly claim to have been surprised bythe Government's shift in assessment of the boundary landsownership question, for the Tribe had been advocating justsuch a shift for decades.The United States and the Tribe, however, urge othergrounds on which to reject the State parties' argumentregarding the preclusive effect of Arizona I. The UnitedStates and the Tribe maintain that the preclusion rationalethe Court applied to the "omitted lands" in Arizona II is notequally applicable to the disputed boundary lands,2 and that,in any event, the State parties have forfeited their preclusiondefense. We agree that the State parties' preclusion de2 The United States and the Tribe point to the holding in Arizona I thatSpecial Master Rifkind had erred in prematurely considering boundarylands claims relating to the Fort Mojave and Colorado River Reservations,see 373 U. S., at 601; they contend that consideration of the Fort YumaReservation boundaries would have been equally premature. They further stress that in Arizona II we held the omitted lands claims precludedbecause we resisted "reopen[ing] an adjudication . . . to reconsider whetherinitial factual determinations were correctly made," 460 U. S., at 623-624;in contrast, they maintain, the present claims turn on the validity of the1893 Agreement and the 1978 Secretarial Order, questions of law notaddressed in prior proceedings.530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN409Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtfense is inadmissible at this late date, and therefore we donot reach the merits of that plea. The State parties couldhave raised the defense in 1979 in response to the UnitedStates' motion for a supplemental decree granting additionalwater rights for the Fort Yuma Reservation. The Stateparties did not do so then, nor did they raise the objectionin 1982 when Arizona II was briefed and argued.3 Unac-countably, they raised the preclusion argument for the firsttime in 1989, when they initiated the current round of pro-ceedings. See Exception and Brief for State Parties 16; Motion of State Parties to Reopen Decree in Arizona v. California, O. T. 1989, No. 8 Orig., p. 6, n. 2. The State parties hadevery opportunity, and every incentive, to press their currentpreclusion argument at earlier stages in the litigation, yetfailed to do so.43 Noting that in Arizona II we "encouraged the parties to assert theirlegal claims and defenses in another forum," The Chief Justice concludes that the Court probably would have declined to resolve the preclusion issue at that stage of the case even had the State parties raised itthen. Post, at 423 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).One can only wonder why this should be so. If this Court had held inArizona II that the United States and the Tribe were precluded fromlitigating their boundary lands claims, it would have been pointless for theCourt to encourage pursuit of those claims "in another forum"; furtherassertion of the claims in any forum would have been barred. In anyevent, a party generally forfeits an affirmative defense by failing to raiseit even if the relevant proceeding is ultimately resolved on other grounds.4 The dissent's observation that "the only `pleadings' in this case werefiled in the 1950's," post, at 422, is beside the point. The State partiescould have properly raised the preclusion defense as early as February1979, in their response to the United States' motion for modification of thedecree, yet did not do so. See Response of the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada and the Other California Defendants to the Motion of theUnited States for Modification of Decree, O. T. 1978, No. 8 Orig. Alternatively, it was open to the State parties to seek leave to file a supplementalpleading "setting forth . . . occurrences or events which have happenedsince the date of the pleading sought to be amended." Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 15(d). In such a supplemental pleading, and in compliance with Rule530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN410 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Court"[W]hile the technical rules of preclusion are not strictlyapplicable [in the context of a single ongoing original action],the principles upon which these rules are founded should in-form our decision." Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 619. Thoseprinciples rank res judicata an affirmative defense ordinarilylost if not timely raised. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c).Counsel for the State parties conceded at oral argument that"no preclusion argument was made with respect to boundarylands" in the proceedings leading up to Arizona II, and that"after this Court's decision inArizona II and after theCourt's later decision in [Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.110 (1983)], the light finally dawned on the State parties thatthere was a valid preclusion--or res judicata argument herewith respect to Fort Yuma." Tr. of Oral Arg. 46-47. Wedisapprove the notion that a party may wake up because a"light finally dawned," years after the first opportunity toraise a defense, and effectively raise it so long as the partywas (though no fault of anyone else) in the dark until itslate awakening.The State parties assert that our prior pronouncements inthis case have expressly recognized the possibility that future boundary lands claims for the Fort Yuma Reservationmight be precluded. If anything, the contrary is true.Nothing in the Arizona II decision hints that the Court be-lieved the boundary lands issue might ultimately be held precluded. Rather, the Court expressly found it "necessary todecide whether any or all of these boundary disputes havebeen `finally determined' within the meaning of Article8(c), the preclusion defense could have been raised. No such supplemental pleading was ever presented, and by 1989 a reasonable time to do sohad surely expired.The State parties' tardiness in raising their preclusion defense is hardto account for, while the United States' decision not to assert claims forthe disputed boundary lands until 1978 can at least be explained by thecontinued vitality of the Margold Opinion, see supra, at 402. It is puzzling that the dissent should go to such lengths to excuse the former delaywhile relentlessly condemning the latter.530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the CourtII(D)(5) . . . ." 460 U. S., at 631 (emphasis added). ThatArizona II contains no discussion of preclusion with respectto the disputed lands is hardly surprising, given that theState parties neglected to raise that issue until six yearslater.The Court did note inArizona II that in the DistrictCourt proceedings the United States had asserted defensesbased on "lack of standing, the absence of indispensable par-ties, sovereign immunity, and the applicable statute of limitations," and added that "[t]here will be time enough, if any ofthese grounds for dismissal are sustained and not overturned on appellate review, to determine whether the boundary issues foreclosed by such [lower court] action are nevertheless open for litigation in this Court." 460 U. S., at 638(emphasis added). This passage, however, is most sensiblyread to convey that the defenses just mentioned--standing,indispensable parties, sovereign immunity, and the statute oflimitations--would not necessarily affect renewed litigationin this Court. The passage contains no acknowledgment,express or implied, of a lurking preclusion issue stemmingfrom our Arizona I disposition.Moreover, and of large significance, the 1979 and 1984 supplemental decrees anticipated that the disputed boundary issues for all five reservations, including the Fort Yuma Reservation, would be "finally determined" in some forum, not bypreclusion but on the merits. See 1984 Supplemental Decree, Art. II(D)(5), Arizona v. California, 466 U. S., at 145(Water rights for all five reservations "shall be subject toappropriate adjustments by agreement or decree of thisCourt in the event that the boundaries of the respectivereservations are finally determined."); 1979 SupplementalDecree, Art. II(D)(5), Arizona v. California, 439 U. S., at421 (same).The State parties themselves stipulated to the terms ofthe supplemental decree we entered in 1979. They also appear to have litigated the Arizona II proceedings on the un530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN412 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtderstanding that the boundary disputes should be resolvedon the merits. See 460 U. S., at 634 ("[The State parties]argued . . . that the boundary controversies were ripe forjudicial review, and they urged the Special Master to receiveevidence, hear legal arguments, and resolve each of theboundary disputes, but only for the limited purpose of establishing additional Indian water rights, if any."); Report ofSpecial Master Tuttle, O. T. 1981, No. 8 Orig., p. 57 (describ-ing the State parties' contention "that the boundaries [of allfive reservations] have not been finally determined and thatI should make a de novo determination of the boundaries forrecommendation to the Court"). As late as 1988, the Stateparties asked the Court to appoint a new Special Master anddirect him "to conclude his review of the boundary issuesas expeditiously as possible and to submit a recommendeddecision to the Court." Brief for Petitioners in Californiav. United States, O. T. 1987, No. 87-1165, p. 49.Finally, the State parties argue that even if they earlierfailed to raise the preclusion defense, this Court should raiseit now sua sponte. Judicial initiative of this sort might beappropriate in special circumstances. Most notably, "if acourt is on notice that it has previously decided the issuepresented, the court may dismiss the action sua sponte, eventhough the defense has not been raised. This result is fullyconsistent with the policies underlying res judicata: it is notbased solely on the defendant's interest in avoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit, but is also based on the avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste." United States v. SiouxNation, 448 U. S. 371, 432 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)(citations omitted). That special circumstance is not presenthere: While the State parties contend that the Fort Yumaboundary dispute could have been decided in Arizona I, thisCourt plainly has not "previously decided the issue presented." Therefore we do not face the prospect of redoinga matter once decided. Where no judicial resources havebeen spent on the resolution of a question, trial courts must530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN413Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtbe cautious about raising a preclusion bar sua sponte,thereby eroding the principle of party presentation so basicto our system of adjudication.In view of the State parties' failure to raise the preclusionargument earlier in the litigation, despite ample opportunityand cause to do so, we hold that the claims of the UnitedStates and the Tribe to increased water rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort Yuma Reservation are notforeclosed by our decision in Arizona I.BThe State parties also assert that the instant water rightsclaims are precluded by the 1983 consent judgment in theClaims Court proceeding, Docket No. 320. Special MasterMcGarr agreed, noting the consent judgment's declarationthat the Tribe would "be barred thereby from asserting anyfurther rights, claims or demands against the defendant andany future action encompassed on docket no. 320." See Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 4,at 9-10. On reconsideration, the Special Master provided afuller account of his recommendation. The settlement, heconcluded, had extinguished the Tribe's claim to title in thedisputed boundary lands, vesting that title in the UnitedStates against all the world: "The only viable basis for adamage or trespass claim [in Docket No. 320] was that the1893 taking was illegal and that title therefore remainedwith the Tribe. When the Tribe accepted money in settlement of this claim, it relinquished its claim to title." Id.,No. 7, at 5 (May 5, 1992). See also id., No. 13, at 3 (Apr. 13,1993) ("[T]he relinquishment of all future claims regardingthe subject matter of Docket No. 320 in exchange for a sumof money extinguished the Tribe's title in the subjectlands . . . ."). Because the settlement extinguished theTribe's title to the disputed boundary lands, the Master reasoned, the United States and the Tribe cannot now seek addi530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN414 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courttional water rights based on the Tribe's purported beneficialownership of those lands.Under standard preclusion doctrine, the Master's recom-mendation cannot be sustained. As already noted, the express terms of the consent judgment in Docket No. 320barred the Tribe and the United States from assertingagainst each other any claim or defense they raised or couldhave raised in that action. See supra, at 405. As betweenthe parties to Docket No. 320, then, the settlement indeedhad, and was intended to have, claim-preclusive effect--amatter the United States and the Tribe readily concede.Exception and Brief for United States 36; Exception andBrief for Quechan Indian Tribe 20. But settlements ordinarily occasion no issue preclusion (sometimes called collateral estoppel), unless it is clear, as it is not here, that theparties intend their agreement to have such an effect. "Inmost circumstances, it is recognized that consent agreementsordinarily are intended to preclude any further litigation onthe claim presented but are not intended to preclude furtherlitigation on any of the issues presented. Thus consentjudgments ordinarily support claim preclusion but not issuepreclusion." 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 4443, pp. 384-385 (1981). This differentiation is grounded in basic res judicata doctrine. It isthe general rule that issue preclusion attaches only "[w]henan issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determinedby a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment." Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 27, p. 250 (1982). "In the case of a judgment enteredby confession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated. Therefore, the rule of this Section [describingissue preclusion's domain] does not apply with respect to anyissue in a subsequent action." Id., comment e, at 257.This Court's decision in United States v. InternationalBuilding Co., 345 U. S. 502 (1953), is illustrative. In 1942,the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed deficiencies530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN415Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtagainst a taxpayer for the taxable years 1933, 1938, and 1939,alleging that the taxpayer had claimed an excessive basisfor depreciation. Id., at 503. After the taxpayer filed forbankruptcy, however, the Commissioner and the taxpayerfiled stipulations in the pending Tax Court proceedings stat-ing that there was no deficiency for the taxable yearsin question, and the Tax Court entered a formal decision tothat effect.Id., at 503-504. In 1948, the Commissioner as-sessed deficiencies for the years 1943, 1944, and 1945, and thetaxpayer defended on the ground that the earlier Tax Courtdecision was preclusive on the issue of the correct basis fordepreciation. We disagreed, holding that the Tax Court de-cision, entered pursuant to the parties' stipulations, did notaccomplish an "estoppel by judgment," i. e., it had no issue-preclusive effect:"We conclude that the decisions entered by the TaxCourt for the years 1933, 1938, and 1939 were only apro forma acceptance by the Tax Court of an agreementbetween the parties to settle their controversy for reasons undisclosed . . . . Perhaps, as the Court of Appealsinferred, the parties did agree on the basis for depreciation. Perhaps the settlement was made for a differentreason, for some exigency arising out of the bankruptcyproceeding. As the case reaches us, we are unable totell whether the agreement of the parties was based onthe merits or on some collateral consideration. Cer-tainly the judgments entered areres judicata of the taxclaims for the years 1933, 1938, and 1939, whether or notthe basis of the agreements on which they rest reachedthe merits . . . . Estoppel by judgment includes mattersin a second proceeding which were actually presentedand determined in an earlier suit. A judgment enteredwith the consent of the parties may involve a determina-tion of questions of fact and law by the court. But unless a showing is made that that was the case, the judg-ment has no greater dignity, so far as collateral estoppel530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN416 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtis concerned, than any judgment entered only as acompromise of the parties." Id., at 505-506 (citationsomitted).The State parties, perhaps recognizing the infirmity oftheir argument as a matter of standard preclusion doctrine,assert that common-law principles of issue preclusion do notapply in the special context of Indian land claims. Instead,they argue, $ 22 of the Indian Claims Commission Act cre-ated a special regime of "statutory preclusion."5 Accordingto the State parties, the payment of a Commission judgmentfor claims to aboriginal or trust lands automatically and universally extinguishes title to the Indian lands upon whichthe claim is based and creates a statutory bar to further assertion of claims against either the United States or thirdparties based on the extinguished title. The State partiespoint to several decisions of the Ninth Circuit in support ofthis contention. See Reply Brief for State Parties 17 (citingUnited States v. Pend Oreille Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1, 926 F. 2d1502 (CA9 1991)); Reply Brief for State Parties 15 (citingUnited States v. Dann, 873 F. 2d 1189 (CA9 1989)); ReplyBrief for State Parties 11 (citing United States v. Gemmill,535 F. 2d 1145 (CA9 1976)).We need not decide whether, in the distinctive context ofthe Indian Claims Commission Act, some consent judgments5 Section 22 provided:"(a) When the report of the Commission determining any claimant tobe entitled to recover has been filed with Congress, such report shall havethe effect of a final judgment of the Court of Claims, and there is authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to pay the final determination of the Commission."The payment of any claim, after its determination in accordance withthis chapter, shall be a full discharge of the United States of all claims anddemands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy."(b) A final determination against a claimant made and reported in accordance with this chapter shall forever bar any further claim or demandagainst the United States arising out of the matter involved in the controversy." 25 U. S. C. $ 70u (1976 ed.).530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN417Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmight bar a tribe from asserting title even in discrete litiga-tion against third parties, for the 1983 settlement of DocketNo. 320 plainly could not qualify as such a judgment. Notonly was the issue of ownership of the disputed boundarylands not actually litigated and decided in Docket No. 320,but, most notably, the Tribe proceeded on alternative andmutually exclusive theories of recovery. Had the case proceeded to final judgment upon trial, the Tribe might havewon damages for a taking, indicating that title was in theUnited States. Alternatively, however, the Tribe mighthave obtained damages for trespass, indicating that title remained in the Tribe. The consent judgment embraced all ofthe Tribe's claims. There was no election by the Tribe ofone theory over the other, nor was any such election requiredto gain approval for the consent judgment. The SpecialMaster's assumption that the settlement necessarily and universally relinquished the Tribe's claim to title was thus unwarranted. Certainly, if the $15 million payment constituted a discharge of the Tribe's trespass claim, it would makescant sense to say that the acceptance of the payment extinguished the Tribe's title. In contrast, the Ninth Circuitcases cited by the State parties (the correctness of which wedo not address) all involved Indian Claims Commission Actpetitions in which tribes claimed no continuing title, choosinginstead to seek compensation from the United States for thetaking of their lands. See, e. g., Pend Oreille, 926 F. 2d, at1507-1508; Dann, 873 F. 2d, at 1192, 1194; Gemmill, 535 F. 2d,at 1149, and n. 6.The United States invites us to look behind the consentjudgment in Docket No. 320 at presettlement stipulationsand memoranda purportedly demonstrating that the judgment was grounded on the parties' shared view, after the1978 Secretarial Order, that the disputed lands belong to theTribe. We need not accept the Government's invitation.On the matter of issue preclusion, it suffices to observe thatthe settlement was ambiguous as between mutually exclu530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN418 ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtsive theories of recovery. Like the Tax Court settlement inInternational Building Co., then, the consent judgment inthe Tribe's Claims Court action is too opaque to serve as afoundation for issue preclusion. Accordingly, we hold thatthe claims of the United States and the Tribe to increasedwater rights for the disputed boundary lands of the FortYuma Reservation are not precluded by the consent judg-ment in Docket No. 320.CThe Special Master has recommended that the Court ap-prove the parties' proposed settlement of the dispute respecting the Fort Mojave Reservation. The claim to addi-tional water for the Fort Mojave Reservation arises out of adispute over the accuracy of a survey of the so-called Hayand Wood Reserve portion of the Reservation. See Arizona II, 460 U. S., at 631-632. The parties agreed to resolvethe matter through an accord that (1) specifies the location ofthe disputed boundary; (2) preserves the claims of the partiesregarding title to and jurisdiction over the bed of the lastnatural course of the Colorado River within the agreed-uponboundary; (3) awards the Tribe the lesser of an additional3,022 acre-feet of water or enough water to supply the needsof 468 acres; (4) precludes the United States and the Tribefrom claiming additional water rights from the ColoradoRiver for lands within the Hay and Wood Reserve; and (5)disclaims any intent to affect any private claims to title to orjurisdiction over any lands. See McGarr Report 8-9 (July28, 1999). We accept the Master's uncontested recommendation and approve the proposed settlement.The Master has also recommended that the Court approvethe parties' proposed settlement of the dispute respectingthe Colorado River Indian Reservation. The claim to additional water for that reservation stems principally from adispute over whether the reservation boundary is the ambulatory west bank of the Colorado River or a fixed line repre530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN419Cite as: 530 U. S. 392 (2000)Opinion of the Courtsenting a past location of the River. See Arizona II, 460U. S., at 631. The parties agreed to resolve the matterthrough an accord that (1) awards the Tribes the lesser of anadditional 2,100 acre-feet of water or enough water to irrigate 315 acres; (2) precludes the United States or the Tribefrom seeking additional reserved water rights from the Colorado River for lands in California; (3) embodies the parties'intent not to adjudicate in these proceedings the correct location of the disputed boundary; (4) preserves the competingclaims of the parties to title to or jurisdiction over the bedof the Colorado River within the reservation; and (5) pro-vides that the agreement will become effective only if theMaster and the Court approve the settlement. See McGarrReport 9-10. The Master expressed concern that the settlement does not resolve the location of the disputed boundary,but recognized that it did achieve the ultimate aim of determining water rights associated with the disputed boundarylands.Id., at 10-12, 13-14. We again accept the Master'srecommendation and approve the proposed settlement.6* * *For the foregoing reasons, we remand the outstandingwater rights claims associated with the disputed boundary6 A group called the West Bank Homeowners Association has filed abrief amicus curiae objecting to the proposed settlement of water rightsclaims respecting the Colorado River Indian Reservation. The Association represents some 650 families who lease property from the UnitedStates within the current boundaries of the Reservation. The Court andthe Special Master have each denied the Association's request to intervenein these proceedings. See Arizona v. California, 514 U. S. 1081 (1995);Special Master McGarr Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 17 (Mar. 29,1995). The Master observed that the Association's members do "not ownland in the disputed area and [the Association] makes no claim to title orwater rights," id., at 2, thus their interests will "not be impeded orimpaired by the outcome of this litigation," id., at 6. Accordingly, we donot further consider the Association's objections.530US1 Unit: $U77 [12-03-01 08:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN420 ARIZONA v.
