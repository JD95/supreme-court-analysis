BRITTONOpinion of the Courtplaintiff must adduce clear and convincing evidence of improper motive in order to defeat a motion for summaryjudgment.IPetitioner is serving a life sentence in the District of Columbia's correctional system. During his confinement hehas filed several lawsuits and has assisted other prisonerswith their cases. He has also provided interviews to reporters who have written news stories about prison conditions.He is a litigious and outspoken prisoner.The events that gave rise to this case occurred in 1988 and1989. Because of overcrowding in the District of Columbiaprison in Lorton, Virginia, petitioner and other inmates weretransferred to the county jail in Spokane, Washington.Thereafter, he was moved, first to a Washington Stateprison, later to a facility in Cameron, Missouri, next back toLorton, then to Petersburg, Virginia, and ultimately to thefederal prison in Marianna, Florida. Three boxes containinghis personal belongings, including legal materials, weretransferred separately. When the District of Columbia Department of Corrections received the boxes from the Washington State facility, respondent, a District correctional officer, asked petitioner's brother-in-law to pick them up ratherthan sending them directly to petitioner's next destination.The boxes were ultimately shipped to Marianna by petitioner's mother, at petitioner's expense, but he was initially denied permission to receive them because they had been sentoutside official prison channels. He finally recovered theproperty several months after his arrival in Florida.Petitioner contends that respondent deliberately misdirected the boxes to punish him for exercising his FirstAmendment rights and to deter similar conduct in the future.Beyond generalized allegations of respondent's hostility, healleges specific incidents in which his protected speech had523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN579Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtprovoked her.1 His claimed injury caused by the delay inreceiving his boxes includes the costs of having the boxesshipped and purchasing new clothes and other items in theinterim, as well as mental and emotional distress. Respondent denies any retaliatory motive and asserts that she en-trusted the property to petitioner's brother-in-law, who wasalso a District of Columbia corrections employee, in order toensure its prompt and safe delivery.Although the factual dispute is relatively simple, it engen-dered litigation that has been both protracted and complex.We shall briefly describe the proceedings that led to the enbanc Court of Appeals decision that we are reviewing, andthen summarize that decision.The Early ProceedingsPetitioner filed suit against respondent and the Districtof Columbia seeking damages under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983.2 The principal theory advanced in his origi1 In 1986, petitioner had invited a Washington Post reporter to visit theLorton prison and obtained a visitor application for the reporter, whichresulted in a front-page article on the prison's overcrowding "crisis." Respondent had approved the visitor application, which did not disclose thevisitor's affiliation with the newspaper; she allegedly accused petitioner oftricking her and threatened to make life "as hard for him as possible."App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a. Petitioner also alleges that when he hadcomplained in 1988 about invasions of privacy, respondent told him,"You're a prisoner, you don't have any rights." Id., at 179a. Later in1988, after another front-page Washington Post article quoted petitioneras saying that litigious prisoners had been "handpicked" for transfer toSpokane "so our lawsuits will be dismissed on procedural grounds," respondent allegedly referred to him as a "legal troublemaker." Id., at180a-181a.2 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides:"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States orother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of anyrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN580 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtnal complaint was that respondent had diverted the boxescontaining his legal materials in order to interfere with hisconstitutional right of access to the courts.Prior to discovery, respondent, relying in part on a qualified immunity defense, moved for dismissal of the complaintor summary judgment. The motion was denied and respondent appealed, arguing, first, that the complaint did notallege a violation of any constitutional right that was clearlyestablished at the time of her acts; and, second, that the com-plaint "failed to satisfy the `heightened pleading standard'that this circuit applies to damage actions against govern-ment officials." 951 F. 2d 1314, 1316 (CADC 1991).The Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that his con-stitutional right of access to the courts was well establishedin 1989, and that his allegations of wrongful intent were suf-ficiently detailed and specific to withstand a motion to dismiss even under the Circuit's "heightened pleading stand-ard." Id., at 1318, 1321. The court concluded, however,that the allegations of actual injury to his ability to litigatewere insufficient under that standard; accordingly, the complaint should have been dismissed. Id., at 1321-1322. Because the contours of the pleading standard had been clari-fied in a decision announced while the case was on appeal,see Hunter v. District of Columbia, 943 F. 2d 69 (CADC1991), the court concluded that petitioner should be allowedto replead.On remand, petitioner filed an amended complaint addingmore detail to support his access claim and also adding twonew claims: a due process claim and the claim that respond-ent's alleged diversion of his property was motivated by anshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, orother proper proceeding for redress . . . ."Only the claim against respondent is before us. The Court of Appealsdid not consider whether petitioner's amended complaint stated a cause ofaction against the District.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN581Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtintent to retaliate against him for exercising his FirstAmendment rights. The District Court dismissed theamended complaint because the court access claim and thedue process claim were legally insufficient, and because theFirst Amendment retaliation claim did not allege "direct evi-dence of unconstitutional motive." 844 F. Supp. 795, 802(DC 1994). The dismissal was, in effect, mandated by priordecisions of the Court of Appeals holding that allegations ofcircumstantial evidence of such a motivation were insuffi-cient to withstand a motion to dismiss. SeeMartin v. D. C.Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435 (1987);Siegert v. Gilley, 895 F. 2d 797, 800-802 (1990), aff 'd on othergrounds, 500 U. S. 226 (1991).The En Banc ProceedingA panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal ofthe first two claims but suggested that the entire courtshould review the dismissal of the First Amendment retalia-tion claim. Accordingly, the en banc court ordered the parties to file briefs addressing five specific questions, two ofwhich concerned the power of the Circuit to supplement theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure with special pleading re-quirements for plaintiffs bringing civil rights claims againstgovernment officials,3 and two of which concerned possiblespecial grounds for granting defense motions for summaryjudgment in cases "where the unlawfulness depends on the3 The first two questions asked:"1. In cases where plaintiffs bring civil rights claims against Government officials who assert qualified immunity, may this circuit supplementthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by requiring plaintiffs to satisfy aheightened pleading requirement in their complaint or face dismissal priorto discovery? If so, should it be done?"2. May this circuit require that plaintiffs who allege that Governmentofficials acted with unconstitutional intent plead direct, as opposed to circumstantial evidence of that intent? If so, should it be done?" App. toPet. for Cert. 108a.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN582 CRAWFORD-EL v.

A majority of the judges appear to haveagreed on these four propositions: (1) the case should be re-manded to the District Court for further proceedings; (2) theplaintiff does not have to satisfy any heightened pleadingrequirement, and may rely on circumstantial as well as directevidence; 5 (3) in order to prevail in an unconstitutional-motive case, the plaintiff must establish that motive byclear and convincing evidence; and (4) special proceduresto protect defendants from the costs of litigation in4 The questions regarding summary judgment asked:"3. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends onthe actor's unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, should the court grant a defense motion for summary judgment,made before plaintiff has conducted discovery, if the plaintiff has failed toadduce evidence from which the fact finder could reasonably infer theillicit motive? See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815-18 (1982);Elliott v. Thomas, 937 F. 2d 338, 345-46 (7th Cir. 1991)?"4. In claims of constitutional tort where the unlawfulness depends onthe actor's unconstitutional motive and the defendant enjoys qualified immunity, are there any circumstances, apart from national security issuesof the sort at stake in Halperin v. Kissinger, 807 F. 2d 180, 184-85 (D. C.Cir. 1986), where the court should grant a defense motion for summaryjudgment on a showing by the defendant such that a reasonable jurywould necessarily conclude that the defendant's stated motivation `wouldhave been reasonable'? Id. at 188; see also id. at 189 (summary judgmentwarranted where no reasonable jury could find that `it was objectivelyunreasonable for the defendants' to be acting for stated, innocent motives)." Id., at 108a-109a.5 On this point, the court disavowed its prior direct-evidence rule ofMartin v. D. C. Metropolitan Police Department, 812 F. 2d 1425, 1435(CADC 1987), and Siegert v. Gilley, 895 F. 2d 797, 800-802 (CADC 1990),aff'd on other grounds, 500 U. S. 226 (1991).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN583Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtunconstitutional-motive cases are required by the reasoningin this Court's opinion inHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.800 (1982).The primary opinion, written by Judge Williams, announced two principal conclusions: "First, we think Harlowallows an official to get summary judgment resolution of thequalified immunity issue, including the question of the official's state of mind, before the plaintiff has engaged in discov-ery on that issue. Second, we believe that unless the plaintiff offers clear and convincing evidence on the state-of-mindissue at summary judgment and trial, judgment or directedverdict (as appropriate) should be granted for the individualdefendant." 93 F. 3d 813, 815 (CADC 1996).Judge Silberman criticized Judge Williams' approach asconfusing, id., at 833, and suggested that Harlow's reasoningpointed to a "more straightforward solution," 93 F. 3d, at834. In his opinion, whenever a defendant asserts a legitimate motive for his or her action, only an objective inquiryinto pretextuality should be allowed. "If the facts establishthat the purported motivation would have been reasonable,the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity." Ibid.Judge Ginsburg agreed with the decision to impose a clearand convincing standard of proof on the unconstitutional motive issue, but he could not accept Judge Williams' new requirement that the District Court must "grant summaryjudgment prior to discovery unless the plaintiff already hasin hand" sufficient evidence to satisfy that standard. Id., at839. He described that innovation as "a rather bold intrusion into the district court's management of the fact-findingprocess" that would result in the defeat of meritorious claimsand "invite an increase in the number of constitutional tortsthat are committed." Ibid. He would allow limited discovery on a proper showing before ruling on a summary judgment motion, but noted that in cases involving qualified immunity it would be an abuse of discretion for the trial judgeto fail to consider, not only the interests of the parties, "but523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN584 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtalso the social costs associated with discovery had against agovernment official." Id., at 840. With reference to thecase at hand, he expressed the view that if petitioner couldnot show that discovery might reveal more than already appeared in the record, summary judgment would be appro-priate without any discovery.Id., at 841-844.Judge Henderson "fully" endorsed the plurality's new clearand convincing evidence standard, but thought that it was amistake for her colleagues to hear this case en banc becausethe record already made it abundantly clear that petitioner'sclaim had no merit. Id., at 844-845.Chief Judge Edwards, joined by four other judges, criti-cized the majority for " `crossing the line between adjudication and legislation.' " Id., at 847 (quoting Frankfurter,Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum.L. Rev. 527, 535 (1947)). He expressed the view that thenew evidentiary standards were unauthorized by statute orprecedent and "would make it all but certain that an entirecategory of constitutional tort claims against government officials--whether or not meritorious--would never be able tosurvive a defendant's assertion of qualified immunity." 93F. 3d, at 847.The different views expressed in those five opinions attestto the importance of both the underlying issue and a correctunderstanding of the relationship between our holding inHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), and the plaintiff 'sburden when his or her entitlement to relief depends onproof of an improper motive. Despite the relative unimpor-tance of the facts of this particular case, we therefore decided to grant certiorari. 520 U. S. 1273 (1997).IIThe Court of Appeals' requirement of clear and convincingevidence of improper motive is that court's latest effort toaddress a potentially serious problem: Because an official's523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN585Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtstate of mind is "easy to allege and hard to disprove," insub-stantial claims that turn on improper intent may be less amenable to summary disposition than other types of claimsagainst government officials. 93 F. 3d, at 816, 821. Thiscategory of claims therefore implicates obvious concernswith the social costs of subjecting public officials to discoveryand trial, as well as liability for damages. The other Courtsof Appeals have also grappled with this problem, but nonehas adopted a heightened burden of proof. Seeid., at 851-852, n. 7 (Edwards, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citingcases).The new rule established in this case is not limited to suitsby prisoners against local officials, but applies to all classes ofplaintiffs bringing damages actions against any governmentofficial, whether federal, state, or local. See Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 500-504 (1978). The heightened burdenof proof applies, moreover, to the wide array of different fed-eral law claims for which an official's motive is a necessaryelement, such as claims of race and gender discrimination inviolation of the Equal Protection Clause,6 cruel and unusualpunishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,7 and ter-mination of employment based on political affiliation in violation of the First Amendment,8 as well as retaliation for theexercise of free speech or other constitutional rights.9 Abare majority of the Court of Appeals regarded this sweep-ing rule as a necessary corollary to our opinion inHarlow.There is, of course, an important difference between theholding in a case and the reasoning that supports that holding. We shall, therefore, begin by explaining why our hold6 Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-248 (1976) (race); PersonnelAdministrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 274 (1979) (gender).7 Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 835-840 (1994).8 Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507, 513-517 (1980).9 E. g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 574 (1968).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN586 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courting in Harlow does not resolve the issue presented in thiscase--indeed, it does not even address any question concerning the plaintiff 's affirmative case. We shall then considerwhether the reasoning in that opinion nevertheless supportsthe conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.Harlow's Specific HoldingIn 1968, A. Ernest Fitzgerald testified before a congres-sional subcommittee about technical difficulties and excessive costs incurred in the development of a new transportplane. His testimony was widely reported and evidentlyembarrassed his superiors in the Department of Defense.In 1970, his job as a management analyst with the Department of the Air Force was eliminated in a "departmentalreorganization and reduction in force."Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 733 (1982). After the conclusion of extended proceedings before the Civil Service Commission in1973, Fitzgerald filed suit against the President of the UnitedStates and some of his aides alleging that they had eliminated his job in retaliation for his testimony. He soughtdamages on both statutory grounds and "in a direct actionunder the Constitution." Id., at 748. When his chargeswere reviewed in this Court, we considered the defendants'claims to immunity in two separate opinions. In Nixon v.Fitzgerald, we held that a former President is entitled toabsolute immunity from damages liability predicated on conduct within the scope of his official duties. Id., at 749. InHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), we held that thesenior aides and advisers of the President were not entitledto absolute immunity, id., at 808-813, but instead were protected by a "qualified immunity standard that would permitthe defeat of insubstantial claims without resort to trial."Id., at 813.Our definition of that qualified immunity standard was informed by three propositions that had been established byearlier cases. First, in Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U. S. 635, 639-523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN587Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Court641 (1980), we held that qualified immunity is an affirmativedefense and that "the burden of pleading it rests with thedefendant." Second, in Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S., at 503-504, we determined that the scope of that defense was thesame in actions against state officials under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983and in actions against federal officials under the FederalConstitution, and that in both types of actions the courts are"competent to determine the appropriate level of immunity."Third, in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), we presumed that the defense protects all officers in the executivebranch of government performing discretionary functions,id., at 245-248, but held that the presumption was rebuttable, id., at 249-250.The actual scope of the defense had been the subject ofdebate within the Court in Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S.308 (1975), a case involving a constitutional claim against themembers of a school board. A bare majority in that caseconcluded that the plaintiff could overcome the defense ofqualified immunity in two different ways, either if (1) thedefendant "knew or reasonably should have known that theaction he took within his sphere of official responsibilitywould violate the constitutional rights of the student affected," or (2) "he took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or otherinjury to the student." Id., at 322. In dissent, Justice Powell argued that the majority's standard was too demanding ofpublic officials, but his proposed standard, like the majority's,included both an objective and a subjective component. Inhis view, our opinion in Scheuer had established this standard: "whether in light of the discretion and responsibilitiesof his office, and under all of the circumstances as they appeared at the time, the officer acted reasonably and in goodfaith." 420 U. S., at 330 (emphasis added).In Harlow, the Court reached a consensus on the properformulation of the standard for judging the defense of quali523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN588 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtfied immunity. Speaking for the Court, Justice Powell announced a single objective standard:"Consistently with the balance at which we aimed inButz, we conclude today that bare allegations of maliceshould not suffice to subject government officials eitherto the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reachingdiscovery. We therefore hold that government officials performing discretionary functions generally areshielded from liability for civil damages insofar as theirconduct does not violate clearly established statutory orconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person wouldhave known." 457 U. S., at 817-818.Under that standard, a defense of qualified immunity maynot be rebutted by evidence that the defendant's conduct wasmalicious or otherwise improperly motivated. Evidenceconcerning the defendant's subjective intent is simply irrelevant to that defense.Our holding that "bare allegations of malice" cannot overcome the qualified immunity defense did not implicate theelements of the plaintiff 's initial burden of proving a constitutional violation. It is obvious, of course, that bare allegations of malice would not suffice to establish a constitutionalclaim. It is equally clear that an essential element of someconstitutional claims is a charge that the defendant's conductwas improperly motivated. For example, A. Ernest Fitzgerald's constitutional claims against President Nixon andhis aides were based on the theory that they had retaliatedagainst him for speaking out on a matter of public concern.10Our consideration of the immunity issues in both the Nixon10 The reason why such retaliation offends the Constitution is that itthreatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right. Pickering, 391 U. S.,at 574. Retaliation is thus akin to an "unconstitutional condition" demanded for the receipt of a government-provided benefit. See Perry v.Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN589Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcase and in Harlow itself assumed that Fitzgerald would beentitled to prevail but for the immunity defenses.11 Thus,although evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on theissue of qualified immunity, it may be an essential componentof the plaintiff 's affirmative case. Our holding in Harlow,which related only to the scope of an affirmative defense,provides no support for making any change in the nature ofthe plaintiff 's burden of proving a constitutional violation.Nevertheless, the en banc court's ruling makes just such achange in the plaintiff 's cause of action. The court's clearand convincing evidence requirement applies to the plaintiff 's showing of improper intent (a pure issue of fact), not tothe separate qualified immunity question whether the official's alleged conduct violated clearly established law, whichis an "essentially legal question." Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472U. S. 511, 526-529 (1985); see Gomez, 446 U. S., at 640("[T]his Court has never indicated that qualified immunity isrelevant to the existence of the plaintiff 's cause of action").Indeed, the court's heightened proof standard logicallyshould govern even if the official never asserts an immunitydefense. See 93 F. 3d, at 815, 838. Such a rule is not required by the holding in Harlow.11 See Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 232 (1991) (observing that "thedetermination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all" is a "necessary concomitant" to the threshold immunity question). Indeed, when Justice Ginsburg was a judge on theDistrict of Columbia Circuit, she commented:"Had the Court [in Harlow] intended its formulation of the qualified immunity defense to foreclose all inquiry into the defendants' state of mind, theCourt might have instructed the entry of judgment for defendants Harlowand Butterfield on the constitutional claim without further ado. In fact,the Court returned the case to the district court in an open-ended remand,a disposition hardly consistent with a firm intent to delete the state ofmind inquiry from every constitutional tort calculus." Martin, 812 F. 2d,at 1432.This correct understanding explains why Harlow does not support thechange in the law advocated by The Chief Justice, post, at 602.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN590 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the CourtThe Reasoning in HarlowTwo reasons that are explicit in our opinion in Harlow,together with a third that is implicit in the holding, amplyjustified Harlow's reformulation of the qualified immunitydefense. First, there is a strong public interest in protecting public officials from the costs associated with the defenseof damages actions.12 That interest is best served by a defense that permits insubstantial lawsuits to be quickly termi-nated. Second, allegations of subjective motivation mighthave been used to shield baseless lawsuits from summaryjudgment. 457 U. S., at 817-818. The objective standard,in contrast, raises questions concerning the state of the lawat the time of the challenged conduct--questions that normally can be resolved on summary judgment. Third, focus-ing on "the objective legal reasonableness of an official'sacts," id., at 819, avoids the unfairness of imposing liabilityon a defendant who "could not reasonably be expected toanticipate subsequent legal developments, nor . . . fairly besaid to `know' that the law forbade conduct not previouslyidentified as unlawful," id., at 818.13 That unfairness may12 "These social costs include the expenses of litigation, the diversion ofofficial energy from pressing public issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office. Finally, there is the danger thatfear of being sued will `dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, orthe most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching discharge oftheir duties.' Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2 1949), cert.denied, 339 U. S. 949 (1950)." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 814.13 Our opinion in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232 (1974), explicitly identified fairness as an important concern: "This official immunity apparentlyrested, in its genesis, on two mutually dependent rationales: (1) the injustice, particularly in the absence of bad faith, of subjecting to liability anofficer who is required, by the legal obligations of his position, to exercisediscretion; (2) the danger that the threat of such liability would deter hiswillingness to execute his office with the decisiveness and the judgmentrequired by the public good." Id., at 239-240 (footnote omitted). Fairness alone is not, however, a sufficient reason for the immunity defense,and thus does not justify its extension to private parties. Wyatt v. Cole,504 U. S. 158, 168 (1992).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN591Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtbe present even when the official conduct is motivated, inpart, by hostility to the plaintiff.This last rationale of fairness does not provide any justifi-cation for the imposition of special burdens on plaintiffs whoallege misconduct that was plainly unlawful when it occurred. While there is obvious unfairness in imposing lia-bility--indeed, even in compelling the defendant to bear theburdens of discovery and trial--for engaging in conduct thatwas objectively reasonable when it occurred, no such unfairness can be attributed to holding one accountable for actionsthat he or she knew, or should have known, violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff. Harlow itself said asmuch: "If the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competentpublic official should know the law governing his conduct."Id., at 818-819; see also Butz, 438 U. S., at 506 ("[I]t is notunfair to hold liable the official who knows or should knowhe is acting outside the law . . .").The first two reasons underlying our holding in Harlow,however, would provide support for a procedural rule thatmakes it harder for any plaintiff, especially one whose constitutional claim requires proof of an improper motive, tosurvive a motion for summary judgment. But there arecountervailing concerns that must be considered before concluding that the balance struck in the context of defining anaffirmative defense is also appropriate when evaluating theelements of the plaintiff 's cause of action. In Harlow, weexpressly noted the need for such a balance "between theevils inevitable in any available alternative." 457 U. S., at813-814. We further emphasized: "In situations of abuse ofoffice, an action for damages may offer the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees." Id., at814. Social costs that adequately justified the elimination ofthe subjective component of an affirmative defense do notnecessarily justify serious limitations upon "the only realistic" remedy for the violation of constitutional guarantees.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN592 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the CourtThere are several reasons why we believe that here, unlikeHarlow, the proper balance does not justify a judicial revision of the law to bar claims that depend on proof of an official's motive. Initially, there is an important distinctionbetween the "bare allegations of malice" that would haveprovided the basis for rebutting a qualified immunity defenseunder Wood v. Strickland and the allegations of intentthat are essential elements of certain constitutional claims.Under Wood, the mere allegation of intent to cause any"other injury," not just a deprivation of constitutional rights,would have permitted an open-ended inquiry into subjectivemotivation. 420 U. S., at 322. When intent is an elementof a constitutional violation, however, the primary focus isnot on any possible animus directed at the plaintiff; rather,it is more specific, such as an intent to disadvantage all members of a class that includes the plaintiff, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-248 (1976), or to deter publiccomment on a specific issue of public importance. Thus, inHarlow, hostility to the content of Fitzgerald's testimony,rather than an intent to cause him harm, was the relevantcomponent of the constitutional claim. In this case, proofthat respondent diverted the plaintiff 's boxes because shehated him would not necessarily demonstrate that she wasresponding to his public comments about prison conditions,although under Wood such evidence might have rebutted thequalified immunity defense.Moreover, existing law already prevents this more narrowelement of unconstitutional motive from automatically carrying a plaintiff to trial. The immunity standard in Harlowitself eliminates all motive-based claims in which the official'sconduct did not violate clearly established law. Even whenthe general rule has long been clearly established (for instance, the First Amendment bars retaliation for protectedspeech), the substantive legal doctrine on which the plaintiffrelies may facilitate summary judgment in two different523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN593Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtways. First, there may be doubt as to the illegality of thedefendant's particular conduct (for instance, whether a plaintiff 's speech was on a matter of public concern). See gener-ally Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640-641 (1987).Second, at least with certain types of claims, proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutionalviolation--there must also be evidence of causation. Accordingly, when a public employee shows that protectedspeech was a "motivating factor" in an adverse employmentdecision, the employer still prevails by showing that it wouldhave reached the same decision in the absence of the protected conduct. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429U. S. 274, 287 (1977). Furthermore, various proceduralmechanisms already enable trial judges to weed out baselessclaims that feature a subjective element, as we explain inmore detail in Part IV,infra.14Thus, unlike the subjective component of the immunity defense eliminated by Harlow, the improper intent element ofvarious causes of action should not ordinarily preclude sum-mary disposition of insubstantial claims. The reasoning inHarlow, like its specific holding, does not justify a rule thatplaces a thumb on the defendant's side of the scales whenthe merits of a claim that the defendant knowingly violatedthe law are being resolved. And,a fortiori, the policy con14 These various protections may not entirely foreclose discovery on theissue of motive, and the Court of Appeals adopted its heightened proofstandard in large part to facilitate the resolution of summary judgmentmotions before any discovery at all. Discovery involving public officialsis indeed one of the evils that Harlow aimed to address, but neither thatopinion nor subsequent decisions create an immunity from all discovery.Harlow sought to protect officials from the costs of "broad-reaching" discovery, 457 U. S., at 818, and we have since recognized that limited discovery may sometimes be necessary before the district court can resolvea motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Andersonv. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 646, n. 6 (1987); see also Mitchell v. Forsyth,472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN594 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtcerns underlying Harlow do not support Justice Scalia'sunprecedented proposal to immunize all officials whose conduct is "objectively valid," regardless of improper intent, seepost, at 612 (dissenting opinion).IIIIn fashioning a special rule for constitutional claims thatrequire proof of improper intent, the judges of the Courtof Appeals relied almost entirely on our opinion in Harlow,and on the specific policy concerns that we identified in thatopinion. As we have explained, neither that case nor thoseconcerns warrant the wholesale change in the law that theyhave espoused. Without such precedential grounding, forthe courts of appeals or this Court to change the burden ofproof for an entire category of claims would stray far fromthe traditional limits on judicial authority.Neither the text of $ 1983 or any other federal statute, northe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provide any supportfor imposing the clear and convincing burden of proof onplaintiffs either at the summary judgment stage or in thetrial itself. The same might be said of the qualified immu-nity defense; but inHarlow, as in the series of earlier casesconcerning both the absolute and the qualified immunity defenses, we were engaged in a process of adjudication that wehad consistently and repeatedly viewed as appropriate forjudicial decision--a process "predicated upon a consideredinquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevantofficial at common law and the interests behind it." Imblerv.Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976); see also Butz, 438U. S., at 503-504; Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 170-172 (1992)(Kennedy, J., concurring).15 The unprecedented change15 Though our opinion in Harlow was forthright in revising the immunitydefense for policy reasons, see Anderson, 483 U. S., at 645, that decisionnonetheless followed recent Court precedent and simply eliminated oneaspect of the established doctrine; it did not create a new immunity standard out of whole cloth.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN595Cite as: 523 U. S. 574 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmade by the Court of Appeals in this case, however, lacksany common-law pedigree and alters the cause of action itselfin a way that undermines the very purpose of $ 1983--to pro-vide a remedy for the violation of federal rights.16In the past, we have consistently declined similar invita-tions to revise established rules that are separate from thequalified immunity defense. We refused to change the Fed-eral Rules governing pleading by requiring the plaintiff toanticipate the immunity defense, Gomez, 446 U. S., at 639-640, or requiring pleadings of heightened specificity in casesalleging municipal liability, Leatherman v. Tarrant CountyNarcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163,164-169 (1993). We also declined to craft an exception tosettled rules of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction and re-jected the argument that the policies behind the immunitydefense justify interlocutory appeals on questions of eviden-tiary sufficiency.Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 317-318(1995). Our reasons for those unanimous rulings apply withequal force to the imposition of a clear and convincing burdenof proof in cases alleging unconstitutional motive.As we have noted, the Court of Appeals adopted a height-ened proof standard in large part to reduce the availabilityof discovery in actions that require proof of motive. To theextent that the court was concerned with this proceduralissue, our cases demonstrate that questions regarding plead-ing, discovery, and summary judgment are most frequentlyand most effectively resolved either by the rulemaking proc-ess or the legislative process. See,e. g., Leatherman, 507U. S., at 168-169. Moreover, the Court of Appeals' indirecteffort to regulate discovery employs a blunt instrument thatcarries a high cost, for its rule also imposes a heightenedstandard of proof at trial upon plaintiffs with bona fide con16 Ironically, the heightened standard of proof directly limits the availability of the remedy in cases involving the specific evil at which the CivilRights Act of 1871 (the predecessor of $ 1983) was originally aimed--racediscrimination. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 174-175 (1961).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN596 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtstitutional claims. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477U. S. 242, 252-255 (1986).One particular recent action by Congress highlights ourconcern with judicial rulemaking to protect officials fromdamages actions. Both Judge Silberman's opinion belowand a brief filed in this Court by 34 States, Guam, and theVirgin Islands suggest that new substantive or proceduralrules are warranted because of the very large number of civilrights actions filed by prison inmates. See 93 F. 3d, at 830,838; Brief for State of Missouri et al. asAmici Curiae 12.Arguably, such cases deserve special attention because manyof them are plainly frivolous and some may be motivatedmore by a desire to obtain a "holiday in court,"17 than by arealistic expectation of tangible relief.Even assuming that a perceived problem with suits byinmates could justify the creation of new rules by federaljudges, Congress has already fashioned special rules to coverthese cases. The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub. L.104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, enacted in April 1996, contains provisions that should discourage prisoners from filing claimsthat are unlikely to succeed. Among the many new changesrelating to civil suits, the statute requires all inmates to payfiling fees; deniesin forma pauperis status to prisoners withthree or more prior "strikes" (dismissals because a filing isfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which reliefmay be granted) unless the prisoner is "under imminent danger of serious physical injury," $ 804(d); bars suits for mentalor emotional injury unless there is a prior showing of physical injury; limits attorney's fees; directs district courts toscreen prisoners' complaints before docketing and authorizesthe court on its own motion to dismiss "frivolous," "mali-cious," or meritless actions; permits the revocation of good17 In his dissent in Harris v. Pate, 440 F. 2d 315 (CA7 1971), Judge Hastings wrote in reference to the "ever increasing volume of frivolous civilactions filed by state custodial prisoners" that "[o]f course, most prisonerswould enjoy a holiday in court." Id., at 320.523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN597Cite as: 523 U.

Recent statistics suggest that the Act is already having its intended effect.18Most significantly, the statute draws no distinction between constitutional claims that require proof of an impropermotive and those that do not. If there is a compelling needto frame new rules of law based on such a distinction, pre-sumably Congress either would have dealt with the problemin the Reform Act, or will respond to it in future legislation.IVIn Harlow, we noted that a " `firm application of the Fed-eral Rules of Civil Procedure' is fully warranted" and maylead to the prompt disposition of insubstantial claims. 457U. S., at 819-820, n. 35 (quotingButz, 438 U.

It must18 Despite the continuing rise in the state and federal prison populations,the number of prisoner civil rights suits filed in federal court dropped from41,215 in fiscal year 1996 (Oct. 1, 1995-Sept. 30, 1996) to 28,635 in fiscalyear 1997 (Oct. 1, 1996-Sept. 30, 1997), a decline of 31 percent.

BRITTONOpinion of the Courtexercise its discretion so that officials are not subjected tounnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.The district judge has two primary options prior to permit-ting any discovery at all. First, the court may order a replyto the defendant's or a third party's answer under FederalRule of Civil Procedure 7(a), or grant the defendant's motionfor a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). Thus, thecourt may insist that the plaintiff "put forward specific, nonconclusory factual allegations" that establish improper mo-tive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment. Siegertv.Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurringin judgment). This option exists even if the official choosesnot to plead the affirmative defense of qualified immunity.Second, if the defendant does plead the immunity defense,the district court should resolve that threshold question be-fore permitting discovery.Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818. To doso, the court must determine whether, assuming the truthof the plaintiff 's allegations, the official's conduct violatedclearly established law.19 Because the former option of demanding more specific allegations of intent places no burdenon the defendant-official, the district judge may choose thatalternative before resolving the immunity question, whichsometimes requires complicated analysis of legal issues.If the plaintiff 's action survives these initial hurdles andis otherwise viable, the plaintiff ordinarily will be entitled tosome discovery. Rule 26 vests the trial judge with broaddiscretion to tailor discovery narrowly and to dictate the sequence of discovery. On its own motion, the trial court"may alter the limits in [the Federal Rules] on the num-ber of depositions and interrogatories and may also limitthe length of depositions under Rule 30 and the number19 If the district court enters an order denying the defendant's motionfor dismissal or summary judgment, the official is entitled to bring animmediate interlocutory appeal of that legal ruling on the immunity question.

Rule 26(b)(2).Additionally, upon motion the court may limit the time, place,and manner of discovery, or even bar discovery altogetheron certain subjects, as required "to protect a party or personfrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense." Rule 26(c). And the court may also setthe timing and sequence of discovery. Rule 26(d).These provisions create many options for the districtjudge. For instance, the court may at first permit the plaintiff to take only a focused deposition of the defendant beforeallowing any additional discovery. See,e. g., Martin, 812F. 2d, at 1437 (opinion of R. B. Ginsburg, J.). Alternatively,the court may postpone all inquiry regarding the official'ssubjective motive until discovery has been had on objectivefactual questions such as whether the plaintiff suffered anyinjury or whether the plaintiff actually engaged in protectedconduct that could be the object of unlawful retaliation.The trial judge can therefore manage the discovery processto facilitate prompt and efficient resolution of the lawsuit; asthe evidence is gathered, the defendant-official may move forpartial summary judgment on objective issues that arepotentially dispositive and are more amenable to summarydisposition than disputes about the official's intent, whichfrequently turn on credibility assessments.20 Of course, the20 The judge does, however, have discretion to postpone ruling on adefendant's summary judgment motion if the plaintiff needs additionaldiscovery to explore "facts essential to justify the party's opposition."Rule 56(f).523US2 Unit: $U58 [04-29-00 18:48:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN600 CRAWFORD-EL v. BRITTONOpinion of the Courtjudge should give priority to discovery concerning issuesthat bear upon the qualified immunity defense, such as theactions that the official actually took, since that defenseshould be resolved as early as possible. See Anderson, 483U. S., at 646, n. 6.21Beyond these procedures and others that we have notmentioned, summary judgment serves as the ultimate screento weed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior to trial. Atthat stage, if the defendant-official has made a properly sup-ported motion,22 the plaintiff may not respond simply withgeneral attacks upon the defendant's credibility, but rathermust identify affirmative evidence from which a jury couldfind that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden of provingthe pertinent motive.Liberty Lobby, 477 U. S., at 256-257.Finally, federal trial judges are undoubtedly familiar withtwo additional tools that are available in extreme cases toprotect public officials from undue harassment: Rule 11,which authorizes sanctions for the filing of papers that arefrivolous, lacking in factual support, or "presented forany improper purpose, such as to harass"; and 28 U. S. C.$ 1915(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. II), which authorizes dismissal"at any time" of in forma pauperis suits that are "frivolousor malicious."It is the district judges rather than appellate judges likeourselves who have had the most experience in managingcases in which an official's intent is an element. Given the21 If the official seeks summary judgment on immunity grounds and thecourt denies the motion, the official can take an immediate interlocutoryappeal, even if she has already so appealed a prior order.
