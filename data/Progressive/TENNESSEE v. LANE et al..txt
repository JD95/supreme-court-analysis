Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA or Act), 104 Stat. 337, 42 U. S. C. $$ 12131-12165, provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, byreason of such disability, be excluded from participation inor be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activi-ties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination byany such entity." $ 12132. The question presented in thiscase is whether Title II exceeds Congress' power under $ 5of the Fourteenth Amendment.IIn August 1998, respondents George Lane and BeverlyJones filed this action against the State of Tennessee anda number of Tennessee counties, alleging past and ongoingviolations of Title II. Respondents, both of whom are paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility, claimed that theywere denied access to, and the services of, the state courtsystem by reason of their disabilities.

At his first appearance, Lane crawled up two flights ofstairs to get to the courtroom. When Lane returned to thecourthouse for a hearing, he refused to crawl again or to becarried by officers to the courtroom; he consequently wasarrested and jailed for failure to appear. Jones, a certifiedcourt reporter, alleged that she has not been able to gainaccess to a number of county courthouses, and, as a result,has lost both work and an opportunity to participate in thejudicial process. Respondents sought damages and equita-ble relief.The State moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that itwas barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The DistrictCourt denied the motion without opinion, and the State ap-pealed.1 The United States intervened to defend Title II'sabrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.On April 28, 2000, after the appeal had been briefed and argued, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered anorder holding the case in abeyance pending our decision inBoard of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356(2001).In Garrett, we concluded that the Eleventh Amendmentbars private suits seeking money damages for state violations of Title I of the ADA. We left open, however, thequestion whether the Eleventh Amendment permits suits formoney damages under Title II. Id., at 360, n. 1. Followingthe Garrett decision, the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc,heard argument in a Title II suit brought by a hearing-impaired litigant who sought money damages for the State'sfailure to accommodate his disability in a child custody pro-ceeding.Popovich v.

The majority interpretedGarrett to bar private ADAsuits against States based on equal protection principles, butnot those that rely on due process principles. 276 F. 3d, at811-816. The minority concluded that Congress had notvalidly abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity for any Title II claims, id., at 821, while the concurringopinion concluded that Title II validly abrogated state sover-eign immunity with respect to both equal protection and dueprocess claims, id., at 818.Following the en banc decision inPopovich, a panel of theCourt of Appeals entered an order affirming the DistrictCourt's denial of the State's motion to dismiss in this case.Judgt. order reported at 40 Fed. Appx. 911 (CA6 2002). Theorder explained that respondents' claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles. In response to a petition for rehearing arguing that Popovich wasnot controlling because the complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion. It explained that the Due Process Clause protects the right ofaccess to the courts, and that the evidence before Congresswhen it enacted Title II "established that physical barriersin government buildings, including courthouses and in thecourtrooms themselves, have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity to access vital services and toexercise fundamental rights guaranteed by the Due ProcessClause." 315 F. 3d 680, 682 (2003). Moreover, that "recorddemonstrated that public entities' failure to accommodatethe needs of qualified persons with disabilities may resultdirectly from unconstitutional animus and impermissiblestereotypes." Id., at 683. The panel did not, however,categorically reject the State's submission. It instead notedthat the case presented difficult questions that "cannot beclarified absent a factual record," and remanded for furtherproceedings. Ibid. We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 941(2003), and now affirm.541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG516 TENNESSEE v. LANEOpinion of the CourtIIThe ADA was passed by large majorities in both Housesof Congress after decades of deliberation and investigationinto the need for comprehensive legislation to address dis-crimination against persons with disabilities. In the yearsimmediately preceding the ADA's enactment, Congress held13 hearings and created a special task force that gatheredevidence from every State in the Union. The conclusionsCongress drew from this evidence are set forth in the taskforce and Committee Reports, described in lengthy legisla-tive hearings, and summarized in the preamble to the statute.2 Central among these conclusions was Congress' find-ing that"individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insularminority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequaltreatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that arebeyond the control of such individuals and resultingfrom stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of theindividual ability of such individuals to participate in,and contribute to, society." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(7).Invoking "the sweep of congressional authority, includ-ing the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and toregulate commerce," the ADA is designed "to provide aclear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities."$$ 12101(b)(1), (b)(4). It forbids discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major areas of public life: em-ployment, which is covered by Title I of the statute; public2 See 42 U. S.

The Act defines the term "public entity" to in-clude state and local governments, as well as their agenciesand instrumentalities. $ 12131(1). Persons with disabili-ties are "qualified" if they, "with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of archi-tectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or theprovision of auxiliary aids and services, mee[t] the essentialeligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public en-tity." $ 12131(2). Title II's enforcement provision incorporates by reference $ 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 92Stat. 2982, as added, 29 U. S. C. $ 794a, which authorizes private citizens to bring suits for money damages. 42 U. S. C.$ 12133.IIIThe Eleventh Amendment renders the States immunefrom "any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted . . .by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects ofany Foreign State." Even though the Amendment "by itsterms . . . applies only to suits against a State by citizensof another State," our cases have repeatedly held that thisimmunity also applies to unconsented suits brought by aState's own citizens.Garrett, 531 U. S., at 363; Kimel v.Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72-73 (2000). Ourcases have also held that Congress may abrogate the State'sEleventh Amendment immunity. To determine whether ithas done so in any given case, we "must resolve two predi-cate questions: first, whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate that immunity; and second, ifit did, whether Congress acted pursuant to a valid grant ofconstitutional authority." Id., at 73.541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG518 TENNESSEE v. LANEOpinion of the CourtThe first question is easily answered in this case. The Actspecifically provides: "A State shall not be immune under theeleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United Statesfrom an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter." 42 U. S. C. $ 12202.As in Garrett, see 531 U. S., at 363-364, no party disputesthe adequacy of that expression of Congress' intent to abro-gate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. The question, then, is whether Congress had the power to give effectto its intent.In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), we held thatCongress can abrogate a State's sovereign immunity when itdoes so pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under $ 5 ofthe Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment. Id., at 456. This enforcementpower, as we have often acknowledged, is a "broad powerindeed." Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.718, 732 (1982), citingEx parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346(1880).3 It includes "the authority both to remedy and todeter violation of rights guaranteed [by the FourteenthAmendment] by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath ofconduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by theAmendment's text."Kimel, 528 U. S., at 81. We have thusrepeatedly affirmed that "Congress may enact so-called prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutionalconduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct." Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538U. S. 721, 727-728 (2003). See also City of Boerne v. Flores,3 In Ex parte Virginia, we described the breadth of Congress' $ 5 poweras follows:"Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out theobjects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of thelaws against State denial or invasion, if not prohibited, is brought withinthe domain of congressional power." 100 U. S., at 345-346. See also Cityof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517-518 (1997).541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG519Cite as: 541 U. S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the Court521 U. S. 507, 518 (1997).4 The most recent affirmation ofthe breadth of Congress' $ 5 power came in Hibbs, in whichwe considered whether a male state employee could recovermoney damages against the State for its failure to complywith the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medi-cal Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 107 Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. $ 2601et seq. We upheld the FMLA as a valid exercise of Con-gress' $ 5 power to combat unconstitutional sex discrimination, even though there was no suggestion that the State'sleave policy was adopted or applied with a discriminatorypurpose that would render it unconstitutional under the ruleofPersonnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 2564 In Boerne, we observed:"Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fallwithin the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the processit prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into`legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.' Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976). For example, the Court uphelda suspension of literacy tests and similar voting requirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, $ 2, as a measure to combat racial discrimination in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308(1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under Lassiter v.Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U. S. 45 (1959). We have alsoconcluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States. South Carolinav. Katzenbach, supra (upholding several provisions of the Voting RightsAct of 1965); Katzenbach v. Morgan, [384 U.

When Congress seeks to remedy or prevent uncon-stitutional discrimination, $ 5 authorizes it to enact prophylactic legislation proscribing practices that are discrim-inatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out the basicobjectives of the Equal Protection Clause.Congress' $ 5 power is not, however, unlimited. WhileCongress must have a wide berth in devising appropriateremedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional ac-tions, those measures may not work a "substantive changein the governing law." Boerne, 521 U. S., at 519. InBoerne, we recognized that the line between remedial legislation and substantive redefinition is "not easy to discern,"and that "Congress must have wide latitude in determiningwhere it lies." Id., at 519-520. But we also confirmed that"the distinction exists and must be observed," and set fortha test for so observing it: Section 5 legislation is valid if itexhibits "a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted tothat end."Id., at 520.In Boerne, we held that Congress had exceeded its $ 5 authority when it enacted the Religious Freedom RestorationAct of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000bbetseq. We began by noting that Congress enacted RFRA "indirect response" to our decision in Employment Div., Dept.of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990),for the stated purpose of "restor[ing]" a constitutional rulethat Smith had rejected. 521 U. S., at 512, 515 (internalquotation marks omitted). Though the respondent attempted to defend the statute as a reasonable means of enforcing the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith,we concluded that RFRA was "so out of proportion" to thatobjective that it could be understood only as an attempt towork a "substantive change in constitutional protections."521 U. S., at 529, 532. Indeed, that was the very purposeof the law.This Court further defined the contours of Boerne's "congruence and proportionality" test in Florida Prepaid Post541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG521Cite as: 541 U. S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527U. S. 627 (1999). At issue in that case was the validity ofthe Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarifi-cation Act (hereinafter Patent Remedy Act), a statutoryamendment Congress enacted in the wake of our decision inAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985),to clarify its intent to abrogate state sovereign immunityfrom patent infringement suits. Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S.,at 631-632. Noting the virtually complete absence of a history of unconstitutional patent infringement on the part ofthe States, as well as the Act's expansive coverage, the Courtconcluded that the Patent Remedy Act's apparent aim wasto serve the Article I concerns of "provid[ing] a uniform remedy for patent infringement and . . . plac[ing] States on thesame footing as private parties under that regime," and notto enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.Id., at 647-648. See also Kimel, 528 U. S. 62 (finding thatthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act exceeded Con-gress' $ 5 powers underBoerne); United States v. Morrison,529 U. S. 598 (2000) (Violence Against Women Act).Applying the Boerne test in Garrett, we concluded thatTitle I of the ADA was not a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibitionon unconstitutional disability discrimination in public employment. As in Florida Prepaid, we concluded Congress'exercise of its prophylactic $ 5 power was unsupported bya relevant history and pattern of constitutional violations.531 U. S., at 368, 374. Although the dissent pointed out thatCongress had before it a great deal of evidence of discrimination by the States against persons with disabilities, id., at379 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the Court's opinion noted thatthe "overwhelming majority" of that evidence related to "theprovision of public services and public accommodations,which areas are addressed in Titles II and III," rather thanTitle I, id., at 371, n. 7. We also noted that neither theADA's legislative findings nor its legislative history reflecteda concern that the States had been engaging in a pattern of541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG522 TENNESSEE v. LANEOpinion of the Courtunconstitutional employment discrimination. We empha-sized that the House and Senate Committee Reports on theADA focused on " `[d]iscrimination [in] . . . employment inthe private sector,' " and made no mention of discriminationin public employment. Id., at 371-372 (quoting S. Rep.No. 101-116, p. 6 (1989), and H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2,p. 28 (1990)) (emphasis in Garrett). Finally, we concludedthat Title I's broad remedial scheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy or prevent unconstitutional discriminationin public employment. Taken together, the historical recordand the broad sweep of the statute suggested that Title I'strue aim was not so much to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibitions against disability discrimination in publicemployment as it was to "rewrite" this Court's FourteenthAmendment jurisprudence. 531 U. S., at 372-374.In view of the significant differences between Titles I andII, however, Garrett left open the question whether Title IIis a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 enforcement power. It isto that question that we now turn.IVThe first step of the Boerne inquiry requires us to identifythe constitutional right or rights that Congress sought toenforce when it enacted Title II. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 365.InGarrett we identified Title I's purpose as enforcement ofthe Fourteenth Amendment's command that "all personssimilarly situated should be treated alike." Cleburne v. Cle-burne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 439 (1985). As weobserved, classifications based on disability violate that con-stitutional command if they lack a rational relationship to alegitimate governmental purpose. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366(citing Cleburne, 473 U. S., at 446).Title II, like Title I, seeks to enforce this prohibition onirrational disability discrimination. But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, in-fringements of which are subject to more searching judicial541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG523Cite as: 541 U. S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the Courtreview. See, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336-337 (1972);Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 634 (1969);Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535, 541(1942). These rights include some, like the right of accessto the courts at issue in this case, that are protected by theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. TheDue Process Clause and the Confrontation Clause of theSixth Amendment, as applied to the States via the Four-teenth Amendment, both guarantee to a criminal defendantsuch as respondent Lane the "right to be present at allstages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings." Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.806, 819, n. 15 (1975). The Due Process Clause also requiresthe States to afford certain civil litigants a "meaningful opportunity to be heard" by removing obstacles to their fullparticipation in judicial proceedings. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371, 379 (1971); M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S.102 (1996). We have held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to criminal defendants the right to trial by a jurycomposed of a fair cross section of the community, notingthat the exclusion of "identifiable segments playing majorroles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial." Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S.522, 530 (1975). And, finally, we have recognized that members of the public have a right of access to criminal proceedings secured by the First Amendment. Press-EnterpriseCo. v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside, 478 U. S.1, 8-15 (1986).Whether Title II validly enforces these constitutionalrights is a question that "must be judged with reference tothe historical experience which it reflects." South Carolinav. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). See also FloridaPrepaid, 527 U. S., at 639-640; Boerne, 521 U. S., at 530.While $ 5 authorizes Congress to enact reasonably prophylactic remedial legislation, the appropriateness of the remedydepends on the gravity of the harm it seeks to prevent.541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG524 TENNESSEE v.

S., at 88, but it is also true that"[s]trong measures appropriate to address one harm may bean unwarranted response to another, lesser one,"Boerne, 521U. S., at 530.It is not difficult to perceive the harm that Title II is designed to address. Congress enacted Title II against abackdrop of pervasive unequal treatment in the administra-tion of state services and programs, including systematicdeprivations of fundamental rights. For example, "[a]s of1979, most States . . . categorically disqualified `idiots' fromvoting, without regard to individual capacity." 5 The major-ity of these laws remain on the books,6 and have been thesubject of legal challenge as recently as 2001.7 Similarly, anumber of States have prohibited and continue to prohibitpersons with disabilities from engaging in activities such asmarrying8 and serving as jurors.9 The historical experiencethat Title II reflects is also documented in this Court's cases,which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled5 Cleburne v.

The decisions of other courts, too, document apattern of unequal treatment in the administration of a widerange of public services, programs, and activities, includingthe penal system,11 public education,12 and voting.13 Notably, these decisions also demonstrate a pattern of unconstitu-tional treatment in the administration of justice.1410 The undisputed findings of fact in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981), provide another example of suchmistreatment.

S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the CourtWith respect to the particular services at issue in this case,Congress learned that many individuals, in many Statesacross the country, were being excluded from courthousesand court proceedings by reason of their disabilities. A report before Congress showed that some 76% of public serv-ices and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by persons with disabilities, eventaking into account the possibility that the services and programs might be restructured or relocated to other parts ofthe buildings.

Post, at 542-543 (dissenting opinion). This argument rests on the mistaken premisethat a valid exercise of Congress' $ 5 power must always be predicatedsolely on evidence of constitutional violations by the States themselves.To operate on that premise in this case would be particularly inappropriatebecause this case concerns the provision of judicial services, an area inwhich local governments are typically treated as "arm[s] of the State" forEleventh Amendment purposes, Mt.

LANEOpinion of the CourtGiven the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination againstpersons with disabilities in the provision of public services,the dissent's contention that the record is insufficient to justify Congress' exercise of its prophylactic power is puzzling,to say the least. Just last Term in Hibbs, we approved thefamily-care leave provision of the FMLA as valid $ 5 legislation based primarily on evidence of disparate provision ofparenting leave, little of which concerned unconstitutionalstate conduct. 538 U. S., at 728-733.17 We explained thatU. S. 274, 280 (1977), and thus enjoy precisely the same immunity fromunconsented suit as the States. See, e. g., Callahan v. Philadelphia, 207F. 3d 668, 670-674 (CA3 2000) (municipal court is an "arm of the State"entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity); Kelly v. Municipal Courts,97 F. 3d 902, 907-908 (CA7 1996) (same); Franceschi v. Schwartz, 57 F. 3d828, 831 (CA9 1995) (same). Cf. Garrett, 531 U. S., at 368-369.In any event, our cases have recognized that evidence of constitutionalviolations on the part of nonstate governmental actors is relevant to the$ 5 inquiry. To be sure, evidence of constitutional violations by the Statesthemselves is particularly important when, as in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627 (1999),Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62 (2000), and Garrett, the solepurpose of reliance on $ 5 is to place the States on equal footing withprivate actors with respect to their amenability to suit. But much of theevidence in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 312-315 (1966),to which The Chief Justice favorably refers, post, at 548, involved theconduct of county and city officials, rather than the States. Moreover,what The Chief Justice calls an "extensive legislative record documenting States' gender discrimination in employment leave policies" in NevadaDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003), post, at 548,in fact contained little specific evidence of a pattern of unconstitutionaldiscrimination on the part of the States. Indeed, the evidence before theCongress that enacted the FMLA related primarily to the practices ofprivate-sector employers and the Federal Government. See Hibbs, 538U. S., at 730-735. See also id., at 745-750 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).17 Specifically, we relied on (1) a Senate Report citation to a Bureau ofLabor Statistics survey revealing disparities in private-sector provision ofparenting leave to men and women; (2) submissions from two sources at ahearing on the Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986, a predecessor bill541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG529Cite as: 541 U. S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the Courtbecause the FMLA was targeted at sex-based classifications,which are subject to a heightened standard of judicial scrutiny, "it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of stateconstitutional violations" than in Garrett or Kimel, both ofwhich concerned legislation that targeted classifications subject to rational-basis review. 538 U. S., at 735-737. TitleII is aimed at the enforcement of a variety of basic rights,including the right of access to the courts at issue in thiscase, that call for a standard of judicial review at least assearching, and in some cases more searching, than the standard that applies to sex-based classifications. And in anyevent, the record of constitutional violations in this case--including judicial findings of unconstitutional state action,and statistical, legislative, and anecdotal evidence of thewidespread exclusion of persons with disabilities from theenjoyment of public services--far exceeds the record inHibbs.The conclusion that Congress drew from this body of evidence is set forth in the text of the ADA itself: "[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as . . . education, transportation, communication,recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, andaccess to public services." 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(a)(3) (emphasis added). This finding, together with the extensive recordof disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear beyond peradventure that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subjectfor prophylactic legislation.to the FMLA, that public-sector parental leave polices " `diffe[r] little' "from private-sector policies; (3) evidence that 15 States provided womenup to one year of extended maternity leave, while only 4 States providedfor similarly extended paternity leave; and (4) a House Report's quotationof a study that found that failure to implement uniform standards for parenting leave would " `leav[e] Federal employees open to discretionary andpossibly unequal treatment,' " H.

LANEOpinion of the CourtVThe only question that remains is whether Title II is anappropriate response to this history and pattern of unequaltreatment. At the outset, we must determine the scope ofthat inquiry. Title II--unlike RFRA, the Patent RemedyAct, and the other statutes we have reviewed for validityunder $ 5--reaches a wide array of official conduct in aneffort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutionalguarantees. Petitioner urges us both to examine the broadrange of Title II's applications all at once, and to treatthat breadth as a mark of the law's invalidity. According topetitioner, the fact that Title II applies not only to publiceducation and voting-booth access but also to seating atstate-owned hockey rinks indicates that Title II is not appro-priately tailored to serve its objectives. But nothing in ourcase law requires us to consider Title II, with its wide vari-ety of applications, as an undifferentiated whole.18 Whatever might be said about Title II's other applications, thequestion presented in this case is not whether Congress can18 Contrary to The Chief Justice, post, at 551-552, neither Garrett norFlorida Prepaid lends support to the proposition that the Boerne testrequires courts in all cases to "measur[e] the full breadth of the statute orrelevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce." In fact, the decision in Garrett,which severed Title I of the ADA from Title II for purposes of the $ 5inquiry, demonstrates that courts need not examine "the full breadth ofthe statute" all at once. Moreover, Garrett and Florida Prepaid, like allof our other recent $ 5 cases, concerned legislation that narrowly targetedthe enforcement of a single constitutional right; for that reason, neitherspeaks to the issue presented in this case.Nor is The Chief Justice's approach compelled by the nature of theBoerne inquiry. The answer to the question Boerne asks--whether apiece of legislation attempts substantively to redefine a constitutionalguarantee--logically focuses on the manner in which the legislation operates to enforce that particular guarantee. It is unclear what, if anything,examining Title II's application to hockey rinks or voting booths can tellus about whether Title II substantively redefines the right of access tothe courts.541US2 Unit: $U48 [05-20-06 18:29:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG531Cite as: 541 U. S. 509 (2004)Opinion of the Courtvalidly subject the States to private suits for money damagesfor failing to provide reasonable access to hockey rinks,or even to voting booths, but whether Congress had thepower under $ 5 to enforce the constitutional right of accessto the courts. Because we find that Title II unquestion-ably is valid $ 5 legislation as it applies to the class of casesimplicating the accessibility of judicial services, we need gono further. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 26(1960).19Congress' chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion anddiscrimination described above, Title II's requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its objectof enforcing the right of access to the courts. The unequaltreatment of disabled persons in the administration of judi-cial services has a long history, and has persisted despiteseveral legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disabilitydiscrimination. Faced with considerable evidence of theshortcomings of previous legislative responses, Congresswas justified in concluding that this "difficult and intractableproble[m]" warranted "added prophylactic measures in response." Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 737 (internal quotation marksomitted).The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outrightexclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonablemeasures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility. 42 U. S. C. $ 12131(2). But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial19 In Raines, a State subject to suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1957contended that the law exceeded Congress' power to enforce the FifteenthAmendment because it prohibited "any person," and not just state actors,from interfering with voting rights. We rejected that argument, concluding that "if the complaint here called for an application of the statuteclearly constitutional under the Fifteenth Amendment, that should havebeen an end to the question of constitutionality." 362 U.

LANEOpinion of the Courtservices accessible to persons with disabilities, and it doesnot require States to compromise their essential eligibilitycriteria for public programs. It requires only "reasonablemodifications" that would not fundamentally alter the natureof the service provided, and only when the individual seekingmodification is otherwise eligible for the service. Ibid. AsTitle II's implementing regulations make clear, the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in a numberof ways. In the case of facilities built or altered after 1992,the regulations require compliance with specific architectural accessibility standards. 28 CFR $ 35.151 (2003). Butin the case of older facilities, for which structural change islikely to be more difficult, a public entity may comply withTitle II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including relocating services to alternative, accessible sites andassigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services. $ 35.150(b)(1). Only if these measures areineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entityrequired to make reasonable structural changes. Ibid.And in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.$$ 35.150(a)(2), (a)(3).This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with thewell-established due process principle that, "within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals ameaningful opportunity to be heard" in its courts. Boddie,401 U. S., at 379 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).20 Our cases have recognized a number of affirmativeobligations that flow from this principle: the duty to waive20 Because this case implicates the right of access to the courts, we neednot consider whether Title II's duty to accommodate exceeds what theConstitution requires in the class of cases that implicate only Cleburne'sprohibition on irrational discrimination.

Judged againstthis backdrop, Title II's affirmative obligation to accommodate persons with disabilities in the administration of justicecannot be said to be "so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood asresponsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior." Boerne, 521 U. S., at 532; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 86.24It is, rather, a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonablytargeted to a legitimate end.For these reasons, we conclude that Title II, as it appliesto the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of ac21 Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971) (divorce filing fee);M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102 (1996) (record fee in parental rightstermination action); Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.

Post, at553 (emphasis in original). But as we have often acknowledged, Congress"is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots theprecise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment," and may prohibit"a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itselfforbidden by the Amendment's text."
