S. 424 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIThe parties are competing tool manufacturers. In the1980's, Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (Leatherman or respondent), introduced its Pocket Survival Tool (PST). TheCourt of Appeals described the PST as an"ingenious multi-function pocket tool which improveson the classic `Swiss army knife' in a number of respects.Not the least of the improvements was the inclusionof pliers, which, when unfolded, are nearly equivalentto regular full-sized pliers. . . . Leatherman apparentlylargely created and undisputedly now dominates themarket for multi-function pocket tools which generallyresemble the PST."Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. v.Cooper Industries, 199 F. 3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999).In 1995, Cooper Industries, Inc. (Cooper or petitioner),decided to design and market a competing multifunction tool.Cooper planned to copy the basic features of the PST, add afew features of its own, and sell the new tool under the name"ToolZall." Cooper hoped to capture about 5% of the multi-function tool market. The first ToolZall was designed to bevirtually identical to the PST,1 but the design was ultimatelymodified in response to this litigation. The controversy tobe resolved in this case involves Cooper's improper advertis-ing of its original ToolZall design.Cooper introduced the original ToolZall in August 1996at the National Hardware Show in Chicago. At that show,it used photographs in its posters, packaging, and adver-tising materials that purported to be of a ToolZall but wereactually of a modified PST. When those materials were pre-pared, the first of the ToolZalls had not yet been manufac1 The ToolZall was marked with a different name than the PST, washeld together with different fasteners, and, in the words of the Courtof Appeals, "included a serrated blade and certain other small but notparticularly visible differences."

LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the Courttured. A Cooper employee created a ToolZall "mock-up" bygrinding the Leatherman trademark from handles and pliersof a PST and substituting the unique fastenings that were tobe used on the ToolZall. At least one of the photographswas retouched to remove a curved indentation where theLeatherman trademark had been. The photographs wereused, not only at the trade show, which normally drawsan audience of over 70,000 people, but also in the marketing materials and catalogs used by Cooper's sales forcethroughout the United States. Cooper also distributed atouched-up line drawing of a PST to its international salesrepresentatives.2Shortly after the trade show, Leatherman filed this actionasserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising under $ 43(a) of the TrademarkAct of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and a common-lawclaim of unfair competition for advertising and selling an"imitation" of the PST. In December 1996, the DistrictCourt entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cooperfrom marketing the ToolZall and from using pictures of themodified PST in its advertising. Cooper withdrew the original ToolZall from the market and developed a new modelwith plastic coated handles that differed from the PST. InNovember 1996, it had anticipatorily sent a notice to itssales personnel ordering a recall of all promotional materialscontaining pictures of the PST, but it did not attempt to re-trieve the materials it had sent to its customers until thefollowing April. As a result, the offending promotional ma-terials continued to appear in catalogs and advertisementswell into 1997.After a trial conducted in October 1997, the jury returned a verdict that answered several special interrogato2 To "create" the drawing, a Cooper manager photocopied a line-artdrawing of a PST and then "whited out" Leatherman's trademark.

With respect to the Lanham Act infringement claims,the jury found that Leatherman had trademark rights in theoverall appearance of the PST and that the original Tool-Zall infringed those rights but that the infringement hadnot damaged Leatherman. It then found that the modifiedToolZall did not infringe Leatherman's trademark rights inthe PST. With respect to the advertising claims, it foundCooper guilty of passing off, false advertising, and unfaircompetition and assessed aggregate damages of $50,000 onthose claims. It then answered "Yes" to the followinginterrogatory:"Has Leatherman shown by clear and convincing evidence that by engaging in false advertising or passingoff, Cooper acted with malice, or showed a reckless andoutrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable riskof harm and has acted with a conscious indifference toLeatherman's rights?" App. 18.Because it answered this question in the affirmative, thejury was instructed to determine the "amount of punitivedamages [that] should be awarded to Leatherman."Ibid.The jury awarded $4.5 million. Ibid.After the jury returned its verdict, the District Courtconsidered, and rejected, arguments that the punitive damages were "grossly excessive" under our decision in BMWof North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996). SeeApp. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. It then entered its judgment,which provided that 60% of the punitive damages would bepaid to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account of theState of Oregon. The judgment also permanently enjoinedCooper from marketing its original ToolZall in the UnitedStates or in 22 designated foreign countries.On appeal, Cooper challenged both the District Court'sinjunction against copying the PST and the punitive damages award. The Court of Appeals issued two opinions. Inits published opinion it set aside the injunction. Leather532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN430 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the Courtman Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper Industries, Inc., supra. Itheld that the overall appearance of the PST was not protected under the trademark laws because its distinguishingfeatures, and the combination of those features, were functional. Accordingly, even though Cooper had deliberatelycopied the PST, it acted lawfully in doing so.3In its unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmedthe punitive damages award. It first rejected Cooper's argument that the Oregon Constitution, which has been in-terpreted to prohibit awards of punitive damages for tortsthat impose liability for speech, precluded the jury's awardof such damages in this case. It then reviewed the DistrictCourt's finding that the award "was proportional and fair,given the nature of the conduct, the evidence of intentionalpassing off, and the size of an award necessary to create de-terrence to an entity of Cooper's size" and concluded "thatthe award did not violate Cooper's due process rights" underthe Federal Constitution.

The Court of Appeals noted that the jury verdict form did notdistinguish between passing off as a Lanham Act claim and passing off asa matter of state law. Although a fee award under $ 35(a) could not besupported unless the federal statute was violated, there is no reason tobelieve that any possible difference between federal and state passing offwould affect the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN431Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Opinion of the Courtsame sort of potential harm to Leatherman or to customersas that which may arise from traditional passing off." Id.,at 4a. The Court of Appeals made clear, however, that itdid not condone the passing off. "[A]t a minimum," it observed, "[the passing off] gave Cooper an unfair advantage"by allowing it to use Leatherman's work product "to obtain a `mock-up' more cheaply, easily, and quickly" than if ithad waited until its own product was ready. Ibid. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded, "the district courtdid not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amountof punitive damages." Ibid.Cooper's petition for a writ of certiorari asked us to decidewhether the Court of Appeals reviewed the constitutionalityof the punitive damages award under the correct standardand also whether the award violated the criteria we articulated in Gore. We granted the petition to resolve confusionamong the Courts of Appeals on the first question.4 531U. S. 923 (2000). We now conclude that the constitutionalissue merits de novo review. Because the Court of Appealsapplied an "abuse of discretion" standard, we remand thecase for determination of the second question under theproper standard.4 Respondent and its amicus at times appear to conflate the questionof the proper standard for reviewing the District Court's due processdetermination with the question of the substantive standard for determining the jury award's conformity with due process in the first instance.See Brief for Arthur F. McEvoy as Amicus Curiae 13 ("[O]n appeal thelitigant's objection to the substance of the jury's holding--whether onliability or damages--should be evaluated under a `rational factfinder'standard . . ."); Brief for Respondent 13. The former is the question weagreed to review. The latter question has already been answered inBMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996). Thus, ourrejection in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S.443 (1993), of "heightened scrutiny" of punitive damages awards, see id.,at 456, is not only wholly consistent with our decision today, it is irrelevantto our resolution of the question presented.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN432 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the CourtIIAlthough compensatory damages and punitive damagesare typically awarded at the same time by the same decision-maker, they serve distinct purposes. The former are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff hassuffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct.See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 903, pp. 453-454 (1979);Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 54 (1991)(O'Connor, J., dissenting). The latter, which have been de-scribed as "quasi-criminal,"id., at 19, operate as "privatefines" intended to punish the defendant and to deter futurewrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the extent of a plaintiff 's injury is essentially a factual determination, whereasits imposition of punitive damages is an expression of itsmoral condemnation. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418U. S. 323, 350 (1974) ("[Punitive damages] are not compensation for injury. Instead, they are private fines levied bycivil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter itsfuture occurrence"); Haslip, 499 U. S., at 54 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting) ("[P]unitive damages are specifically designed toexact punishment in excess of actual harm to make clear thatthe defendant's misconduct was especially reprehensible").5Legislatures have extremely broad discretion in definingcriminal offenses, Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 268-269,n. 18 (1984), and in setting the range of permissible punishments for each offense, ibid.; Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277,290 (1983). Judicial decisions that operate within these legislatively enacted guidelines are typically reviewed for abuseof discretion. See, e. g., Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81,96, 99-100 (1996); cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466,481 (2000) (it is permissible "for judges to exercise dis5 See also Sunstein, Kahneman, & Schkade, Assessing Punitive Damages(With Notes on Cognition and Valuation in Law), 107 Yale L.

Cf. Gore, 517 U. S., at 568 ("Statesnecessarily have considerable flexibility in determining thelevel of punitive damages that they will allow in differentclasses of cases and in any particular case"). A good manyStates have enacted statutes that place limits on the permis-sible size of punitive damages awards.6 When juries makeparticular awards within those limits, the role of the trialjudge is "to determine whether the jury's verdict is withinthe confines set by state law, and to determine, by referenceto federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a newtrial or remittitur should be ordered." Browning-FerrisIndustries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257,279 (1989). If no constitutional issue is raised, the role ofthe appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merelyto review the trial court's "determination under an abuse-ofdiscretion standard." Ibid.7Despite the broad discretion that States possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitivedamages, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limitson that discretion. That Clause makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and6 See Gore, 517 U. S., at 614-619 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Since ourdecision in Gore, four additional States have added punitive damages caps:Alabama, Alaska, North Carolina, and Ohio. See Ala. Code $ 6-11-21(Supp. 2000); Alaska Stat. Ann. $ 09.17.020 (2000); N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 1D-25(1999); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2315.21 (Supp. 2000).7 In Browning-Ferris, the petitioner did argue that the award violatedthe Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, but we held theClause inapplicable to punitive damages. The petitioner's reliance onthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was unavailingbecause that argument had not been raised in the District Court, theCourt of Appeals, or the certiorari petition. See 492 U. S., at 276-277.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN434 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

S., at 291; Enmund, 458U. S., at 789-796; Coker, 433 U. S., at 593-597 (opinion ofWhite, J.). Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the issuewe address today, in each of these cases we have engagedin an independent examination of the relevant criteria. See,e. g., Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 337-344; Gore, 517 U. S., at575-586; Solem, 463 U. S., at 295-300; Enmund, 458 U. S.,at 788-801; Coker, 433 U. S., at 592-600 (opinion of White, J.).In Bajakajian, we expressly noted that the courts ofappeals must review the proportionality determination "denovo" and specifically rejected the suggestion of the respondent, who had prevailed in the District Court, that thetrial judge's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. "The factual findings made by the district courts in conducting the excessiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearlyerroneous. . . . But the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutionalstandard to the facts of a particular case, and in this contextde novo review of that question is appropriate." 524 U. S.,at 336-337, n. 10 (citing Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S.690, 697 (1996)).532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN436 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the CourtLikewise, in Ornelas, we held that trial judges' determi-nations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause shouldbe reviewed de novo on appeal. The reasons we gave insupport of that holding are equally applicable in this case.First, as we observed in Ornelas, the precise meaning of con-cepts like "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause" cannotbe articulated with precision; they are "fluid concepts thattake their substantive content from the particular contextsin which the standards are being assessed." Id., at 696.That is, of course, also a characteristic of the concept of"gross excessiveness." Second, "the legal rules for probablecause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only throughapplication. Independent review is therefore necessary ifappellate courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify,the legal principles." Id., at 697. Again, this is also trueof the general criteria set forth inGore; they will acquiremore meaningful content through case-by-case applicationat the appellate level. "Finally, de novo review tends tounify precedent" and " `stabilize the law.' " 517 U. S., at 697-698. Justice Breyer made a similar point in his concur-ring opinion inGore:"Requiring the application of law, rather than a decision-maker's caprice, does more than simply provide citizensnotice of what actions may subject them to punishment;it also helps to assure the uniform general treatment ofsimilarly situated persons that is the essence of law it-self." 517 U. S., at 587.Our decisions in analogous cases, together with the reason-ing that produced those decisions, thus convince us thatcourts of appeals should apply a de novo standard of re-view when passing on district courts' determinations of theconstitutionality of punitive damages awards.99 Contrary to respondent's assertion, Brief for Respondent 12-13, ourdecision today is supported by our reasoning in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 20-21 (1991). In that case, we emphasized the532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN437Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIII"Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, whichpresents a question of historical or predictive fact, see,e. g.,[St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648 (1915)],the level of punitive damages is not really a `fact' `tried'by the jury." Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,518 U. S. 415, 459 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Becausethe jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute afinding of "fact," appellate review of the district court's de-termination that an award is consistent with due processdoes not implicate the Seventh Amendment concerns raisedby respondent and itsamicus.10 See Brief for Respondent18-24; Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of Americaas Amicus Curiae 17-20. Our decisions in Gasperini andHetzel v. Prince William County, 523 U.

See id., at 20-21 ("[A]ppellate review makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in theiramount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurredand to deter its repetition").10 Respondent argues that our decision in Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,512 U. S. 415 (1994), rests upon the assumption that punitive damagesawards are findings of fact. In that case, we held that the Oregon Constitution, which prohibits the reexamination of any "fact tried by a jury,"Ore. Const., Art. VII, $ 3, violated due process because it did not allowfor any review of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Respondent claims that, because we considered this provision of the OregonConstitution to cover punitive damages, we implicitly held that punitivedamages are a "fact tried by a jury." Brief for Respondent 27-28. Itwas the Oregon Supreme Court's interpretation of that provision, however, and not our own, that compelled the treatment of punitive damagesas covered. See Oberg, 512 U. S., at 427; see also Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 93, 210 P. 2d 461, 462 (1949) (construing the OregonConstitution).11 Nor does the historical material upon which respondent relies soextensively, see Brief for Respondent 19-24, conflict with our decision torequire de novo review. Most of the sources respondent cites merely532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the CourtIt might be argued that the deterrent function of punitivedamages suggests that the amount of such damages awardedis indeed a "fact" found by the jury and that, as a result, theSeventh Amendment is implicated in appellate review of thataward. Some scholars, for example, assert that punitivedamages should be used to compensate for the underdeterrence of unlawful behavior that will result from a defendant'sevasion of liability. See Polinsky & Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 890-891stand for the proposition that, perhaps because it is a fact-sensitive undertaking, determining the amount of punitive damages should be left to thediscretion of the jury. See, e. g., Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565(1886) ("[I]t is the peculiar function of the jury" to set the amount ofpunitive damages); Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852) (punitivedamages should be "left to the discretion of the jury"). They do not,however, indicate that the amount of punitive damages imposed by thejury is itself a "fact" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment'sReexamination Clause. See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,518 U. S. 415, 432 (1996) (distinguishing between the "Trial by Jury"Clause, which "bears . . . on the allocation of trial functions between judgeand jury," and the "Reexamination" Clause, which "controls the allocationof authority to review verdicts"); see also id., at 447-448 (Stevens, J.,dissenting) (same).In any event, punitive damages have evolved somewhat since the timeof respondent's sources. Until well into the 19th century, punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conceptionof compensatory damages prevalent at the time. See Haslip, 499 U. S.,at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also Note, Exemplary Damages inthe Law of Torts, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 517, 520 (1957) (observing a "vacillation"in the 19th-century cases between "compensatory" and "punitive" theoriesof "exemplary damages"). As the types of compensatory damages available to plaintiffs have broadened, see, e. g., 1 J. Nates, C. Kimball, D. Axelrod, & R. Goldstein, Damages in Tort Actions $ 3.01[3][a] (2000) (pain andsuffering are generally available as species of compensatory damages),the theory behind punitive damages has shifted toward a more purelypunitive (and therefore less factual) understanding.

New York, 216 F. 3d 236,244-245 (CA2 2000) (Calabresi, J., concurring). "The effi-cient deterrence theory thus regards punitive damages asmerely an augmentation of compensatory damages designedto achieve economic efficiency." Galanter & Luban, PoeticJustice: Punitive Damages and Legal Pluralism, 42 Am. U.L. Rev. 1393, 1449 (1993).However attractive such an approach to punitive dam-ages might be as an abstract policy matter, it is clear thatjuries do not normally engage in such a finely tuned exerciseof deterrence calibration when awarding punitive damages.See Sunstein, Schkade, & Kahneman, Do People Want Opti-mal Deterrence?, 29 J. Legal Studies 237, 240 (2000). Afterall, deterrence is not the only purpose served by punitivedamages. Seesupra, at 432. And there is no dispute that,in this case, deterrence was but one of four concerns thejury was instructed to consider when setting the amount ofpunitive damages.12 Moreover, it is not at all obvious thateven the deterrent function of punitive damages can beservedonly by economically "optimal deterrence." "[C]iti-zens and legislators may rightly insist that they are willingto tolerate some loss in economic efficiency in order to deterwhat they consider morally offensive conduct, albeit cost12 The jury was instructed to consider the following factors: (1) "Thecharacter of the defendant's conduct that is the subject of Leatherman'sunfair competition claims"; (2) "The defendant's motive"; (3) "The sum ofmoney that would be required to discourage the defendant and others fromengaging in such conduct in the future"; and (4) "The defendant's incomeand assets." App. 14. Although the jury's application of these instructions may have depended on specific findings of fact, nothing in our decision today suggests that the Seventh Amendment would permit a court,in reviewing a punitive damages award, to disregard such jury findings.See, e. g., Gore, 517 U. S., at 579-580.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN440 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the Courtbeneficial morally offensive conduct; efficiency is just oneconsideration among many." Galanter & Luban, 42 Am. U.L. Rev., at 1450.13Differences in the institutional competence of trial judgesand appellate judges are consistent with our conclusion. InGore, we instructed courts evaluating a punitive damagesaward's consistency with due process to consider three criteria: (1) the degree or reprehensibility of the defendant'smisconduct, (2) the disparity between the harm (or potentialharm) suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damagesaward, and (3) the difference between the punitive damagesawarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized orimposed in comparable cases. 517 U. S., at 574-575. Onlywith respect to the first Gore inquiry do the district courtshave a somewhat superior vantage over courts of appeals,and even then the advantage exists primarily with respect toissues turning on witness credibility and demeanor.14 Trialcourts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second factor. And the third Gore criterion, whichcalls for a broad legal comparison, seems more suited tothe expertise of appellate courts. Considerations of institutional competence therefore fail to tip the balance in favorof deferential appellate review.13 We express no opinion on the question whether Gasperini wouldgovern--and de novo review would be inappropriate--if a State were toadopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightlyto the jury's finding of compensatory damages. This might be the case,for example, if the State's scheme constrained a jury to award only theexact amount of punitive damages it determined was necessary to obtaineconomically optimal deterrence or if it defined punitive damages as amultiple of compensatory damages (e. g., treble damages).14 While we have determined that the Court of Appeals must review theDistrict Court's application of the Gore test de novo, it of course remainstrue that the Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findingsof fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998).532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN441Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIVIt is possible that the standard of review applied by theCourt of Appeals will affect the result of theGore analysisin only a relatively small number of cases. See Brief forRespondent 46-48; Brief for Association of American Rail-roads as Amicus Curiae 18; see also Gasperini, 518 U. S.,at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, it does seemlikely that in this case a thorough, independent review of theDistrict Court's rejection of petitioner's due process ob-jections to the punitive damages award might well have ledthe Court of Appeals to reach a different result. Indeed,our own consideration of each of the threeGore factors re-veals a series of questionable conclusions by the DistrictCourt that may not survive de novo review.When the jury assessed the reprehensibility of Cooper'smisconduct, it was guided by instructions that characterizedthe deliberate copying of the PST as wrongful. The jury'sselection of a penalty to deter wrongful conduct may, there-fore, have been influenced by an intent to deter Cooper fromengaging in such copying in the future. Similarly, the Dis-trict Court's belief that Cooper acted unlawfully in deliberately copying the PST design might have influenced itsconsideration of the first Gore factor. See App. to Pet. forCert. 23a. But, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, suchcopying of the functional features of an unpatented productis lawful. See TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,Inc., ante, p. 23. The Court of Appeals recognized that theDistrict Court's award of attorney's fees could not be supported if based on the premise that the copying was unlaw-ful, but it did not consider whether that improper predicatemight also have undermined the basis for the jury's largepunitive damages award.In evaluating the second Gore factor, the ratio betweenthe size of the award of punitive damages and the harmcaused by Cooper's tortious conduct, the District Court532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Opinion of the Courtmight have been influenced by respondent's submission thatit was not the actual injury--which the jury assessed at$50,000--that was relevant, but rather "the potential harmLeatherman would have suffered had Cooper succeeded inits wrongful conduct." See Brief for Respondent 7; seealso Record Doc. No. 323, p. 23. Respondent calculated that"potential harm" by referring to the fact that Cooper hadanticipated "gross profits of approximately $3 million duringthe first five years of sales." Brief for Respondent 7; seealso Record Doc. No. 323, at 23. Even if that estimate werecorrect, however, it would be unrealistic to assume that allof Cooper's sales of the ToolZall would have been attributable to its misconduct in using a photograph of a modifiedPST in its initial advertising materials. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the picture of the PST did not misrepresent the features of the original ToolZall and could not havedeceived potential customers in any significant way. Its usewas wrongful because it enabled Cooper to expedite the promotion of its tool, but that wrongdoing surely could not betreated as the principal cause of Cooper's entire sales volumefor a 5-year period.With respect to the third Gore factor, respondent arguesthat Cooper would have been subject to a comparable sanction under Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. Brieffor Respondent 49. In a suit brought by a State under thatAct, a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation may beassessed. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 646.642(3) (1997). In respondent's view, each of the thousands of pieces of promotionalmaterial containing a picture of the PST that Cooper distributed warranted the maximum fine. Brief for Respondent 49. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that its preparation of a single "mock-up" for use in a single distributionwould have been viewed as a single violation under the statestatute.

It did, however,observe that the unfairness in Cooper's use of the picture532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 532 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. This observationis more consistent with the single-violation theory thanwith the notion that the statutory violation would have beensanctioned with a multimillion dollar fine.We have made these comments on issues raised by appli-cation of the threeGore guidelines to the facts of this case,not to prejudge the answer to the constitutional question,but rather to illustrate why we are persuaded that the Courtof Appeals' answer to that question may depend upon thestandard of review. The de novo standard should governits decision. Because the Court of Appeals applied a lessdemanding standard in this case, we vacate the judgmentand remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Thomas, concurring.I continue to believe that the Constitution does notconstrain the size of punitive damages awards. SeeBMWof North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 599 (1996)(Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting). For this rea-son, given the opportunity, I would vote to overrule BMW.This case, however, does not present such an opportunity.The only issue before us today is what standard should beused to review a trial court's ruling on a BMW challenge.Because I agree with the Court's resolution of that issue,I join the opinion of the Court.Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.I was (and remain) of the view that excessive punitivedamages do not violate the Due Process Clause; but theCourt held otherwise. SeeBMW of North America, Inc. v.Gore, 517 U.

LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Ginsburg, J., dissentingof discretion (rather than de novo) fact-bound constitutionalissues which, in their resistance to meaningful generalization, resemble the question of excessiveness of punitivedamages--namely, whether there exists reasonable suspicionfor a stop and probable cause for a search; but the Courtheld otherwise. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690(1996); id., at 700 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Finally, in a casein which I joined a dissent that made it unnecessary forme to reach the issue, the Court categorically stated that"the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessivecalls for . . . de novo review." United States v. Bajakajian,524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998); seeid., at 344 (Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor andScalia, JJ., dissenting). Given these precedents, I agreethat de novo review of the question of excessive punitivedamages best accords with our jurisprudence. Accordingly,I concur in the judgment of the Court.Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.In Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415(1996), we held that appellate review of a federal trial court'srefusal to set aside a jury verdict as excessive is reconcilablewith the Seventh Amendment if "appellate control [is] lim-ited to review for `abuse of discretion.' "Id., at 419. Gasperini was a diversity action in which the defendant hadchallenged a compensatory damages award as excessiveunder New York law. The reasoning of that case appliesas well to an action challenging a punitive damages awardas excessive under the Constitution. I would hold, there-fore, that the proper standard of appellate oversight is notde novo review, as the Court today concludes, but review forabuse of discretion."An essential characteristic of [the federal court] systemis the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, underthe influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amend532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN445Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Ginsburg, J., dissentingment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact tothe jury."Id., at 432 (citing Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec.Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958)). The SeventhAmendment provides: "In Suits at common law . . . the rightof trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by ajury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of theUnited States, than according to the rules of the commonlaw." In Gasperini, we observed that although trial courtstraditionally had broad authority at common law to set asidejury verdicts and to grant new trials, 518 U. S., at 432-433,"appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motionto set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late,and less secure, development," id., at 434. We ultimatelyconcluded that the Seventh Amendment does not precludesuch appellate review, id., at 436, but explained that "[w]ithinthe federal system, practical reasons combine with SeventhAmendment constraints to lodge in the district court, notthe court of appeals, primary responsibility for applicationof [an excessiveness standard]," id., at 438. "Trial judgeshave the unique opportunity to consider the evidence in theliving courtroom context," we said, "while appellate judgessee only the cold paper record." Ibid. (citations and internalquotation marks omitted). "If [courts of appeals] reverse,it must be because of an abuse of discretion. . . . The verynature of the problem counsels restraint. . . . [Appellatecourts] must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgmentof the trial judge." Id., at 438-439 (internal quotationmarks omitted) (citing Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961)).Although Gasperini involved compensatory damages, I seeno reason why its logic should be abandoned when punitivedamages are alleged to be excessive. At common law, as ourlongstanding decisions reiterate, the task of determining theamount of punitive damages "has [always been] left to thediscretion of the jury." Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371(1852); see Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886)532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Ginsburg, J., dissenting("[N]othing is better settled than that . . . it is the peculiarfunction of the jury to determine the amount [of punitivedamages] by their verdict."). The commitment of this func-tion to the jury, we have explained, reflects the historicalunderstanding that "the degree of punishment to be thusinflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of eachcase." Day, 13 How., at 371. The relevant factors include"the conduct and motives of the defendant" and whether,"in committing the wrong complained of, he acted recklessly,or wilfully and maliciously, with a design to oppress and in-jure the plaintiff." 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 720(1882). Such inquiry, the Court acknowledges, "is a factsensitive undertaking." Ante, at 438, n. 11.The Court nevertheless today asserts that a "jury's awardof punitive damages does not constitute a finding of `fact' "within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. Ante, at437. An ultimate award of punitive damages, it is true, involves more than the resolution of matters of historical orpredictive fact. See ibid. (citing Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 459(Scalia, J., dissenting)). But there can be no question thata jury's verdict on punitive damages is fundamentally dependent on determinations we characterize as factfindings--e. g., the extent of harm or potential harm caused by thedefendant's misconduct, whether the defendant acted ingood faith, whether the misconduct was an individual instance or part of a broader pattern, whether the defendant behaved negligently, recklessly, or maliciously. Punitivedamages are thus not "[u]nlike the measure of actual damages suffered," ante, at 437 (citation and internal quotationmarks omitted), in cases of intangible, noneconomic injury.One million dollars' worth of pain and suffering does notexist as a "fact" in the world any more or less than onemillion dollars' worth of moral outrage. Both derive theirmeaning from a set of underlying facts as determined by ajury. If one exercise in quantification is properly regardedas factfinding, see St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Ginsburg, J., dissentingU. S. 648, 661 (1915) (compensation for pain and suffering"involves only a question of fact"), it seems to me the othershould be so regarded as well.InBrowning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), we approved applicationof an abuse-of-discretion standard for appellate review of adistrict court's ruling on a motion to set aside a punitivedamages award as excessive. See id., at 279. BrowningFerris reserved the question whether even such deferentialappellate review might run afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment. At that time (i. e., pre-Gasperini), the Court "ha[d]never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allowsappellate review of a district court's denial of a motion toset aside an award as excessive." 492 U. S., at 279, n. 25.We found it unnecessary to reach the Seventh Amendmentquestion in Browning-Ferris because the jury verdict theresurvived lower court review intact. Id., at 279, n. 25, 280.Browning-Ferris, in short, signaled our recognition thatappellate review of punitive damages, if permissible at all,would involve at most abuse-of-discretion review. "[P]articularly . . . because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," we were "reluctant tostray too far from traditional common-law standards, or totake steps which ultimately might interfere with the properrole of the jury." Id., at 280, n. 26.The Court finds no incompatibility between this caseand Browning-Ferris, observing that Browning-Ferris presented for our review an excessiveness challenge restingsolely on state law, not on the Constitution. See ante, at433, and n. 7. It is unclear to me why this distinction shouldmake a difference. Of the three guideposts BMW of NorthAmerica, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996), established forassessing constitutional excessiveness, two were derivedfrom common-law standards that typically inform state law.See id., at 575, n. 24 ("The principle that punishment shouldfit the crime is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Ginsburg, J., dissentingcommon-law jurisprudence." (citation and internal quota-tion marks omitted));id., at 580 ("The principle that exemplary damages must bear a `reasonable relationship' tocompensatory damages has a long pedigree."). The thirdguidepost--comparability of sanctions for comparable misconduct--is not similarly rooted in common law, nor is itsimilarly factbound. As the Court states, "the third Gorecriterion . . . calls for a broad legal comparison." Ante, at440. But to the extent the inquiry is "legal" in character,there is little difference between review de novo and review for abuse of discretion. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 448(Stevens, J., dissenting) ("[I]t is a familiar . . . maxim thatdeems an error of law an abuse of discretion.").1Apart from "Seventh Amendment constraints," an abuseof-discretion standard also makes sense for "practical reasons." Id., at 438. With respect to the first Gore inquiry(i. e., reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct), districtcourts have an undeniably superior vantage over courts ofappeals. As earlier noted, supra, at 445, district courtsview the evidence not on a "cold paper record," but "in theliving courtroom context," Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 438.They can assess from the best seats the vital matter of witness credibility. And "it of course remains true that [a]1 Appellate courts, following our instruction, apply de novo review totrial court determinations of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and excessiveness of fines. See ante, at 435-436 (citing United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998), and Ornelas v. United States,517 U. S. 690, 696-698 (1996)). But such determinations typically aremade without jury involvement, see, e. g., Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 325-326; Ornelas, 517 U. S., at 694, and surely do not implicate the SeventhAmendment. Moreover, although Bajakajian said "the question whethera [criminal] fine is constitutionally excessive calls for . . . de novo review,"524 U. S., at 336-337, n. 10, Bajakajian did not disturb our holding inBrowning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S.257 (1989), that the "Excessive Fines Clause does not apply to awards ofpunitive damages in [civil] cases between private parties," id., at 260.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)Ginsburg, J., dissentingCourt of Appeals should defer to the District Court's find-ings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous." Ante, at440, n. 14.2The Court recognizes that district courts have the edgeon the first Gore factor, ante, at 440, but goes on to saythat "[t]rial courts and appellate courts seem equally capableof analyzing the second [Gore] factor" (i. e., whether punitivedamages bear a reasonable relationship to the actual harminflicted), ibid. Only "the third Gore criterion [i. e., intra-jurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons] . . . seemsmore suited to the expertise of appellate courts." Ibid.To the extent the second factor requires a determinationof "the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff," Gore, 517 U. S.,at 580, district courts may be better positioned to conductthe inquiry, especially in cases of intangible injury. I candemur to the Court's assessment of relative institutionalstrengths, however, for even accepting that assessment,I would disagree with the Court's conclusion that "[c]onsiderations of institutional competence . . . fail to tip the balancein favor of deferential appellate review," ante, at 440. Goreitself assigned particular importance to the first inquiry,characterizing "degree of reprehensibility" as "[p]erhaps themost important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitivedamages award." 517 U. S., at 575. District courts, as justnoted, supra, at 448 and this page, have a superior vantageover courts of appeals in conducting that fact-intensive inquiry. Therefore, in the typical case envisioned by Gore,where reasonableness is primarily tied to reprehensibility, anappellate court should have infrequent occasion to reverse.This observation, I readily acknowledge, suggests thatthe practical difference between the Court's approach and2 An appellate court might be at a loss to accord such deference to juryfindings of fact absent trial court employment of either a special verdictor a general verdict accompanied by written interrogatories. See Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 49.532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMANTOOL GROUP, INC.Ginsburg, J., dissentingmy own is not large. An abuse-of-discretion standard, asI see it, hews more closely to "the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 280, n. 26.The Court's de novo standard is more complex. It requireslower courts to distinguish between ordinary common-lawexcessiveness and constitutional excessiveness, ante, at 433,and to separate out factfindings that qualify for "clearly erro-neous" review,ante, at 440, n. 14. See also ante, at 440, n. 13(suggesting abuse-of-discretion review might be in order"if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award ofpunitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages"). The Court's approach will be chal-lenging to administer. Complex as it is, I suspect that approach and mine will yield different outcomes in few cases.The Ninth Circuit, I conclude, properly identified abuseof discretion as the appropriate standard in reviewing theDistrict Court's determination that the punitive damagesawarded against Cooper were not grossly excessive. Forthe Seventh Amendment and practical reasons stated, Iwould affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN451OCTOBER TERM, 2000SyllabusROGERS v. TENNESSEEcertiorari to the supreme court of tennesseeNo. 99-6218. Argued November 1, 2000--Decided May 14, 2001Following James Bowdery's death some 15 months after petitionerstabbed him, petitioner was convicted in Tennessee state court of seconddegree murder under the State's criminal homicide statute. Althoughthat statute makes no mention of the common law "year and a dayrule"--under which no defendant could be convicted of murder unlesshis victim died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of theact, see, e. g., Louisville, E. & St. L. R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U. S. 230, 239--petitioner argued on appeal that the rule persisted as part of the State'scommon law and, as such, precluded his conviction. The TennesseeCourt of Criminal Appeals disagreed and affirmed the conviction. Inaffirming, the State Supreme Court abolished the rule, finding that thereasons for recognizing the rule at common law no longer existed. Thecourt disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would violate the Ex Post FactoClauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, observing that thoseprovisions refer only to legislative Acts. The court also concluded thatapplication of its decision to petitioner would not run afoul of Bouie v.City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354, in which this Court held that dueprocess prohibits retroactive application of any judicial construction ofa criminal statute that is unexpected and indefensible by reference tothe law which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.Held: The Tennessee Supreme Court's retroactive application to petitioner of its decision abolishing the year and a day rule did not denypetitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 456-467.(a) To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause, he misreads Bouie. Bouie contains some dicta suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues, see, e. g., 378 U. S., at 353-354,but the decision was rooted firmly in well established notions of dueprocess. Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice,foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties towhat previously had been innocent conduct, see, e. g., id., at 351, 352,354-355. Subsequent decisions have not interpreted Bouie as extending so far as petitioner suggests, but have uniformly viewed Bouie532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 ROGERS v. TENNESSEESyllabusas restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so, they haveapplied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but, rather, in accordance with the more basic and general principle of fair warning thatBouie so clearly articulated. See, e. g., United States v. Lanier, 520U. S. 259, 266. While petitioner's assertion that the two Clauses safeguard common interests is undoubtedly correct, he is mistaken to suggest that these considerations compel extending the Ex Post FactoClause's strictures to the context of common law judging through therubric of due process. Such an extension would circumvent the Ex PostFacto Clause's clear text, which expressly applies only to legislatures;would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating and common law decisionmaking;would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marksany evolving legal system; and would unduly impair the incremental andreasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the commonlaw system. It was on account of such concerns that Bouie restricteddue process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to theconduct in issue. See 378 U. S., at 354. That restriction adequatelyserves the common law context as well. Pp. 456-462.(b) The Tennessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was notunexpected and indefensible. Advances in medical and related sciencehave so undermined the rule's usefulness as to render it without question obsolete, and it has been legislatively or judicially abolished in thevast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. Despite petitioner's argument to the contrary, the fact that a vast numberof jurisdictions outside Tennessee have abolished the rule is surely relevant to whether its abolition in his case, which involves the continuingviability of a common law rule, can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed. Bouie, supra, at359-360, distinguished. Perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the rule had only the most tenuous foothold as part ofTennessee's criminal law. It did not exist as part of the State's statutory criminal code, and while the Tennessee Supreme Court concludedthat the rule persisted at common law, it also pointedly observed thatthe rule had never once served as a ground of decision in any murderprosecution in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases,the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time in dicta.These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was "unexpected and indefensible" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated in Bouie and its progeny.

S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courting to indicate that abolition of the rule in petitioner's case representedan exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action againstwhich the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far from a marked andunpredictable departure from prior precedent, the court's decision wasa routine exercise of common law decisionmaking that brought the lawinto conformity with reason and common sense.

At common law, the year and a dayrule provided that no defendant could be convicted of murderunless his victim had died by the defendant's act within ayear and a day of the act. See,e. g., Louisville, E. & St. L.R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U. S. 230, 239 (1894); 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries on the Laws of England 197-198 (1769). TheSupreme Court of Tennessee abolished the rule as it hadexisted at common law in Tennessee and applied its decisionto petitioner to uphold his conviction. The question beforeus is whether, in doing so, the court denied petitioner dueprocess of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.*Paula R.

TENNESSEEOpinion of the CourtIPetitioner Wilbert K. Rogers was convicted in Tennesseestate court of second degree murder. According to the undisputed facts, petitioner stabbed his victim, James Bow-dery, with a butcher knife on May 6, 1994. One of the stabwounds penetrated Bowdery's heart. During surgery to re-pair the wound to his heart, Bowdery went into cardiac arrest, but was resuscitated and survived the procedure. Asa result, however, he had developed a condition known as"cerebral hypoxia," which results from a loss of oxygen tothe brain. Bowdery's higher brain functions had ceased,and he slipped into and remained in a coma until August7, 1995, when he died from a kidney infection (a commoncomplication experienced by comatose patients). Approxi-mately 15 months had passed between the stabbing andBowdery's death which, according to the undisputed testi-mony of the county medical examiner, was caused by cerebral hypoxia " `secondary to a stab wound to the heart.' "992 S. W. 2d 393, 395 (Tenn. 1999).Based on this evidence, the jury found petitioner guiltyunder Tennessee's criminal homicide statute. The statute,which makes no mention of the year and a day rule, definescriminal homicide simply as "the unlawful killing of anotherperson which may be first degree murder, second degreemurder, voluntary manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide." Tenn. Code Ann. $ 39-13-201(1997). Petitioner appealed his conviction to the TennesseeCourt of Criminal Appeals, arguing that, despite its absencefrom the statute, the year and a day rule persisted as partof the common law of Tennessee and, as such, precluded hisconviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed the conviction. The court held thatTennessee's Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (1989Act), which abolished all common law defenses in criminalactions in Tennessee, had abolished the rule. See Tenn.Code Ann. $ 39-11-203(e)(2) (1997). The court also rejected532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner's further contention that the legislative abolitionof the rule constituted an ex post facto violation, noting thatthe 1989 Act had taken effect five years before petitionercommitted his crime. No. 02C01-9611-CR-00418 (Tenn.Crim. App., Oct. 17, 1997), App. 7.The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed on differentgrounds. The court observed that it had recognized the viability of the year and a day rule in Tennessee in Percer v.State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780 (1907), and that, "[d]espitethe paucity of case law" on the rule in Tennessee, "bothparties . . . agree that the . . . rule was a part of the commonlaw of this State." 992 S. W. 2d, at 396. Turning to therule's present status, the court noted that the rule has beenlegislatively or judicially abolished by the "vast majority" ofjurisdictions recently to have considered the issue. Id., at397. The court concluded that, contrary to the conclusion ofthe Court of Criminal Appeals, the 1989 Act had not abolished the rule. After reviewing the justifications for therule at common law, however, the court found that the original reasons for recognizing the rule no longer exist. Accordingly, the court abolished the rule as it had existed atcommon law in Tennessee. Id., at 399-401.The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case wouldviolate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the State and FederalConstitutions. Those constitutional provisions, the courtobserved, refer only to legislative Acts. The court thennoted that in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964),this Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any " `judicial construction of a criminal statute[that] is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the lawwhich has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' "992 S. W. 2d, at 402 (quoting Bouie v. City of Columbia,supra, at 354) (alteration in original). The court concluded,however, that application of its decision to petitioner would532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the Courtnot offend this principle. 992 S. W. 2d, at 402. We grantedcertiorari, 529 U. S. 1129 (2000), and we now affirm.IIAlthough petitioner's claim is one of due process, the Con-stitution's Ex Post Facto Clause figures prominently in hisargument. The Clause provides simply that "[n]o Stateshall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law." Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1.The most well-known and oft-repeated explanation of thescope of the Clause's protection was given by Justice Chase,who long ago identified, in dictum, four types of laws towhich the Clause extends:"1st. Every law that makes an action done before thepassing of the law, and which was innocent when done,criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every lawthat aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was,when committed. 3d. Every law that changes thepunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, thanthe law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th.Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, andreceives less, or different, testimony, than the law re-quired at the time of the commission of the offense, inorder to convict the offender." Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.386, 390 (1798) (seriatim opinion of Chase, J.) (empha-sis deleted).Accord, Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 521-525 (2000); Col-lins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41-42, 46 (1990). As thetext of the Clause makes clear, it "is a limitation upon thepowers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force applyto the Judicial Branch of government." Marks v. UnitedStates, 430 U. S. 188, 191 (1977) (citation omitted).We have observed, however, that limitations on ex postfacto judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notion ofdue process. In Bouie v. City of Columbia, we consideredthe South Carolina Supreme Court's retroactive application532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courtof its construction of the State's criminal trespass statute tothe petitioners in that case. The statute prohibited "entryupon the lands of another . . . after notice from the owner ortenant prohibiting such entry . . . ." 378 U. S., at 349, n. 1(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The SouthCarolina court construed the statute to extend to patrons ofa drug store who had received no notice prohibiting theirentry into the store, but had refused to leave the store whenasked. Prior to the court's decision, South Carolina casesconstruing the statute had uniformly held that convictionunder the statute required proof of notice before entry.None of those cases, moreover, had given the "slightest indication that that requirement could be satisfied by proof ofthe different act of remaining on the land after being told toleave." Id., at 357.We held that the South Carolina court's retroactive application of its construction to the store patrons violated dueprocess. Reviewing decisions in which we had held criminalstatutes "void for vagueness" under the Due Process Clause,we noted that this Court has often recognized the "basicprinciple that a criminal statute must give fair warning ofthe conduct that it makes a crime." Id., at 350; see id., at350-352 (discussing, inter alia, United States v. Harriss, 347U. S. 612 (1954), Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451 (1939),and Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385 (1926)).Deprivation of the right to fair warning, we continued, canresult both from vague statutory language and from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of statutorylanguage that appears narrow and precise on its face.Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S., at 352. For that reason, we concluded that "[i]f a judicial construction of a criminal statute is `unexpected and indefensible by reference tothe law which had been expressed prior to the conduct inissue,' [the construction] must not be given retroactive effect." Id., at 354 (quoting J. Hall, General Principles ofCriminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960)). We found that the South532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN458 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the CourtCarolina court's construction of the statute violated thisprinciple because it was so clearly at odds with the statute'splain language and had no support in prior South Carolinadecisions. 378 U. S., at 356.Relying largely upon Bouie, petitioner argues that theTennessee court erred in rejecting his claim that the retroactive application of its decision to his case violates due process. Petitioner contends that the Ex Post Facto Clausewould prohibit the retroactive application of a decision abolishing the year and a day rule if accomplished by the Tennessee Legislature. He claims that the purposes behind theClause are so fundamental that due process should preventthe Supreme Court of Tennessee from accomplishing thesame result by judicial decree. Brief for Petitioner 8-18.In support of this claim, petitioner takes Bouie to stand forthe proposition that "[i]n evaluating whether the retroactiveapplication of a judicial decree violates Due Process, a critical question is whether the Constitution would prohibit thesame result attained by the exercise of the state's legislativepower." Brief for Petitioner 12.To the extent petitioner argues that the Due ProcessClause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex PostFacto Clause as identified in Calder, petitioner misreadsBouie. To be sure, our opinion in Bouie does contain someexpansive language that is suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues. Most prominent is ourstatement that "[i]f a state legislature is barred by theEx Post Facto Clause from passing . . . a law, it must followthat a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due ProcessClause from achieving precisely the same result by judicialconstruction." 378 U. S., at 353-354; see also id., at 353("[A]n unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex postfacto law"); id., at 362 ("The Due Process Clause compels thesame result" as would the constitutional proscription againstex post facto laws "where the State has sought to achieve532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN459Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courtprecisely the same [impermissible] effect by judicial con-struction of the statute"). This language, however, wasdicta. Our decision in Bouie was rooted firmly in well es-tablished notions ofdue process. See supra, at 457-458.Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice,foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warningas those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attachingcriminal penalties to what previously had been innocent con-duct. See,e. g., 378 U. S., at 351, 352, 354-355. And wecouched its holding squarely in terms of that establisheddue process right, and not in terms of theex post factorelated dicta to which petitioner points. Id., at 355 (conclud-ing that "the South Carolina Code did not give [the petitioners] fair warning, at the time of their conduct . . . , thatthe act for which they now stand convicted was renderedcriminal by the statute"). Contrary to petitioner's sugges-tion, nowhere in the opinion did we go so far as to incorporate jot-for-jot the specific categories of Calder into dueprocess limitations on the retroactive application of judicialdecisions.Nor have any of our subsequent decisions addressingBouie-type claims interpreted Bouie as extending so far.Those decisions instead have uniformly viewed Bouie as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so,they have applied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the ex post facto categoriesset out in Calder, but, rather, in accordance with the morebasic and general principle of fair warning that Bouie soclearly articulated. See, e. g., United States v. Lanier, 520U. S. 259, 266 (1997) ("[D]ue process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct thatneither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairlydisclosed to be within its scope"); Marks v. United States,430 U. S., at 191-192 (Due process protects against judicialinfringement of the "right to fair warning" that certain conduct will give rise to criminal penalties); Rose v. Locke, 423U. S. 48, 53 (1975) (per curiam) (upholding defendant's con532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN460 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the Courtviction under statute prohibiting "crimes against nature" be-cause, unlike inBouie, the defendant "[could] make no claimthat [the statute] afforded no notice that his conduct mightbe within its scope");Douglas v. Buder, 412 U. S. 430, 432(1973) (per curiam) (trial court's construction of the term"arrest" as including a traffic citation, and application of thatconstruction to defendant to revoke his probation, was unforeseeable and thus violated due process); Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313, 316 (1972) (per curiam) (reversing conviction under state obscenity law because it did "not giv[e] fairnotice" that the location of the allegedly obscene exhibitionwas a vital element of the offense).Petitioner observes that the Due Process and Ex PostFacto Clauses safeguard common interests--in particular,the interests in fundamental fairness (through notice and fairwarning) and the prevention of the arbitrary and vindictiveuse of the laws. Brief for Petitioner 12-18. While this isundoubtedly correct, see, e. g., Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433,439-440, and n. 12 (1997), petitioner is mistaken to suggestthat these considerations compel extending the strictures ofthe Ex Post Facto Clause to the context of common law judging. The Ex Post Facto Clause, by its own terms, does notapply to courts. Extending the Clause to courts throughthe rubric of due process thus would circumvent the clearconstitutional text. It also would evince too little regard forthe important institutional and contextual differences between legislating, on the one hand, and common law decisionmaking, on the other.Petitioner contends that state courts acting in their common law capacity act much like legislatures in the exerciseof their lawmaking function, and indeed may in some caseseven be subject to the same kinds of political influences andpressures that justify ex post facto limitations upon legislatures. Brief for Petitioner 12-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner15. A court's "opportunity for discrimination," however, "ismore limited than [a] legislature's, in that [it] can only act532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN461Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courtin construing existing law in actual litigation." James v.United States, 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, "[g]iventhe divergent pulls of flexibility and precedent in our caselaw system," ibid., incorporation of the Calder categoriesinto due process limitations on judicial decisionmaking wouldplace an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normaljudicial processes and would be incompatible with the resolu-tion of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system.That is particularly so where, as here, the allegedly imper-missible judicial application of a rule of law involves not theinterpretation of a statute but an act of common law judging.In the context of common law doctrines (such as the yearand a day rule), there often arises a need to clarify or evento reevaluate prior opinions as new circumstances and factpatterns present themselves. Such judicial acts, whetherthey be characterized as "making" or "finding" the law, area necessary part of the judicial business in States in whichthe criminal law retains some of its common law elements.Strict application of ex post facto principles in that contextwould unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common lawsystem. The common law, in short, presupposes a measureof evolution that is incompatible with stringent applicationof ex post facto principles. It was on account of concernssuch as these that Bouie restricted due process limitationson the retroactive application of judicial interpretations ofcriminal statutes to those that are "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed priorto the conduct in issue." Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378U. S., at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).We believe this limitation adequately serves the commonlaw context as well. It accords common law courts the substantial leeway they must enjoy as they engage in the dailytask of formulating and passing upon criminal defenses andinterpreting such doctrines as causation and intent, reevalu532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN462 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the Courtating and refining them as may be necessary to bring thecommon law into conformity with logic and common sense.It also adequately respects the due process concern with fun-damental fairness and protects against vindictive or arbitrary judicial lawmaking by safeguarding defendants againstunjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law. Accordingly, we conclude that a judicial alteration of a commonlaw doctrine of criminal law violates the principle of fairwarning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, onlywhere it is "unexpected and indefensible by reference tothe law which had been expressed prior to the conductin issue."Ibid.Justice Scalia makes much of the fact that, at the timeof the framing of the Constitution, it was widely acceptedthat courts could not "change" the law, see post, at 472-473,477-478 (dissenting opinion), and that (according toJusticeScalia) there is no doubt that the Ex Post Facto Clausewould have prohibited a legislative decision identical to theTennessee court's decision here, see post, at 469-471, 478.This latter argument seeks at bottom merely to reopen whathas long been settled by the constitutional text and our owndecisions: that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply tojudicial decisionmaking. The former argument is beside thepoint. Common law courts at the time of the framing undoubtedly believed that they were finding rather than mak-ing law. But, however one characterizes their actions, thefact of the matter is that common law courts then, as now,were deciding cases, and in doing so were fashioning andrefining the law as it then existed in light of reason and expe-rience. Due process clearly did not prohibit this process ofjudicial evolution at the time of the framing, and it does notdo so today.IIITurning to the particular facts of the instant case, the Ten-nessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was notunexpected and indefensible. The year and a day rule iswidely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law. Peti532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courttioner does not even so much as hint that good reasons existfor retaining the rule, and so we need not delve too deeplyinto the rule and its history here. Suffice it to say that therule is generally believed to date back to the 13th century,when it served as a statute of limitations governing the timein which an individual might initiate a private action for murder known as an "appeal of death"; that by the 18th centurythe rule had been extended to the law governing publicprosecutions for murder; that the primary and most frequently cited justification for the rule is that 13th centurymedical science was incapable of establishing causation beyond a reasonable doubt when a great deal of time hadelapsed between the injury to the victim and his death; andthat, as practically every court recently to have consideredthe rule has noted, advances in medical and related sciencehave so undermined the usefulness of the rule as to renderit without question obsolete. See,e. g., People v. Carrillo,164 Ill. 2d 144, 150, 646 N. E. 2d 582, 585 (1995); Commonwealth v. Lewis, 381 Mass. 411, 414-415, 409 N. E. 2d 771,772-773 (1980); People v. Stevenson, 416 Mich. 383, 391-392,331 N. W. 2d 143, 146 (1982); State v. Hefler, 310 N. C. 135,138-140, 310 S. E. 2d 310, 313 (1984); see generally Comment,59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1337 (1992) (tracing the history of therule).For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. See 992 S. W. 2d,at 397, n. 4 (reviewing cases and statutes). Citing Bouie,petitioner contends that the judicial abolition of the rule inother jurisdictions is irrelevant to whether he had fair warning that the rule in Tennessee might similarly be abolishedand, hence, to whether the Tennessee court's decision wasunexpected and indefensible as applied to him. Brief forPetitioner 28-30. In discussing the apparent meaning of theSouth Carolina statute in Bouie, we noted that "[i]t would bea rare situation in which the meaning of a statute of anotherState sufficed to afford a person `fair warning' that his own532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the CourtState's statute meant something quite different from whatits words said." 378 U. S., at 359-360. This case, however,involves not the precise meaning of the words of a particularstatute, but rather the continuing viability of a common lawrule. Common law courts frequently look to the decisionsof other jurisdictions in determining whether to alter ormodify a common law rule in light of changed circumstances,increased knowledge, and general logic and experience.Due process, of course, does not require a person to apprisehimself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guaran-tee that his actions will not subject him to punishment inlight of a developing trend in the law that has not yet madeits way to his State. At the same time, however, the factthat a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule thathas so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant towhether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can besaid to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to thelaw as it then existed.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the year and a day rule had only the mosttenuous foothold as part of the criminal law of the State ofTennessee. The rule did not exist as part of Tennessee'sstatutory criminal code. And while the Supreme Court ofTennessee concluded that the rule persisted at common law,it also pointedly observed that the rule had never onceserved as a ground of decision in any prosecution for murderin the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases,the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each timein dicta.The first mention of the rule in Tennessee, and the onlymention of it by the Supreme Court of that State, was in1907 in Percer v. State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780. InPercer, the court reversed the defendant's conviction for second degree murder because the defendant was not presentin court when the verdict was announced and because theproof failed to show that the murder occurred prior to thefinding of the indictment. In discussing the latter ground532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN465Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)Opinion of the Courtfor its decision, the court quoted the rule that " `it is . . . forthe State to show that the crime was committed before theindictment was found, and, where it fails to do so, a convic-tion will be reversed.' "Id., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting 12 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 382 (1904)). Thecourt then also quoted the rule that " `[i]n murder, the deathmust be proven to have taken place within a year and a dayfrom the date of the injury received.' " 118 Tenn., at 777,103 S. W., at 783 (quoting F. Wharton, Law of Homicide $ 18(3d ed. 1907)).While petitioner relies on this case for the proposition thatthe year and a day rule was firmly entrenched in the commonlaw of Tennessee, we agree with the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the case cannot establish nearly so much. Afterreciting the rules just mentioned, the court inPercer wenton to point out that the indictment was found on July 6, 1906;that it charged that the murder was committed sometime inMay 1906; and that the only evidence of when the victim diedwas testimony from a witness stating that he thought thedeath occurred sometime in July, but specifying neither adate nor a year. From this, the court concluded that it did"not affirmatively appear" from the evidence "whether thedeath occurred before or after the finding of the indictment."118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783. The court made nomention of the year and a day rule anywhere in its legalanalysis or, for that matter, anywhere else in its opinion.Thus, whatever the import of the court's earlier quoting ofthe rule, it is clear that the rule did not serve as the basisfor the Percer court's decision.The next two references to the rule both were by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals in cases in which the dateof the victim's death was not even in issue. Sixty-sevenyears after Percer, the court in Cole v. State, 512 S. W. 2d598 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974), noted the existence of the rulein rejecting the defendants' contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the jury's conclusion that they hadcaused the victim's death in a drag-racing crash. Id., at 601.532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 ROGERS v. TENNESSEEOpinion of the CourtTwenty-one years after that, in State v. Ruane, 912 S. W. 2d766 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995), a defendant referred to the rulein arguing that the operative cause of his victim's death wasremoval of life support rather than a gunshot wound at thedefendant's hand. The victim had died within 10 days ofreceiving the wound. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the defendant's argument, concluding, as it had in thiscase, that the year and a day rule had been abolished by the1989 Act. It went on to hold that the evidence of causationwas sufficient to support the conviction. Id., at 773-777.Ruane, of course, was decided after petitioner committed hiscrime, and it concluded that the year and a day rule no longerexisted in Tennessee for a reason that the high court of thatState ultimately rejected. But we note the case nonethelessto complete our account of the few appearances of the common law rule in the decisions of the Tennessee courts.These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was "unexpected and indefensible" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulatedin Bouie and its progeny. This is so despite the fact that,as Justice Scalia correctly points out, the court viewed theyear and a day rule as a "substantive principle" of the common law of Tennessee. See post, at 480. As such, however,it was a principle in name only, having never once beenenforced in the State. The Supreme Court of Tennesseealso emphasized this fact in its opinion, see 992 S. W. 2d, at402, and rightly so, for it is surely relevant to whether thecourt's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case violated dueprocess limitations on retroactive judicial decisionmaking.And while we readily agree with Justice Scalia that fundamental due process prohibits the punishment of conduct thatcannot fairly be said to have been criminal at the time theconduct occurred, see, e. g., post, at 470, 478, 480, nothingsuggests that is what took place here.There is, in short, nothing to indicate that the Tennesseecourt's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 532 U.

Farfrom a marked and unpredictable departure from prior prec-edent, the court's decision was a routine exercise of commonlaw decisionmaking in which the court brought the law intoconformity with reason and common sense. It did so by laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule that had never beenrelied upon as a ground of decision in any reported Tennes-see case.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee isaccordingly affirmed.
