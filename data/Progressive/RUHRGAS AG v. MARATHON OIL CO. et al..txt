This case concerns the authority of the federal courts toadjudicate controversies. Jurisdiction to resolve cases onthe merits requires both authority over the category of claimin suit (subject-matter jurisdiction) and authority over theparties (personal jurisdiction), so that the court's decisionwill bind them. InSteel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83 (1998), this Court adhered to the rule thata federal court may not hypothesize subject-matter jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits. Steel Co.rejected a doctrine, once approved by several Courts ofAppeals, that allowed federal tribunals to pretermit juris-dictional objections "where (1) the merits question is morereadily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the meritswould be the same as the prevailing party were jurisdictiondenied."Id., at 93. Recalling "a long and venerable line ofour cases," id., at 94, Steel Co. reiterated: "The requirementthat jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter . . .is `inflexible and without exception,' " id., at 94-95 (quotingMansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382(1884)); for "[ j]urisdiction is power to declare the law," and" `[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in anycause,' " 523 U. S., at 94 (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall.506, 514 (1869)). The Court, in Steel Co., acknowledged that"the absolute purity" of the jurisdiction-first rule had beendiluted in a few extraordinary cases, 523 U. S., at 101, andJustice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy, joined themajority on the understanding that the Court's opinion didnot catalog "an exhaustive list of circumstances" in whichexceptions to the solid rule were appropriate, id., at 110.Steel Co. is the backdrop for the issue now before us: If, asSteel Co. held, jurisdiction generally must precede merits indispositional order, must subject-matter jurisdiction precedepersonal jurisdiction on the decisional line? Or, do federaldistrict courts have discretion to avoid a difficult question526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN578 RUHRGAS AG v. MARATHON OIL CO.Opinion of the Courtof subject-matter jurisdiction when the absence of personaljurisdiction is the surer ground? The particular civil actionwe confront was commenced in state court and removed tofederal court. The specific question on which we grantedcertiorari asks "[w]hether a federal district court is abso-lutely barred in all circumstances from dismissing a removedcase for lack of personal jurisdiction without first decidingits subject-matter jurisdiction." Pet. for Cert. i.We hold that in cases removed from state court to federalcourt, as in cases originating in federal court, there is nounyielding jurisdictional hierarchy. Customarily, a federalcourt first resolves doubts about its jurisdiction over the subject matter, but there are circumstances in which a districtcourt appropriately accords priority to a personal jurisdiction inquiry. The proceeding before us is such a case.IThe underlying controversy stems from a venture toproduce gas in the Heimdal Field of the Norwegian NorthSea. In 1976, respondents Marathon Oil Company and Mar-athon International Oil Company acquired Marathon Petroleum Company (Norway) (MPCN) and respondent MarathonPetroleum Norge (Norge). See App. 26.1 Before the acquisition, Norge held a license to produce gas in the HeimdalField; following the transaction, Norge assigned the licenseto MPCN. See Record, Exhs. 61 and 62 to Document 64.In 1981, MPCN contracted to sell 70% of its share of theHeimdal gas production to a group of European buyers, in-cluding petitioner Ruhrgas AG. See Record, Exh. 1 to Document 63, pp. 90, 280. The parties' agreement was incor1 Ruhrgas is a German corporation; Norge is a Norwegian corporation.See App. 21, 22.

See App. 33-40. MarathonOil Company and Marathon International Oil Company alleged that Ruhrgas and the other European buyers inducedthem with false promises of "premium prices" and guaranteed pipeline tariffs to invest over $300 million in MPCN forthe development of the Heimdal Field and the erection of apipeline to Ruhrgas' plant in Germany. See id., at 26-28;Brief for Respondents 1-2. Norge alleged that Ruhrgas' effective monopolization of the Heimdal gas diminished thevalue of the license Norge had assigned to MPCN. See App.31, 33, 357; Brief for Respondents 2. Marathon assertedthat Ruhrgas had furthered its plans at three meetings inHouston, Texas, and through a stream of correspondence directed to Marathon in Texas. See App. 229, 233.Ruhrgas removed the case to the District Court for theSouthern District of Texas. See 145 F. 3d 211, 214 (CA51998). In its notice of removal, Ruhrgas asserted threebases for federal jurisdiction: diversity of citizenship, see 28U. S.

Ruhrgas moved to dismissthe complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Marathonmoved to remand the case to the state court for lack of fed-eral subject-matter jurisdiction. See 145 F. 3d, at 215.After permitting jurisdictional discovery, the DistrictCourt dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.See App. 455. In so ruling, the District Court relied onFifth Circuit precedent allowing district courts to adjudicatepersonal jurisdiction without first establishing subjectmatter jurisdiction. See id., at 445. Texas' long-arm stat-ute, see Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $ 17.042 (1997),authorizes personal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by theDue Process Clause of the Federal Constitution. See App.446; Kawasaki Steel Corp. v. Middleton, 699 S. W. 2d 199,200 (Tex. 1985). The District Court addressed the constitutional question and concluded that Ruhrgas' contacts withTexas were insufficient to support personal jurisdiction.2 A suit between "citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreignstate" lies within federal diversity jurisdiction. 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a)(2).Section 1332 has been interpreted to require "complete diversity." SeeStrawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806); R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D.Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System1528-1531 (4th ed. 1996). The foreign citizenship of defendant Ruhrgas,a German corporation, and plaintiff Norge, a Norwegian corporation, rendered diversity incomplete.3 Title 9 U. S. C. $ 205 allows removal "[w]here the subject matter of anaction or proceeding pending in a State court relates to an arbitrationagreement or award falling under the Convention [on the Recognition andEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958]."526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN581Cite as: 526 U. S. 574 (1999)Opinion of the CourtSee App. 445-454. Finding "no evidence that Ruhrgas en-gaged in any tortious conduct in Texas," id., at 450, the courtdetermined that Marathon's complaint did not present cir-cumstances adequately affiliating Ruhrgas with Texas, seeid., at 448.4A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that "respec[t]" for "the proper balance of federalism"impelled it to turn first to "the formidable subject matterjurisdiction issue presented." 115 F. 3d, at 318. After ex-amining and rejecting each of Ruhrgas' asserted bases offederal jurisdiction, see id., at 319-321,5 the Court of Appealsvacated the judgment of the District Court and ordered thecase remanded to the state court, see id., at 321. This Courtdenied Ruhrgas' petition for a writ of certiorari, which was4 Respecting the three meetings Ruhrgas attended in Houston, Texas,see supra, at 579, the District Court concluded that Marathon had notshown that Ruhrgas pursued the alleged pattern of fraud and misrepresentation during the Houston meetings. See App. 449. The court further found that Ruhrgas attended those meetings "due to the [HeimdalAgreement] with MPCN." Id., at 450. As the Heimdal Agreement provides for arbitration in Sweden, the court reasoned, "Ruhrgas could nothave expected to be haled into Texas courts based on these meetings."Ibid. The court also determined that Ruhrgas did not have "systematicand continuous contacts with Texas" of the kind that would "subject it togeneral jurisdiction in Texas." Id., at 453 (citing Helicopteros Nacionalesde Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408 (1984)).5 The Court of Appeals concluded that whether Norge had a legal interest in the Heimdal license notwithstanding its assignment to MPCN likelyturned on difficult questions of Norwegian law; Ruhrgas therefore couldnot show, at the outset, that Norge had been fraudulently joined as aplaintiff to defeat diversity. See 115 F. 3d 315, 319-320 (CA5), vacatedand rehearing en banc granted, 129 F. 3d 746 (1997). The appeals courtalso determined that Marathon's claims did not "strike at the sovereigntyof a foreign nation," so as to raise a federal question on that account. 115F. 3d, at 320. Finally, the court concluded that Marathon asserted claimsindependent of the Heimdal Agreement and that the case therefore didnot "relat[e] to" an international arbitration agreement under 9 U. S. C.$ 205. See 115 F. 3d, at 320-321.526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN582 RUHRGAS AG v. MARATHON OIL CO.Opinion of the Courtlimited to the question whether subject-matter jurisdictionexisted under 9 U. S. C. $ 205. See 522 U. S. 967 (1997).The Fifth Circuit, on its own motion, granted rehearing enbanc, thereby vacating the panel decision. See 129 F. 3d 746(1997). In a 9-to-7 decision, the en banc court held that, inremoved cases, district courts must decide issues of subjectmatter jurisdiction first, reaching issues of personal jurisdic-tion "only if subject-matter jurisdiction is found to exist."145 F. 3d, at 214. Noting Steel Co.'s instruction thatsubject-matter jurisdiction must be " `established as athreshold matter,' " 145 F. 3d, at 217 (quoting 523 U. S., at94), the Court of Appeals derived from that decision "counselagainst" recognition of judicial discretion to proceed directlyto personal jurisdiction. 145 F. 3d, at 218. The court limited its holding to removed cases; it perceived in those casesthe most grave threat that federal courts would "usur[p] . . .state courts' residual jurisdiction." Id., at 219.6Writing for the seven dissenters, Judge Higginbothamagreed that subject-matter jurisdiction ordinarily should beconsidered first. See id., at 231. If the challenge to personal jurisdiction involves no complex state-law questions,however, and is more readily resolved than the challenge tosubject-matter jurisdiction, the District Court, in the dis-senters' view, should take the easier route. See ibid.Judge Higginbotham regarded the District Court's decisiondismissing Marathon's case as illustrative and appropriate:While Ruhrgas' argument under 9 U. S. C. $ 205 presenteda difficult issue of first impression, its personal jurisdictionchallenge raised "[n]o substantial questions of purely statelaw," and "could be resolved relatively easily in [Ruhrgas']favor." 145 F. 3d, at 232-233.6 The Fifth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for it toconsider the "nove[l]" subject-matter jurisdiction issues presented. 145F. 3d 211, 225 (CA5 1998). The appeals court "express[ed] no opinion" onthe vacated panel decision which had held that the District Court lackedsubject-matter jurisdiction. Id., at 225, n. 23.526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN583Cite as: 526 U. S. 574 (1999)Opinion of the CourtWe granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1039 (1998), to resolve aconflict between the Circuits7 and now reverse.IIISteel Co. held that Article III generally requires a federalcourt to satisfy itself of its jurisdiction over the subject matter before it considers the merits of a case. "For a court topronounce upon [the merits] when it has no jurisdiction to doso," Steel Co. declared, "is . . . for a court to act ultra vires."523 U. S., at 101-102. The Fifth Circuit incorrectly readSteel Co. to teach that subject-matter jurisdiction must befound to exist, not only before a federal court reaches themerits, but also before personal jurisdiction is addressed.See 145 F. 3d, at 218.AThe Court of Appeals accorded priority to the requirementof subject-matter jurisdiction because it is nonwaivable anddelimits federal-court power, while restrictions on a court'sjurisdiction over the person are waivable and protect individual rights. See id., at 217-218. The character ofthe two jurisdictional bedrocks unquestionably differs.Subject-matter limitations on federal jurisdiction serve insti-tutional interests. They keep the federal courts within thebounds the Constitution and Congress have prescribed. Ac-cordingly, subject-matter delineations must be policed by thecourts on their own initiative even at the highest level. SeeSteel Co., 523 U. S., at 94-95; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3)("Whenever it appears . . . that the court lacks jurisdictionof the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.");28 U. S. C. $ 1447(c) (1994 ed., Supp. III) ("If at any time before final judgment [in a removed case] it appears that the7 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has concluded that districtcourts have discretion to dismiss a removed case for want of personaljurisdiction without reaching the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.See Cantor Fitzgerald, L.

MARATHON OIL CO.Opinion of the Courtdistrict court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shallbe remanded.").Personal jurisdiction, on the other hand, "represents a re-striction on judicial power . . . as a matter of individual liberty." Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702 (1982). Therefore, a partymay insist that the limitation be observed, or he may forgothat right, effectively consenting to the court's exercise ofadjudicatory authority. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(1)(defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person waivable);Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U. S., at 703 (same).These distinctions do not mean that subject-matter jurisdiction is ever and always the more "fundamental." Personal jurisdiction, too, is "an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district . . . court," without which the court is"powerless to proceed to an adjudication." Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374, 382 (1937). In thiscase, indeed, the impediment to subject-matter jurisdictionon which Marathon relies--lack of complete diversity--restson statutory interpretation, not constitutional command.Marathon joined an alien plaintiff (Norge) as well as an aliendefendant (Ruhrgas). If the joinder of Norge is legitimate,the complete diversity required by 28 U. S. C. $ 1332 (1994ed. and Supp. III), but not by Article III, see State FarmFire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967),is absent. In contrast, Ruhrgas relies on the constitutionalsafeguard of due process to stop the court from proceedingto the merits of the case. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland,456 U. S., at 702 ("The requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction flows . . . from the Due Process Clause.").While Steel Co. reasoned that subject-matter jurisdictionnecessarily precedes a ruling on the merits, the same principle does not dictate a sequencing of jurisdictional issues."[A] court that dismisses on . . . non-merits grounds suchas . . . personal jurisdiction, before finding subject-matterjurisdiction, makes no assumption of law-declaring power526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN585Cite as: 526 U. S. 574 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthat violates the separation of powers principles underlyingMansfield and Steel Company." In re Papandreou, 139F. 3d 247, 255 (CADC 1998). It is hardly novel for a federalcourt to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits. Thus, as the Court observedinSteel Co., district courts do not overstep Article III limitswhen they decline jurisdiction of state-law claims on discretionary grounds without determining whether those claimsfall within their pendent jurisdiction, see Moor v. Countyof Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 715-716 (1973), or abstain underYounger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), without decidingwhether the parties present a case or controversy, see Ellisv.Dyson, 421 U. S. 426, 433-434 (1975). See Steel Co., 523U. S., at 100-101, n. 3; cf. Arizonans for Official English v.Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 66-67 (1997) (pretermitting challengeto appellants' standing and dismissing on mootness grounds).BMaintaining that subject-matter jurisdiction must be de-cided first even when the litigation originates in federalcourt, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 21; Brief for Respondents 13, Mar-athon sees removal as the more offensive case, on the groundthat the dignity of state courts is immediately at stake. Ifa federal court dismisses a removed case for want of personaljurisdiction, that determination may preclude the partiesfrom relitigating the very same personal jurisdiction issue instate court. See Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men'sAssn., 283 U. S. 522, 524-527 (1931) (personal jurisdictionruling has issue-preclusive effect).Issue preclusion in subsequent state-court litigation, how-ever, may also attend a federal court's subject-matter determination. Ruhrgas hypothesizes, for example, a defendantwho removes on diversity grounds a state-court suit seeking$50,000 in compensatory and $1 million in punitive damagesfor breach of contract. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11. If thedistrict court determines that state law does not allow puni526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN586 RUHRGAS AG v.

C. $ 1332(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III)($75,000), the federal court's conclusion will travel back withthe case. Assuming a fair airing of the issue in federalcourt, that court's ruling on permissible state-law damagesmay bind the parties in state court, although it will set noprecedent otherwise governing state-court adjudications.SeeChicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308U. S. 371, 376 (1940) ("[Federal courts'] determinations of[whether they have jurisdiction to entertain a case] may notbe assailed collaterally."); Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 12, p. 115 (1980) ("When a court has rendered a judgment in a contested action, the judgment [ordinarily] precludes the parties from litigating the question of the court'ssubject matter jurisdiction in subsequent litigation."). Similarly, as Judge Higginbotham observed, our "dualistic . . .system of federal and state courts" allows federal courts tomake issue-preclusive rulings about state law in the exerciseof supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1367. 145F. 3d, at 231, and n. 7.Most essentially, federal and state courts are complementary systems for administering justice in our Nation. Cooperation and comity, not competition and conflict, are essentialto the federal design. A State's dignitary interest bearsconsideration when a district court exercises discretion in acase of this order. If personal jurisdiction raises "difficultquestions of [state] law," and subject-matter jurisdiction isresolved "as eas[ily]" as personal jurisdiction, a district courtwill ordinarily conclude that "federalism concerns tip thescales in favor of initially ruling on the motion to remand."Allen v. Ferguson, 791 F. 2d 611, 616 (CA7 1986). In othercases, however, the district court may find that concerns ofjudicial economy and restraint are overriding. See, e. g.,Asociacion Nacional de Pescadores v. Dow Quimica, 988F. 2d 559, 566-567 (CA5 1993) (if removal is nonfrivolous and526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN587Cite as: 526 U. S. 574 (1999)Opinion of the Courtpersonal jurisdiction turns on federal constitutional issues,"federal intrusion into state courts' authority . . . is minimized"). The federal design allows leeway for sensitivejudgments of this sort. " `Our Federalism' ""does not mean blind deference to `States' Rights' anymore than it means centralization of control over everyimportant issue in our National Government and itscourts. The Framers rejected both these courses.What the concept does represent is a system in whichthere is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of bothState and National Governments." Younger, 401 U. S.,at 44.The Fifth Circuit and Marathon posit that state-court de-fendants will abuse the federal system with opportunistic removals. A discretionary rule, they suggest, will encouragemanufactured, convoluted federal subject-matter theoriesdesigned to wrench cases from state court. See 145 F. 3d,at 219; Brief for Respondents 28-29. This specter of unwarranted removal, we have recently observed, "rests on an as-sumption we do not indulge--that district courts generallywill not comprehend, or will balk at applying, the rules onremoval Congress has prescribed. . . . The well-adviseddefendant . . . will foresee the likely outcome of an unwar-ranted removal--a swift and nonreviewable remand order,see 28 U. S. C. $$ 1447(c), (d), attended by the displeasure of adistrict court whose authority has been improperly invoked."Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 77-78 (1996).CIn accord with Judge Higginbotham, we recognize that inmost instances subject-matter jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry. See 145 F. 3d, at 229 ("engag[ing]" subject-matter jurisdiction "at the outset of a case . . . [is] often . . .the most efficient way of going"). In such cases, both expe-dition and sensitivity to state courts' coequal stature should526US2 Unit: $U57 [12-11-00 20:46:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN588 RUHRGAS AG v.

Peaslee, 88 F. 3d 152, 155 (CA21996) (a court disposing of a case on personal jurisdictiongrounds "should be convinced that the challenge to thecourt's subject-matter jurisdiction is not easily resolved").Where, as here, however, a district court has before it astraightforward personal jurisdiction issue presenting nocomplex question of state law, and the alleged defect insubject-matter jurisdiction raises a difficult and novel ques-tion, the court does not abuse its discretion by turning directly to personal jurisdiction.8* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.8 Ruhrgas suggests that it would be appropriate simply to affirm theDistrict Court's holding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Ruhrgas.See Brief for Petitioner 38-39, and n. 20.

Argued March 24, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999While executing a warrant to arrest petitioners' son in their home, respondents, deputy federal marshals and local sheriff's deputies, inviteda newspaper reporter and a photographer to accompany them. Thewarrant made no mention of such a "media ride-along." The officers'early morning entry into the home prompted a confrontation with petitioners, and a protective sweep revealed that the son was not in thehouse. The reporters observed and photographed the incident butwere not involved in the execution of the warrant. Their newspapernever published the photographs they took of the incident. Petitionerssued the officers in their personal capacities for money damages underBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (the federal marshals), and 42 U. S.

LAYNESyllabus(b) It violates the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners for police to bring members of the media or other third parties into their homeduring the execution of a warrant when the presence of the third partiesin the home was not in aid of the warrant's execution. The Amendmentembodies centuries-old principles of respect for the privacy of the home,which apply where, as here, police enter a home under the authority ofan arrest warrant in order to take into custody the suspect named inthe warrant, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 602-604. It does notnecessarily follow from the fact that the officers were entitled to enterpetitioners' home that they were entitled to bring a reporter and a photographer with them. The Fourth Amendment requires that policeactions in execution of a warrant be related to the objectives of theauthorized intrusion. See, e. g., Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 325.Certainly the presence of the reporters, who did not engage in the execution of the warrant or assist the police in their task, was not relatedto the objective of the authorized intrusion, the apprehension of petitioners' son. Taken in their entirety, the reasons advanced by respondents to support the reporters' presence--publicizing the government'sefforts to combat crime, facilitating accurate reporting on law enforcement activities, minimizing police abuses, and protecting suspects andthe officers--fall short of justifying media ride-alongs. Although thepresence of third parties during the execution of a warrant may in somecircumstances be constitutionally permissible, the presence of thesethird parties was not. Pp. 609-614.(c) Petitioners' Fourth Amendment right was not clearly establishedat the time of the search. "Clearly established" for qualified immunitypurposes means that the contours of the right must be sufficiently clearthat a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. His very action need not previously have been heldunlawful, but in the light of pre-existing law its unlawfulness must beapparent. E. g., Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. It was notunreasonable for a police officer at the time at issue to have believedthat bringing media observers along during the execution of an arrestwarrant (even in a home) was lawful. First, the constitutional questionpresented by this case is by no means open and shut. Accurate mediacoverage of police activities serves an important public purpose, and itis not obvious from the Fourth Amendment's general principles that theofficers' conduct in this case violated the Amendment. Second, petitioners have not cited any cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the time in question which clearly established the rule on whichthey seek to rely, nor have they identified a consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed thathis actions were lawful. Finally, the federal marshals in this case relied526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN605Cite as: 526 U.

LAYNEOpinion of the Courtof the law was not clearly established at the time the searchin this case took place, the officers are entitled to the defenseof qualified immunity. IIn early 1992, the Attorney General of the United Statesapproved "Operation Gunsmoke," a special national fugitiveapprehension program in which United States Marshalsworked with state and local police to apprehend dangerouscriminals. The "Operation Gunsmoke" policy statement ex-plained that the operation was to concentrate on "armed individuals wanted on federal and/or state and local warrantsfor serious drug and other violent felonies." App. 15. Thiseffective program ultimately resulted in over 3,000 arrestsin 40 metropolitan areas. Brief for Federal RespondentsLayne et al. 2.One of the dangerous fugitives identified as a target of"Operation Gunsmoke" was Dominic Wilson, the son of peti-tioners Charles and Geraldine Wilson. Dominic Wilson hadviolated his probation on previous felony charges of robbery,theft, and assault with intent to rob, and the police computerlisted "caution indicators" that he was likely to be armed, toresist arrest, and to "assaul[t] police." App. 40. The computer also listed his address as 909 North StoneStreet Avenue in Rockville, Maryland. Unknown to the police, thiswas actually the home of petitioners, Dominic Wilson's parents. Thus, in April 1992, the Circuit Court for Montgom-ery County issued three arrest warrants for Dominic Wilson,one for each of his probation violations. The warrants wereeach addressed to "any duly authorized peace officer," andcommanded such officers to arrest him and bring him "imme-diately" before the Circuit Court to answer an indictment asto his probation violation. The warrants made no mentionof media presence or assistance.11 The warrants were identical in all relevant respects. By way of example, one of them read as follows:526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN607Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the CourtIn the early morning hours of April 16, 1992, a Gunsmoketeam of Deputy United States Marshals and MontgomeryCounty Police officers assembled to execute the Dominic Wilson warrants. The team was accompanied by a reporter anda photographer from the Washington Post, who had been invited by the Marshals to accompany them on their missionas part of a Marshals Service ride-along policy.At around 6:45 a.m., the officers, with media representatives in tow, entered the dwelling at 909 North StoneStreetAvenue in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Rockville.Petitioners Charles and Geraldine Wilson were still in bedwhen they heard the officers enter the home. PetitionerCharles Wilson, dressed only in a pair of briefs, ran into theliving room to investigate. Discovering at least five men instreet clothes with guns in his living room, he angrily demanded that they state their business, and repeatedly cursedthe officers. Believing him to be an angry Dominic Wilson,the officers quickly subdued him on the floor. GeraldineWilson next entered the living room to investigate, wearingonly a nightgown. She observed her husband being restrained by the armed officers.When their protective sweep was completed, the officerslearned that Dominic Wilson was not in the house, and theydeparted. During the time that the officers were in thehome, the Washington Post photographer took numerous pictures. The print reporter was also apparently in the livingroom observing the confrontation between the police and"The State of Maryland, to any duly authorized peace officer, greeting:you are hereby commanded to take Dominic Jerome Wilson if he/she shallbe found in your bailiwick, and have him immediately before the CircuitCourt for Montgomery County, now in session, at the Judicial Center, inRockville, to answer an indictment, or information, or criminal appealsunto the State of Maryland, of and concerning a certain charge of Robbery[Violation of Probation] by him committed, as hath been presented, and soforth.

At no time, however, were the reportersinvolved in the execution of the arrest warrant. Brief forFederal Respondents Layne et al. 4. The Washington Postnever published its photographs of the incident.Petitioners sued the law enforcement officials in their personal capacities for money damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971) (the U. S.Marshals Service respondents), and Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983 (the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Department respondents). They contended that the officers' actions in bringing members of the media to observe and record the attempted execution of the arrest warrant violatedtheir Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court deniedrespondents' motion for summary judgment on the basis ofqualified immunity.On interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals, a dividedpanel reversed and held that respondents were entitled toqualified immunity. The case was twice reheard en banc,where a divided Court of Appeals again upheld the defenseof qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals declined to decide whether the actions of the police violated the FourthAmendment. It concluded instead that because no courthad held (at the time of the search) that media presence during a police entry into a residence violated the FourthAmendment, the right allegedly violated by respondents wasnot "clearly established" and thus qualified immunity wasproper. 141 F. 3d 111 (CA4 1998). Five judges dissented,arguing that the officers' actions did violate the FourthAmendment, and that the clearly established protections ofthe Fourth Amendment were violated in this case.

S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the CourtIIPetitioners sued the federal officials under Bivens andthe state officials under $ 1983. BothBivens and $ 1983allow a plaintiff to seek money damages from governmentofficials who have violated his Fourth Amendment rights.See $ 1983; Bivens, supra, at 397. But government officialsperforming discretionary functions generally are granted aqualified immunity and are "shielded from liability for civildamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a rea-sonable person would have known."Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).Although this case involves suits under both $ 1983 andBivens, the qualified immunity analysis is identical undereither cause of action. See,e. g., Graham v. Connor, 490U. S. 386, 394, n. 9 (1989); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340,n. 2 (1986). A court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity"must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged thedeprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so,proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation." Conn v. Gabbert, ante, at 290. This order of procedure is designed to"spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability, but unwar-ranted demands customarily imposed upon those defendinga long drawn out lawsuit." Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226,232 (1991). Deciding the constitutional question before ad-dressing the qualified immunity question also promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefitof both the officers and the general public. SeeCounty ofSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 840-842, n. 5 (1998). Wenow turn to the Fourth Amendment question.In 1604, an English court made the now-famous observa-tion that "the house of every one is to him as his castle andfortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence,as for his repose." Semayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN610 WILSON v. LAYNEOpinion of the CourtEng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B.). In his Commentaries on theLaws of England, William Blackstone noted that"the law of England has so particular and tender a re-gard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles ithis castle, and will never suffer it to be violated withimpunity: agreeing herein with the sentiments of antientRome . . . . For this reason no doors can in generalbe broken open to execute any civil process; though,in criminal causes, the public safety supersedes theprivate." 4 Commentaries 223 (1765-1769).The Fourth Amendment embodies this centuries-old princi-ple of respect for the privacy of the home: "The right of thepeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and ef-fects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall notbe violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probablecause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly de-scribing the place to be searched, and the persons or thingsto be seized." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4 (emphasis added). SeealsoUnited States v. United States Dist. Court for EasternDist. of Mich., 407 U. S. 297, 313 (1972) ("[P]hysical entry ofthe home is the chief evil against which the wording of theFourth Amendment is directed").Our decisions have applied these basic principles of theFourth Amendment to situations, like the one in this case, inwhich police enter a home under the authority of an arrestwarrant in order to take into custody the suspect named inthe warrant. In Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 602(1980), we noted that although clear in its protection of thehome, the common-law tradition at the time of the draftingof the Fourth Amendment was ambivalent on the questionwhether police could enter a home without a warrant. Wewere ultimately persuaded that the "overriding respectfor the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in ourtraditions since the origins of the Republic" meant that absent a warrant or exigent circumstances, police could not526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN611Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the Courtenter a home to make an arrest. Id., at 601, 603-604. Wedecided that "an arrest warrant founded on probable causeimplicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter adwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason tobelieve the suspect is within." Id., at 603.Here, of course, the officers had such a warrant, and theywere undoubtedly entitled to enter the Wilson home in orderto execute the arrest warrant for Dominic Wilson. But itdoes not necessarily follow that they were entitled to bringa newspaper reporter and a photographer with them. InHorton v. California, 496 U. S. 128, 140 (1990), we held "[i]fthe scope of the search exceeds that permitted by the termsof a validly issued warrant or the character of the relevantexception from the warrant requirement, the subsequent seizure is unconstitutional without more." While this does notmean that every police action while inside a home must beexplicitly authorized by the text of the warrant, see Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705 (1981) (Fourth Amendment allows temporary detainer of homeowner while policesearch the home pursuant to warrant), the Fourth Amendment does require that police actions in execution of a warrant be related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion,see Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 325 (1987). See alsoMaryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 87 (1987) ("[T]he purposes justifying a police search strictly limit the permissibleextent of the search").Certainly the presence of reporters inside the home wasnot related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion.Respondents concede that the reporters did not engage inthe execution of the warrant, and did not assist the police intheir task. The reporters therefore were not present forany reason related to the justification for police entry intothe home--the apprehension of Dominic Wilson.This is not a case in which the presence of the third partiesdirectly aided in the execution of the warrant. Where thepolice enter a home under the authority of a warrant to526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN612 WILSON v. LAYNEOpinion of the Courtsearch for stolen property, the presence of third parties forthe purpose of identifying the stolen property has long beenapproved by this Court and our common-law tradition. See,e. g., Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, 1067 (K. B.1765) (in search for stolen goods case, " `[t]he owner mustswear that the goods are lodged in such a place. He mustattend at the execution of the warrant to shew them to theofficer, who must see that they answer the description")(quoted with approval inBoyd v. United States, 116 U. S.616, 628 (1886)).Respondents argue that the presence of the WashingtonPost reporters in the Wilsons' home nonetheless served anumber of legitimate law enforcement purposes. They firstassert that officers should be able to exercise reasonable discretion about when it would "further their law enforcementmission to permit members of the news media to accompanythem in executing a warrant." Brief for Federal Respondents Layne et al. 15. But this claim ignores the importanceof the right of residential privacy at the core of the FourthAmendment. It may well be that media ride-alongs furtherthe law enforcement objectives of the police in a generalsense, but that is not the same as furthering the purposes ofthe search. Were such generalized "law enforcement objectives" themselves sufficient to trump the Fourth Amendment, the protections guaranteed by that Amendment's textwould be significantly watered down.Respondents next argue that the presence of third partiescould serve the law enforcement purpose of publicizing thegovernment's efforts to combat crime, and facilitate accuratereporting on law enforcement activities. There is certainlylanguage in our opinions interpreting the First Amendmentwhich points to the importance of "the press" in informingthe general public about the administration of criminal justice. In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 491-492 (1975), for example, we said "in a society in which eachindividual has but limited time and resources with which to526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN613Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the Courtobserve at first hand the operations of his government, herelies necessarily upon the press to bring to him in convenient form the facts of those operations." See also RichmondNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U. S. 555, 572-573 (1980).No one could gainsay the truth of these observations, or theimportance of the First Amendment in protecting press free-dom from abridgment by the government. But the FourthAmendment also protects a very important right, and in thepresent case it is in terms of that right that the media ridealongs must be judged.Surely the possibility of good public relations for the policeis simply not enough, standing alone, to justify the ride-alongintrusion into a private home. And even the need for accurate reporting on police issues in general bears no direct relation to the constitutional justification for the police intrusion into a home in order to execute a felony arrest warrant.Finally, respondents argue that the presence of third parties could serve in some situations to minimize police abusesand protect suspects, and also to protect the safety of theofficers. While it might be reasonable for police officers tothemselves videotape home entries as part of a "quality control" effort to ensure that the rights of homeowners arebeing respected, or even to preserve evidence, cf. Ohio v.Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 35 (1996) (noting the use of a"mounted video camera" to record the details of a routinetraffic stop), such a situation is significantly different fromthe media presence in this case. The Washington Post reporters in the Wilsons' home were working on a story fortheir own purposes. They were not present for the purposeof protecting the officers, much less the Wilsons. A privatephotographer was acting for private purposes, as evidencedin part by the fact that the newspaper and not the policeretained the photographs. Thus, although the presence ofthird parties during the execution of a warrant may in somecircumstances be constitutionally permissible, see supra, at611-612, the presence of these third parties was not.526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN614 WILSON v. LAYNEOpinion of the CourtThe reasons advanced by respondents, taken in their en-tirety, fall short of justifying the presence of media inside ahome. We hold that it is a violation of the Fourth Amend-ment for police to bring members of the media or other thirdparties into a home during the execution of a warrant whenthe presence of the third parties in the home was not in aidof the execution of the warrant.2IIISince the police action in this case violated petitioners'Fourth Amendment right, we now must decide whether thisright was clearly established at the time of the search. SeeSiegert, 500 U. S., at 232-233. As noted above, Part II,supra, government officials performing discretionary func-tions generally are granted a qualified immunity and are"shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown."Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 818. Whatthis means in practice is that "whether an official protectedby qualified immunity may be held personally liable for anallegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the `objective legal reasonableness' of the action, assessed in lightof the legal rules that were `clearly established' at the timeit was taken." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639(1987) (citingHarlow, supra, at 819); see also Graham v.Connor, 490 U. S., at 397.In Anderson, we explained that what "clearly established"means in this context depends largely "upon the level of generality at which the relevant `legal rule' is to be identified."483 U. S., at 639. "[C]learly established" for purposes of2 Even though such actions might violate the Fourth Amendment, if thepolice are lawfully present, the violation of the Fourth Amendment is thepresence of the media and not the presence of the police in the home. Wehave no occasion here to decide whether the exclusionary rule would applyto any evidence discovered or developed by the media representatives.526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN615Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the Courtqualified immunity means that "[t]he contours of the rightmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. This isnot to say that an official action is protected by qualifiedimmunity unless the very action in question has previouslybeen held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent."Id., at640 (citations omitted); see also United States v. Lanier, 520U. S. 259, 270 (1997).It could plausibly be asserted that any violation ofthe Fourth Amendment is "clearly established," since itis clearly established that the protections of the FourthAmendment apply to the actions of police. Some variationof this theory of qualified immunity is urged upon us by petitioners, Brief for Petitioners 37, and seems to have been atthe core of the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals,see 141 F. 3d, at 123. However, as we explained in Anderson, the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if itwas clearly established. 483 U. S., at 641. In this case, theappropriate question is the objective inquiry whether a reasonable officer could have believed that bringing members ofthe media into a home during the execution of an arrest warrant was lawful, in light of clearly established law and theinformation the officers possessed. Cf. ibid.We hold that it was not unreasonable for a police officer inApril 1992 to have believed that bringing media observersalong during the execution of an arrest warrant (even in ahome) was lawful. First, the constitutional question presented by this case is by no means open and shut. TheFourth Amendment protects the rights of homeowners fromentry without a warrant, but there was a warrant here. Thequestion is whether the invitation to the media exceeded thescope of the search authorized by the warrant. Accuratemedia coverage of police activities serves an important public purpose, and it is not obvious from the general principles526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN616 WILSON v. LAYNEOpinion of the Courtof the Fourth Amendment that the conduct of the officers inthis case violated the Amendment.Second, although media ride-alongs of one sort or anotherhad apparently become a common police practice,3 in 1992there were no judicial opinions holding that this practice be-came unlawful when it entered a home. The only publisheddecision directly on point was a state intermediate court de-cision which, though it did not engage in an extensive FourthAmendment analysis, nonetheless held that such conduct wasnot unreasonable.Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d 130, 154-155, 295 N. W. 2d 768, 782 (App. 1980). From the federalcourts, the parties have only identified two unpublished Dis-trict Court decisions dealing with media entry into homes,each of which upheld the search on unorthodox non-FourthAmendment right to privacy theories.Moncrief v. Hanton,10 Media L. Rptr. 1620 (ND Ohio 1984); Higbee v. TimesAdvocate, 5 Media L. Rptr. 2372 (SD Cal. 1980). Thesecases, of course, cannot "clearly establish" that media entryinto homes during a police ride-along violates the FourthAmendment.At a slightly higher level of generality, petitioners point toBills v. Aseltine, 958 F. 2d 697 (CA6 1992), in which theCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that there werematerial issues of fact precluding summary judgment on thequestion whether police exceeded the scope of a search warrant by allowing a private security guard to participate inthe search to identify stolen property other than that described in the warrant. Id., at 709. Bills, which was de-cided a mere five weeks before the events of this case, didanticipate today's holding that police may not bring alongthird parties during an entry into a private home pursuant3 See, e. g., Florida Publishing Co. v. Fletcher, 340 So. 2d 914, 919 (1976)(it " `is a widespread practice of long-standing' " for media to accompanyofficers into homes), cert. denied, 431 U. S. 930 (1977); Zoglin, Live on theVice Beat, Time, Dec. 22, 1986, p. 60 (noting "the increasingly commonpractice of letting TV crews tag along on drug raids").526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN617Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of the Courtto a warrant for purposes unrelated to those justifying thewarrant. Id., at 706. However, we cannot say that even inlight of Bills, the law on third-party entry into homes wasclearly established in April 1992. Petitioners have notbrought to our attention any cases of controlling authorityin their jurisdiction at the time of the incident that clearlyestablished the rule on which they seek to rely, nor havethey identified a consensus of cases of persuasive authoritysuch that a reasonable officer could not have believed thathis actions were lawful.Finally, important to our conclusion was the reliance bythe United States marshals in this case on a Marshals Service ride-along policy that explicitly contemplated that mediawho engaged in ride-alongs might enter private homes withtheir cameras as part of fugitive apprehension arrests.4 TheMontgomery County Sheriff 's Department also at this timehad a ride-along program that did not expressly prohibitmedia entry into private homes. Deposition of Sheriff Raymond M. Kight, in No. PJM-94-1718, p. 8. Such a policy, ofcourse, could not make reasonable a belief that was contraryto a decided body of case law. But here the state of the lawas to third parties accompanying police on home entries wasat best undeveloped, and it was not unreasonable for lawenforcement officers to look and rely on their formal ridealong policies.Given such an undeveloped state of the law, the officers inthis case cannot have been "expected to predict the futurecourse of constitutional law."Procunier v. Navarette, 4344 A booklet distributed to marshals recommended that "fugitive apprehension cases . . . normally offer the best possibilities for ride-alongs."App. 4-5. In its discussion of the best way to make ride-alongs useful tothe media and portray the Marshals Service in a favorable light, the booklet noted that reporters were likely to want to be able to shoot "goodaction footage, not just a mop-up scene." It advised agents that "[i]f thearrest is planned to take place inside a house or building, agree ahead oftime on when the camera can enter and who will give the signal."

Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 557 (1967).Between the time of the events of this case and today's decision, a split among the Federal Circuits in fact developedon the question whether media ride-alongs that enter homessubject the police to money damages. See 141 F. 3d, at 118-119; Ayeni v. Mottola, 35 F. 3d 680 (CA2 1994), cert. denied,514 U. S. 1062 (1995); Parker v. Boyer, 93 F. 3d 445 (CA81996), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 1148 (1997); Berger v. Hanlon,129 F. 3d 505 (CA9 1997), cert. granted, 525 U. S. 981 (1998).If judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losingside of the controversy.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.Like every other federal appellate judge who has addressed the question, I share the Court's opinion that it violates the Fourth Amendment for police to bring members ofthe media or other third parties into a private dwelling during the execution of a warrant unless the homeowner hasconsented or the presence of the third parties is in aid of theexecution of the warrant. I therefore join Parts I and II ofthe Court's opinion.In my view, however, the homeowner's right to protectionagainst this type of trespass was clearly established long before April 16, 1992. My sincere respect for the competenceof the typical member of the law enforcement profession precludes my assent to the suggestion that "a reasonable officercould have believed that bringing members of the media intoa home during the execution of an arrest warrant was lawful." Ante, at 615. I therefore disagree with the Court's526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN619Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.resolution of the conflict in the Circuits on the qualified immunity issue.1 The clarity of the constitutional rule, a federal statute (18 U. S. C. $ 3105), common-law decisions, andthe testimony of the senior law enforcement officer all support my position that it has long been clearly establishedthat officers may not bring third parties into private homesto witness the execution of a warrant. By contrast, theCourt's opposing view finds support in the following sources:its bare assertion that the constitutional question "is by nomeans open and shut," ante, at 615; three judicial opinionsthat did not directly address the constitutional question,ante, at 616; and a public relations booklet prepared by someone in the United States Marshals Service that never mentions allowing representatives of the media to enter privateproperty without the owner's consent, ante, at 617.IIn its decision today the Court has not announced a newrule of constitutional law. Rather, it has refused to recognize an entirely unprecedented request for an exception to awell-established principle. Police action in the execution ofa warrant must be strictly limited to the objectives of theauthorized intrusion. That principle, like the broader protection provided by the Fourth Amendment itself, represents the confluence of two important sources: our Englishforefathers' traditional respect for the sanctity of the private1 It is important to emphasize that there is no split in Circuit authority on the merits of the constitutional issue. Nor, as I explain infra, at622-624, do I believe that any District Court had reached a conclusion atodds with the Court's Fourth Amendment holding. Any conflict was limited to the qualified immunity issue. Three Circuits rejected the defensewhereas the Fourth and the Eighth accepted it. See Ayeni v. Mottola,35 F. 3d 680, 686 (CA2 1994); Bills v. Aseltine, 958 F. 2d 697 (CA6 1992);Berger v. Hanlon, 129 F. 3d 505 (CA9 1997); 141 F. 3d 111 (CA4 1998)(en banc); Parker v.

LAYNEOpinion of Stevens, J.home and the American colonists' hatred of the generalwarrant.The contours of the rule are fairly described by the Court,ante, at 609-611 of its opinion, and in the cases that it citeson those pages. All of those cases were decided before 1992.None of those cases--nor, indeed, any other of which I amaware--identified any exception to the rule of law that theCourt repeats today. In fact, the Court's opinion fails toidentify a colorable rationale for any such exception. Respondents' position on the merits consisted entirely of theirunpersuasive factual submission that the presence of representatives of the news media served various legitimate--albeit nebulous--law enforcement purposes. The Court'scogent rejection of those post hoc rationalizations cannotbe characterized as the announcement of a new rule of law.During my service on the Court, I have heard lawyersargue scores of cases raising Fourth Amendment issues.Generally speaking, the Members of the Court have beensensitive to the needs of the law enforcement community.In virtually all of them at least one Justice thought that thepolice conduct was reasonable. In fact, in only a handful didthe Court unanimously find a Fourth Amendment violation.That the Court today speaks with a single voice on the merits of the constitutional question is unusual and certainlylends support to the notion that the question is indeed "openand shut." Ante, at 615.But the more important basis for my opinion is that itshould have been perfectly obvious to the officers that their"invitation to the media exceeded the scope of the searchauthorized by the warrant." Ibid. Despite reaffirmingthat clear rule, the Court nonetheless finds that the merepresence of a warrant rendered the officers' conduct reasonable. The Court fails to cite a single case that even arguablysupports the proposition that using official power to enablenews photographers and reporters to enter a private homefor purposes unrelated to the execution of a warrant could526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 526 U. S. 603 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.be regarded as a "reasonable" invasion of either propertyor privacy.IIThe absence of judicial opinions expressly holding that police violate the Fourth Amendment if they bring media representatives into private homes provides scant support forthe conclusion that in 1992 a competent officer could reasonably believe that it would be lawful to do so. Prior to ourdecision in United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259 (1997), nojudicial opinion specifically held that it was unconstitutionalfor a state judge to use his official power to extort sexualfavors from a potential litigant. Yet, we unanimously concluded that the defendant had fair warning that he was violating his victim's constitutional rights. Id., at 271 ("Theeasiest cases don't even arise" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).Nor am I persuaded that the absence of rulings on theprecise Fourth Amendment issue presented in this case canplausibly be explained by the assumption that the policepractice was common. I assume that the practice of allowing media personnel to "ride along" with police officers wascommon, but that does not mean that the officers routinelyallowed the media to enter homes without the consent of theowners. As the Florida Supreme Court noted in FloridaPublishing Co. v. Fletcher, 340 So. 2d 914, 918 (1976), therehas long been a widespread practice for firefighters to allowphotographers to enter disaster areas to take pictures, forexample, of the interior of buildings severely damaged byfire. But its conclusion that such media personnel were nottrespassers rested on a doctrine of implied consent 2--a the2 The Florida Supreme Court held:"The trial court properly determined from the record before it that therewas no genuine issue of material fact insofar as the entry into respondent'shome by petitioner's employees became lawful and non-actionable pursu526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN622 WILSON v. LAYNEOpinion of Stevens, J.ory wholly inapplicable to forcible entries in connection withthe execution of a warrant.3In addition to this case, the Court points to three lowercourt opinions--none of which addresses the Fourth Amendment--as the ostensible basis for a reasonable officer's beliefthat the rule in Semayne's Case 4 was ripe for reevaluation.5See ante, at 616. Two of the cases were decided in 1980 andthe third in 1984. In view of the clear restatement of therule in the later opinions of this Court, cited ante, at 611,those three earlier decisions could not possibly provide aant to the doctrine of common custom, usage, and practice and since it hadbeen shown that it was common usage, custom and practice for news mediato enter private premises and homes under the circumstances presenthere.. . . . ." `The fire was a disaster of great public interest . . . . [I]t has been alongstanding custom and practice throughout the country for representatives of the news media to enter upon private property where disaster ofgreat public interest has occurred.' " 340 So. 2d, at 917-918.The Court's reference to this case, ante, at 616, n. 3, misleadingly suggests that the "widespread practice" referred to in the Florida court'sopinion was police practice; it was not.3 Indeed, the Wisconsin state-court decision, cited by the Court as contrary authority, took pains to distinguish this case:"We will not imply a consent as a matter of law. It is of course wellknown that news representatives want to enter a private building afteror even during a newsworthy event within the building. That knowledgeis no basis for an implied consent by the possessor of the building to theentry. . . . We conclude that custom and usage have not been shown in factor law to confer an implied consent upon news representatives to enter abuilding under the circumstances presented by this case." Prahl v.

Hanton, 10 Media L. Rptr. 1620 (ND Ohio 1984);Higbee v. Times-Advocate, 5 Media L. Rptr. 2372 (SD Cal.1980). As for the other case, Prahl v. Brosamle, 98 Wis. 2d130, 295 N. W. 2d 768 (App. 1980)--cited by the Court,ante,at 616, for the proposition that the officer's conduct was "notunreasonable"--it actually held that the defendants' motionto dismiss should have been denied because the allegationssupported the conclusion that the officer committed a tres-pass when he allowed a third party to enter the plaintiff 'sproperty.7 Since that conclusion was fully consistent with a6 In the Fourth Circuit, unreported opinions may not be considered inthe course of determining qualified immunity.

IIIThe most disturbing aspect of the Court's ruling on thequalified immunity issue is its reliance on a document discussing "ride-alongs" apparently prepared by an employee inthe public relations office of the United States MarshalsService. The text of the document, portions of which areset out in an appendix, makes it quite clear that its authorwas not a lawyer, but rather a person concerned with devel-oping the proper public image of the Service, with a specialinterest in creating a favorable impression with the Congress. Although the document occupies 14 pages in the joint138, 295 N. W. 2d, at 774.

Id., at 7.It does not, however, purport to give any guidance to themarshals regarding when such a signal should be given,whether it should ever be given without the consent of thehomeowner, or indeed on how to carry out any part of theirlaw enforcement mission. The notion that any member ofthat well-trained cadre of professionals would rely on such adocument for guidance in the performance of dangerous lawenforcement assignments is too farfetched to merit seriousconsideration.* * *The defense of qualified immunity exists to protect reasonable officers from personal liability for official actions laterfound to be in violation of constitutional rights that were notclearly established. The conduct in this case, as the Courtitself reminds us, contravened the Fourth Amendment's coreprotection of the home.

S. Marshals Service, like all federal agencies, ultimately serves the needs and interests of the American public526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 WILSON v. LAYNEAppendix to opinion of Stevens, J.when it accomplishes its designated duties. Keeping thepublic adequately informed of what the Service does can beviewed as a duty in its own right, and we depend on thenews media to accomplish that."Media `ride-alongs' are one effective method to promote anaccurate picture of Deputy Marshals at work. Ride-alongs,as the name implies, are simply opportunities for reportersand camera crews to go along with Deputies on operationalmissions so they can see, and record, what actually happens.The result is usually a very graphic and dynamic look at theoperational activities of the Marshals Service, which is sub-sequently aired on TV or printed in a newspaper, magazine,or book."However, successful ride-alongs don't just `happen' in aspontaneous fashion. They require careful planning and attention to detail to ensure that all goes smoothly and thatthe media receive an accurate picture of how the MarshalsService operates. This booklet describes considerationsthat are important in nearly every ride-along." App. 4."Establish Ground Rules"Another good idea--actually, it's an essential one--is to es-tablish ground rules at the start and convey them to thereporter and camera person. Address such things as whatcan be covered with cameras and when, any privacy restrictions that may be encountered, and interview guidelines."Emphasize the need for safety considerations and explainany dangers that might be involved. Make the ground rulesrealistic but balanced--remember, the media will want goodaction footage, not just a mop-up scene. If the arrest isplanned to take place inside a house or building, agree aheadof time on when the camera can enter and who will give thesignal." Id., at 7."The very best planning won't result in a good ride-along ifthe Marshals Service personnel involved do not do their part.It's a case of actions speaking as loudly as words, and both526US3 Unit: $U59 [12-11-00 20:56:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 526 U.

This is accomplished when Deputies caneasily be recognized as USMS Deputies because they arewearing raid jackets, prominently displaying their badges,or exhibiting other easily identifiable marks of the Service.We want the public to know who you are and what kind ofjob you do. That is one of the goals of the ride-along. Sohaving Deputy Marshals easily identified as such on camerais not just a whim--it's important to the overall success ofthe ride-along."Of course, how the Deputies act and what they say is alsocrucial. During the ride-along virtually any statementmade by Deputies just might end up as a quote, attributedto the person who made it. Sometimes that could prove embarrassing. A Deputy must try to visualize what his or herwords will look like in a newspaper or sound like on TV.Being pleasant and professional at all times is key, and thatincludes not being drawn into statements of personal opinionor inappropriate comments. Using common sense is therule."Id., at 9-10."You also need to find out when the coverage will air or endup in print. Ask the reporter if he or she can keep youinformed on that matter. You might `grease the skids' forthis by offering the reporter, camera person, or other mediarepresentatives involved a memento of the Marshals Service.Marshals Service caps, mugs, T-shirts, and the like can helpestablish a rapport with a reporter that can benefit you inthe future." Id., at 12."Getting to the Final Product"Naturally, it's important to see the final product of the ride-along when it airs on TV or appears in the newspaper.

MONROECOUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATIONet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuitNo. 97-843. Argued January 12, 1999--Decided May 24, 1999Petitioner filed suit against respondents, a county school board (Board)and school officials, seeking damages for the sexual harassment of herdaughter LaShonda by G. F., a fifth-grade classmate at a public elementary school. Among other things, petitioner alleged that respondents'deliberate indifference to G. F.'s persistent sexual advances towardLaShonda created an intimidating, hostile, offensive, and abusive schoolenvironment that violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of1972, which, in relevant part, prohibits a student from being "excludedfrom participation in, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or be[ing] subjectedto discrimination under any education program or activity receivingFederal financial assistance," 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). In granting respondents' motion to dismiss, the Federal District Court found that "studenton-student," or peer, harassment provides no ground for a Title IXprivate cause of action for damages. The en banc Eleventh Circuitaffirmed.Held:1. A private Title IX damages action may lie against a school boardin cases of student-on-student harassment, but only where the fundingrecipient is deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which therecipient has actual knowledge, and that harassment is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victimsof access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by theschool. Pp. 638-653.(a) An implied private right of action for money damages existsunder Title IX, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S.60, where funding recipients had adequate notice that they could beliable for the conduct at issue, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17, but a recipient is liable only for its ownmisconduct. Here, petitioner attempts to hold the Board liable for itsown decision to remain idle in the face of known student-on-studentharassment in its schools. The standard set out in Gebser v. Lago VistaIndependent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274--that a school district may beliable for damages under Title IX where it is deliberately indifferent toknown acts of teacher-student sexual harassment--also applies in cases526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Syllabusof student-on-student harassment. Initially, in Gebser, this Court expressly rejected the use of agency principles to impute liability to thedistrict for the acts of its teachers. Id., at 283. Additionally, Title IX'sregulatory scheme has long provided funding recipients with notice thatthey may be liable for their failure to respond to nonagents' discriminatory acts. The common law has also put schools on notice that theymay be held responsible under state law for failing to protect studentsfrom third parties' tortious acts. Of course, the harasser's identity isnot irrelevant. Deliberate indifference makes sense as a direct liabilitytheory only where the recipient has the authority to take remedial action, and Title IX's language itself narrowly circumscribes the circumstances giving rise to damages liability under the statute. If a recipientdoes not engage in harassment directly, it may not be liable for damagesunless its deliberate indifference "subject[s]" its students to harassment,i. e., at a minimum, causes students to undergo harassment or makesthem liable or vulnerable to it. Moreover, because the harassmentmust occur "under" "the operations of" a recipient, 20 U. S. C. $$ 1681(a),1687, the harassment must take place in a context subject to the schooldistrict's control. These factors combine to limit a recipient's damagesliability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantialcontrol over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs. Where, as here, the misconduct occurs during schoolhours on school grounds, misconduct is taking place "under" an "operation" of the recipient. In these circumstances, the recipient retains substantial control over the context in which the harassment occurs. Moreimportantly, in this setting, the Board exercises significant control overthe harasser, for it has disciplinary authority over its students. At thetime of the events here, a publication for school attorneys and administrators indicated that student-on-student harassment could trigger TitleIX liability, and subsequent Department of Education policy guidelinesprovide that such harassment falls within Title IX's scope. Contraryto contentions of respondents and the dissent, school administrators willcontinue to enjoy the flexibility they require in making disciplinary decisions so long as funding recipients are deemed "deliberately indifferent"to acts of student-on-student harassment only where the recipient's response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in lightof the known circumstances. Pp. 639-649.(b) The requirement that recipients receive adequate notice of TitleIX's proscriptions also bears on the proper definition of "discrimination"in a private damages action. Title IX proscribes sexual harassmentwith sufficient clarity to satisfy Pennhurst's notice requirement andserve as a basis for a damages action. See Gebser, supra, at 281. Having previously held that such harassment is "discrimination" in the526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Syllabusschool context under Title IX, this Court is constrained to conclude thatstudent-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of "discrimination" actionable under the statute.The statute's other prohibitions help to give content to "discrimination"in this context. The statute not only protects students from discrimination but also shields them from being "excluded from participation in"or "denied the benefits of" a recipient's "education program or activity"on the basis of gender. 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). It is not necessary toshow an overt, physical deprivation of access to school resources tomake out a damages claim for sexual harassment under Title IX, but aplaintiff must show harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims'educational experience, that the victims are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities. Cf. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67. Whether gender-orientedconduct is harassment depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships, Oncale v. Sundowner OffshoreServices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 82, including, but not limited to, the harasser's and victim's ages and the number of persons involved. Courtsmust also bear in mind that schoolchildren may regularly interact inways that would be unacceptable among adults. Moreover, that thediscrimination must occur "under any education program or activity"suggests that the behavior must be serious enough to have the systemiceffect of denying the victim equal access to an education program oractivity. A single instance of severe one-on-one peer harassment could,in theory, be said to have such a systemic effect, but it is unlikely thatCongress would have thought so. The fact that it was a teacher whoengaged in harassment in Franklin and Gebser is relevant. Peer harassment is less likely to satisfy the requirements that the misconductbreach Title IX's guarantee of equal access to educational benefits andhave a systemic effect on a program or activity. Pp. 649-653.2. Applying this standard to the facts at issue, the Eleventh Circuiterred in dismissing petitioner's complaint. This Court cannot say beyond doubt that she can prove no set of facts that would entitle her torelief. She alleges that LaShonda was the victim of repeated acts ofharassment by G. F. over a 5-month period, and allegations support theconclusion that his misconduct was severe, pervasive, and objectivelyoffensive. Moreover, the complaint alleges that multiple victims ofG. F.'s misconduct sought an audience with the school principal andthat the harassment had a concrete, negative effect on LaShonda's ability to receive an education. The complaint also suggests that petitionermay be able to show both actual knowledge and deliberate indifference526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD.

S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthe Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), 86 Stat. 373,as amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681 et seq. The District Courtdismissed petitioner's Title IX claim on the ground that"student-on-student, " or peer, harassment provides noground for a private cause of action under the statute. TheCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc,affirmed. We consider here whether a private damages ac-tion may lie against the school board in cases of student-onstudent harassment. We conclude that it may, but onlywhere the funding recipient acts with deliberate indifferenceto known acts of harassment in its programs or activities.Moreover, we conclude that such an action will lie only forharassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively of-fensive that it effectively bars the victim's access to an educational opportunity or benefit.IPetitioner's Title IX claim was dismissed under FederalRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claimupon which relief could be granted. Accordingly, in review-ing the legal sufficiency of petitioner's cause of action, "wemust assume the truth of the material facts as alleged in thecomplaint." Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U. S. 322,325 (1991). APetitioner's minor daughter, LaShonda, was allegedly thevictim of a prolonged pattern of sexual harassment by oneof her fifth-grade classmates at Hubbard Elementary School,a public school in Monroe County, Georgia. According topetitioner's complaint, the harassment began in December1992, when the classmate, G. F., attempted to touch LaShonda's breasts and genital area and made vulgar statementssuch as " `I want to get in bed with you' " and " `I want tofeel your boobs.' " Complaint || 7. Similar conduct alleg-edly occurred on or about January 4 and January 20, 1993.Ibid. LaShonda reported each of these incidents to her526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN634 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtmother and to her classroom teacher, Diane Fort. Ibid.Petitioner, in turn, also contacted Fort, who allegedly assured petitioner that the school principal, Bill Querry, hadbeen informed of the incidents.Ibid. Petitioner contendsthat, notwithstanding these reports, no disciplinary actionwas taken against G. F. Id., || 16.G. F.'s conduct allegedly continued for many months. Inearly February, G. F. purportedly placed a door stop in hispants and proceeded to act in a sexually suggestive mannertoward LaShonda during physical education class. Id., || 8.LaShonda reported G. F.'s behavior to her physical educationteacher, Whit Maples. Ibid. Approximately one weeklater, G. F. again allegedly engaged in harassing behavior,this time while under the supervision of another classroomteacher, Joyce Pippin. Id., || 9. Again, LaShonda allegedlyreported the incident to the teacher, and again petitionercontacted the teacher to follow up. Ibid.Petitioner alleges that G. F. once more directed sexuallyharassing conduct toward LaShonda in physical educationclass in early March, and that LaShonda reported the incident to both Maples and Pippen. Id., || 10. In mid-April1993, G. F. allegedly rubbed his body against LaShonda inthe school hallway in what LaShonda considered a sexuallysuggestive manner, and LaShonda again reported the matterto Fort. Id., || 11.The string of incidents finally ended in mid-May, whenG. F. was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, sexual batteryfor his misconduct. Id., || 14. The complaint alleges thatLaShonda had suffered during the months of harassment,however; specifically, her previously high grades allegedlydropped as she became unable to concentrate on her studies,id., || 15, and, in April 1993, her father discovered that shehad written a suicide note, ibid. The complaint furtheralleges that, at one point, LaShonda told petitioner thatshe " `didn't know how much longer she could keep [G. F.]off her.' " Id., || 12.526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN635Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the CourtNor was LaShonda G. F.'s only victim; it is alleged thatother girls in the class fell prey to G. F.'s conduct. Id., || 16.At one point, in fact, a group composed of LaShonda andother female students tried to speak with Principal Querryabout G. F.'s behavior. Id., || 10. According to the com-plaint, however, a teacher denied the students' request withthe statement, " `If [Querry] wants you, he'll call you.' "Ibid.Petitioner alleges that no disciplinary action was taken inresponse to G. F.'s behavior toward LaShonda. Id., || 16.In addition to her conversations with Fort and Pippen, petitioner alleges that she spoke with Principal Querry in mid-May 1993. When petitioner inquired as to what action theschool intended to take against G. F., Querry simply stated," `I guess I'll have to threaten him a little bit harder.' "Id.,|| 12. Yet, petitioner alleges, at no point during the manymonths of his reported misconduct was G. F. disciplined forharassment. Id., || 16. Indeed, Querry allegedly askedpetitioner why LaShonda " `was the only one complaining.' "Id., || 12.Nor, according to the complaint, was any effort made toseparate G. F. and LaShonda. Id., || 16. On the contrary,notwithstanding LaShonda's frequent complaints, only aftermore than three months of reported harassment was sheeven permitted to change her classroom seat so that she wasno longer seated next to G. F. Id., || 13. Moreover, peti-tioner alleges that, at the time of the events in question, theMonroe County Board of Education (Board) had not in-structed its personnel on how to respond to peer sexualharassment and had not established a policy on the issue.Id., || 17. BOn May 4, 1994, petitioner filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Middle District of Georgia against theBoard, Charles Dumas, the school district's superintendent,and Principal Querry. The complaint alleged that the Board526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN636 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtis a recipient of federal funding for purposes of Title IX,that "[t]he persistent sexual advances and harassment by thestudent G. F. upon [LaShonda] interfered with her ability toattend school and perform her studies and activities," andthat "[t]he deliberate indifference by Defendants to the unwelcome sexual advances of a student upon LaShonda cre-ated an intimidating, hostile, offensive and abus[ive] schoolenvironment in violation of Title IX." Id., |||| 27, 28. Thecomplaint sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief. Id., || 32.The defendants (all respondents here) moved to dismisspetitioner's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could begranted, and the District Court granted respondents' motion.See 862 F. Supp. 363, 368 (MD Ga. 1994). With regard topetitioner's claims under Title IX, the court dismissed theclaims against individual defendants on the ground that onlyfederally funded educational institutions are subject to liability in private causes of action under Title IX. Id., at 367.As for the Board, the court concluded that Title IX providedno basis for liability absent an allegation "that the Board oran employee of the Board had any role in the harassment."Ibid.Petitioner appealed the District Court's decision dismissing her Title IX claim against the Board, and a panel of theCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. 74 F.3d 1186, 1195 (1996). Borrowing from Title VII law, a majority of the panel determined that student-on-student harassment stated a cause of action against the Board underTitle IX: "[W]e conclude that as Title VII encompasses aclaim for damages due to a sexually hostile working environment created by co-workers and tolerated by the employer,Title IX encompasses a claim for damages due to a sexuallyhostile educational environment created by a fellow studentor students when the supervising authorities knowingly failto act to eliminate the harassment." Id., at 1193. The526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN637Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the CourtEleventh Circuit panel recognized that petitioner sought tostate a claim based on school "officials' failure to take actionto stop the offensive acts of those over whom the officialsexercised control,"ibid., and the court concluded that petitioner had alleged facts sufficient to support a claim for hostile environment sexual harassment on this theory, id., at1195.The Eleventh Circuit granted the Board's motion for re-hearing en banc, 91 F. 3d 1418 (1996), and affirmed the District Court's decision to dismiss petitioner's Title IX claimagainst the Board, 120 F. 3d 1390 (1998). The en banc courtrelied, primarily, on the theory that Title IX was passed pursuant to Congress' legislative authority under the Constitution's Spending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and thatthe statute therefore must provide potential recipients offederal education funding with "unambiguous notice of theconditions they are assuming when they accept" it. 120F. 3d, at 1399. Title IX, the court reasoned, provides recipients with notice that they must stop their employees fromengaging in discriminatory conduct, but the statute fails toprovide a recipient with sufficient notice of a duty to preventstudent-on-student harassment. Id., at 1401.Writing in dissent, four judges urged that the statute, bydeclining to identify the perpetrator of discrimination, encompasses misconduct by third parties: "The identity of theperpetrator is simply irrelevant under the language" of thestatute. Id., at 1412 (Barkett, J., dissenting). The plainlanguage, the dissenters reasoned, also provides recipientswith sufficient notice that a failure to respond to student-onstudent harassment could trigger liability for the district.Id., at 1414.We granted certiorari, 524 U. S. 980 (1998), in order to resolve a conflict in the Circuits over whether, and under whatcircumstances, a recipient of federal educational funds can beliable in a private damages action arising from student-onstudent sexual harassment, compare 120 F. 3d 1390 (CA11526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN638 DAVIS v.

S. C. $ 1681(a).Congress authorized an administrative enforcement schemefor Title IX. Federal departments or agencies with the authority to provide financial assistance are entrusted to pro-mulgate rules, regulations, and orders to enforce the objectives of $ 1681, see $ 1682, and these departments or agenciesmay rely on "any . . . means authorized by law," including526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN639Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthe termination of funding, ibid., to give effect to the stat-ute's restrictions.There is no dispute here that the Board is a recipient offederal education funding for Title IX purposes. 74 F. 3d,at 1189. Nor do respondents support an argument thatstudent-on-student harassment cannot rise to the level of"discrimination" for purposes of Title IX. Rather, at issuehere is the question whether a recipient of federal educationfunding may be liable for damages under Title IX under anycircumstances for discrimination in the form of student-onstudent sexual harassment.APetitioner urges that Title IX's plain language compels theconclusion that the statute is intended to bar recipients offederal funding from permitting this form of discriminationin their programs or activities. She emphasizes that thestatute prohibits a student from being "subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receivingFederal financial assistance." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a) (emphasis added). It is Title IX's "unmistakable focus on the bene-fited class," Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677,691 (1979), rather than the perpetrator, that, in petitioner'sview, compels the conclusion that the statute works to protectstudents from the discriminatory misconduct of their peers.Here, however, we are asked to do more than define thescope of the behavior that Title IX proscribes. We mustdetermine whether a district's failure to respond to studenton-student harassment in its schools can support a privatesuit for money damages. SeeGebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 283 (1998) ("In this case,. . . petitioners seek not just to establish a Title IX violationbut to recover damages . . ."). This Court has indeed recog-nized an implied private right of action under Title IX, seeCannon v. University of Chicago, supra, and we have heldthat money damages are available in such suits, Franklin v.526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN640 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the CourtGwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992). Be-cause we have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislationenacted pursuant to Congress' authority under the SpendingClause, however, see,e. g., Gebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., supra, at 287 (Title IX); Franklin v. GwinnettCounty Public Schools, supra, at 74-75, and n. 8 (Title IX);see alsoGuardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of NewYork City, 463 U. S. 582, 598-599 (1983) (opinion of White, J.)(Title VI), private damages actions are available only whererecipients of federal funding had adequate notice that theycould be liable for the conduct at issue. When Congress actspursuant to its spending power, it generates legislation"much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds,the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions." Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). In interpreting language inspending legislation, we thus "insis[t] that Congress speakwith a clear voice," recognizing that "[t]here can, of course,be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the putative contract] if a State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by thelegislation] or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it."Ibid.; see also id., at 24-25.Invoking Pennhurst, respondents urge that Title IX provides no notice that recipients of federal educational fundscould be liable in damages for harm arising from student-onstudent harassment. Respondents contend, specifically, thatthe statute only proscribes misconduct by grant recipients,not third parties. Respondents argue, moreover, that itwould be contrary to the very purpose of Spending Clauselegislation to impose liability on a funding recipient for themisconduct of third parties, over whom recipients exerciselittle control. See also Rowinsky v. Bryan IndependentSchool Dist., 80 F. 3d, at 1013.We agree with respondents that a recipient of federalfunds may be liable in damages under Title IX only for itsown misconduct. The recipient itself must "exclud[e] [per526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN641Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtsons] from participation in, . . . den[y] [persons] the benefitsof, or . . . subjec[t] [persons] to discrimination under" its "program[s] or activit[ies]" in order to be liable under Title IX.The Government's enforcement power may only be exercisedagainst the funding recipient, see $ 1682, and we have notextended damages liability under Title IX to parties outsidethe scope of this power. SeeNational Collegiate AthleticAssn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 467, n. 5 (1999) (rejecting sug-gestion "that the private right of action available under . . .$ 1681(a) is potentially broader than the Government's en-forcement authority"); cf.Gebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., supra, at 289 ("It would be unsound, we think,for a statute's express system of enforcement to requirenotice to the recipient and an opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while a judicially implied system of enforcement permits substantial liability without regard to the recipient's knowledge or its corrective actions upon receivingnotice").We disagree with respondents' assertion, however, thatpetitioner seeks to hold the Board liable for G. F.'s actionsinstead of its own. Here, petitioner attempts to hold theBoard liable for its own decision to remain idle in the faceof known student-on-student harassment in its schools. InGebser, we concluded that a recipient of federal educationfunds may be liable in damages under Title IX where it isdeliberately indifferent to known acts of sexual harassmentby a teacher. In that case, a teacher had entered into asexual relationship with an eighth-grade student, and thestudent sought damages under Title IX for the teacher'smisconduct. We recognized that the scope of liability inprivate damages actions under Title IX is circumscribedby Pennhurst's requirement that funding recipients havenotice of their potential liability. 524 U. S., at 287-288. Invoking Pennhurst, Guardians Assn., and Franklin, inGebser we once again required "that `the receiving entity offederal funds [have] notice that it will be liable for a mone526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN642 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courttary award' " before subjecting it to damages liability. 524U. S., at 287 (quotingFranklin v. Gwinnett County PublicSchools, 503 U. S., at 74). We also recognized, however, thatthis limitation on private damages actions is not a bar toliability where a funding recipient intentionally violates thestatute. Id., at 74-75; see also Guardians Assn. v. CivilServ. Comm'n of New York City, supra, at 597-598 (opinionof White, J.) (same with respect to Title VI). In particular,we concluded thatPennhurst does not bar a private damagesaction under Title IX where the funding recipient engagesin intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of thestatute.Accordingly, we rejected the use of agency principles toimpute liability to the district for the misconduct of its teachers. 524 U. S., at 283. Likewise, we declined the invitationto impose liability under what amounted to a negligencestandard--holding the district liable for its failure to reactto teacher-student harassment of which it knew or shouldhave known. Ibid. Rather, we concluded that the districtcould be liable for damages only where the district itself intentionally acted in clear violation of Title IX by remainingdeliberately indifferent to acts of teacher-student harassment of which it had actual knowledge. Id., at 290. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, the misconduct of theteacher in Gebser was not "treated as the grant recipient'sactions." Post, at 661 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Liabilityarose, rather, from "an official decision by the recipient notto remedy the violation." Gebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., supra, at 290. By employing the "deliberateindifference" theory already used to establish municipal liability under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, see Gebserv. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., supra, at 290-291(citing Board of Comm'rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S.397 (1997), and Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989)), weconcluded in Gebser that recipients could be liable in damages only where their own deliberate indifference effectively526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN643Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Court"cause[d]" the discrimination, 524 U. S., at 291; see also Canton v. Harris, supra, at 385 (recognizing that a municipalitywill be liable under $ 1983 only if "the municipality itselfcauses the constitutional violation at issue" (emphasis inoriginal)). The high standard imposed in Gebser sought toeliminate any "risk that the recipient would be liable indamages not for its own official decision but instead for itsemployees' independent actions." 524 U. S., at 290-291.Gebser thus established that a recipient intentionally violates Title IX, and is subject to a private damages action,where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known actsof teacher-student discrimination. Indeed, whether viewedas "discrimination" or "subject[ing]" students to discrimination, Title IX "[u]nquestionably . . . placed on [the Board]the duty not" to permit teacher-student harassment inits schools, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,supra, at 75, and recipients violate Title IX's plain termswhen they remain deliberately indifferent to this form ofmisconduct.We consider here whether the misconduct identified inGebser--deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment--amounts to an intentional violation of Title IX, capable of supporting a private damages action, when the harasser is a student rather than a teacher. We conclude that,in certain limited circumstances, it does. As an initial matter, in Gebser we expressly rejected the use of agency principles in the Title IX context, noting the textual differencesbetween Title IX and Title VII. 524 U. S., at 283; cf. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 791-792 (1998) (invokingagency principles on ground that definition of "employer" inTitle VII includes agents of employer); Meritor SavingsBank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986) (same). Additionally, the regulatory scheme surrounding Title IX haslong provided funding recipients with notice that they maybe liable for their failure to respond to the discriminatoryacts of certain nonagents. The Department of Education re526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN644 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtquires recipients to monitor third parties for discriminationin specified circumstances and to refrain from particularforms of interaction with outside entities that are known todiscriminate. See,e. g., 34 CFR $$ 106.31(b)(6), 106.31(d),106.37(a)(2), 106.38(a), 106.51(a)(3) (1998).The common law, too, has put schools on notice that theymay be held responsible under state law for their failure toprotect students from the tortious acts of third parties. SeeRestatement (Second) of Torts $ 320, and Commenta (1965).In fact, state courts routinely uphold claims alleging thatschools have been negligent in failing to protect their students from the torts of their peers. See, e. g., Rupp v. Bryant, 417 So. 2d 658, 666-667 (Fla. 1982); Brahatcek v. MillardSchool Dist., 202 Neb. 86, 99-100, 273 N. W. 2d 680, 688(1979); McLeod v. Grant County School Dist. No. 128, 42Wash. 2d 316, 320, 255 P. 2d 360, 362-363 (1953).This is not to say that the identity of the harasser is irrelevant. On the contrary, both the "deliberate indifference"standard and the language of Title IX narrowly circumscribethe set of parties whose known acts of sexual harassmentcan trigger some duty to respond on the part of funding recipients. Deliberate indifference makes sense as a theory ofdirect liability under Title IX only where the funding recipient has some control over the alleged harassment. A recipient cannot be directly liable for its indifference where it lacksthe authority to take remedial action.The language of Title IX itself--particularly when viewedin conjunction with the requirement that the recipient havenotice of Title IX's prohibitions to be liable for damages--also cabins the range of misconduct that the statute proscribes. The statute's plain language confines the scope ofprohibited conduct based on the recipient's degree of controlover the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs. If a funding recipient does not engage in harassment directly, it may not be liable for damages unless itsdeliberate indifference "subject[s]" its students to harass526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN645Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtment. That is, the deliberate indifference must, at a mini-mum, "cause [students] to undergo" harassment or "makethem liable or vulnerable" to it. Random House Dictionaryof the English Language 1415 (1966) (defining "subject" as"to cause to undergo the action of something specified; expose" or "to make liable or vulnerable; lay open; expose");Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2275 (1961)(defining "subject" as "to cause to undergo or submit to:make submit to a particular action or effect: EXPOSE").Moreover, because the harassment must occur "under" "theoperations of " a funding recipient, see 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a);$ 1687 (defining "program or activity"), the harassment musttake place in a context subject to the school district's control,Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at2487 (defining "under" as "in or into a condition of subjection,regulation, or subordination"; "subject to the guidance andinstruction of "); Random House Dictionary, supra, at 1543(defining "under" as "subject to the authority, direction, orsupervision of ").These factors combine to limit a recipient's damages liability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in whichthe known harassment occurs. Only then can the recipientbe said to "expose" its students to harassment or "cause"them to undergo it "under" the recipient's programs. Weagree with the dissent that these conditions are satisfiedmost easily and most obviously when the offender is an agentof the recipient. Post, at 661. We rejected the use ofagency analysis in Gebser, however, and we disagree thatthe term "under" somehow imports an agency requirementinto Title IX. See post, at 660-661. As noted above, thetheory in Gebser was that the recipient was directly liablefor its deliberate indifference to discrimination. See supra,at 642-643. Liability in that case did not arise because the"teacher's actions [were] treated" as those of the funding recipient, post, at 661; the district was directly liable for its526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN646 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtown failure to act. The terms "subjec[t]" and "under" im-pose limits, but nothing about these terms requires the useof agency principles.Where, as here, the misconduct occurs during school hoursand on school grounds--the bulk of G. F.'s misconduct, infact, took place in the classroom--the misconduct is takingplace "under" an "operation" of the funding recipient. SeeDoe v. University of Illinois, 138 F. 3d, at 661 (finding liabil-ity where school fails to respond properly to "student-onstudent sexual harassment that takes place while the stu-dents are involved in school activities or otherwise under thesupervision of school employees"). In these circumstances,the recipient retains substantial control over the context inwhich the harassment occurs. More importantly, however,in this setting the Board exercises significant control overthe harasser. We have observed, for example, "that the nature of [the State's] power [over public schoolchildren] is cus-todial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision andcontrol that could not be exercised over free adults." Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 655 (1995).On more than one occasion, this Court has recognized theimportance of school officials' "comprehensive authority . . . ,consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, toprescribe and control conduct in the schools."

The common law, too, recognizes theschool's disciplinary authority. See Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 152 (1965). We thus conclude that recipients of federal funding may be liable for "subject[ing]" their students526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN647Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtto discrimination where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual harassmentand the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority.At the time of the events in question here, in fact, schoolattorneys and administrators were being told that studenton-student harassment could trigger liability under Title IX.In March 1993, even as the events alleged in petitioner'scomplaint were unfolding, the National School Boards Association issued a publication, for use by "school attorneys andadministrators in understanding the law regarding sexualharassment of employees and students," which observed thatdistricts could be liable under Title IX for their failure torespond to student-on-student harassment. See NationalSchool Boards Association Council of School Attorneys, Sexual Harassment in the Schools: Preventing and DefendingAgainst Claims v, 45 (rev. ed.). Drawing on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines interpreting TitleVII, the publication informed districts that, "if [a] school district has constructive notice of severe and repeated acts ofsexual harassment by fellow students, that may form thebasis of a [T]itle IX claim." Ibid. The publication evencorrectly anticipated a form of Gebser's actual notice requirement: "It is unlikely that courts will hold a school districtliable for sexual harassment by students against students inthe absence of actual knowledge or notice to district employees." Sexual Harassment in the Schools, supra, at 45. Although we do not rely on this publication as an "indicium ofcongressional notice," see post, at 671, we do find supportfor our reading of Title IX in the fact that school attorneyshave rendered an analogous interpretation.Likewise, although they were promulgated too late to contribute to the Board's notice of proscribed misconduct, theDepartment of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) hasrecently adopted policy guidelines providing that studenton-student harassment falls within the scope of Title IX'sproscriptions. See Department of Education, Office of Civil526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN648 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD.

Reg. 12034, 12039-12040 (1997) (OCR Title IXGuidelines); see also Department of Education, Racial Incidents and Harassment Against Students at EducationalInstitutions, 59 Fed. Reg. 11448, 11449 (1994).We stress that our conclusion here--that recipients maybe liable for their deliberate indifference to known acts ofpeer sexual harassment--does not mean that recipients canavoid liability only by purging their schools of actionablepeer harassment or that administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action. We thus disagree with respondents' contention that, if Title IX provides a cause of actionfor student-on-student harassment, "nothing short of expulsion of every student accused of misconduct involving sexualovertones would protect school systems from liability ordamages." See Brief for Respondents 16; see also 120 F. 3d,at 1402 (Tjoflat, J.) ("[A] school must immediately suspend orexpel a student accused of sexual harassment"). Likewise,the dissent erroneously imagines that victims of peer harassment now have a Title IX right to make particular remedialdemands. See post, at 686 (contemplating that victim coulddemand new desk assignment). In fact, as we have previously noted, courts should refrain from second-guessingthe disciplinary decisions made by school administrators.New Jersey v. T. L. O., supra, at 342-343, n. 9.School administrators will continue to enjoy the flexibilitythey require so long as funding recipients are deemed "deliberately indifferent" to acts of student-on-student harassmentonly where the recipient's response to the harassment or lackthereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The dissent consistently mischaracterizes thisstandard to require funding recipients to "remedy" peer harassment, post, at 658, 662, 668, 683, and to "ensur[e] that . . .students conform their conduct to" certain rules, post, at 666.Title IX imposes no such requirements. On the contrary,526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN649Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtthe recipient must merely respond to known peer harass-ment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable. This isnot a mere "reasonableness" standard, as the dissent as-sumes. See post, at 679. In an appropriate case, there isno reason why courts, on a motion to dismiss, for summaryjudgment, or for a directed verdict, could not identify a response as not "clearly unreasonable" as a matter of law.Like the dissent, seepost, at 664-668, we acknowledgethat school administrators shoulder substantial burdens asa result of legal constraints on their disciplinary authority.To the extent that these restrictions arise from federalstatutes, Congress can review these burdens with attentionto the difficult position in which such legislation may placeour Nation's schools. We believe, however, that the stand-ard set out here is sufficiently flexible to account both forthe level of disciplinary authority available to the schooland for the potential liability arising from certain forms ofdisciplinary action. A university might not, for example, beexpected to exercise the same degree of control over itsstudents that a grade school would enjoy, see post, at 666-668, and it would be entirely reasonable for a school to refrain from a form of disciplinary action that would expose itto constitutional or statutory claims.While it remains to be seen whether petitioner can showthat the Board's response to reports of G. F.'s misconductwas clearly unreasonable in light of the known circum-stances, petitioner may be able to show that the Board "subject[ed]" LaShonda to discrimination by failing to respond inany way over a period of five months to complaints of G. F.'sin-school misconduct from LaShonda and other femalestudents.BThe requirement that recipients receive adequate notice ofTitle IX's proscriptions also bears on the proper definition of"discrimination" in the context of a private damages action.We have elsewhere concluded that sexual harassment is a526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN650 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtform of discrimination for Title IX purposes and that TitleIX proscribes harassment with sufficient clarity to satisfyPennhurst's notice requirement and serve as a basis for adamages action. SeeGebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., 524 U. S., at 281; Franklin v. Gwinnett CountyPublic Schools, 503 U. S., at 74-75. Having previously de-termined that "sexual harassment" is "discrimination" in theschool context under Title IX, we are constrained to concludethat student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficientlysevere, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination ac-tionable under the statute. SeeBennett v. Kentucky Dept.of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 665-666 (1985) (rejecting claim of insufficient notice under Pennhurst where statute made clearthat there were some conditions placed on receipt of federalfunds, and noting that Congress need not "specifically identif[y] and proscrib[e]" each condition in the legislation). Thestatute's other prohibitions, moreover, help give content tothe term "discrimination" in this context. Students are notonly protected from discrimination, but also specificallyshielded from being "excluded from participation in" or "denied the benefits of " any "education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." $ 1681(a). The statute makes clear that, whatever else it prohibits, studentsmust not be denied access to educational benefits and opportunities on the basis of gender. We thus conclude that funding recipients are properly held liable in damages only wherethey are deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, ofwhich they have actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprivethe victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.The most obvious example of student-on-student sexualharassment capable of triggering a damages claim wouldthus involve the overt, physical deprivation of access toschool resources. Consider, for example, a case in whichmale students physically threaten their female peers every526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN651Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courtday, successfully preventing the female students from usinga particular school resource--an athletic field or a computerlab, for instance. District administrators are well aware ofthe daily ritual, yet they deliberately ignore requests for aidfrom the female students wishing to use the resource. Thedistrict's knowing refusal to take any action in response tosuch behavior would fly in the face of Title IX's core principles, and such deliberate indifference may appropriately besubject to claims for monetary damages. It is not necessary,however, to show physical exclusion to demonstrate that stu-dents have been deprived by the actions of another studentor students of an educational opportunity on the basis of sex.Rather, a plaintiff must establish sexual harassment of students that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive,and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectivelydenied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities. Cf. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477U. S., at 67.Whether gender-oriented conduct rises to the level ofactionable "harassment" thus "depends on a constellation ofsurrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships,"Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75,82 (1998), including, but not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved,see OCR Title IX Guidelines 12041-12042. Courts, moreover, must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adultworkplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among adults. See, e. g.,Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as AmiciCuriae 11 (describing "dizzying array of immature . . . behaviors by students"). Indeed, at least early on, students arestill learning how to interact appropriately with their peers.It is thus understandable that, in the school setting, studentsoften engage in insults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing,and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN652 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtsubjected to it. Damages are not available for simple actsof teasing and name-calling among school children, however,even where these comments target differences in gender.Rather, in the context of student-on-student harassment,damages are available only where the behavior is so severe,pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victimsthe equal access to education that Title IX is designed toprotect.The dissent fails to appreciate these very real limitationson a funding recipient's liability under Title IX. It is notenough to show, as the dissent would read this opinion toprovide, that a student has been "teased," post, at 678, or"called . . . offensive names," post, at 680. Comparisons toan "overweight child who skips gym class because the otherchildren tease her about her size," the student who "refusesto wear glasses to avoid the taunts of `four-eyes,' " and "thechild who refuses to go to school because the school bullycalls him a `scaredy-cat' at recess," post, at 678, are inapposite and misleading. Nor do we contemplate, much less hold,that a mere "decline in grades is enough to survive" a motionto dismiss. Post, at 677. The dropoff in LaShonda's gradesprovides necessary evidence of a potential link between hereducation and G. F.'s misconduct, but petitioner's ability tostate a cognizable claim here depends equally on the allegedpersistence and severity of G. F.'s actions, not to mention theBoard's alleged knowledge and deliberate indifference. Wetrust that the dissent's characterization of our opinion willnot mislead courts to impose more sweeping liability thanwe read Title IX to require.Moreover, the provision that the discrimination occur"under any education program or activity" suggests that thebehavior be serious enough to have the systemic effect ofdenying the victim equal access to an educational programor activity. Although, in theory, a single instance of sufficiently severe one-on-one peer harassment could be said tohave such an effect, we think it unlikely that Congress would526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN653Cite as: 526 U. S. 629 (1999)Opinion of the Courthave thought such behavior sufficient to rise to this level inlight of the inevitability of student misconduct and theamount of litigation that would be invited by entertainingclaims of official indifference to a single instance of one-onone peer harassment. By limiting private damages actionsto cases having a systemic effect on educational programs oractivities, we reconcile the general principle that Title IXprohibits official indifference to known peer sexual harassment with the practical realities of responding to studentbehavior, realities that Congress could not have meant to beignored. Even the dissent suggests that Title IX liabilitymay arise when a funding recipient remains indifferent tosevere, gender-based mistreatment played out on a "wide-spread level" among students. Post, at 683.The fact that it was a teacher who engaged in harassmentin Franklin and Gebser is relevant. The relationship between the harasser and the victim necessarily affects theextent to which the misconduct can be said to breach TitleIX's guarantee of equal access to educational benefits andto have a systemic effect on a program or activity. Peerharassment, in particular, is less likely to satisfy these re-quirements than is teacher-student harassment.CApplying this standard to the facts at issue here, we con-clude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint. Petitioner alleges that her daughter was thevictim of repeated acts of sexual harassment by G. F. over a5-month period, and there are allegations in support of theconclusion that G. F.'s misconduct was severe, pervasive, andobjectively offensive. The harassment was not only verbal;it included numerous acts of objectively offensive touching,and, indeed, G. F. ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal sex-ual misconduct. Moreover, the complaint alleges that therewere multiple victims who were sufficiently disturbed byG. F.'s misconduct to seek an audience with the school prin526US3 Unit: $U60 [01-04-01 06:48:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN654 DAVIS v. MONROE COUNTY BD. OF ED.Kennedy, J., dissentingcipal. Further, petitioner contends that the harassment hada concrete, negative effect on her daughter's ability to receive an education. The complaint also suggests that petitioner may be able to show both actual knowledge and deliberate indifference on the part of the Board, which made noeffort whatsoever either to investigate or to put an end tothe harassment.On this complaint, we cannot say "beyond doubt that [petitioner] can prove no set of facts in support of [her] claimwhich would entitle [her] to relief." Conley v. Gibson, 355U. S. 41, 45-46 (1957). See also Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S.232, 236 (1974) ("The issue is not whether a plaintiff willultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled tooffer evidence to support the claims"). Accordingly, thejudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.
