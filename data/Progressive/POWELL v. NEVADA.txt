In Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), we held that theFourth Amendment's shield against unreasonable seizuresrequires a prompt judicial determination of probable causefollowing an arrest made without a warrant and ensuing de-tention.County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44(1991), established that "prompt" generally means within 48hours of the warrantless arrest; absent extraordinary circumstances, a longer delay violates the Fourth Amendment.In the case now before us, the Supreme Court of Nevadastated thatMcLaughlin does not apply to a prosecution commenced prior to the rendition of that decision. We hold thatthe Nevada Supreme Court misread this Court's precedent:"[A] . . . rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to beapplied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, . . . not yetfinal" when the rule is announced.

S. 79 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIPetitioner Kitrich Powell was arrested on Friday, Novem-ber 3, 1989, for felony child abuse of his girlfriend's 4-yearold daughter, in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 200.508 (1991).That afternoon, the arresting officer prepared a sworn declaration describing the cause for and circumstances of the ar-rest. Not until November 7, 1989, however, did a Magistrate find probable cause to hold Powell for a preliminaryhearing. That same day, November 7, Powell made statements to the police, prejudicial to him, which the prosecutorlater presented at Powell's trial. Powell was not personallybrought before a Magistrate until November 13, 1989. Bythat time, the child had died of her injuries, and Powell wascharged additionally with her murder.A jury found Powell guilty of first-degree murder and, following a penalty hearing, sentenced him to death. On ap-peal to the Nevada Supreme Court, Powell argued that theState had violated Nevada's "initial appearance" statute byfailing to bring him before a magistrate within 72 hours, andthat his conviction should therefore be reversed.The Nevada statute governing appearances before a magistrate provides:"If an arrested person is not brought before a magis-trate within 72 hours after arrest, excluding nonjudicialdays, the magistrate:"(a) Shall give the prosecuting attorney an opportunity to explain the circumstances leading to the delay;and"(b) May release the arrested person if he determinesthat the person was not brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay." Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178(3)(1991).Powell emphasized that 10 days had elapsed between his ar-rest on November 3, 1989, and his November 13 initial appearance before a Magistrate. In view of the incriminating511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT82 POWELL v. NEVADAOpinion of the Courtstatements he made on November 7, Powell contended, theunlawful delay was prejudicial to him. Under Nevada law,Powell asserted, vindication of his right to a speedy firstappearance required that his conviction be reversed, andthat he be set free. Appellant's Opening Brief in No. 22348(Nev.), p. 85.The district attorney maintained before the Nevada Supreme Court that there had been no fatal violation of Neva-da's initial appearance statute. First, the district attorneyurged, the confirmation of probable cause by a Magistrate onNovember 7 occurred within 72 hours of the November 3arrest (excluding the intervening weekend). This probablecause finding, the district attorney contended, satisfied the72-hour prescription of Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178. In anyevent, the district attorney continued, under Nevada law, anaccused waives his right to a speedy arraignment when hevoluntarily waives his right to remain silent and his right tocounsel. Powell did so, the district attorney said, when hemade his November 7 statements, after he was read his Miranda rights and waived those rights. See Respondent'sAnswering Brief in No. 22348 (Nev.), pp. 56-60. In reply,Powell vigorously contested the district attorney's portrayalof the probable-cause determination as tantamount to an initial appearance sufficient to satisfy Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178's72-hour prescription. Powell pointed out that he "wasneither present [n]or advised of the magistrate's finding."Appellant's Reply Brief in No. 22348 (Nev.), p. 1.The Nevada Supreme Court concluded, in accord with thedistrict attorney's assertion, that Powell had waived hisright under state law to a speedy arraignment. 108 Nev.700, 705, 838 P. 2d 921, 924-925 (1992). If the Nevada Supreme Court had confined the decision to that point, its opinion would have resolved no federal issue. But the NevadaSupreme Court said more. Perhaps in response to the district attorney's contention that the Magistrate's November 7probable-cause notation satisfied Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178 (a511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT83Cite as: 511 U. S. 79 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcontention the State now disavows), the Nevada SupremeCourt, sua sponte, raised a federal concern. That court detoured from its state-law analysis to inquire whether the No-vember 3 to November 7, 1989, delay in judicial confirmationof probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment under thisCourt's precedents.County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991),the Nevada Supreme Court recognized, made specific theprobable-cause promptness requirement of Gerstein v. Pugh,420 U. S. 103 (1975);McLaughlin instructed that a delay ex-ceeding 48 hours presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment. Merging the speedy initial appearance required byNevada statute and the prompt probable-cause determination required by the Fourth Amendment, the Nevada Su-preme Court declared: "TheMcLaughlin case renders [Nev.Rev. Stat. $ ]171.178(3) unconstitutional insofar [as] it permitsan initial appearance up to seventy-two hours after arrestand instructs that non-judicial days be excluded from the calculation of those hours." 108 Nev., at 705, 838 P. 2d, at 924.While instructing that, henceforth, probable-cause determinations be made within 48 hours of a suspect's arrest, theNevada Supreme Court heldMcLaughlin inapplicable "tothe case at hand," because that recent precedent postdatedPowell's arrest. 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1.McLaughlin announced a new rule, the Nevada SupremeCourt observed, and therefore need not be applied retroac-tively. 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1.Powell petitioned for our review raising the questionwhether a state court may decline to apply a recently rendered Fourth Amendment decision of this Court to a casepending on direct appeal. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S.811 (1993), and now reject the state court's prospectivitydeclaration.IIPowell's arrest was not validated by a magistrate untilfour days elapsed. That delay was presumptively unreason511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT84 POWELL v. NEVADAOpinion of the Courtable under McLaughlin's 48-hour rule. The State so concedes. Appellee's Answer to Petition for Rehearing in No.22348 (Nev.), p. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. The State furtherconcedes that the Nevada Supreme Court's retroactivityanalysis was incorrect. See ibid. We held in Griffith v.Kentucky, 479 U. S., at 328, that "a new rule for the conductof criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to allcases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yetfinal." Griffith stressed two points. First, "the nature ofjudicial review . . . precludes us from `[s]imply fishing onecase from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehiclefor pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow byunaffected by that new rule.' " Id., at 323 (quoting Mackeyv. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 679 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment)). Second, "selective application ofnew rules violates the principle of treating similarly situateddefendants the same." Griffith, supra, at 323. Assuming,arguendo, that the 48-hour presumption announced in McLaughlin qualifies as a "new rule," cf. Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288, 299-310 (1989), Griffith nonetheless entitles Powellto rely on McLaughlin for this simple reason: Powell's conviction was not final when McLaughlin was announced.It does not necessarily follow, however, that Powell must"be set free," 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1, orgain other relief, for several questions remain open for decision on remand. In particular, the Nevada Supreme Courthas not yet closely considered the appropriate remedy for adelay in determining probable cause (an issue not resolvedby McLaughlin), or the consequences of Powell's failure toraise the federal question, or the district attorney's argument that introduction at trial of what Powell said on November 7, 1989, was "harmless" in view of a similar, albeitshorter, statement Powell made on November 3, prior to hisarrest.
