This case concerns the authority of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA or Agency) to enforce the provisions of the Clean Air Act's (CAA or Act) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. Under that program,no major air pollutant emitting facility may be constructedunless the facility is equipped with "the best available control technology" (BACT). As added by $ 165, 91 Stat. 735,and amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 7475(a)(4). BACT, as defined inthe CAA, means, for any major air pollutant emitting facility,"an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of[pollutant] reduction . . . which the permitting authority, ona case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines isachievable for [the] facility. . . ." $ 7479(3).Regarding EPA oversight, the Act includes a general instruction and one geared specifically to the PSD program.The general prescription, $ 113(a)(5) of the Act, authorizesEPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAArequirement governing construction of a pollutant source,to issue an order prohibiting construction, to prescribe anadministrative penalty, or to commence a civil action for injunctive relief. 42 U.

Before 1977, no CAA pro-vision specifically addressed potential air quality deterioration in areas where pollutant levels were lower than theNAAQS.Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F. 2d 323, 346-347 (CADC 1979). Responding to litigation initiated by anenvironmental group,2 however, EPA issued regulations in1974 requiring that SIPs include a PSD program.Id., at347, and n. 18 (citing 39 Fed. Reg. 42510 (1974)). Threeyears later, Congress adopted the current PSD program.See S. Rep. No. 95-127, p. 11 (1977) (Congress itself has"a responsibility to delineate a policy for protecting cleanair").The PSD program imposes on States a regime governingareas "designated pursuant to [42 U.

No such facility may be constructed or modified unless a permit prescribing emissionlimitations has been issued for the facility. $ 7475(a)(1); see$ 7479(2)(C) (defining "construction" to include "modification"). Alaska's SIP imposes an analogous requirement.18 Alaska Admin. Code $ 50.300(c)(1) (2003). Modificationsto major emitting facilities that increase nitrogen oxide emissions in excess of 40 tons per year require a PSD permit.40 CFR $ 51.166(b)(23)(i) (2002); 18 Alaska Admin. Code$ 50.300(h)(3)(B)(ii) (2003).The Act sets out preconditions for the issuance of PSDpermits. Inter alia, no PSD permit may issue unless "theproposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to [CAA] regulation . . .emitted from . . .

Alaska's SIP contains provisions that track the statutory BACT requirement and definition. 18 Alaska Admin.Code $$ 50.310(d)(3) and 50.990(13) (2003). The State, withslightly variant terminology, defines BACT as "the emissionlimitation that represents the maximum reduction achievable for each regulated air contaminant, taking into accountenergy, environmental and economic impacts, and othercosts." $ 50.990(13). Under the federal Act, a limited classof sources must gain advance EPA approval for the BACTprescribed in the permit. 42 U. S. C. $ 7475(a)(8).CAA also provides that a PSD permit may issue only ifa source "will not cause, or contribute to, air pollution inexcess of any . . . maximum allowable increase or maximumallowable concentration for any pollutant" or any NAAQS.$ 7475(a)(3). Congress left to the Agency the determinationof most maximum allowable increases, or "increments," inpollutants. EPA regulations have defined increments fornitrogen oxides. 40 CFR $ 51.166(c) (2002). Typically, todemonstrate that increments will not be exceeded, applicantsuse mathematical models of pollutant plumes, their behavior,and their dispersion. Westbrook, Air Dispersion Models:Tools to Assess Impacts from Pollution Sources, 13 NaturalResources & Env. 546, 547-548 (1999).Among measures EPA may take to ensure compliancewith the PSD program, two have special relevance here.The first prescription, $ 113(a)(5) of the Act, provides that"[w]henever, on the basis of any available information, [EPA]finds that a State is not acting in compliance with anyrequirement or prohibition of the chapter relating to theconstruction of new sources or the modification of existingsources," 42 U.

To achieve nitrogen oxide emission re-ductions commensurate with SCR's 90% impact, Comincoproposed fitting the new generator MG-17 and the six exist-ing generators with Low NOx. Ibid.8 Cominco assertedthat it could lower net emissions by 396 tons per year if itfitted all seven generators with Low NOx rather than fittingtwo (MG-5 and MG-17) with SCR and choosing one of themas the standby unit.Id., at 87. Cominco's proposal hingedon the "assumption . . . that under typical operating conditions one or more engines will not be running due to mainte-nance of standby-generation capacity." Ibid. If all sevengenerators ran continuously, however, Cominco's alternativewould increase emissions by 79 tons per year. Ibid. Accepting Cominco's submission, ADEC stated that Cominco'sLow NOx solution "achieve[d] a similar maximum NOx reduction as the most stringent controls; [could] potentiallyresult in a greater NOx reduction; and is logistically and economically less onerous to Cominco." Id., at 87-88.On the final day of the public comment period, June 2,1999, the United States Department of the Interior, NationalParks Service (NPS), submitted comments to ADEC. App.to Pet. for Cert. 33a; App. 97, 108. NPS objected to theprojected offset of new emissions from MG-5 and MG-17against emissions from other existing generators that werenot subject to BACT. Letter from John Notar, NPS AirResources Division, to Jim Baumgartner, ADEC (June 2,1999). Such an offset, NPS commented, "is neither allowedby BACT, nor achieves the degree of reduction that wouldresult if all the generators that are subject to BACT wereequipped with SCR." Id., at 3. NPS further observed thatthe proposed production-increase project would removeoperating restrictions that the 1994 PSD permit had placedon four of the existing generators--MG-1, MG-3, MG-4,8 Two generators already were fitted with a technology called Fuel Injection Timing Retard that results in a 20% to 30% reduction in nitrogenoxide emissions.

Due to that altera-tion, NPS urged, those generators, too, became part of theproduction-expansion project and would be subject to theBACT requirement.Ibid.Following NPS' lead, EPA wrote to ADEC on July 29,1999, commenting: "Although ADEC states in its analysisthat [SCR], the most stringent level of control, is economically and technologically feasible, ADEC did not propose torequire SCR. . . . [O]nce it is determined that an emissionunit is subject to BACT, the PSD program does not allowthe imposition of a limit that is less stringent than BACT."App. 96-97. A permitting authority, EPA agreed with NPS,could not offset new emissions "by imposing new controls onother emission units" that were not subject to BACT. Id.,at 97. New emissions could be offset only against reducedemissions from sources covered by the same BACT authori-zation.Id., at 285-286. EPA further agreed with NPSthat, based on the existing information, BACT would be re-quired for MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5.Id., at 97.After receiving EPA comments, ADEC issued a seconddraft PSD permit and technical analysis report on Septem-ber 1, 1999, again finding Low NOx to be BACT for MG-17.Id., at 105-117. Abandoning the emissions-offsetting justi-fication advanced in the May 4 draft permit, ADEC agreedwith NPS and EPA that "emission reductions from sourcesthat were not part of the permit action," here MG-1, MG-2,MG-3, MG-4, MG-5, and MG-6, could not be consideredin determining BACT for MG-17. Id., at 111; id., at 199(same).99 Rather than subject MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5 to BACT, ADECand Cominco "agreed to permit conditions that would require low NOxcontrols on MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5, and emission limits that reflectthe previous `bubbled' limits. Under this approach, the permit would result in no increase in actual or allowable emissions from any of these engines and the installation of BACT would not be necessary for these four540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 540 U.

Contradicting its May 1999 conclusionthat SCR was "technically and economically feasible," seesupra, at 476, ADEC found in September 1999 that SCR imposed "a disproportionate cost" on the mine. App. 116.ADEC concluded, on a "cursory review," that requiring SCRfor a rural Alaska utility would lead to a 20% price increase,and that in comparison with other BACT technologies, SCRcame at a "significantly higher" cost. Ibid. No economicbasis for a comparison between the mine and a rural utilityappeared in ADEC's technical analysis.EPA protested the revised permit. In a September 15,1999, letter, the Agency stated: "Cominco has not adequatelydemonstrated any site-specific factors to support their claimthat the installation of [SCR] is economically infeasible atthe Red Dog Mine. Therefore, elimination of SCR as BACTbased on cost-effectiveness grounds is not supported by therecord and is clearly erroneous." Id., at 127; see id., at138 (ADEC's record does not support the departure fromADEC's initial view that the costs for SCR were economically feasible).To justify the September 1, 1999, permit, EPA suggested,ADEC could "include an analysis of whether requiring Cominco to install and operate [SCR] would have any adverseeconomic impacts upon Cominco specifically." Id., at 127.Stating that such an inquiry was unnecessary and expressing"concerns related to confidentiality," Cominco declined tosubmit financial data. Id., at 134.

Nonetheless, ADEC advanced, as cause forits decision, SCR's adverse effect on the mine's "unique andcontinuing impact on the economic diversity of th[e] region"and on the venture's "world competitiveness."

Id., at821 (emphasis in original). Concluding that EPA had "authority to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of thestate's justification for its decision," the Court of Appealsemphasized that the "provision of a reasoned justification"by a permitting authority is undeniably a "requirement" ofthe Act.

In notably capacious terms, Congress armed EPA with authority to issueorders stopping construction when "a State is not acting incompliance with any [CAA] requirement or prohibition . . .relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources," $ 7413(a)(5), or when "constructionor modification of a major emitting facility . . . does not conform to the requirements of [the PSD program]," $ 7477.The federal Act enumerates several "[p]reconstruction requirements" for the PSD program. $ 7475.

"$ 7479(3). Under this formulation, the permitting authority, ADEC here, exercises primary or initial responsibilityfor identifying BACT in line with the Act's definition ofthat term.All parties agree that one of the "many requirements inthe PSD provisions that the EPA may enforce" is "that a540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 540 U.

The prospect is very real that such a State would lose existingindustrial plants to more permissive States.

We give that unexceptional principle effect by attending both tothe unequivocal grant of supervisory authority to EPA in $$ 113(a)(5) and167, and to the statutory control on permitting authorities' discretion contained in the BACT definition, 42 U.

Congress, however,vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforceCAA "requirements" relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT.We fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed anexpansive surveillance role for EPA in two independentCAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agencyfrom verifying substantive compliance with the BACT provisions and, instead, limit EPA's superintendence to the insubstantial question whether the state permitting authority haduttered the key words "BACT."We emphasize, however, that EPA's rendition of the Act'sless than crystalline text leaves the "permitting authority"considerable leeway. The Agency acknowledges "the needto accord appropriate deference" to States' BACT designations, Brief for Respondents 43, and disclaims any intentionto " `second guess' state decisions," 63 Fed.

EPA's limitedbut vital role in enforcing BACT is consistent with a schemethat "places primary responsibilities and authority withthe States, backed by the Federal Government." S. Rep.No. 95-127, p. 29.ADEC also points to 42 U. S. C. $ 7475(a)(8), a provision ofthe Act expressly requiring, in a limited category of cases,EPA approval of a state permitting authority's BACT determination before a facility may be constructed. See Brief forPetitioner 25; Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. Had Congressintended EPA superintendence of BACT determinations,ADEC urges, Congress would have said so expressly bymandating Agency approval of all, not merely some, BACTdeterminations. Brief for Petitioner 25-26. ADEC's argument overlooks the obvious difference between a statutoryrequirement, e. g., $ 7475(a)(8), and a statutory authorization. Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not requireEPA approval of all state BACT determinations, they simplyauthorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a statepermitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.EPA recognizes that its authorization to issue a stop ordermay be exercised only when a state permitting authority'sdecision is unreasonable; in contrast, a required approvalmay be withheld if EPA would come to a different determination on the merits. See, e. g., 57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (1992)("EPA acknowledges that states have the primary role inadministering and enforcing the various components of thePSD program. States have been largely successful in thiseffort, and EPA's involvement in interpretative and enforcement issues is limited to only a small number of cases.").Even if the Act imposes a requirement of reasoned justification for a BACT determination, ADEC ultimately argues,such a requirement may be enforced only through state ad540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN492 ALASKA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTALCONSERVATION v. EPAOpinion of the Courtministrative and judicial processes. Brief for Petitioner 34-38.15 State review of BACT decisions, according to ADEC,allows development of an adequate factual record, properlyimposes the burden of persuasion on EPA when it challengesa State's BACT determination, and promotes certainty. Id.,at 36-37. Unless EPA review of BACT determinations ischanneled into state administrative and judicial forums,ADEC suggests, "there is nothing to prevent the EPA frominvalidating a BACT determination at any time--months,even years, after a permit has been issued." Id., at 35.It would be unusual, to say the least, for Congress to remita federal agency enforcing federal law solely to state court.We decline to read such an uncommon regime into the Act'ssilence. EPA, the expert federal agency charged with enforcing the Act, has interpreted the BACT provisions and itsown $$ 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to requirerecourse to state processes before stopping a facility's con15 From the availability of state-court judicial review, the dissent concludes, it necessarily "follows that EPA . . . must take the same proceduralsteps," of filing suit in state court, as any other person or entity seekingto challenge the issuance of a PSD permit. Post, at 509. Interpretedotherwise, the dissent asserts, the Act contains a "loophole" that allowsan EPA "end run around the State's process." Post, at 511. In designingthe Act, however, Congress often gave EPA a choice of enforcement measures. For example, EPA has three options to address a failure to complywith new source requirements. Compare 42 U. S. C. $ 7413(a)(5)(A) (EPAmay "issue an order prohibiting the construction or modification of anymajor stationary source") with $ 7413(a)(5)(B) (EPA may "issue an administrative penalty order") and $ 7413(a)(5)(C) (EPA may "bring a civil action"). Other sections of the Act provide EPA with similar options. See,e. g., $$ 7413(a)(1)-(3). Following the dissent's logic, EPA's authority tobring a civil action would rule out, as a "loophole," its authority to issuea stop-construction order.Moreover, the existence of concurrent authority is hardly at odds withthe Act. As ADEC itself concedes, EPA can issue a checking order if aPSD permit lacks a BACT determination, Brief for Petitioner 34, even ifstate-court jurisdiction could be invoked instead.540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN493Cite as: 540 U.

Wesee no reason to conclude that an appropriate record generally cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court re-view when EPA disputes a BACT decision's reasonableness.ADEC contends that, in this very case, "the State's BACTdetermination was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit on an incomplete record." Brief for Petitioner 37. ADEC, how-ever, offers no particulars to back up its assertion that theCourt of Appeals proceeded on an inadequate evidentiaryrecord. We note again that the Ninth Circuit ordered EPAto submit a complete administrative record. 298 F. 3d, at818. After the Agency declared that the record was complete, "all the parties effectively agreed that the record as itstood was adequate to resolve the issues on appeal."Ibid.As to the burdens of production and persuasion, nothingin the Act suggests that EPA gains a proof-related tacticaladvantage by issuing a stop-construction order instead ofseeking relief through a civil action. But cf. post, at 510(EPA authority to issue stop-construction orders creates"the anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State"). Correspondingly,nothing in our decision today invites or permits EPA toachieve an unfair advantage through its choice of litigationforum. In granting EPA a choice between initiating a civilaction and exercising its stop-construction-order authority,seesupra, at 473-474, 492, n. 15, Congress nowhere suggested that the allocation of proof burdens would differ de-pending upon which enforcement route EPA selected. The16 Experience, we have already noted, see supra, at 490, n. 14, affordsno grounding for the dissent's predictions that EPA oversight, which isundeniably subject to federal-court review, will "rewor[k] . . . the balancebetween State and Federal Governments" and threaten state courts' independence.

Accordingly, we holdthat in either an EPA-initiated civil action or a challenge toan EPA stop-construction order filed in state or federalcourt, the production and persuasion burdens remain withEPA and the underlying question a reviewing court resolvesremains the same: Whether the state agency's BACT determination was reasonable, in light of the statutory guides andthe state administrative record. See supra, at 485-486,491.17The Ninth Circuit's review of EPA's order is in keepingwith our holding that EPA may not reduce the burden itmust carry by electing to invoke its stop-construction-orderauthority. Specifically, the Court of Appeals rested its judgment on what EPA showed from ADEC's own report: "(1)Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating [toADEC] that SCR was economically infeasible; and (2) ADECfailed to provide a reasoned justification for its eliminationof SCR as a control option." 298 F. 3d, at 823.

Brief for Petitioner 35; post, at 512-514. This casethreatens no such development. It involves preconstructionorders issued by EPA, see supra, at 481, not postconstruction federal Agency directives. EPA itself regards it as"imperative" to act on a timely basis, recognizing that courtsare "less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the farther planning and constructionhave progressed." App. 273 (July 15, 1988, EPA guidancememorandum). In the one instance of untimely EPA actionADEC identifies, the federal courts declined to permit enforcement to proceed. See United States v. AM GeneralCorp., 34 F. 3d 472, 475 (CA7 1994) (affirming District Court'sdismissal of an EPA-initiated enforcement action where EPAdid not act until well after the facility received a PSD permitand completed plant modifications). EPA, we are confident,could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and thedissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to reviewEPA's actions. Cf. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of NewYork, 397 U. S. 664, 678-679 (1970); Panhandle Oil Co. v.Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (1928) (Holmes,J., dissenting), overruled in part by Alabama v. King &Boozer, 314 U. S. 1, 8-9 (1941).In sum, EPA interprets the Act to allow substantive federal Agency surveillance of state permitting authorities'BACT determinations subject to federal-court review. Wecredit EPA's longstanding construction of the Act and confirm EPA's authority, pursuant to $$ 113(a)(5) and 167, to ruleon the reasonableness of BACT decisions by state permitting authorities.540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN496 ALASKA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTALCONSERVATION v. EPAOpinion of the CourtIVAWe turn finally, and more particularly, to the reasons whywe conclude that EPA properly exercised its statutory authority in this case. ADEC urges that, even if the Actallows the Agency to issue stop-construction orders when astate permitting authority unreasonably determines BACT,EPA acted impermissibly in this instance. See Brief forPetitioner 39-48. We note, first, EPA's threshold objection.ADEC's petition to this Court questioned whether the Actaccorded EPA oversight authority with respect to a State'sBACT determination. Pet. for Cert. 13-22. ADEC did notpresent, as a discrete issue, the question whether EPA, as-suming it had authority to review the substance of a stateBACT determination, nevertheless abused its authority bycountermanding ADEC's permit for the Red Dog Mineexpansion. See Brief for Respondents 44-45; cf. ReplyBrief for Petitioner 15-16, n. 12 ("EPA asserts authorityto overturn only `arbitrary or unreasoned' state BACTdeterminations. . . . Thus, whether the State issued a reasoned justification is `fairly included' within the question presented[.]"). Treating the case-specific issue as embracedwithin the sole question presented, we are satisfied that EPAdid not act arbitrarily in finding that ADEC furnished notenable accounting for its determination that Low NOx wasBACT for MG-17.Because the Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial review in this instance,18 we apply the familiar defaultstandard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C.$ 706(2)(A), and ask whether the Agency's action was "arbi18 The Court of Appeals referred to 42 U. S. C. $ 7607(d)(9)(A) when itconsidered whether EPA's decision was "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse ofdiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 298 F. 3d 814, 822(CA9 2002). Section 7607(d)(9), however, applies only to the "subsection"concerning rulemaking in which it is embedded.540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN497Cite as: 540 U. S. 461 (2004)Opinion of the Courttrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not inaccordance with law." Even when an agency explains itsdecision with "less than ideal clarity," a reviewing court willnot upset the decision on that account "if the agency's pathmay reasonably be discerned." Bowman Transp., Inc. v.Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286(1974). EPA's three skeletal orders to ADEC and Comincosurely are not composed with ideal clarity. These orders,however, are properly read together with accompanying explanatory correspondence from EPA; so read, the Agency'scomments and orders adequately ground the determinationthat ADEC's acceptance of Low NOx for MG-17 was unreasonable given the facts ADEC found.In the two draft permits and the final permit, ADECformally followed the EPA-recommended top-down methodology to determine BACT, as Cominco had done in its application. App. 61, 109, 175; see supra, at 475-476. Employing that methodology in the May 1999 draft permit, ADECfirst concluded that SCR was the most stringent emissioncontrol technology that was both "technically and economically feasible." App. 65; see supra, at 476. That technology should have been designated BACT absent "technicalconsiderations, or energy, environmental, or economic impacts justif[ying] a conclusion that [SCR was] not `achievable' in [this] case." New Source Review Manual, p. B.2;App. 61-62. ADEC nevertheless selected Low NOx asBACT; ADEC did so in May 1999 based on Cominco's suggestion that fitting all Red Dog Mine generators with Low NOxwould reduce aggregate emissions. Id., at 87, 111-112; seesupra, at 476-477.In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejectedSCR as BACT but no longer relied on Cominco's suggestionthat it could reduce aggregate emissions by equipping allgenerators with Low NOx. See supra, at 478-480. ADECcandidly stated that it aimed "[t]o support Cominco's RedDog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contri540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN498 ALASKA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTALCONSERVATION v. EPAOpinion of the Courtbutions to the region." App. 208. In these second andthird rounds, ADEC rested its selection of Low NOxsquarely and solely on SCR's "disproportionate cost." Id.,at 116; id., at 112-117, 203-208; supra, at 478-480.EPA concluded that ADEC's switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economicallyinfeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record. See App. 138. In the September and December 1999technical analyses, ADEC acknowledged that "no judgment[could then] be made as to the impact of [SCR's] cost on theoperation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red DogMine." Id., at 116, 207. ADEC nevertheless concludedthat SCR would threaten both the Red Dog Mine's "uniqueand continuing impact on the economic diversity" of northwest Alaska and the mine's "world competitiveness." Id., at208. ADEC also stressed the mine's role as employer in anarea with "historical high unemployment and limited permanent year-round job opportunities." Id., at 207.We do not see how ADEC, having acknowledged that nodetermination "[could] be made as to the impact of [SCR's]cost on the operation . . . and competitiveness of the [mine],"ibid., could simultaneously proffer threats to the mine's operation or competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible. ADEC, indeed, forthrightly explainedwhy it was disarmed from reaching any judgment onwhether, or to what extent, implementation of SCR wouldadversely affect the mine's operation or profitability: Cominco had declined to provide the relevant financial data, disputing the need for such information and citing "confidentiality" concerns, id., at 134; see supra, at 479-480; 298 F. 3d,at 823 ("Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstratingthat SCR was economically infeasible."). No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR for its newgenerator, would be obliged to cut personnel or raise zincprices. Absent evidence of that order, ADEC lacked cause540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN499Cite as: 540 U. S. 461 (2004)Opinion of the Courtfor selecting Low NOx as BACT based on the more stringentcontrol's impact on the mine's operation or competitiveness.Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice of Low NOx.To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADECinvoked four BACT determinations made in regard to dieselgenerators used for primary power production; BACT's cost,in those instances, ranged from $0 to $936 per ton of nitrogenoxide removed. App. 205-206; supra, at 480. ADEC itself,however, had previously found SCR's per-ton cost, then estimated as $2,279, to be "well within what ADEC and EPAconsiders economically feasible." App. 84; cf.id., at 204 (estimating SCR's per ton cost to be $2,100). No reasoned explanation for ADEC's retreat from this position appears inthe final permit. See id., at 138 ("[SCR's cost falls] wellwithin the range of costs EPA has seen permitting authorities nationwide accept as economically feasible for NOx control except where there are compelling site specific factorsthat indicate otherwise."). Tellingly, as to examples of lowcost BACT urged by Cominco, ADEC acknowledged: "Thecited examples of engines permitted in Alaska without requiring SCR are not valid examples as they either took placeover 18 months ago or were not used for similar purposes."Id., at 233-234 (footnote omitted). ADEC added that it hasindeed "permitted [Alaska] projects requiring SCR." Id., at234. Further, EPA rejected ADEC's comparison betweenthe mine and a rural utility, see supra, at 479, because "nofacts exist to suggest that the `economic impact' of the incrementally higher cost of SCR on the world's largest producerof zinc concentrates would be anything like its impact on arural, non-profit utility that must pass costs on to a smallbase of individual consumers," Brief for Respondents 49;App. 138-139 (similar observation in Nov. 10, 1999, EPAletter).ADEC's basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to areadiness "[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine ProductionRate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region."540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN500 ALASKA DEPT.

Th is justificati on, however, hardly meetsADEC's own standard of a "source-specific . . . economic impac[t] which demonstrate[s] [SCR] to be inappropriate asBACT." Id., at 177. In short, as the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADEC'sBACT designation simply did not qualify as reasonable inlight of the statutory guides.In its briefs to this Court, ADEC nonetheless justifies itsselection of Low NOx as BACT for MG-17 on the groundthat lower aggregate emissions would result from Cominco's"agree[ment] to install Low NOx on all its generators."Brief for Petitioner 42, and n. 12 (emphasis added); id., at 29;Reply Brief for Petitioner 19, n. 16. We need not dwell onADEC's attempt to resurrect Cominco's emissions-offsettingsuggestion, see supra, at 477, adopted in the initial May 1999draft permit, but thereafter dropped. As ADEC acknowledges, the final PSD permit did not offset MG-17's emissionsagainst those of the mine's six existing generators, installations that were not subject to BACT. Brief for Petitioner42, n. 12; App. 149. ADEC recognized in September andDecember 1999 that a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one "bubble" 19 forPSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is "part of the permit action." Id., at 111, 199. Offsetting new emissions against those from any of the mine'sother generators, ADEC agreed, "[was] not a considerationof the BACT review provided for by the applicable law orguidelines," for those generators remained outside the permit's compass. Id., at 112, 199. ADEC plainly did not, andcould not, base its December 10, 1999, permit and technicalanalysis on an emissions-offsetting rationale drawing in gen19 Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

BWe emphasize that today's disposition does not impedeADEC from revisiting the BACT determination in question.In letters and orders throughout the permitting process,EPA repeatedly commented that it was open to ADEC toprepare "an appropriate record" supporting its selection ofLow NOx as BACT. Tr. of Oral Arg. 35; see App. 127 (attachment to Sept. 28, 1999, EPA letter to ADEC, stating "ananalysis of whether requiring Cominco to install and operate[SCR] would have any adverse economic impacts upon Com-inco specifically" might demonstrate SCR's economic infeasibility); id., at 150 (letter accompanying EPA's Dec. 10, 1999,finding of noncompliance and order reiterating the Agency'swillingness to "review and consider any additional informa-tion or analyses provided by ADEC or Cominco" on LowNOx as BACT); App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a (EPA Dec. 10,1999, order inviting ADEC to justify its choice of Low NOxby "document[ing] why SCR is not BACT [for MG-17]"); id.,at 49a (similar statement in Feb. 8, 2000, order). At oralargument, counsel for EPA reaffirmed that, "absolutely,"ADEC could reconsider the matter and, on an "appropriate20 The May 4, 1999, draft permit considered whether adding Low NOxto seven generators would result in lower emissions than adding SCR toonly two and choosing one of the latter as a standby unit. App. 86-87.Before December 10, 1999, however, Cominco agreed to install Low NOxcontrols on four of the mine's six existing generators--MG-1, MG-3,MG-4, and MG-5--in order to increase use of those generators withoutexceeding the 1994 PSD permit's operating restriction. Id., at 149. Having agreed to use Low NOx on four generators, Cominco could proposein the December 10, 1999, permit only the addition of Low NOx to twogenerators--MG-2 and MG-6--to offset increases in emissions from MG-17. No facts in the record support any suggestion that addition of LowNOx to three generators, MG-2, MG-6, and MG-17, would result in loweraggregate emissions than the addition of SCR to MG-17 alone.540US2 Unit: $U15 [10-27-05 21:21:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN502 ALASKA DEPT.
