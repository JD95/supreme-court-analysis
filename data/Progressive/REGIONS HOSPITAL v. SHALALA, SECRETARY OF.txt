Section 9202(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Rec-onciliation Amendments of 1985, Pub. L. 99-272, 100 Stat.151, 171-175, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(h) (GME Amendment),522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the Courtprovides: "The Secretary [of Health and Human Services]shall determine, for the hospital's cost reporting period thatbegan during fiscal year 1984, the average amount recog-nized as reasonable under this subchapter for direct graduatemedical education costs of the hospital for each full-time-equivalent resident." $ 1395ww(h)(2)(A). The Amendmentdirects the Secretary to use the 1984 amount, adjusted forinflation, to calculate a hospital's graduate medical education(GME) reimbursement for subsequent years. $ 1395ww(h)(2). The Secretary interprets the GME Amendment to permit a second audit of the 1984 GME costs to ensure accuratefuture reimbursements, even though the GME costs had beenaudited previously. 42 CFR $ 413.86(e) (1996). This casepresents the question whether the Secretary's "reaudit" ruleis a reasonable interpretation of the GME Amendment.We conclude that it is.IAUnder the Medicare Act and its implementing regula-tions, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395 et seq., the costs of certain educational programs for interns and residents, known as GMEprograms, are "allowable cost[s]" for which a hospital (a provider) may receive reimbursement. 42 CFR $ 413.85(a)(1996). At the close of each fiscal year, the provider prepares a "cost repor[t]." $ 405.1801(b). That report, whichserves as the basis for its total allowable Medicare reimbursement, shows the provider's costs and the percentageof those costs allocated to Medicare services. $$ 413.20(b),413.24(f ). The provider files the report with a "fiscal inter-mediary," usually an insurance company, designated by theSecretary. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395h. The intermediary exam-ines the cost report, audits it when found necessary, andissues a written "notice of amount of program reimburse-ment" (NAPR). The NAPR determines the total amountpayable to the provider for Medicare services during522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN453Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the Courtthe reporting period, 42 CFR $ 405.1803 (1996), and is subjectto review by the Provider Reimbursement Review Board(PRRB), the Secretary, and ultimately the courts. See 42U. S. C. $$ 1395oo(a), (b), (f)(1); 42 CFR $$ 405.1835, 405.1837(1996).By regulation, the Secretary may reopen, within threeyears, any determination by a fiscal intermediary, the PRRB,or the Secretary herself "to revise any matter in issue atany such proceedings." $ 405.1885(a). In other words, theSecretary can recoup excessive (or correct insufficient) reimbursement for a given year so long as the Secretary actswithin the three-year reopening window.In April 1986, Congress changed the method for calculating reimbursable GME costs. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(h).In lieu of discrete annual determinations of "reasonable cost. . . actually incurred," $ 1395x(v)(1)(A), Congress designateda baseline year, 1984, for cost determinations, i. e., costs "recognized as reasonable" for that year would serve as the basefigure used to calculate GME reimbursements for all subsequent years. The GME Amendment directed the Secretaryto determine a per-resident amount by dividing each provider's 1984 GME costs "recognized as reasonable" by the number of full-time-equivalent residents working for the provider in 1984. $ 1395ww(h)(2)(A). The 1984 per-residentamount, adjusted for inflation, would then be used to determine the provider's GME reimbursements for all fiscal years"beginning on or after July 1, 1985." Note following 42U. S. C. $ 1395ww, p. 1131. The provider's reimbursablecosts for a particular year would be computed by multiplyingthe inflation-adjusted 1984 per-resident amount by the provider's weighted number of full-time-equivalent residents, asdetermined by $ 1395ww(h)(4), and the hospital's Medicarepatient load, $ 1395ww(h)(3)(C).In September 1988, the Secretary published a proposedregulation to implement the GME Amendment. At that522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the Courttime, the Secretary reported reason to believe some "ques-tionable" GME costs had been "erroneously reimbursed" toproviders for their 1984 fiscal year, the period Congress des-ignated in 1986 to serve continually as the base year. 53Fed. Reg. 36591 (1988). To prevent perpetuation of pastmistakes under the new GME cost-reimbursement methodology, the Secretary proposed to give fiscal intermediaries re-auditing authority to ensure that future payments would bebased on an "accurate" determination of providers' 1984GME costs.Id., at 36591-36592. The final regulation, pub-lished in September 1989, instructs intermediaries to verifyeach hospital's base-year GME costs and its average numberof full-time-equivalent residents; exclude from those baseyear GME costs "any nonallowable or misclassified costs, in-cluding those previously allowed under . . . this chapter";and, upon the hospital's request, include GME costs misclas-sified as operating costs during the base period. 42 CFR$$ 413.86(e)(1)(ii)(A)-(C) (1996).The Secretary made clear that the reaudit rule permittedno recoupment of excess reimbursement for years in whichthe reimbursement determination had become final. 54 Fed.Reg. 40302 (1989). Rather, the rule sought to prevent fu-ture overpayments and to permit recoupment of prior excessreimbursement only for years in which the reimbursementdetermination had not yet become final. Id., at 40301,40302; 42 CFR $ 413.86(e)(1)(iii) (1996).BRegions Hospital (Hospital), the petitioner, is a teachinghospital eligible for GME cost reimbursement.1 On February 28, 1986, the Hospital received from its intermediary anNAPR for the 1984 reporting period which reflected total1984 GME costs of $9,892,644. A reaudit commenced in late1 When the petitioner filed its petition and briefs with the Court, itwas known as "St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center." It changed its name to"Regions Hospital" on September 15, 1997.522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the Court1990 ultimately yielded a determination that the Hospital'stotal allowable 1984 GME costs were $5,916,868. The recomputed average per-resident amount was $49,805, in contrast to the original $70,662. The Secretary sought to usethis recomputed amount to determine reimbursements forfuture years and past years within the three-year reopeningwindow of $ 405.1885. The reaudit determination would notbe used to recoup excessive reimbursement paid to the Hospital for its 1984 GME costs, for the three-year window hadalready closed on that year.On appeal to the PRRB, the Hospital challenged the validity of the reaudit rule. The PRRB responded that it lackedauthority to invalidate the Secretary's regulation, andthe Hospital sought expedited judicial review under 42U. S. C. $ 1395oo(f)(1). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the District of Minnesota ruledfor the Secretary. Adopting the reasoning of the Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund v. Shalala, 987 F. 2d790 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1064 (1994), the DistrictCourt concluded that the language of $ 1395ww(h)(2)(A) wasambiguous, and that the Secretary's reaudit regulation reasonably interpreted Congress' prescription. The DistrictCourt also held that the reauditing did not impose an impermissible "retroactive rule." App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a-8a.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed ina per curiam opinion, following Tulane. St. Paul-RamseyMedical Center, Inc. v. Shalala, 91 F. 3d 57 (1996). In asimilar case, the Sixth Circuit, rejecting Tulane, saw no ambiguity in the GME Amendment and alternately held thateven if the provision lacked clarity, the Secretary's interpretation was unreasonable. Toledo Hospital v. Shalala, 104F. 3d 791, 797-801 (1997), cert. pending, No. 96-2046. Wegranted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 520 U. S. 1250(1997), and now affirm the Eighth Circuit's judgment.522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the CourtIIThe Hospital argues that the Secretary's reaudit regula-tion is an impermissible retroactive rule and, on that accountalone, is invalid. It is an argument we need not linger over.Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244 (1994), ex-plained that " `the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily beassessed under the law that existed when the conduct tookplace,' " id., at 265 (quoting Kaiser Aluminum & ChemicalCorp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 855 (1990) (Scalia, J., concur-ring)), but further clarified that a prescription " `is not maderetroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent factsfor its operation,' " 511 U. S., at 270, n. 24 (quotingCox v. Hart,260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922)). The reaudit rule accords withLandgraf 's instruction. The rule calls for application of thecost-reimbursement principles in effect at the time the costswere incurred. A correct application of those principles, notthe application of any new reimbursement principles, is therule's objective. Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,488 U. S. 204, 207 (1988) (regulation at issue impermissiblyinvoked a new substantive standard as a basis for recoupingsums previously paid to hospitals). Furthermore, the Secretary's reaudits leave undisturbed the actual 1984 reim-bursements and reimbursements for any later cost-reportingyear on which the three-year reopening window had closed.The adjusted reasonable cost figures resulting from the reaudits are to be used solely to calculate reimbursements forstill open and future years. Seesupra, at 454.Understandably, there is no Circuit split on this issue. Al-though holding against the Secretary on other grounds, theSixth Circuit concisely stated why the reaudit rule "does notamount to an impermissibly retroactive regulation": The rule"require[s] a determination based upon events occurring inthe base year," but "it does not change the standards underwhich the base year costs are to be determined."ToledoHospital v. Shalala, 104 F. 3d, at 795.522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIIIWe turn, next, to the question that has divided the Circuits: Is the Secretary's interpretation of $ 1395ww(h)(2)(A),embodied in the reaudit rule, entitled to deference? Underthe formulation now familiar, when we examine the Secretary's rule interpreting a statute, we ask first whether "theintent of Congress is clear" as to "the precise question atissue." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). If, by "employingtraditional tools of statutory construction," id., at 843, n. 9,we determine that Congress' intent is clear, "that is the endof the matter," id., at 842. But "if the statute is silent orambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the questionfor the court is whether the agency's answer is based on apermissible construction of the statute." Id., at 843. If theagency's reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonableway in light of the Legislature's design, we give that readingcontrolling weight, even if it is not the answer "the courtwould have reached if the question initially had arisen in ajudicial proceeding." Id., at 843, n. 11.AWe must decide whether Congress, under $ 1395ww(h)(2)(A), intended to prohibit the Secretary from ensuring anaccurate GME base-year amount by reauditing a provider'sstatement of 1984 GME costs for past errors, outside theSecretary's three-year reopening window. Put another way,does "shall determine" for the baseline year 1984 the"amount recognized as reasonable" inevitably refer to theamount originally, or on reopening within three years, recognized as reasonable; or could the statute plausibly be readto mean, in light of the new methodology making 1984 critical for all subsequent years, an "amount recognized as reasonable" through a reauditing process designed to catch522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN458 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the Courterrors that, if perpetuated, could grossly distort futurereimbursements?Separate provisions of the Medicare Act speak clearly tothe timing of other "recognized as reasonable" determinations. For example, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) permitsthe Secretary to "provide for the establishment of limits[on certain costs] to be recognized as reasonable based onestimates of the costs necessary in the efficient deliveryof needed health services." (Emphasis added.) Section1395uu(c)(1)(B), which concerns payments to promote theclosing or converting of underutilized hospital facilities, directs the Secretary, in determining the hospital's proper"transitional allowance," to acknowledge the "outstandingportion of actual debt obligations previously recognized asreasonable for purposes of reimbursement." (Emphasisadded.)Section 1395ww(h)(2)(A), in contrast, is silent on the matter of time, and therefore, we think, ambiguous. We agreewith the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that "the phrase `recognized as reasonable,' by itself,does not tell us whether Congress means to refer the Secretary to action already taken or to give directions on actionsabout to be taken." Tulane, 987 F. 2d, at 796. In otherwords, the phrase "recognized as reasonable" might meancosts the Secretary (1) has recognized as reasonable for 1984GME cost-reimbursement purposes, or (2) will recognize asreasonable as a base for future GME calculations.The Hospital urges that Congress could not have intended"recognized as reasonable" to mean two separate amounts:one for 1984 itself; and a lower, recalculated amount once theSecretary, cognizant that 1984 had become the base year forsubsequent determinations, checked and discovered miscalculations. Why this must be so is not apparent. As theSecretary said, it is "hard to believe that Congress intendedthat misclassified and nonallowable costs [would] continue to522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN459Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the Courtbe recognized through the GME payment indefinitely." 54Fed. Reg. 40301 (1989).2We face these choices. Congress meant either for the Sec-retary to calculate future reimbursements using the figureemerging through regular NAPR review and the three-yearreopening window, or for the Secretary to use the figure recognized as reasonable at a later time, informed by a morecareful assessment. The Secretary realized, tardily, thatthe Hospital's reimbursement for 1984 (like that grantedmany other providers) was inconsistent with the reasonableness standards under the Medicare Act and its implementingregulations. Congress likely assumed that the Secretarywould act in time to adjust the 1984 costs to achieve accuracyboth in 1984 reimbursements and in future calculations.3Had Congress contemplated that the Secretary would nothave responded to the 1986 GME Amendment swiftlyenough to catch 1984 NAPR errors within the Secretary's2 The Hospital also raises the specter of the Secretary perpetually reauditing the base-year costs. Here, the Secretary had a compelling reason to reaudit the base-year costs, for those costs, under the new GMEscheme, would be projected far into the future. The Administrative Procedure Act, 80 Stat. 392, as amended, 5 U. S. C. $ 701 et seq., which requiresa court to "hold unlawful and set aside agency action" that is "arbitrary" or"capricious," see $ 706(2)(A), should protect the Hospital from any futurereaudits performed without legitimate reason.3 Congress more firmly instructed that the Secretary, no later than December 31, 1987, "shall report" to specific Committees of the Senate andHouse of Representatives on the need for revisions to provide greateruniformity in approved full-time-equivalent resident amounts. The dateset for the report was inside the three-year reopening window. Note following 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww; see post, at 468. Missing the deadline bysome years, the Secretary did not file the required report until March24, 1992. The Secretary's failure to meet the deadline, a not uncommonoccurrence when heavy loads are thrust on administrators, does not meanthat official lacked power to act beyond it. See, e. g., Brock v. PierceCounty, 476 U. S. 253, 260 (1986) (even though the Secretary of Labor didnot meet a "shall" statutory deadline, the Court "would be most reluctantto conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action").522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN460 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the Courtthree-year reopening period, what would the Legislaturehave anticipated as the proper administrative course?Error perpetuation until Congress plugged the hole? Orthe Secretary's exercise of authority to effectuate the Legislature's overriding purpose in the Medicare scheme: reason-able (not excessive or unwarranted) cost reimbursement?While the Hospital's reading of the GME Amendment isplausible, it is not the "only possible interpretation." SeeSullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83, 89 (1990). As JudgeWald wrote in her opinion for the D. C. Circuit: "Context isall, and . . . we believe the use of the 1984 figures for theindefinite future cautions . . . against a reading of [`recognized as reasonable'] that allows no elbow room for adjust-ments [to correct] prior miscalculations or errors." Tulane,987 F. 2d, at 796.4 Because the Hospital's construction isnot an inevitable one,5 we turn to the Secretary's position,examining its reasonableness as an interpretation of the gov-erning legislation.BThe purpose of the GME Amendment was to "limit payments to hospitals" for GME costs. See H. R. Conf. Rep.4 The Hospital contends Congress did not delegate authority to the Secretary specifically to reaudit the 1984 base-year amount, in contrast toits express delegation to "establish rules" for computing the number offull-time-equivalent residents under $ 1395ww(h)(4). But "the concept ofreasonable costs already was a mainstay of Medicare statutes and regulations, [so] there was no need to establish any new rulemaking authorityfor its determination." Tulane, 987 F. 2d, at 795, n. 5 (citations omitted).See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1395x(v)(1)(A), 1395hh(a)(1).5 The dissent acknowledges that, "in isolation the phrase `recognized asreasonable' is ambiguous," post, at 466, but finds clarity when those wordsare read "in their entire context," ibid. We agree that context countsand stress in this regard what the Court has said "[o]ver and over": " `Inexpounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to itsobject and policy.' " United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins.Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993) (quoting United Statesv. Heirs of Boisdore', 8 How. 113, 122 (1849)).522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN461Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the CourtNo. 99-453, p. 482 (1985) (emphasis added). The Secretary'sreaudit rule brings the base-year calculation in line withCongress' pervasive instruction for reasonable cost reim-bursement. The rule does not permit recoupment of anytime-barred 1984 overpayment, but it enables the Secretary,for open and future years, to carry out that official's responsibility to reimburse only reasonable costs, and to prevent pay-ment of uncovered, improperly classified, or excessive costs.See supra, at 454.Until the GME Amendment in 1986, GME costs were determined annually; one year's determination did not control alater year's reimbursement. The GME Amendment, whichcalled for a base-year GME cost determination that wouldcontrol payments in later years, became law at a time whenother Medicare changes were underway, including installa-tion of a new prospective payment system (PPS).6 See 54Fed. Reg. 40301 (1989) (acknowledging that GME costs werenot given prompt scrutiny "because of the many changesthat were taking place in Medicare generally"). The GMEAmendment introduced the new statutory concept of perresident GME costs; it was this innovation that caused theSecretary "to examine GME costs that ha[d] been reimbursed in the past and to question the significant variationin costs that ha[d] been allowed." 53 Fed. Reg. 36593 (1988).Concerned that providers may have been reimbursed erro-neously, the Secretary attempted to assure reimbursementin future and still open years of reasonable costs, but nomore. To accomplish this, the Secretary endeavored to stripfrom the base-period amount improper costs,e. g., physiciancosts for activities unrelated to the GME program, malprac6 The PPS scheme established fixed payment rates, based on patientdiagnosis, for a provider's operating costs of furnishing in-patient careto program beneficiaries. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(d); Good SamaritanHospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S. 402, 406, n. 3 (1993). Costs incurred inconnection with GME programs were excluded from the PPS scheme. 42U. S. C. $$ 1395ww(a)(4) and (d)(1)(A).522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN462 REGIONS HOSPITAL v. SHALALAOpinion of the Courttice costs, and excessive administrative and general servicecosts. The Secretary so proceeded on the assumption thatCongress, when it changed the system for GME cost reim-bursement, surely did not want to cement misclassified andnonallowable costs into future reimbursements, thus perpetuating literally million-dollar mistakes.The Hospital maintains it is "irrational" to assume Congress intended the Secretary to reaudit 1984 GME costsoutside the three-year reopening window of 42 CFR$ 405.1885(a) (1996). We disagree. Because the period forreassessing 1984 NAPRs had closed, the Secretary's reauditing rule, by design, could affect only the base-year perresident calculation used to compute reimbursements from1985 onward. In effect, the Secretary altered the reopeningperiod prescribed in the agency's regulations by lengtheningthe time for base-year GME cost correction. The Secretarydid not enlarge the time the agency had to seek repayment ofexcess reimbursements in years closed under the three-yearprescription; rather, the Secretary extended only the timefor determining the proper amount of reimbursement due insubsequent years.The GME Amendment necessitated comprehensive regulations, and the reaudit rule was formulated and issued aspart of the full set of regulations. Viewed in the context ofother, contemporaneous changes in Medicare and the Secretary's decision not to pursue recoupment of 1984 GME reimbursements, the three-year gap from the 1986 enactment ofthe GME Amendment to release of the Secretary's final regulations in 1989 was not exorbitant. As the D. C. Circuitsaid, three years is "not an unreasonable period for developing, proposing, permitting comment, and finalizing a regulatory framework for a complex statutory scheme." Tulane,987 F. 2d, at 797.The Hospital also contends Congress would not have endorsed reauditing as a fair measure, because fading memories, changes in personnel, and discarded records make it522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 522 U. S. 448 (1998)Opinion of the Courtunreasonable to demand that providers "reprove" theirbase-year GME costs. We note these countervailing considerations. Providers can challenge the accuracy of specificauditing principles in individual cases. 42 CFR $ 413.86(e)(1)(v) (1996). Providers dissatisfied with the Secretary'sdetermination may seek judicial review under 42 U. S. C.$ 1395oo(f)(1). For providers who discarded their 1984 rec-ords, the Secretary offered "an equitable solution" permitting them, during the reaudit, "to furnish documentationfrom cost reporting periods subsequent to the base period insupport of the allocation of physician compensation costs inthe GME bas[e] period." See 55 Fed. Reg. 36063 (1990).7Furthermore, the reaudit rule allowed providers to requestupward adjustment in their reimbursable PPS hospitalspecific rate if the GME reaudit revealed previously claimedGME costs that should have been classified as operatingcosts eligible for PPS reimbursement. 42 CFR $ 413.86( j)(1)(i) (1996).Finally, the Hospital argues that because 42 CFR$$ 405.1807 and 405.1885(a) (1996) render an intermediary'sdetermination "final and binding" after three years, the Sec-retary's reaudit regulation violates principles of issue preclusion. The initial 1984 GME cost determination, however,was made under the pre-GME Amendment regime, when"final and binding" referred only to year-by-year determina-tion. An issue determined for one year (1984 only) is notthe same as a base-year determination to be carried forwardinto the unlimited future. Furthermore, the base-year costcalculation was derived from an intermediary's determina-tion in an NAPR, without a hearing before the PRRB on thereasonableness of the costs. Absent actual and adversarial7 In fact, the Hospital took advantage of the Secretary's "equitable solution." Because the Hospital did not maintain base-year records reflectingphysician time for teaching medical students, it used 1989 and 1990 timestudies in endeavoring to establish the accuracy of its allocation of 1984GME costs.522US2 Unit: $U26 [02-06-00 16:01:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 REGIONS HOSPITAL v.
