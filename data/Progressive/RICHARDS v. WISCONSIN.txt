In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), we held thatthe Fourth Amendment incorporates the common-law requirement that police officers entering a dwelling must knockon the door and announce their identity and purpose beforeattempting forcible entry. At the same time, we recognizedthat the "flexible requirement of reasonableness should notbe read to mandate a rigid rule of announcement that ignorescountervailing law enforcement interests,"id., at 934, andleft "to the lower courts the task of determining the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonableunder the Fourth Amendment,"id., at 936.In this case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court concluded thatpolice officers are never required to knock and announcetheir presence when executing a search warrant in a felony*Tracey Maclin, Steven R.

In so doing, it reaffirmed a pre-Wilsonholding and concluded that Wilson did not preclude this perse rule. We disagree with the court's conclusion that theFourth Amendment permits a blanket exception to theknock-and-announce requirement for this entire category ofcriminal activity. But because the evidence presented tosupport the officers' actions in this case establishes that thedecision not to knock and announce was a reasonable oneunder the circumstances, we affirm the judgment of the Wis-consin court.IOn December 31, 1991, police officers in Madison, Wiscon-sin, obtained a warrant to search Steiney Richards' motelroom for drugs and related paraphernalia. The search war-rant was the culmination of an investigation that had uncovered substantial evidence that Richards was one of severalindividuals dealing drugs out of hotel rooms in Madison.The police requested a warrant that would have given ad-vance authorization for a "no-knock" entry into the motelroom, but the Magistrate explicitly deleted those portions ofthe warrant. App. 7, 9.The officers arrived at the motel room at 3:40 a.m. OfficerPharo, dressed as a maintenance man, led the team. Withhim were several plainclothes officers and at least one manin uniform. Officer Pharo knocked on Richards' door and,responding to the query from inside the room, stated that hewas a maintenance man. With the chain still on the door,Richards cracked it open. Although there is some disputeas to what occurred next, Richards acknowledges that whenhe opened the door he saw the man in uniform standingbehind Officer Pharo. Brief for Petitioner 6. He quicklyslammed the door closed and, after waiting two or three sec-onds, the officers began kicking and ramming the door togain entry to the locked room. At trial, the officers testifiedthat they identified themselves as police while they werekicking the door in. App. 40. When they finally did break520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)Opinion of the Courtinto the room, the officers caught Richards trying to escapethrough the window. They also found cash and cocaine hidden in plastic bags above the bathroom ceiling tiles.Richards sought to have the evidence from his motel roomsuppressed on the ground that the officers had failed toknock and announce their presence prior to forcing entry intothe room. The trial court denied the motion, concludingthat the officers could gather from Richards' strange behav-ior when they first sought entry that he knew they werepolice officers and that he might try to destroy evidence orto escape.Id., at 54. The judge emphasized that the easilydisposable nature of the drugs the police were searching forfurther justified their decision to identify themselves as theycrossed the threshold instead of announcing their presencebefore seeking entry. Id., at 55. Richards appealed thedecision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and that courtaffirmed. 201 Wis. 2d 845, 549 N. W. 2d 218 (1996).The Wisconsin Supreme Court did not delve into theevents underlying Richards' arrest in any detail, but accepted the following facts: "[O]n December 31, 1991, policeexecuted a search warrant for the motel room of the defendant seeking evidence of the felonious crime of Possessionwith Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance in violation ofWis. Stat. $ 161.41(1m) (1991-92). They did not knock andannounce prior to their entry. Drugs were seized." Id., at849, 549 N. W. 2d, at 220.Assuming these facts, the court proceeded to considerwhether our decision in Wilson required the court to abandon its decision in State v. Stevens, 181 Wis. 2d 410, 511 N. W.2d 591 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U. S. 1102 (1995), which heldthat "when the police have a search warrant, supported byprobable cause, to search a residence for evidence of deliveryof drugs or evidence of possession with intent to deliverdrugs, they necessarily have reasonable cause to believe exigent circumstances exist" to justify a no-knock entry. 201Wis. 2d, at 852, 549 N. W. 2d, at 221. The court concluded520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 RICHARDS v. WISCONSINOpinion of the Courtthat nothing in Wilson's acknowledgment that the knock-and-announce rule was an element of the Fourth Amendment"reasonableness" requirement would prohibit application ofa per se exception to that rule in a category of cases. 201Wis. 2d, at 854-855, 549 N. W. 2d, at 220.In reaching this conclusion, the Wisconsin court found itreasonable--after considering criminal conduct surveys,newspaper articles, and other judicial opinions--to assumethat all felony drug crimes will involve "an extremely highrisk of serious if not deadly injury to the police as well asthe potential for the disposal of drugs by the occupants priorto entry by the police."Id., at 847-848, 549 N. W. 2d, at 219.Notwithstanding its acknowledgment that in "some cases,police officers will undoubtedly decide that their safety, thesafety of others, and the effective execution of the warrantdictate that they knock and announce," id., at 863, 549 N. W.2d, at 225, the court concluded that exigent circumstancesjustifying a no-knock entry are always present in felony drugcases. Further, the court reasoned that the violation of privacy that occurs when officers who have a search warrantforcibly enter a residence without first announcing theirpresence is minimal, given that the residents would ulti-mately be without authority to refuse the police entry. Theprincipal intrusion on individual privacy interests in such asituation, the court concluded, comes from the issuance of thesearch warrant, not the manner in which it is executed. Id.,at 864-865, 549 N. W. 2d, at 226. Accordingly, the court determined that police in Wisconsin do not need specific infor-mation about dangerousness, or the possible destruction ofdrugs in a particular case, in order to dispense with theknock-and-announce requirement in felony drug cases.11 Several other state courts--in cases that predate our decision in Wilson--have adopted similar rules, concluding that simple probable cause tosearch a home for narcotics always allows the police to forgo the knockand-announce requirement. See, e. g., People v. Lujan, 484 P. 2d 1238,1241 (Colo. 1971) (en banc); Henson v. State, 236 Md. 519, 523-524, 204 A.520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)Opinion of the CourtJustice Abrahamson concurred in the judgment because,in her view, the facts found by the trial judge justified ano-knock entry. Id., at 866-868, 549 N. W. 2d, at 227. Spe-cifically, she noted that Richards' actions in slamming thedoor when he saw the uniformed man standing behind Offi-cer Pharo indicated that he already knew that the peopleknocking on his door were police officers. Under these cir-cumstances, any further announcement of their presencewould have been a useless gesture. Id., at 868-869, n. 3, 549N. W. 2d, at 228, n. 3. While agreeing with the outcome,Justice Abrahamson took issue with her colleagues' affirma-tion of the blanket exception to the knock-and-announce requirement in drug felony cases. She observed that the con-stitutional reasonableness of a search has generally been amatter left to the court, rather than to the officers who con-ducted the search, and she objected to the creation of a blanket rule that insulated searches in a particular category ofcrime from the neutral oversight of a reviewing judge. Id.,at 868-875, 549 N. W. 2d, at 228-230.IIWe recognized in Wilson that the knock-and-announce re-quirement could give way "under circumstances presentinga threat of physical violence," or "where police officers havereason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed ifadvance notice were given." 514 U. S., at 936. It is indis-putable that felony drug investigations may frequently involve both of these circumstances.2 The question we must2d 516, 519-520 (1964); State v. Loucks, 209 N. W. 2d 772, 777-778 (N. D.1973). Cf. People v. De Lago, 16 N. Y. 2d 289, 292, 213 N. E. 2d 659, 661(1965) (similar rule for searches related to gambling operations), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 963 (1966).2 This Court has encountered before the links between drugs and violence, see, e. g., Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 702 (1981), and thelikelihood that drug dealers will attempt to dispose of drugs before policeseize them, see, e. g., Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 28, n. 3 (1963).520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 RICHARDS v. WISCONSINOpinion of the Courtresolve is whether this fact justifies dispensing with caseby-case evaluation of the manner in which a search wasexecuted.3The Wisconsin court explained its blanket exception as necessitated by the special circumstances of today's drug culture, 201 Wis. 2d, at 863-866, 549 N. W. 2d, at 226-227, andthe State asserted at oral argument that the blanket exception was reasonable in "felony drug cases because of the convergence in a violent and dangerous form of commerce ofweapons and the destruction of drugs." Tr. of Oral Arg.26. But creating exceptions to the knock-and-announce rulebased on the "culture" surrounding a general category ofcriminal behavior presents at least two serious concerns.43 Although our decision in Wilson did not address this issue directly, itis instructive that in that case--which involved a felony drug investigation--we remanded to the state court for further factual development todetermine whether the no-knock entry was reasonable under the circumstances of the case. Two amicus briefs in Wilson suggested that weadopt just the sort of per se rule the Wisconsin court propounded here.Brief for Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Inc., et al. as AmiciCuriae 10-11, Brief for Wayne County, Michigan, as Amicus Curiae 39-46, in Wilson v. Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707.

Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707, p. 11, and amicisupporting the petitioner also presented arguments against a categoricalrule. Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae inWilson v. Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707, p. 29, n. 44. Thus, while theprospect of a categorical rule was one to which we were alerted in Wilson,we did not choose to adopt such a rule at that time.4 It is always somewhat dangerous to ground exceptions to constitutionalprotections in the social norms of a given historical moment. The purposeof the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness "is to preservethat degree of respect for the privacy of persons and the inviolability oftheir property that existed when the provision was adopted--even if alater, less virtuous age should become accustomed to considering all sortsof intrusion `reasonable.' " Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U. S. 366, 380(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring).520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)Opinion of the CourtFirst, the exception contains considerable overgeneraliza-tion. For example, while drug investigation frequently doespose special risks to officer safety and the preservation ofevidence, not every drug investigation will pose these risksto a substantial degree. For example, a search could be con-ducted at a time when the only individuals present in a residence have no connection with the drug activity and thuswill be unlikely to threaten officers or destroy evidence. Orthe police could know that the drugs being searched for wereof a type or in a location that made them impossible to destroy quickly. In those situations, the asserted governmen-tal interests in preserving evidence and maintaining safetymay not outweigh the individual privacy interests intrudedupon by a no-knock entry.5 Wisconsin's blanket rule impermissibly insulates these cases from judicial review.A second difficulty with permitting a criminal-category exception to the knock-and-announce requirement is that the5 The State asserts that the intrusion on individual interests effectuatedby a no-knock entry is minimal because the execution of the warrant itselfconstitutes the primary intrusion on individual privacy and that the individual privacy interest cannot outweigh the generalized governmental interest in effective and safe law enforcement. Brief for Respondent 21-24.See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 ("occupants' privacyinterest is necessarily limited to the brief interval between the officers'announcement and their entry"). While it is true that a no-knock entryis less intrusive than, for example, a warrantless search, the individualinterests implicated by an unannounced, forcible entry should not be unduly minimized. As we observed in Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927,930-932 (1995), the common law recognized that individuals should beprovided the opportunity to comply with the law and to avoid the destruction of property occasioned by a forcible entry. These interests are notinconsequential.Additionally, when police enter a residence without announcing theirpresence, the residents are not given any opportunity to prepare themselves for such an entry. The State pointed out at oral argument that, inWisconsin, most search warrants are executed during the late night andearly morning hours. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. The brief interlude betweenannouncement and entry with a warrant may be the opportunity that anindividual has to pull on clothes or get out of bed.520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 RICHARDS v. WISCONSINOpinion of the Courtreasons for creating an exception in one category can,relatively easily, be applied to others. Armed bank robbers,for example, are, by definition, likely to have weapons, andthe fruits of their crime may be destroyed without too muchdifficulty. If a per se exception were allowed for eachcategory of criminal investigation that included a consider-able--albeit hypothetical--risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of theFourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement would bemeaningless.Thus, the fact that felony drug investigations may frequently present circumstances warranting a no-knock entrycannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of a reviewing courtthe reasonableness of the police decision not to knock andannounce in a particular case. Instead, in each case, it isthe duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particularentry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announcerequirement.In order to justify a "no-knock" entry, the police must havea reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing theirpresence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destructionof evidence. This standard--as opposed to a probable-causerequirement--strikes the appropriate balance between thelegitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interestsaffected by no-knock entries. Cf. Maryland v. Buie, 494U. S. 325, 337 (1990) (allowing a protective sweep of a houseduring an arrest where the officers have "a reasonable beliefbased on specific and articulable facts that the area to beswept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on thearrest scene"); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 30 (1968) (requiringa reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify apatdown search). This showing is not high, but the police520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)Opinion of the Courtshould be required to make it whenever the reasonablenessof a no-knock entry is challenged.IIIAlthough we reject the Wisconsin court's blanket excep-tion to the knock-and-announce requirement, we concludethat the officers' no-knock entry into Richards' motel roomdid not violate the Fourth Amendment. We agree with thetrial court, and with Justice Abrahamson, that the circum-stances in this case show that the officers had a reasonablesuspicion that Richards might destroy evidence if given fur-ther opportunity to do so.6The judge who heard testimony at Richards' suppressionhearing concluded that it was reasonable for the officers executing the warrant to believe that Richards knew, after open-ing the door to his motel room the first time, that the menseeking entry to his room were the police. App. 54. Oncethe officers reasonably believed that Richards knew whothey were, the court concluded, it was reasonable for themto force entry immediately given the disposable nature of thedrugs. Id., at 55.In arguing that the officers' entry was unreasonable, Richards places great emphasis on the fact that the Magistrate whosigned the search warrant for his motel room deleted theportions of the proposed warrant that would have given theofficers permission to execute a no-knock entry. But thisfact does not alter the reasonableness of the officers' deci-sion, which must be evaluated as of the time they enteredthe motel room. At the time the officers obtained the war-rant, they did not have evidence sufficient, in the judgmentof the Magistrate, to justify a no-knock warrant. Of course,6 We note that the attorneys general of 26 States, the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico, and the Territory of Guam filed an amicus brief taking theposition that the officers' decision was reasonable under the specific factsof this case, but rejecting Wisconsin's per se rule. See Brief for Ohio etal. as Amici Curiae.520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 RICHARDS v. WISCONSINOpinion of the Courtthe Magistrate could not have anticipated in every particu-lar the circumstances that would confront the officers whenthey arrived at Richards' motel room.7 These actual cir-cumstances--petitioner's apparent recognition of the officerscombined with the easily disposable nature of the drugs--justified the officers' ultimate decision to enter without firstannouncing their presence and authority.Accordingly, although we reject the blanket exception tothe knock-and-announce requirement for felony drug investi-gations, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court isaffirmed.
