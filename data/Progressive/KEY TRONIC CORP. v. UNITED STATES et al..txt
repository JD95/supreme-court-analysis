Petitioner Key Tronic Corporation, one of several partiesresponsible for contaminating a landfill, brought this actionto recover a share of its cleanup costs from other responsi-ble parties. The question presented is whether attorney'sfees are "necessary costs of response" within the meaningof $ 107(a)(4)(B) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA),as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, and therefore re-coverable in such an action.IDuring the 1970's Key Tronic and other parties, includingthe United States Air Force, disposed of liquid chemicals atthe Colbert Landfill in eastern Washington State. In 1980the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) determinedthat the water supply in the surrounding area had beencontaminated by these chemicals. Various lawsuits ensued,including formal proceedings against Key Tronic, the AirForce, and other parties.Two of those proceedings were settled. In one settlementwith WDOE and the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), Key Tronic agreed to contribute $4.2 million to anEPA cleanup fund. In the other, the Air Force agreed topay the EPA $1.45 million. The EPA subsequently releasedthe Air Force from further liability pursuant to CERCLA$ 122(g)(5), 42 U. S. C. $ 9622(g)(5), which provides that a*Rex E. Lee, Carter G. Phillips, Janet M. Letson, Larry G. Gutterridge,and James M.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtparty that has resolved its liability to the United States shallnot be liable for contribution claims regarding matters addressed in the settlement.1Key Tronic thereafter brought this action against theUnited States and other parties seeking to recover part ofits $4.2 million commitment to the EPA in a contributionclaim under CERCLA $ 113(f ), 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f ), and seek-ing an additional $1.2 million for response costs that it incurred before the settlements in a cost recovery claim underCERCLA $ 107(a)(4)(B), 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(B). The $1.2million included attorney's fees for three types of legal serv-ices: (1) the identification of other potentially responsibleparties (PRP's), including the Air Force, that were liable forthe cleanup; (2) preparation and negotiation of its agreementwith the EPA; and (3) the prosecution of this litigation.2The District Court dismissed Key Tronic's $4.2 millioncontribution claim against the Air Force when Key Tronicconceded that $ 122(g)(5) precluded it from recovering anypart of the consent decree obligation.3 Key Tronic's claimfor $1.2 million of additional response costs could be pursuedunder CERCLA $ 107(a)(4)(B), 42 U. S. C. $ 9607, the courtheld, because it related to matters not covered by the Air1 See Administrative Order on Consent and Interagency Agreement || 8,p. 12 (Record, Doc. No. 23, Exh. 1). Paragraph 7(a) of that agreementdefines the term "Covered Matters" to include "any and all civil liabilityfor reimbursement of response costs or for injunctive relief pursuant tosections 106 or 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U. S. C. 9606 or 9607(a), or section7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42U. S. C. 6973, with regard to the Site."2 Key Tronic also sought prejudgment interest against the UnitedStates. The District Court awarded such interest, and the Air Force didnot appeal that award. Other payments the Air Force made to KeyTronic are not in dispute.3 The statutory bar protected only the Air Force from liability. KeyTronic's claim against another defendant, Alumax Fabricated Products,Inc., and Alumax Mill Products, Inc. (collectively Alumax), was deemedmoot when the two parties settled. 766 F.

"Because Congress has not explicitly authorizedprivate litigants to recover their legal expenses incurred ina private cost recovery action," the District Court's awardof attorney's fees could not stand. 984 F. 2d, at 1028.Judge Canby dissented, reasoning that Congress' 1986amendment of the definition of "response" meant to author-ize the recovery of attorney's fees even in private litigants'cost recovery actions. Ibid.Other courts addressing this question have differed overthe extent to which attorney's fees are a necessary cost ofresponse under CERCLA. SeeGeneral Electric Co. v. Litton Industrial Automation Systems, Inc., 920 F. 2d 1415(CA8 1990) (fees recoverable); Donahey v. Bogle, 987 F. 2d1250, 1256 (CA6 1993) (same); Juniper Development Groupv. Kahn, 993 F. 2d 915, 933 (CA1 1993) (litigation fees notrecoverable); FMC Corp. v. Aero Industries, Inc., 998 F. 2d842 (CA10 1993) (only nonlitigation fees may be recoverable).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 510 U. S.1023 (1993).IIAs its name implies, CERCLA is a comprehensive statutethat grants the President broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardouswaste sites. Sections 104 and 106 provide the frameworkfor federal abatement and enforcement actions that the Pres-ident, the EPA as his delegated agent, or the Attorney General initiates. 42 U. S. C. $$ 9604, 9606. These actions typi-cally require private parties to incur substantial costs inremoving hazardous wastes and responding to hazardousconditions. Section 107 sets forth the scope of the liabilitiesthat may be imposed on private parties and the defenses thatthey may assert. 42 U. S. C. $ 9607.Our cases establish that attorney's fees generally are nota recoverable cost of litigation "absent explicit congressionalauthorization." Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 185511us3$63I 11-04-97 20:42:31 PAGES OPINPGT815Cite as: 511 U. S. 809 (1994)Opinion of the Court(1976) (citing Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975)). Recognition of the availability of attorney's fees therefore requires a determinationthat "Congress intended to set aside this longstanding American rule of law." Runyon, 427 U. S., at 185-186. NeitherCERCLA $ 107, the liabilities and defenses provision, nor$ 113, which authorizes contribution claims, expressly mentions the recovery of attorney's fees. The absence of specificreference to attorney's fees is not dispositive if the statuteotherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees. TheEighth Circuit, for example, found "a sufficient degree ofexplicitness" in CERCLA's references to "necessary costs ofresponse" and "enforcement activities" to warrant the awardof attorney's fees and expenses.6 Mere "generalized commands," however, will not suffice to authorize such fees. Id.,at 186.The three components of Key Tronic's claim for attorney'sfees raise somewhat different issues. We first considerwhether the fees for prosecuting this action against the AirForce are recoverable under CERCLA. That depends,again, upon whether the "enforcement activities" included in$ 101(25)'s definition of "response" encompass a private party's action to recover cleanup costs from other PRP's such6 See General Electric Co. v. Litton Industrial Automation Systems,Inc., 920 F. 2d 1415, 1421-1422 (1990). After setting out the relevant language of $$ 107(a)(4)(B) and 101(25), the court concluded that a privateparty cost-recovery action is an enforcement activity within the meaningof the statute, that attorney's fees "necessarily are incurred in this kindof enforcement activity," and that "it would strain the statutory languageto the breaking point to read them out of the `necessary costs' that section9607(a)(4)(B) allows private parties to recover." Ibid. The court's subsequent conclusion that CERCLA authorizes private parties to recover attorney's fees was "based on the statutory language" and was "consistentwith two of the main purposes of CERCLA--prompt cleanup of hazardouswaste sites and imposition of all cleanup costs on the responsible party."Id., at 1422.511us3$63I 11-04-97 20:42:31 PAGES OPINPGT816 KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthat the attorney's fees associated with that action are then"necessary costs of response" within $ 107(a)(4)(B).IIIThe 1986 amendments to CERCLA are the genesis of theterm "enforcement activities"; we begin, therefore, by considering the statutory basis for the claim in the originalCERCLA enactment and the SARA provisions' effect on it.In its original form CERCLA contained no express provisionauthorizing a private party that had incurred cleanup coststo seek contribution from other PRP's. In numerous cases,however, District Courts interpreted the statute--particularly the $ 107 provisions outlining the liabilities and de-fenses of persons against whom the Government may assertclaims--to impliedly authorize such a cause of action.7The 1986 amendments included a provision--CERCLA$ 113(f)--that expressly created a cause of action for contri-bution. See 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f). Other SARA provisions,moreover, appeared to endorse the judicial decisions recog-nizing a cause of action under $ 107 by presupposing thatsuch an action existed. An amendment to $ 107 itself, forexample, refers to "amounts recoverable in an action underthis section." 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(D). The new contri-bution section also contains a reference to a "civil action . . .under section 9607(a)." 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f)(1). Thus thestatute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in $ 113 and impliedly authorizes a similar and some-what overlapping remedy in $ 107.7 In Walls v. Waste Resource Corp., 761 F. 2d 311 (CA6 1985), JudgeMerritt noted that District Courts "have been virtually unanimous" inholding that $ 107(a)(4)(B) creates a private right of action for the recoveryof necessary response costs. Id., at 318 (citing Bulk Distribution Centers,Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 589 F. Supp. 1437, 1442-1444 (SD Fla. 1984); Jonesv. Inmont Corp., 584 F.

S. 809 (1994)Opinion of the CourtAs we have said, neither $ 107 nor $ 113 expressly calls forthe recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party. Incontrast, two SARA provisions contain explicit authority forthe award of attorney's fees. A new provision authorizingprivate citizens to bring suit to enforce the statute, see 100Stat. 1704-1705, expressly authorizes the award of "reasonable attorney and expert witness fees" to the prevailingparty. 42 U. S. C. $ 9659(f). And an amendment to the section authorizing the Attorney General to bring abatementactions provides that a person erroneously ordered to payresponse costs may in some circumstances recover counselfees from the Government. See $ 9606(b)(2)(E).8 Since itsenactment CERCLA also has expressly authorized the re-covery of fees in actions brought by employees claiming discriminatory treatment based on their disclosure of statutoryviolations. See $ 9610(c) ("aggregate amount of all costs andexpenses (including the attorney's fees)" is recoverable).Judicial decisions, rather than explicit statutory text, alsoresolved an issue that arose frequently under the originalversion of CERCLA--that is, whether the award in a government enforcement action seeking to recover cleanup costscould encompass its litigation expenses, including attorney'sfees. Here, too, District Courts generally agreed that suchfees were recoverable.9 Congress arguably endorsed theseholdings, as well, in the SARA provision redefining the term"response" to include related "enforcement activities," 1008 Under this section, the reimbursement that a court awards "may include appropriate costs, fees, and other expenses" in accordance with 28U. S. C. $$ 2412(a) and (d), which outline the procedures by which costs andfees are awarded. Section 2412(d)(2)(A), in particular, defines "fees andother expenses" to include reasonable attorney's fees.9 See, e. g., United States v. South Carolina Recycling & Disposal, Inc.,653 F. Supp. 984, 1009 (S. C. 1984), aff 'd in part and vacated in part, 858F. 2d 160 (CA4 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1106 (1989); United States v.Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co., 579 F.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtStat. 1615.10 Key Tronic contends that a private actionunder $ 107 is one of the enforcement activities covered bythat definition and that fees should therefore be available inprivate litigation as well as in government actions.For three reasons, we are unpersuaded. First, although$ 107 unquestionably provides a cause of action for privateparties to seek recovery of cleanup costs, that cause of actionis not explicitly set out in the text of the statute.11 To conclude that a provision that only impliedly authorizes suitnonetheless provides for attorney's fees with the clarity required by Alyeska would be unusual if not unprecedented.Indeed, none of our cases has authorized fee awards to prevailing parties in such circumstances.Second, Congress included two express provisions for feeawards in SARA without including a similar provision ineither $ 113, which expressly authorizes contribution claims,or in $ 107, which impliedly authorizes private parties torecover cleanup costs from other PRP's. These omissions10 According to the House Committee Report on this amendment,$ 101(25)'s modification of the definition of "response action" to include related enforcement activities "will confirm the EPA's authority to recovercosts for enforcement actions taken against responsible parties." H. R.Rep. No. 99-253, pp. 66-67 (1985).11 Justice Scalia correctly notes that "to say that A shall be liable toB is the express creation of a right of action." Post, at 822. Section 107,however, merely says that "A shall be liable" without revealing to whomA is liable. Sections 104 and 106 plainly indicate that the parties described in $ 107 are liable to the Government. The statute thus expresslyidentifies the Government as a potential plaintiff and only impliedly identifies private parties as the hypothetical B in $ 107 litigation. That $ 107imposes liability on A for costs incurred "by any other person" implies--but does not expressly command--that A may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors. Cf. Texas Industries, Inc.v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 639-640 (1981) (finding no implied right to contribution from other participants in conspiracy violativeof antitrust laws); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S.77, 91-95 (1981) (finding no implied right to contribution under the EqualPay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).511us3$63I 11-04-97 20:42:31 PAGES OPINPGT819Cite as: 511 U. S. 809 (1994)Opinion of the Courtstrongly suggest a deliberate decision not to authorize suchawards.Third, we believe it would stretch the plain terms of thephrase "enforcement activities" too far to construe it as encompassing the kind of private cost recovery action at issuein this case. Though we offer no comment on the extentto which that phrase forms the basis for the Government'srecovery of attorney's fees through $ 107, the term "enforcement activity" is not sufficiently explicit to embody a privateaction under $ 107 to recover cleanup costs.12 Given our adherence to a general practice of not awarding fees to a pre-vailing party absent explicit statutory authority,AlyeskaPipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S., at 262,we conclude that CERCLA $ 107 does not provide for theaward of private litigants' attorney's fees associated withbringing a cost recovery action.13IVThe conclusion we reach with respect to litigation-relatedfees does not signify that all payments that happen to be made12 That characterization undeniably applies to citizen suits brought byprivate parties under $ 310 seeking affirmative relief. Significantly, Congress expressly authorized fee awards in such cases. See 42 U. S. C.$ 9659(f).13 In concluding that a private party may not recover attorney's feesarising from the litigation of a private recovery action, the Tenth Circuitobserved: "We simply cannot agree with those courts that find an explicitauthorization for the award of litigation fees from the fact that responsecosts include related enforcement activities. We recognize that CERCLAis designed to encourage private parties to assume the financial responsibility of cleanup by allowing them to seek recovery from others. It maybe true that awarding the litigation fees incurred in that recovery wouldfurther this goal. Nonetheless, the efficacy of an exception to the American rule is a policy decision that must be made by Congress, not the courts.The desirability of a fee-shifting provision cannot substitute for the express authorization mandated by the Supreme Court." FMC Corp v.Aero Industries, Inc., 998 F. 2d 842, 847 (1993) (citing Alyeska, 421 U. S.,at 263-264).511us3$63I 11-04-97 20:42:31 PAGES OPINPGT820 KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto a lawyer are unrecoverable expenses under CERCLA.On the contrary, some lawyers' work that is closely tied tothe actual cleanup may constitute a necessary cost of re-sponse in and of itself under the terms of $ 107(a)(4)(B). Thecomponent of Key Tronic's claim that covers the work per-formed in identifying other PRP's falls in this category. Unlike the litigation services at issue in Alyeska, these effortsmight well be performed by engineers, chemists, private investigators, or other professionals who are not lawyers. Asthe Tenth Circuit observed, the American rule set out inAlyeska does not govern such fees "because they are notincurred in pursuing litigation."FMC Corp. v. Aero Industries, Inc., 998 F. 2d 842, 847 (1993).The District Court in this case recognized the role KeyTronic's search for other responsible parties played in uncov-ering the Air Force's disposal of wastes at the site and inprompting the EPA to initiate its enforcement action againstthe Air Force. 766 F. Supp., at 872, n. 4. Tracking downother responsible solvent polluters increases the probabilitythat a cleanup will be effective and get paid for. Key Tronicis therefore quite right to claim that such efforts significantlybenefited the entire cleanup effort and served a statutorypurpose apart from the reallocation of costs. These kindsof activities are recoverable costs of response clearly distinguishable from litigation expenses.14This reasoning does not extend, however, to the legal services performed in connection with the negotiations betweenKey Tronic and the EPA that culminated in the consent decree. Studies that Key Tronic's counsel prepared or super-vised during those negotiations may indeed have aided theEPA and may also have affected the ultimate scope and formof the cleanup. We nevertheless view such work as primarily protecting Key Tronic's interests as a defendant in theproceedings that established the extent of its liability. As14 As is customary in assessments of this sort, of course, trial courts willdetermine the exact amount of these costs that is recoverable.511us3$63I 11-04-97 20:42:31 PAGES OPINPGT821Cite as: 511 U.
