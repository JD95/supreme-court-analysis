This case presents the question whether respondent LoriWilliams, who paid a tax under protest to remove a lien onher property, has standing to bring a refund action under 28U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1), even though the tax she paid was assessed against a third party. We hold that respondent hasstanding to sue for a refund. Respondent's suit falls withinthe broad language of $ 1346(a)(1), which gives federal courtsjurisdiction to hear "[a]ny civil action against the UnitedStates for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax allegedto have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,"and only a strained reading of other relevant provisionswould bar her suit. She had no realistic alternative topayment of a tax she did not owe,1 and we do not believeCongress intended to leave parties in respondent's positionwithout a remedy. IBefore this litigation commenced, respondent Lori Wil-liams and her then-husband Jerrold Rabin jointly ownedtheir home. As part owner of a restaurant, Rabin person-ally incurred certain tax liabilities, which he failed to satisfy.In June 1987 and March 1988, the Government assessedRabin close to $15,000 for these liabilities, and thereby placeda lien in the assessed amount on all his property, includinghis interest in the house. See 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 ("If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the sameafter demand, the amount . . . shall be a lien in favor ofthe United States upon all property and rights to property,whether real or personal, belonging to such person."). TheGovernment has not alleged that Williams is personally lia-ble for these or any subsequent assessments.1 Seeking summary disposition in the District Court, the Governmentdid not contend otherwise or question the District Court's understandingthat "the plaintiff here is left without a remedy."

Williams did not havenotice of the lien when Rabin deeded his interest in thehouse to her on October 25, 1988, for the Government didnot file its tax lien until November 10, 1988. As consideration for the house, Williams assumed three liabilities forRabin (none of them tax liabilities) totaling almost $650,000.App. 7-8 (Statement of Uncontroverted Facts presented byattorneys for United States). In the ensuing months, theGovernment made further assessments on Rabin in excessof $26,000, but did not file notice of them until June 22, 1989.Williams entered a contract on May 9, 1989, to sell thehouse, and agreed to a closing date of July 3. Id., at 8. Oneweek before the closing, the Government gave actual noticeto Williams and the purchaser of over $41,000 in tax lienswhich, it claimed, were valid against the property or proceeds of the sale. The purchaser threatened to sue Williamsif the sale did not go through on schedule. Believing shehad no realistic alternative--none having been suggested bythe Government--Williams, under protest, authorized disbursement of $41,937 from the sale proceeds directly to theInternal Revenue Service so that she could convey clear title.After the Government denied Williams' claim for an administrative refund, she filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claimingshe had taken the property free of the Government's lienunder 26 U. S. C. $ 6323(a) (absent proper notice, tax lien notvalid against purchaser). To enforce her rights, she invoked28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1), which waives the Government's sovereign immunity from suit by authorizing federal courts toadjudicate "[a]ny civil action against the United States forthe recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to havebeen erroneously or illegally assessed or collected." In atrial on stipulated facts, the Government maintained that itwas irrelevant whether the Government had a right to Williams' money; her plea could not be entertained, the Govern514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n531Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtment insisted, because she lacked standing to seek a refundunder $ 1346(a)(1).2 According to the Government, that provision authorizes actions only by the assessed party, i. e.,Rabin. The District Court accepted this jurisdictional argument, relying on precedent set in the Fifth and SeventhCircuits.3The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitreversed, 24 F. 3d 1143, 1145 (1994), guided by Fourth Circuitprecedent.4 To resolve this conflict among the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 959 (1994), and nowaffirm.IIThe question before us is whether the waiver of sovereignimmunity in $ 1346(a)(1) authorizes a refund suit by a partywho, though not assessed a tax, paid the tax under protestto remove a federal tax lien from her property. In resolvingthis question, we may not enlarge the waiver beyond thepurview of the statutory language. Department of Energyv.Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 614-616 (1992). Our task is to discernthe "unequivocally expressed" intent of Congress, construingambiguities in favor of immunity. United States v. NordicVillage, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33 (1992) (internal quotationmarks omitted).To fathom the congressional instruction, we turn first tothe language of $ 1346(a). This provision does not say thatonly the person assessed may sue. Instead, the statute usesbroad language:2 The dissent, perhaps finding unappealing the Government's defense ofunjustified taking, tenders factual inferences, post, at 545-546, both unfavorable to Williams and beyond the parties' stipulation of uncontrovertedfacts. The sole issue in this case, however, is whether one in Williams'situation has standing to sue for a refund, and to that issue the strengthof Williams' case on the merits is not relevant.3 See Snodgrass v. United States, 834 F. 2d 537, 540 (CA5 1987); Bussev. United States, 542 F. 2d 421, 425 (CA7 1976).4 See Martin v. United States, 895 F. 2d 992 (1990).514US2 Unit: $U51 [01-06-00 07:01:05] PAGES PGT: OPINBX m532 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Court"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the United States Court of FederalClaims, of:"(1) Any civil action against the United States for therecovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to havebeenerroneously or illegally assessed or collected, orany penalty claimed to have been collected withoutauthority or any sum alleged to have been excessive orin any manner wrongfully collected under the internalrevenue laws." 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a) (1988 ed. and Supp.V) (emphasis added).Williams' plea to recover a tax "erroneously . . . collected"falls squarely within this language.The broad language of $ 1346(a)(1) mirrors the broadcommon-law remedy the statute displaced: actions of assumpsit for money had and received, once brought againstthe tax collector personally rather than against the UnitedStates. See Ferguson, Jurisdictional Problems in FederalTax Controversies, 48 Iowa L. Rev. 312, 327 (1963). Assumpsit afforded a remedy to those who, like Williams, had paidmoney they did not owe--typically as a result of fraud, duress, or mistake. See H. Ballantine, Shipman on Common-Law Pleading 163-164 (3d ed. 1923). Assumpsit refundactions were unavailable to volunteers, a limit that wouldnot have barred Williams because she paid under protest.See Philadelphia v. Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 731-732 (1867)("Where the party voluntarily pays the money, he is withoutremedy; but if he pays it by compulsion of law, or underprotest, or with notice that he intends to bring suit to testthe validity of the claim, he may recover it back . . . .").IIIAcknowledging the evident breadth of $ 1346(a)(1), theGovernment relies on the interaction of three other provisions to narrow the waiver of sovereign immunity. TheGovernment argues: Under 26 U. S. C. $ 7422, a party may514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n533Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtnot bring a refund action without first exhausting adminis-trative remedies; under 26 U. S. C. $ 6511, only a "taxpayer"may exhaust; under 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(14), Williams is nota taxpayer.It is undisputed that $ 7422 requires administrative ex-haustion.5 If Williams is eligible to exhaust, she did so byfiling an administrative claim. But to show that Williams isnot eligible to exhaust, the Government relies first on 26U. S. C. $ 6511(a), which provides in part:"(a) Period of limitation on filing claim"Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of anytax imposed by this title in respect of which tax thetaxpayer is required to file a return shall be filed by thetaxpayer within 3 years from the time the return wasfiled or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no returnwas filed by the taxpayer, within 2 years from the timethe tax was paid." (Emphasis added.)From the statute's use of the term "taxpayer," rather than"person who paid the tax," the Government concludes thatonly a "taxpayer" may file for administrative relief under$ 7422, and thereafter pursue a refund action under 28U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1).6 Then, to show that Williams is not5 Section 7422(a) provides in relevant part:"No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recoveryof any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegallyassessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collectedwithout authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in anymanner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has beenduly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in thatregard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuancethereof."6 Title 26 U. S. C. $ 6532(a)(1), governing the time to file a refund suit incourt, reads in part:"No suit or proceeding under section 7422(a) for the recovery of any internal revenue tax, penalty, or other sum, shall be begun before the expira514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n534 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courta "taxpayer," the Government relies on 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(14), which defines "taxpayer" as "any person subject toany internal revenue tax." According to the Government, aparty who pays a tax is not "subject to" it unless she is theone assessed.The Government's argument fails at both statutory junctures. First, the word "taxpayer" in $ 6511(a)--the provision governing administrative claims--cannot bear theweight the Government puts on it. This provision's plainterms provide only a deadline for filing for administrativerelief,7 not a limit on who may file. To read the term "taxpayer" as implicitly limiting administrative relief to theparty assessed is inconsistent with other provisions of therefund scheme, which expressly contemplate refunds to parties other than the one assessed. Thus, in authorizing theSecretary to award a credit or refund "[i]n the case of anyoverpayment," 26 U. S. C. $ 6402(a) describes the recipientnot as the "taxpayer," but as "the person who made theoverpayment." Similarly, in providing for credits and refunds for sales taxes and taxes on tobacco and alcohol, 26U. S. C. $ 6416(a) and 26 U. S. C. $ 6419(a) describe the recipient as "the person who paid the tax."tion of 6 months from the date of filing the claim required under suchsection unless the Secretary renders a decision thereon within that time,nor after the expiration of 2 years from the date of mailing by certifiedmail or registered mail by the Secretary to the taxpayer of a notice of thedisallowance of the part of the claim to which the suit or proceedingrelates."7 As a statute of limitations, $ 6511(a) does narrow the waiver of sovereign immunity in $ 1346(a)(1) by barring the tardy. See United States v.Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 602 (1990) ("Read together, the import of these sections [$$ 1346(a)(1), 7422(a), 6511(a)] is clear: unless a claim for refund of atax has been filed within the time limits imposed by $ 6511(a), a suit forrefund, regardless of whether the tax is alleged to have been `erroneously,'`illegally,' or `wrongfully collected,' $$ 1346(a)(1), 7422(a), may not be maintained in any court.").514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n535Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the CourtFurther, even if, as the Government contends, only "tax-payers" could seek administrative relief under $ 6511, theGovernment's claim that Williams is not at this point a"taxpayer" is unpersuasive. Section 7701(a)(14), defining"taxpayer," informs us that "[w]hen used in [the InternalRevenue Code], where not otherwise distinctly expressed ormanifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, . . . [t]heterm `taxpayer' means any person subject to any internalrevenue tax." 8 That definition does not exclude Williams.The Government reads the definition as if it said "any personwho is assessed any internal revenue tax," but these are notCongress' words. The general phrase "subject to" isbroader than the specific phrase "assessed" and, in the taxcollection context before us, we think it is broad enough toinclude Williams. In placing a lien on her home and thenaccepting her tax payment under protest, the Governmentsurely subjected Williams to a tax, even though she was notthe assessed party.In support of its reading of "taxpayer," the Governmentcites our observation in Colorado Nat. Bank of Denver v.Bedford, 310 U. S. 41, 52 (1940), that "[t]he taxpayer is theperson ultimately liable for the tax itself." The Governmenttakes this language out of context. We were not interpret-ing the term "taxpayer" in the Internal Revenue Code, butdeciding whether a state tax scheme was consistent with fed-eral law. In particular, we were determining whether Colorado had imposed its service tax on a bank's customers(which was consistent with federal law) or on the bank itself(which was not). Though the bank collected and paid thetax, its incidence fell on the customers. Favoring substanceover form, we said: "The person liable for the tax [the bank],primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer.8 The Treasury's regulation, 26 CFR $ 301.7701-16 (1994), adds nothingto the statute; in particular, the regulation does not ascribe any special orlimiting meaning to the statute's "subject to" terminology.514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n536 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtThe taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax it-self." Ibid. As a result, we determined that the tax hadbeen imposed on the customers rather than the bank. IfColorado Nat. Bank is relevant at all, it shows our preference for commonsense inquiries over formalism--a prefer-ence that works against the Government's technical argument in this case. IVAs we have just developed, 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(a)(1) clearlyallows one from whom taxes are erroneously or illegally collected to sue for a refund of those taxes. And 26 U. S. C.$ 6402(a), with similar clarity, authorizes the Secretary to payout a refund to "the person who made the overpayment."The Government's strained reading of $ 1346(a)(1), we note,would leave people in Williams' position without a remedy.Seesupra, at 529, n. 1. This consequence reinforces ourconclusion that Congress did not intend refund actions under$ 1346(a)(1) to be unavailable to persons situated as Lori Wil-liams is. Though the Government points to three otherremedies, none was realistically open to Williams. Norwould any of the vaunted remedies be available to others inher situation. See, e. g., Martin v. United States, 895 F. 2d992 (CA4 1990);Barris v. United States, 851 F. Supp. 696(WD Pa. 1994);Brodey v. United States, 788 F. Supp. 44(Mass. 1991) (all ordering refunds of amounts erroneouslycollected to the people who paid those amounts).If the Government has not levied on property--as it hasnot levied on Williams' home--the owner cannot challengesuch a levy under 26 U. S. C. $ 7426. Nor would an actionunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2410(a)(1) to quiet title afford meaningfulrelief to someone in Williams' position. The first lien on herproperty, for nearly $15,000, was filed just six months beforethe closing; and liens in larger sum--over $26,000, out of$41,937--were filed only 11 days before the closing. (Wil-liams did not receive actual notice ofany of the liens untilbarely a week before the closing.) She simply did not have514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n537Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courttime to bring a quiet title action. She urgently sought tosell the property, but a sale would have been difficult beforea final judgment in such litigation, which could have beenprotracted. In contrast, a refund suit would allow her tosell the property and simultaneously pay off the lien, leavingher free to litigate with the Government without tying upher real property, whose worth far exceeded the value of theGovernment's liens.Nor may Williams and persons similarly situated rely on$ 6325(b)(3) for such an arrangement. This provision permits the Government to discharge a lien on property if theowner sets aside a fund that becomes subject to a new lien;the parties then can litigate the propriety of the new lienafter the property is sold. However, $ 6325(b)(3) and its implementing regulation render this remedy doubtful indeed,for it is available only at the Government's discretion. See$ 6325(b)(3) ("[T]he Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge [of a federal tax lien] of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, the proceeds of suchsale are to be held, as a fund subject to the liens and claimsof the United States, in the same manner and with the samepriority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.") (emphasis added); 26 CFR $ 301.6325-1(b)(3) (1994) ("A district director [of the Internal RevenueService] may, in his discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a [tax lien] ifsuch part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a writtenagreement with the district director, the proceeds of the saleare held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of theUnited States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the lien or claim had with respect to the dischargedproperty.") (emphasis added).So far as the record shows, the Government did not affordWilliams an opportunity to substitute a fund pursuant to514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n538 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Court$ 6325(b)(3).9 This omission is not surprising, for on theGovernment's theory of who may sue under $ 1346(a)(1),the Government had scant incentive to agree to such anarrangement with people caught in Williams' bind. Under$ 6325(b)(3), the Government does not receive cash, but an-other lien (albeit one on a fund). In contrast, if the Government resists a $ 6325(b)(3) agreement, it is likely to get cashimmediately: property owners eager to remove a tax lien willhave to pay, as did Williams. If they may not sue under$ 1346(a)(1), their payment is nonrefundable. An agreementpursuant to $ 6325(b)(3) thus dependent on the district direc-tor's grace cannot sensibly be described as available toWilliams.We do not agree with the Government that, if $ 1346(a)(1)authorizes some third-party suits, the levy, quiet title,and separate-fund remedies become superfluous. Section1346(a)(1) is a postdeprivation remedy, available only if thetaxpayer has paid the Government in full. Flora v. UnitedStates, 362 U. S. 145 (1960). The other remedies offerpredeprivation relief. The levy provision in 26 U. S. C.$ 7426(a)(1) is available "without regard to whether suchproperty has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary."Likewise, 28 U. S. C. $ 2410 allows a property owner to havea lien discharged without ever paying the tax. Under 26U. S. C. $ 6325(b)(3), the lien on the property is removed inexchange for a new lien, rather than a cash payment.VFinally, the Government urges that allowing Williams tosue will violate the principle that parties may not challenge9 The dissent asserts, regarding $ 6325(b)(3), that Williams cannot complain in court without exhausting her administrative remedy. Post, at547-548. But $ 6325(b)(3) presents no question of administrative exhaustion as a prelude to judicial review, for that "remedy" lies entirely withinthe Government's discretion.514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n539Cite as: 514 U. S. 527 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthe tax liabilities of others. According to the Government,undermining this principle will lead to widespread abuse: Inparticular, parties will volunteer to pay the tax liabilities ofothers, only to seek a refund once the Government hasceased collecting from the real taxpayer.Although parties generally may not challenge the tax liabilities of others, this rule is not unyielding. A taxpayer'sfiduciary may litigate the taxpayer's liability, even thoughthe fiduciary is not herself liable. See 26 CFR $ 301.6903-1(a) (1994) (the fiduciary must "assume the powers, rights,duties, and privileges of the taxpayer with respect to thetaxes imposed by the Code"); ibid. ("The amount of the taxor liability is ordinarily not collectible from the personal estate of the fiduciary but is collectible from the estate of thetaxpayer . . . ."); 15 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation $ 58.08 (1994) (refund claims for decedents filed by executor, administrator, or other fiduciary of estate). Similarly,certain transferees may litigate the tax liabilities of thetransferor; if the transfer qualifies as a fraudulent conveyance under state law, the Code treats the transferee as thetaxpayer, see 26 U. S. C. $ 6901(a)(1)(A); 5 J. Rabkin & M.Johnson, Federal Income, Gift and Estate Taxation $ 73.10,pp. 73-82 to 73-87 (1992), so the transferee may contest thetransferor's liability either in tax court, see 14 Mertens,supra, $ 53.50, or in a refund suit under $ 1346(a)(1). See id.,$ 53.55. Furthermore, the Court has allowed a refund action by parties who were not assessed, albeit under a different statute. See Stahmann v. Vidal, 305 U. S. 61 (1938) (cotton producers could bring a refund action for a federal cottonginning tax if they had paid the tax, even though the taxwas assessed against ginners rather than producers).The burden on the principle that a party may not challengethe tax liability of another is mitigated, moreover, becauseWilliams' main challenge is to the existence of a lien againsther property, rather than to the underlying assessment on514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n540 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courther husband. That is, her primary claim is not that her husband never owed the tax 10--a matter that, had she not paidthese taxes herself under the duress of a lien, would not normally be her concern. Rather, she asserts that the Government has attached a lien on the wrong property, because thehouse belongs to her rather than to him--a scenario whichleaves her "subject to" the tax in a meaningful and immediate way.We do not find disarming the Government's forecast thatallowing Williams to sue will lead to rampant abuse. TheGovernment's posited scenario seems implausible; it is notclear what incentive a volunteer has to pay someone else'staxes as a way to help that person evade them. Nor doesthe Government report that such schemes are commonplaceamong the millions of taxpayers in the Fourth and NinthCircuits, Circuits that permit persons in Williams' positionto bring refund suits. Furthermore, our holding does notauthorize the host of third-party challenges the Governmentfears. Williams paid under protest, solely to gain release ofthe Government's lien on her property--a lien she attackedas erroneously maintained. We do not decide the circumstances, if any, under which a party who volunteers to pay atax assessed against someone else may seek a refund under$ 1346(a).10 On motion for summary judgment in District Court, Williams did challenge her husband's liability as well. See Plaintiff's Notice of Motion andCross-Motion for Summary Judgment 13. However, counsel retreatedfrom this claim at oral argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 ("We're not arguingthat she's going to go into court and litigate the liability of her exhusband."); id., at 37 ("[W]e're not saying that she wa[nts] [to] go intocourt and litigate his tax liability. That's his problem, not hers."). Moreover, to affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment, we can rely solely on Williams' standing to challenge the lien, regardless of whether she has standing to challenge the underlying assessment on her husband. Accordingly,we need not resolve whether Williams is still asserting her challenge tothe underlying assessment, let alone whether she has standing to do so.514us2$51P 05-27-98 19:59:25 PAGES OPINBXPGT n541Cite as: 514 U.
