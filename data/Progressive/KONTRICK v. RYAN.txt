This case concerns the duration of a right to object to apleading on the ground that it was filed out of time. Underthe Bankruptcy Rules governing Chapter 7 liquidation pro-ceedings, a creditor has "60 days after the first date set forthe meeting of creditors" to file a complaint objecting to thedebtor's discharge.

Inthe matter before us a creditor, in an untimely pleading, ob-jected to the debtor's discharge. The debtor, however, didnot promptly move to dismiss the creditor's plea as imper-missibly late. Only after the Bankruptcy Court decided, onthe merits, that the discharge should be refused did thedebtor, in a motion for reconsideration, urge the untimelinessof the creditor's plea.*Henry J.

No statute, however, specifies a time limit for filing a complaint objecting tothe debtor's discharge. Instead, the controlling time prescriptions are contained in the Federal Rules of BankruptcyProcedure, specifically, Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3).In relevant part, Bankruptcy Rule 4004(a) states: "[A]complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge under $ 727(a)of the Code shall be filed no later than 60 days after thefirst date set for the meeting of creditors." Rule 4004(b),governing extensions of the Rule 4004(a) filing deadline, pro-vides: "[T]he court may for cause extend the time [Rule4004(a) allows] to file a complaint objecting to discharge" ifthe motion is "filed before the time has expired." Reinforcing Rule 4004(b)'s restriction on extension of the Rule4004(a) deadline, Rule 9006(b)(3) allows enlargement of "thetime for taking action" under Rule 4004(a) "only to the ex-tent and under the conditions stated in [that rule],"i. e., onlyas permitted by Rule 4004(b).3IIOn April 4, 1997, petitioner, Dr. Andrew J.

After gaining three successive time extensionsfrom the Bankruptcy Court, Ryan filed an original complainton January 13, 1998, in which he objected to the dischargeof any of Kontrick's debts.

The amended complaintparticularized for the first time the debtor's violation of$ 727(a)(2)(A) in this regard: Debtor Kontrick, creditor Ryanalleged, had fraudulently transferred money to Kontrick'swife, first by removing Kontrick's own name from the family's once-joint checking account, then by continuing regularlyto deposit his salary checks into the account, from which hiswife routinely paid family expenses (the "family-account"claim). Id., at 52-53.4Kontrick answered Ryan's amended complaint on June 10,1998. His answer "did not raise the untimeliness of [thefamily-account] claim," Brief for Petitioner 4; on the merits,he admitted the transfers to the family account but deniedviolating $ 727(a)(2)(A). In March 1999, after the parties engaged in acrimonious discovery, Ryan moved for summaryjudgment. As Local Bankruptcy Rule 402(M) (Bkrtcy.

His response, instead, andin line with Local Rule 402(N), addressed the substance ofthe family-account claim.

It was the first time Kontrick appended ajurisdictional label to any pleading he filed relating to thefamily-account claim.The Bankruptcy Court denied the reconsideration motionon June 8, 2000, and entered final judgment five days later.The court held that Rule 4004's complaint-filing time instructions are not "jurisdictional," and that Kontrick had waivedthe right to assert the untimeliness of the amended complaint by failing squarely to raise the point before the courtreached the merits of Ryan's objections to discharge.The District Court sustained the Bankruptcy Court's decision denying Kontrick's discharge.

See Tr. ofOral Arg. 5; Brief for Petitioner 5 ("Kontrick . . . argued that in opposingRyan's many other allegations as untimely, he had also sufficiently raisedthe untimeliness of the family account claim.").

S. 443 (2004)Opinion of the CourtCongress did so with respect to bankruptcy courts in Title28 (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure); in cataloging corebankruptcy proceedings, Congress authorized bankruptcycourts to adjudicate, inter alia, objections to discharge. See28 U. S. C. $$ 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(I) and (J). Certain statu-tory provisions governing bankruptcy courts contain built-intime constraints. For example, $ 157(c)(1) addresses de novodistrict court review of bankruptcy court findings and conclusions in noncore proceedings; that provision confines re-view to "matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected." 8 The provision conferring jurisdiction overobjections to discharge, however, contains no timeliness condition. Section 157(b)(2)(J) instructs only that "objectionsto discharges" are "[c]ore proceedings" within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.The time constraints applicable to objections to dischargeare contained in Bankruptcy Rules prescribed by this Courtfor "the practice and procedure in cases under title 11." 28U. S. C. $ 2075; cf. $ 2072 (similarly providing for Court-prescribed "rules of practice and procedure" for cases in thefederal district courts and courts of appeals). "[I]t is axio-matic" that such rules "do not create or withdraw federaljurisdiction." Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger,437 U. S. 365, 370 (1978). As Bankruptcy Rule 9030 states,the Bankruptcy Rules "shall not be construed to extend orlimit the jurisdiction of the courts." Rule 9030's forerunner--its counterpart in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,8 Provisions of a similar order, with built-in time constraints, include 28U. S.

Miller, & R.Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3141, pp. 484-485(2d ed. 1997) ("Rule 82 states [the] important principle" that"[t]he rules merely prescribe the method by which the jurisdiction granted the courts by Congress is to be exercised.");Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 64 (1970) ("The proce-dural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transactionof its business are not jurisdictional . . . ."). In short, thefiling deadlines prescribed in Bankruptcy Rules 4004 and9006(b)(3) are claim-processing rules that do not delineatewhat cases bankruptcy courts are competent to adjudicate.This much is common ground. Kontrick does not contendin this Court that the timing rules in question affect thesubject-matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts. SeeTr. of Oral Arg. 9 (acknowledging that "[t]his case does notdeal with subject matter jurisdiction"); id., at 9-10 (explaining that counsel for Kontrick used the word "jurisdiction""as a shorthand" to indicate a nonextendable time limit).Courts, including this Court, it is true, have been less thanmeticulous in this regard; they have more than occasionallyused the term "jurisdictional" to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court. "Jurisdiction," the Court hasaptly observed, "is a word of many, too many, meanings."Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 90(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, wehave described Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), on timeenlargement, and correspondingly, Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 45(b), on extending time, as "mandatory and jurisdictional."

"[C]lassify[ing] time prescrip-tions, even rigid ones, under the heading `subject matter jurisdiction' " can be confounding. Carlisle, 517 U. S., at 434(Ginsburg, J., concurring). Clarity would be facilitated ifcourts and litigants used the label "jurisdictional" not forclaim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineatingthe classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's adjudica-tory authority.Though Kontrick concedes that Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3)are not properly labeled "jurisdictional" in the sense of describing a court's subject-matter jurisdiction, he maintainsthat the Rules have the same import as provisions governingsubject-matter jurisdiction. A litigant generally may raisea court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time inthe same civil action, even initially at the highest appellateinstance.Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S.379, 382 (1884) (challenge to a federal court's subject-matterjurisdiction may be made at any stage of the proceedings,and the court should raise the question sua sponte); Capronv.

Proc.12(h)(3) ("Whenever it appears by suggestion of the partiesor otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subjectmatter, the court shall dismiss the action.").9 Just so, Kontrick urges, a debtor may challenge a creditor's objection todischarge as untimely under Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) anytime in the proceedings, even initially on appeal or certiorari.Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11 (a debtor may object after final judgment or on appeal "so long as it's within the same proceed9 Even subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may not be attacked collaterally.

ND Ill. 1986)).The equation Kontrick advances overlooks a critical difference between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdictionand an inflexible claim-processing rule. Characteristically,a court's subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded toaccount for the parties' litigation conduct; a claim-processingrule, on the other hand, even if unalterable on a party's appli-cation, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting therule waits too long to raise the point.IVWe turn back now to the relevant claim-processing rules inthis case. Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3),governing proceedings over which bankruptcy courts havesubject-matter jurisdiction,10 serve three primary purposes.First, they inform the pleader, i. e., the objecting creditor, ofthe time he has to file a complaint. Second, they instructthe court on the limits of its discretion to grant motions forcomplaint-filing-time enlargements. Third, they afford thedebtor an affirmative defense to a complaint filed outside theRules 4004(a) and (b) limits. This case involves the thirdoffice of the Rules.It is uncontested that creditor Ryan filed his complaint objecting to debtor Kontrick's discharge outside the Rules'10 Like Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) and Federal Rule ofAppellate Procedure 26(b), Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) is modeled on FederalRule of Civil Procedure 6(b). See Advisory Committee's Note accompanying Rule 9006 ("Subdivision (b) is patterned after Rule 6(b) F. R. Civ. P.and Rule 26(b) F. R. App. P." (emphasis in original)).540US2 Unit: $U14 [11-01-05 13:31:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 540 U. S. 443 (2004)Opinion of the Courttime limits. Kontrick urges that nothing occurring thereafter counts, for the Rules' time prescriptions are unalterable,allowing no recourse to "equitable exceptions." Brief forPetitioner 13, n. 4; see id., at 8, 16-18. This case, however,involves no issue of equitable tolling or any other equitybased exception. Neither at the time creditor Ryan filedthe amended complaint containing the family-account claimnor anytime thereafter did he assert circumstances--equitable or otherwise--qualifying him for a time extension.Whether the Rules, despite their strict limitations, could besoftened on equitable grounds 11 is therefore a question wedo not reach.12 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 ("[M]uch of [Kontrick's] argument is actually directedto an issue that is not presented in this case," i. e., whetherthe timing rules here in question are alterable by recourseto " `equitable exceptions imported from outside the rules.' "(quoting Brief for Petitioner 13)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40("Whether [the bankruptcy court] would have had discretion11 Lower courts have divided on the question whether Bankruptcy Rules4004 and 4007(c) allow equitable exceptions. Compare, e. g., 295 F. 3d, at733 (Rules 4004 and 4007(c) "are subject to equitable defenses"); In reBenedict, 90 F. 3d, at 54 (same conclusion regarding Rule 4007(c)); Faroukiv.

Murchison, 815 F. 2d 345, 346-347 (CA5 1987)(same).12 Nor should anything in this opinion be read to suggest that a debtorand creditor may stipulate to the assertion of time-barred claims whensuch an accommodation would operate to the detriment of other creditors.See, e. g., In re Dollar, 257 B. R. 364, 366 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Ga. 2001) ("Although the defendant debtor would significantly benefit by the allowanceof the amended complaint [reflecting the parties' pretrial agreement tosubstitute an untimely $ 523(a)(6) cause of action for a timely $ 727(a)(2)claim,] the defendant's other creditors would be significantly harmed.").540US2 Unit: $U14 [11-01-05 13:31:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN458 KONTRICK v.

The question,in that event, would have been "whether the time restrictions in th[e] Rules are in such `emphatic form' " as to preclude equitable exceptions.

Here, however, thesole question is whether Kontrick forfeited his right to assert the untimeliness of Ryan's amended complaint by failingto raise the issue until after that complaint was adjudicatedon the merits.13 In other words, how long did the affirmative defense Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) affordedKontrick linger in the proceedings?The Court of Appeals, we agree, followed the proper pathon this key question.
