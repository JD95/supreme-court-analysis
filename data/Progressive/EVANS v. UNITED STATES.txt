We granted certiorari, 500 U. S. 951 (1991), to resolve aconflict in the Circuits over the question whether an affirmative act of inducement by a public official, such as a demand,is an element of the offense of extortion "under color of official right" prohibited by the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1951.We agree with the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuitthat it is not, and therefore affirm the judgment of thecourt below.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIPetitioner was an elected member of the Board of Commissioners of DeKalb County, Georgia. During the period between March 1985 and October 1986, as part of an effort bythe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate allegations of public corruption in the Atlanta area, particularly in the area of rezonings of property, an FBI agent posing as a real estate developer talked on the telephone andmet with petitioner on a number of occasions. Virtually all,if not all, of those conversations were initiated by the agentand most were recorded on tape or video. In those conversations, the agent sought petitioner's assistance in an effortto rezone a 25-acre tract of land for high-density residentialuse. On July 25, 1986, the agent handed petitioner cash totaling $7,000 and a check, payable to petitioner's campaign,for $1,000. Petitioner reported the check, but not the cash,on his state campaign-financing disclosure form; he also didnot report the $7,000 on his 1986 federal income tax return.Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as we must in light of the verdict, see Glasser v.United States, 315 U. S. 60, 80 (1942), we assume that thejury found that petitioner accepted the cash knowing that itwas intended to ensure that he would vote in favor of therezoning application and that he would try to persuade hisfellow commissioners to do likewise. Thus, although petitioner did not initiate the transaction, his acceptance of thebribe constituted an implicit promise to use his official position to serve the interests of the bribegiver.In a two-count indictment, petitioner was charged with extortion in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1951 and with failure toreport income in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 7206(1). He wasconvicted by a jury on both counts. With respect to the extortion count, the trial judge gave the following instruction:"The defendant contends that the $8,000 he receivedfrom agent Cormany was a campaign contribution. The504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT258 EVANS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsolicitation of campaign contributions from any personis a necessary and permissible form of political activityon the part of persons who seek political office and persons who have been elected to political office. Thus, theacceptance by an elected official of a campaign contribution does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the HobbsAct even though the donor has business pending beforethe official."However, if a public official demands or acceptsmoney in exchange for [a] specific requested exercise ofhis or her official power, such a demand or acceptancedoes constitute a violation of the Hobbs Act regardlessof whether the payment is made in the form of a campaign contribution." App. 16-17.In affirming petitioner's conviction, the Court of Appealsnoted that the instruction did not require the jury to findthat petitioner had demanded or requested the money, orthat he had conditioned the performance of any official actupon its receipt. 910 F. 2d 790, 796 (CA11 1990). TheCourt of Appeals held, however, that "passive acceptance ofa benefit by a public official is sufficient to form the basis ofa Hobbs Act violation if the official knows that he is beingoffered the payment in exchange for a specific requested exercise of his official power. The official need not take anyspecific action to induce the offering of the benefit." Ibid.(emphasis in original).1This statement of the law by the Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit is consistent with holdings in eight other1 The Court of Appeals explained its conclusion as follows:"[T]he requirement of inducement is automatically satisfied by the powerconnected with the public office. Therefore, once the defendant hasshown that a public official has accepted money in return for a requestedexercise of official power, no additional inducement need be shown. `Thecoercive nature of the official office provides all the inducement necessary.'

O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 687 (CA2 1984) (enbanc) ("Although receipt of benefits by a public official is anecessary element of the crime, there must also be proof thatthe public official did something, under color of his publicoffice, to cause the giving of benefits");United States v.Aguon, 851 F. 2d 1158, 1166 (CA9 1988) (en banc) ("We findourselves in accord with the Second Circuit's conclusion thatinducement is an element required for conviction under theHobbs Act").

S. 246,263 (1952).3At common law, extortion was an offense committed by apublic official who took "by colour of his office"4 money thatwas not due to him for the performance of his official duties.5A demand, or request, by the public official was not an element of the offense.6 Extortion by the public official wasthe rough equivalent of what we would now describe as "taking a bribe." It is clear that petitioner committed that of-fense.7 The question is whether the federal statute, insofar3 Or, as Justice Frankfurter advised, "if a word is obviously transplantedfrom another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation,it brings the old soil with it." Frankfurter, Some Reflections on theReading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947).4 Blackstone described extortion as "an abuse of public justice, whichconsists in an officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of his office, from anyman, any money or thing of value, that is not due to him, or more than isdue, or before it is due." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *141 (emphasisadded). He used the phrase "by colour of his office," rather than thephrase "under color of official right," which appears in the Hobbs Act.Petitioner does not argue that there is any difference in the phrases. Hawkins' definition of extortion is probably the source for the official rightlanguage used in the Hobbs Act. See Lindgren, The Elusive DistinctionBetween Bribery and Extortion: From the Common Law to the HobbsAct, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 815, 864 (1988) (hereinafter Lindgren). Hawkinsdefined extortion as follows:"[I]t is said, That extortion in a large sense signifies any oppression undercolour of right; but that in a strict sense, it signifies the taking of moneyby any officer, by colour of his office, either where none at all is due, ornot so much is due, or where it is not yet due." 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas ofthe Crown 316 (6th ed. 1787).5 See Lindgren 882-889. The dissent says that we assume that"common-law extortion encompassed any taking by a public official ofsomething of value that he was not `due.' " Post, at 279. That statement,of course, is incorrect because, as stated in the text above, the paymentmust be "for the performance of his official duties."6 Lindgren 884-886.7 Petitioner argued to the jury, at least with respect to the extortioncount, that he had been entrapped, see App. 20; however, in light of thejury's verdict on that issue, we must assume that he was predisposed tocommit the crime.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT261Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of the Courtas it applies to official extortion, has narrowed the common-law definition.Congress has unquestionably expanded the common-lawdefinition of extortion to include acts by private individualspursuant to which property is obtained by means of force,fear, or threats. It did so by implication in the Travel Act,18 U. S. C. $ 1952, see United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S.286, 289-296 (1969), and expressly in the Hobbs Act. Theportion of the Hobbs Act that is relevant to our decisiontoday provides:"(a) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article orcommodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or at-tempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatensphysical violence to any person or property in further-ance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violationof this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 orimprisoned not more than twenty years, or both."(b) As used in this section--. . . . ."(2) The term `extortion' means the obtaining of prop-erty from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, orunder color of official right." 18 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcareful not to interfere with legitimate activities betweenemployers and employees. See H. R. Rep. No. 1833, 73dCong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934). The 1946 amendment was in-tended to encompass the conduct held to be beyond the reachof the 1934 Act by our decision in United States v. Teamsters,315 U. S. 521 (1942).10 The amendment did not make anysignificant change in the section referring to obtaining prop-erty "under color of official right" that had been prohibitedby the 1934 Act. Rather, Congress intended to broaden thescope of the Anti-Racketeering Act and was concerned pri"(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced bywrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right." Act of June18, 1934, ch. 569, $ 2, 48 Stat. 979-980.One of the models for the statute was the New York statute:"Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, or the obtainingthe [sic] property of a corporation from an officer, agent or employeethereof, with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, orunder color of official right." Penal Law of 1909, $ 850, as amended, 1917N. Y. Laws, ch. 518, codified in N. Y. Penal Law $ 850 (McKinney Supp.1965).The other model was the Field Code, a 19th-century model code:"Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent,induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right."Commissioners of the Code, Proposed Penal Code of the State of NewYork $ 613 (1865) (Field Code).Lindgren points out that according to the Field Code, coercive extortionand extortion by official right extortion are separate offenses, and the NewYork courts recognized this difference when, in 1891, they said the FieldCode treats "extortion by force and fear as one thing, and extortion byofficial action as another." People v. Barondess, 61 Hun. 571, 576, 16N. Y. S. 436, 438 (App. Div. 1891). The judgment in this case was laterreversed without opinion. See 133 N. Y. 649, 31 N. E. 240 (1892). Lindgren identifies early English statutes and cases to support his contentionthat official extortion did not require a coercive taking, nor did it underthe early American statutes, including the later New York statute. SeeLindgren 869, 908.10 In United States v. Teamsters, the Court construed the exemption for" `the payment of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee' "that was contained in the 1934 Act but is no longer a part of the statute.315 U. S., at 527.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmarily with distinguishing between "legitimate" labor activity and labor "racketeering," so as to prohibit the latter whilepermitting the former. See 91 Cong. Rec. 11899-11922(1945).Many of those who supported the amendment argued thatits purpose was to end the robbery and extortion that someunion members had engaged in, to the detriment of all laborand the American citizenry. They urged that the amendment was not, as their opponents charged, an antilabor measure, but rather, it was a necessary measure in the wake ofthis Court's decision in United States v. Teamsters.11 Intheir view, the Supreme Court had mistakenly exemptedlabor from laws prohibiting robbery and extortion, whereasCongress had intended to extend such laws to all Americancitizens. See, e. g., 91 Cong. Rec. 11910 (1945) (remarks ofRep. Springer) ("To my mind this is a bill that protects thehonest laboring people in our country. There is nothing contained in this bill that relates to labor. This measure, ifpassed, will relate to every American citizen"); id., at 11912(remarks of Rep. Jennings) ("The bill is one to protect theright of citizens of this country to market their productswithout any interference from lawless bandits").Although the present statutory text is much broader 12than the common-law definition of extortion because it encompasses conduct by a private individual as well as conduct11 In fact, the House Report sets out the text of United States v. Teamsters in full, to make clear that the amendment to the Anti-RacketeeringAct was in direct response to the Supreme Court decision. See H. R.Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-10 (1945).12 This Court recognized the broad scope of the Hobbs Act in Stirone v.United States, 361 U. S. 212, 215 (1960):"That Act speaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all theconstitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstatecommerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence. The Act outlawssuch interference `in any way or degree.' "504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT264 EVANS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtby a public official,13 the portion of the statute that refersto official misconduct continues to mirror the common-lawdefinition. There is nothing in either the statutory text orthe legislative history that could fairly be described as a"contrary direction," Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.,at 263, from Congress to narrow the scope of the offense.The legislative history is sparse and unilluminating withrespect to the offense of extortion. There is a reference tothe fact that the terms "robbery and extortion" had beenconstrued many times by the courts and to the fact that thedefinitions of those terms were "based on the New Yorklaw." 89 Cong. Rec. 3227 (1943) (statement of Rep. Hobbs);see 91 Cong. Rec. 11906 (1945) (statement of Rep. Robsion).In view of the fact that the New York statute applied to apublic officer "who asks, or receives, or agrees to receive"unauthorized compensation, N. Y. Penal Code $ 557 (1881),the reference to New York law is consistent with an intentto apply the common-law definition. The language of theNew York statute quoted above makes clear that extortioncould be committed by one who merely received an unauthor13 Several States had already defined the offense of extortion broadlyenough to include the conduct of the private individual as well as theconduct of the public official. See, e. g., United States v. Nardello, 393U. S. 286, 289 (1969) ("In many States . . . the crime of extortion has beenstatutorily expanded to include acts by private individuals under whichproperty is obtained by means of force, fear, or threats"); Bush v. State,19 Ariz. 195, 198, 168 P. 508, 509-510 (1917) (recognizing that the statePenal Code "has enlarged the scope of this offense so as not to confine thecommission of it to those persons who act under color of official right");People v. Peck, 43 Cal. App. 638, 643, 185 P. 881, 882-883 (1919) (In someStates "the statutory definitions have extended the scope of the offensebeyond that of the common law so as to include the unlawful taking ofmoney or thing of value of another by any person, whether a public officeror a private individual, and this is so in California . . .").At least one commentator has argued that, at common law, extortionunder color of official right could also be committed by a private individual.See Lindgren 875.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of the Courtized payment.14 This was the statute that was in force inNew York when the Hobbs Act was enacted.The two courts that have disagreed with the decision toapply the common-law definition have interpreted the word"induced" as requiring a wrongful use of official power that"begins with the public official, not with the gratuitous actions of another." United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d, at691; see United States v. Aguon, 851 F. 2d, at 1166 (" `inducement' can be in the overt form of a `demand,' or in a moresubtle form such as `custom' or `expectation' "). If we hadno common-law history to guide our interpretation of thestatutory text, that reading would be plausible. For tworeasons, however, we are convinced that it is incorrect.First, we think the word "induced" is a part of the definition of the offense by the private individual, but not the offense by the public official. In the case of the private individual, the victim's consent must be "induced by wrongfuluse of actual or threatened force, violence or fear." In thecase of the public official, however, there is no such requirement. The statute merely requires of the public official thathe obtain "property from another, with his consent, . . . undercolor of official right." The use of the word "or" before"under color of official right" supports this reading.1514 Many of the treatise writers explained that, at common law, extortionwas defined as the corrupt taking or receipt of an unlawful fee by a publicofficer under color of office. They did not allude to any requirements of"inducement" or "demand" by a public officer. See, e. g., W. LaFave &A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law $ 95, p. 704 (1972); R. Perkins &R. Boyce, Criminal Law 448 (1982); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law$ 695, p. 481, $ 698, p. 484 (14th ed. 1981).15 This meaning would, of course, have been completely clear if Congresshad inserted the word "either" before its description of the private offensebecause the word "or" already precedes the description of the public offense. The definition would then read: "The term `extortion' means theobtaining of property from another, with his consent, either induced bywrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under colorof official right."504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT266 EVANS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSecond, even if the statute were parsed so that the word"induced" applied to the public officeholder, we do not believethe word "induced" necessarily indicates that the transactionmust beinitiated by the recipient of the bribe. Many ofthe cases applying the majority rule have concluded that thewrongful acceptance of a bribe establishes all the inducement that the statute requires.16 They conclude that the coercive element is provided by the public office itself. Andeven the two courts that have adopted an inducement requirement for extortion under color of official right do notrequire proof that the inducement took the form of a threator demand. See United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d, at 687;United States v. Aguon, 851 F. 2d, at 1166.1716 See, e. g., United States v. Holzer, 816 F. 2d 304, 311 (CA7), vacated onother grounds, 484 U. S. 807 (1987), aff'd in part on remand, 840 F. 2d 1343(CA7), cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1035 (1988); United States v. Paschall, 772F. 2d 68, 72-74 (CA4 1985); United States v. Williams, 621 F. 2d, at 124;United States v. Butler, 618 F. 2d, at 418.17 Moreover, we note that while the statute does not require that affirmative inducement be proven as a distinct element of the Hobbs Act,there is evidence in the record establishing that petitioner received themoney with the understanding that he would use his office to aid the bribegiver. Petitioner and the agent had several exchanges in which they triedto clarify their understanding with each other. For example, petitionersaid to the agent: "I understand both of us are groping . . . for what weneed to say to each other. . . . I'm gonna work. Let m[e] tell you I'mgonna work, if you didn't give me but three [thousand dollars], on this,I've promised to help you. I'm gonna work to do that. You understandwhat I mean. . . . If you gave me six, I'll do exactly what I said I wasgonna do for you. If you gave me one, I'll do exactly what I said I wasgonna do for you. I wanna' make sure you're clear on that part. So itdoesn't really matter. If I promised to help, that's what I'm gonna do."App. 36-37.Petitioner instructed the agent on the form of the payment ("What youdo, is make me out one, ahh, for a thousand. . . . And, and that means wegonna record it and report it and then the rest would be cash"), and agreedwith the agent that the payment was being made, not because it was anelection year, but because there was a budget to support petitioner's ac504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT267Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner argues that the jury charge with respect to ex-tortion, see supra, at 257-258, allowed the jury to convicthim on the basis of the "passive acceptance of a contribu-tion." Brief for Petitioner 24.18 He contends that the instruction did not require the jury to find "an element of dutions, and that there would be a budget either way ("Either way, yep.Oh, I understand that. I understand"). Id., at 38.18 Petitioner also makes the point that "[t]he evidence at trial against[petitioner] is more conducive to a charge of bribery than one of extortion."Brief for Petitioner 40. Although the evidence in this case may have supported a charge of bribery, it is not a defense to a charge of extortionunder color of official right that the defendant could also have been convicted of bribery. Courts addressing extortion by force or fear have occasionally said that extortion and bribery are mutually exclusive, see, e. g.,People v. Feld, 262 App. Div. 909, 28 N. Y. S. 2d 796, 797 (1941); while thatmay be correct when the victim was intimidated into making a payment(extortion by force or fear), and did not offer it voluntarily (bribery), thatdoes not lead to the conclusion that extortion under color of official rightand bribery are mutually exclusive under either common law or the HobbsAct. See, e. g., Stern, Prosecutions of Local Political Corruption Underthe Hobbs Act: The Unnecessary Distinction Between Bribery and Extortion, 3 Seton Hall L. Rev. 1, 14 (1971) ("If the [Hobbs] Act is read in full,the distinction between bribery and extortion becomes unnecessary wherepublic officials are involved").Another commentator has argued that bribery and extortion were overlapping crimes, see Lindgren 905, 908, and has located an early New Yorkcase in which the defendant was convicted of both bribery and extortionunder color of official right, see People v. Hansen, 241 N. Y. 532, 150 N. E.542 (1925), aff'g, 211 App. Div. 861, 207 N. Y. S. 894 (1924). He also makesthe point that the cases usually cited for the proposition that extortionand bribery are mutually exclusive crimes are cases involving extortionby fear and bribery, see, e. g., People v. Feld, supra; People v. Dioguardi,8 N. Y. 2d 260, 263, 271-273, 168 N. E. 2d 683, 685, 690-692 (1960), and wenote that the latter case was decided after the Hobbs Act, so it could nothave been a case on which Congress relied. We agree with the SeventhCircuit in United States v. Braasch, 505 F. 2d 139, 151, n. 7 (1974), cert.denied, 421 U. S. 910 (1975), that " `the modern trend of the federal courtsis to hold that bribery and extortion as used in the Hobbs Ac[t] are notmutually exclusive. United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtress such as a demand," id., at 22, and it did not properlydescribe the quid pro quo requirement for conviction if thejury found that the payment was a campaign contribution.We reject petitioner's criticism of the instruction, and conclude that it satisfies the quid pro quo requirement of McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991), because theoffense is completed at the time when the public official receives a payment in return for his agreement to performspecific official acts; fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not anelement of the offense. We also reject petitioner's conten-tion that an affirmative step is an element of the offense ofextortion "under color of official right" and need be includedin the instruction.19 As we explained above, our construction of the statute is informed by the common-law traditionfrom which the term of art was drawn and understood. Wehold today that the Government need only show that a publicofficial has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for officialacts.20Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that so many othercourts that have considered the issue over the last 20 yearshave interpreted the statute in the same way.21 Moreover,19 We do not reach petitioner's second claim pertaining to the tax fraudcount because, as petitioner conceded at oral argument, we would onlyhave to reach that claim in the event that petitioner succeeded on hisHobbs Act claim. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 27.20 The dissent states that we have "simply made up," post, at 286, therequirement that the payment must be given in return for official acts.On the contrary, that requirement is derived from the statutory language"under color of official right," which has a well-recognized common-lawheritage that distinguished between payments for private services andpayments for public services. See, e. g., Collier v. State, 55 Ala. 125(1877), which the dissent describes as a "typical case." Post, at 281.21 See, e. g., United States v. Swift, 732 F. 2d 878, 880 (CA11 1984), cert.denied, 469 U. S. 1158 (1985); United States v. Jannotti, 673 F. 2d, at 594-596; United States v. French, 628 F. 2d, at 1074; United States v.

Thesilence of the body that is empowered to give us a "contrarydirection" if it does not want the common-law rule to surviveis consistent with an application of the normal presumptionidentified in Taylor and Morissette.IIIAn argument not raised by petitioner is now advanced bythe dissent.

[as] a wrongful taking under a falsepretense of official right") (emphasis in original); post, at 282.It is perfectly clear, however, that although extortion accomplished by fraud was a well-recognized type of extortion,there were other types as well. As the court explained inCommonwealth v. Wilson, 30 Pa.

Hall, supra, the Governor of Oklahoma was convicted of extorting money "under color of official right," inviolation of the Hobbs Act; in United States v. Kenny, 462 F. 2d 1205, 1211(CA3 1972), each of the eight defendants, who was part of a scheme tointerfere with interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act, "was, orhad been, a highly placed public official or political leader in Jersey Cityor Hudson County or both"; and in United States v. Jannotti, 673 F. 2d, at578, the Government operation, which came to be known as ABSCAM, ledto the trial and conviction of various local and federal public officials,which, in other phases of the operation, included several Congressmen.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT270 EVANS v.

Indeed, none makesany reference to the state of mind of the payor, and nonestates that a "false pretense" is an element of the offense.Instead, those cases merely support the proposition that theservices for which the fee is paid must be official and thatthe official must not be entitled to the fee that he collected--both elements of the offense that are clearly satisfied in thiscase. The complete absence of support for the dissent's thesis presumably explains why it was not advanced by peti-tioner in the District Court or the Court of Appeals, is not504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 504 U.

It is so ordered.23 Moreover, the dissent attempts to have it both ways in its use ofcommon-law history. It wants to draw an artificial line and say that weshould only look at American common law and not at the more ancientEnglish common law (even though the latter provided the roots for theformer), see post, at 280-281, and at the same time, it criticizes the Courtfor relying on a " `modern' view of extortion," post, at 285-286, n. 4; it alsouses a 1961 case, which was decided 15 years after the enactment of theHobbs Act, to explain the American view of the common-law crime ofextortion at the time of the Act, see ibid., even though it claims that weare only supposed to look at "the American understanding of the crimeat the time the Hobbs Act was passed in 1946." Post, at 281. Moreover,the 1961 case that it cites, State v. Begyn, 34 N. J. 35, 46, 167 A. 2d 161,166, in which a sanitary inspector was charged with extortion for accepting payments by a scavenger who held a garbage removal contract andwho made payments in order to ensure the continuation of the contract,merely supports the proposition that extortion was not limited to the overpayment of fees. The common-law crime of extortion was broader thanthe dissent now attempts to paint it, and in any of the historical periodsto which the dissent wants to point there are cases that are contrary tothe dissent's narrow view. For "modern" cases, see Begyn, supra, andState v. Barts, 132 N. J.

UNITED STATESOpinion of Kennedy, J.Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, because in myview they correctly answer the question on which the Courtgranted certiorari--whether or not an act of inducement isan element of the offense of extortion under color of officialright. See Pet. for Cert. i. The issue raised by the dissentand discussed in Part III of the Court's opinion is not fairlyincluded in this question, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a), andsound prudential reasons suggest that the Court should notaddress it. Cf. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535-538(1992). Neither party in this case has briefed or argued thequestion. A proper resolution of the issue requires a de-tailed examination of common law extortion cases, which inturn requires intensive historical research. As there appearto be substantial arguments on either side, we would be farmore assured of arriving at the correct result were we toawait a case in which the issue had been addressed by theparties. It is unfair to the United States to decide a case ona ground not raised by the petitioner and which the UnitedStates has had no opportunity to address. For these rea-sons, I join neither the dissent nor Part III of the Court'sopinion, and I express no view as to which is correct.Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.The Court gives a summary of its decision in these words:"We hold today that the Government need only show that apublic official has obtained a payment to which he was notentitled, knowing that the payment was made in return forofficial acts." Ante, at 268. In my view the dissent is cor-rect to conclude that this language requires aquid pro quoas an element of the Government's case in a prosecutionunder 18 U. S. C. $ 1951, seepost, at 285-287, and the Court'sopinion can be interpreted in a way that is consistent withthis rule. Although the Court appears to accept the re504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of Kennedy, J.quirement of a quid pro quo as an alternative rationale, inmy view this element of the offense is essential to a determination of those acts which are criminal and those which arenot in a case in which the official does not pretend that he isentitled by law to the property in question. Here the prosecution did establish a quid pro quo that embodied the neces-sary elements of a statutory violation. I join Part III ofthe Court's opinion and concur in the judgment affirming theconviction. I write this separate opinion to explain my analysis and understanding of the statute.With regard to the question whether the word "induced"in the statutory definition of extortion applies to the phrase"under color of official right," 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(2), I findmyself in substantial agreement with the dissent. Scrutinyof the placement of commas will not, in the final analysis,yield a convincing answer, and we are left with two quiteplausible interpretations. Under these circumstances, Iagree with the dissent that the rule of lenity requires thatwe avoid the harsher one. See post, at 289. We must takeas our starting point the assumption that the portion of thestatute at issue here defines extortion as "the obtaining ofproperty from another, with his consent, induced . . . undercolor of official right."I agree with the Court, on the other hand, that the word"induced" does not "necessarily indicat[e] that the transaction must be initiated by the" public official. Ante, at 266(emphasis in original). Something beyond the mere acceptance of property from another is required, however, or elsethe word "induced" would be superfluous. That something,I submit, is the quid pro quo. The ability of the official touse or refrain from using authority is the "color of officialright" which can be invoked in a corrupt way to induce payment of money or to otherwise obtain property. The inducement generates a quid pro quo, under color of official right,that the statute prohibits. The term "under color of " isused, as I think both the Court and the dissent agree, to504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT274 EVANS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Kennedy, J.sweep within the statute those corrupt exercises of authoritythat the law forbids but that nevertheless cause damage because the exercise is by a governmental official. Cf. Monroev.Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 184 (1961) (" `Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only becausethe wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, isaction taken `under color of ' state law' ") (quotingUnitedStates v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 326 (1941)).The requirement of aquid pro quo means that withoutpretense of any entitlement to the payment, a public officialviolates $ 1951 if he intends the payor to believe that absentpayment the official is likely to abuse his office and his trustto the detriment and injury of the prospective payor or togive the prospective payor less favorable treatment if thequid pro quo is not satisfied. The official and the payor neednot state the quid pro quo in express terms, for otherwisethe law's effect could be frustrated by knowing winks andnods. The inducement from the official is criminal if it isexpress or if it is implied from his words and actions, so longas he intends it to be so and the payor so interprets it.The criminal law in the usual course concerns itself withmotives and consequences, not formalities. And the trier offact is quite capable of deciding the intent with which wordswere spoken or actions taken as well as the reasonable construction given to them by the official and the payor. SeeMcCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257, 270 (1991) ("Itgoes without saying that matters of intent are for the juryto consider"). In this respect a prosecution under the statute has some similarities to a contract dispute, with theadded and vital element that motive is crucial. For example, a quid pro quo with the attendant corrupt motive can beinferred from an ongoing course of conduct. Cf. UnitedStates v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 694 (CA2 1984) (Pierce, J.,concurring). In such instances, for a public official to commit extortion under color of official right, his course of dealings must establish a real understanding that failure to make504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of Kennedy, J.a payment will result in the victimization of the prospectivepayor or the withholding of more favorable treatment, a victimization or withholding accomplished by taking or refrain-ing from taking official action, all in breach of the official'strust. See Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction BetweenBribery and Extortion: From the Common Law to the HobbsAct, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 815, 887-888 (1988) (observing thatthe offense of official extortion has always focused on publiccorruption).Thus, I agree with the Court, that the quid pro quo re-quirement is not simply made up, as the dissent asserts.Post, at 287. Instead, this essential element of the offenseis derived from the statutory requirement that the officialreceive payment under color of official right, see ante, at 268,n. 20, as well as the inducement requirement. And thereare additional principles of construction which justify thisinterpretation. First is the principle that statutes are tobe construed so that they are constitutional. See EdwardJ. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), and casescited therein. As one Court of Appeals Judge who agreedwith the construction the Court today adopts noted, "thephrase `under color of official right,' standing alone, is vaguealmost to the point of unconstitutionality." United States v.O'Grady, supra, at 695 (Van Graafeiland, J., concurring inpart and dissenting in part) (citing Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 498-499 (1982)).By placing upon a criminal statute a narrow construction,we avoid the possibility of imputing to Congress an enactment that lacks necessary precision.Moreover, the mechanism which controls and limits thescope of official right extortion is a familiar one: a state ofmind requirement. See Morissette v. United States, 342U. S. 246 (1952) (refusing to impute to Congress the intentto create a strict liability crime despite the absence of anyexplicit mens rea requirement in the statute). Hence, even504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT276 EVANS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Kennedy, J.if the quid pro quo requirement did not have firm roots inthe statutory language, it would constitute no abuse of judicial power for us to find it by implication.Morissette legitimates the Court's decision in an additionalway. As both the Court and the dissent agree, compareante, at 260, n. 4, with post, at 288, n. 5, Congress' choice ofthe phrase "under color of official right" rather than "by colour of his office" does not reflect a substantive modificationof the common law. Instead, both the Court and dissentconclude that the language at issue here must be interpretedin light of the familiar principle that absent any indicationotherwise, Congress meant its words to be interpreted inlight of the common law. Morissette, supra, at 263. As tothe meaning of the common law, I agree with the Court'sanalysis and therefore join Part III of the Court's opinion.While the dissent may well be correct that prior to theenactment of the Hobbs Act a large number of the reportedofficial extortion cases in the United States happened to involve false pretenses, those cases do not so much as hint thata false pretense of right was ever considered as an essentialelement of the offense. See, e. g., People v. Whaley, 6 Cow.661, 663-664 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1827) ("Extortion signifies, in anenlarged sense, any oppression under color of right. In astricter sense, it signifies the taking of money by any officer,by color of his office; either, where none at all is due, or notso much due, or when it is not yet due"); Hanley v. State,125 Wis. 396, 401-402, 104 N. W. 57, 59 (1905) ("The commonlaw offense of extortion is said `to be an abuse of public justice, which consists in any officer's unlawfully taking by colorof his office, from any man, any money or thing of value thatis not due him, or more than is due him, or before it is due' ")(quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *141). Furthermore, as the Court demonstrates, see ante, at 269-270, during the same period other American courts affirmed convictions of public officials for extortion based upon corruptreceipt of payment absent any claim of right.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Opinion of Kennedy, J.Morissette is relevant in one final respect. As I have indi-cated, and as the jury instructions in this case made clear,an official violates the statute only if he agrees to receive apayment not due him in exchange for an official act, knowingthat he is not entitled to the payment. See App. 13 (requiring "wrongful use of otherwise valid official power"). Mod-ern courts familiar with the principle that only a clear congressional statement can create a strict liability offense, seeMorissette, supra, understand this fundamental limitation.I point it out only because the express terms of the common-law definition of official extortion do not state the requirement that the official's intent be corrupt, see, e. g., Whaley,supra, at 663-664; Hanley, supra, at 401-402, 104 N. W., at59; Lindgren, 35 UCLA L. Rev., at 870-871 (setting forth sixcolonial-era definitions of official extortion), and some courtsin this country appear to have taken the view that thecommon-law offense had no mens rea requirement. See,e. g., Commonwealth v. Bagley, 24 Mass. 279, 281 (1828)(affirming the conviction "of an honest and meritorious publicofficer, who by misapprehension of his rights [had] demandedand received a lawful fee for a service not yet performed").On the other hand, in other jurisdictions corrupt motive wasthought to be an element of the offense. E. g., Whaley,supra, at 664 (remarking that the jury found that the defendant accepted payment "with the corrupt intent charged inthe indictment"). In any event, even if the rule had beenotherwise at common law, our modern jurisprudence wouldrequire that there be a mens rea requirement now. Inshort, a public official who labors under the good-faith buterroneous belief that he is entitled to payment for an officialact does not violate the statute. That circumstance is not,however, presented here.The requirement of a quid pro quo in a $ 1951 prosecutionsuch as the one before us, in which it is alleged that moneywas given to the public official in the form of a campaigncontribution, was established by our decision last Term in504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT278 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingMcCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991). Readersof today's opinion should have little difficulty in understanding that the rationale underlying the Court's holding appliesnot only in campaign contribution cases, but in all $ 1951prosecutions. That is as it should be, for, given a corruptmotive, thequid pro quo, as I have said, is the essence ofthe offense.Because I agree that the jury instruction in this case com-plied with the quid pro quo requirement, I concur in thejudgment of the Court.Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice andJustice Scalia join, dissenting.The Court's analysis is based on the premise, with whichI fully agree, that when Congress employs legal terms of art,it " `knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attachedto each borrowed word in the body of learning from which itwas taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicialmind.' "Ante, at 259 (quoting Morissette v. United States,342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)). Thus, we presume, Congressknew the meaning of common-law extortion when it enactedthe Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1951. Unfortunately, today'sopinion misapprehends that meaning and misconstrues thestatute. I respectfully dissent.IExtortion is one of the oldest crimes in Anglo-Americanjurisprudence. See 3 E. Coke, Institutes *541. Hawkinsprovides the classic common-law definition: "[I]t is said, thatExtortion in a large Sense signifies any OppressionunderColour of Right; but that in a strict Sense it signifies theTaking of Money by any Officer, by Colour of his Office,either where none at all is due, or not so much is due, orwhere it is not yet due." 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown170 (2d ed. 1724) (emphasis added). Blackstone echoed thatdefinition: "[E]xtortion is an abuse of public justice, which504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingconsists in any officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of hisoffice, from any man, any money or thing of value, that is notdue to him, or more than is due, or before it is due." 4 W.Blackstone, Commentaries 141 (1769) (emphasis added).These definitions pose, but do not answer, the critical ques-tion: What does it mean for an official to take money "bycolour of his office"? The Court fails to address this ques-tion, simply assuming that common-law extortion encompassed any taking by a public official of something of valuethat he was not "due."Ante, at 260.The "under color of office" element of extortion, however,had a definite and well-established meaning at common law."At common law it was essential that the money or propertybe obtained under color of office, that is, under the pretensethat the officer was entitled thereto by virtue of his office.The money or thing received must have been claimed oraccepted in right of office, and the person paying musthave yielded to official authority." 3 R. Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure $ 1393, pp. 790-791 (1957)(emphasis added).1 Thus, although the Court purports to1 That was straightforward black-letter law at the time the Hobbs Actwas passed in 1946, and continues to be straightforward black-letter lawtoday. See, e. g., 1 W. Burdick, Law of Crime $ 275, p. 395 (1946) ("Atcommon law, the money or other thing of value must be taken under colorof office. That is, the service rendered, or to be rendered, or pretendedto have been rendered, must be apparently, or pretended to be, withinofficial power or authority, and the money must be taken in such anapparent or claimed capacity") (emphasis added; footnotes omitted); 31AAm. Jur. 2d $ 11, p. 600 (1989) ("In order to constitute extortion, the takingmust take place under color of office--that is, under the pretense that theofficer is entitled to the fee by virtue of his or her office. This requiresthat the service rendered must be apparently, or pretended to be, withinofficial power or authority, and the money must be taken in such apparentor claimed authority") (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). Cf. 7 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 401-402 (1903) (defining "color of office" as "apretense of official right to do an act made by one who has no such right;the mere semblance, shadow, or false appearance of official authority; thedissembling face of the right of office; the use of official authority as a504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT280 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingdefine official extortion under the Hobbs Act by referenceto the common law, its definition bears scant resemblanceto the common-law crime Congress presumably codified in1946.AThe Court's historical analysis rests upon a theory setforth in one law review article. Seeante, at 260, and nn. 4-6(citing Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction Between Briberyand Extortion: From the Common Law to the Hobbs Act, 35UCLA L. Rev. 815 (1988)). Focusing on early English cases,the article argues that common-law extortion encompasseda wide range of official takings, whether by coercion, falsepretenses, or bribery. Whatever the merits of that argu-ment as a description of early English common law,2 it ispretext or cover for the commission of some corrupt or vicious act; an actevilly done, by the countenance of an office; an act unjustly done by thecountenance of an office; an act wrongfully done by an officer under thepretended authority of his office; and is always taken in the worst sense,being grounded upon corruption, of which the office is as a mere shadowor color; under statutes, the phrase is used to define an illegal claim ofright or authority to take the security; some illegal exertion of authority,whereby an obligation is extorted which the statute does not require tobe given") (footnotes omitted).2 Those merits are far from clear. Most commentators maintain thatextortion and bribery were distinct crimes at early English common law.See, e. g., J. Noonan, Bribes 398, 585-587 (1984); Ruff, Federal Prosecutionof Local Corruption: A Case Study in the Making of Law EnforcementPolicy, 65 Geo. L. J. 1171, 1179-1180 (1977). While--as I explain below--Professor Lindgren may well be correct that common-law extortion didnot contain an "inducement" element, in my view he does not adequatelyaccount for the crime's "by color of office" element. This latter elementhas existed since long before the founding of the Republic, and cannotsimply be ignored. As Chief Justice Mountague explained over four centuries ago, colore officii sui ("by color of his office") "signifies an Act badlydone under the Countenance of an Office, and it bears a dissembling Visage of Duty, and is properly called Extortion." Dive v. Maningham, 1Plowd. 60, 68, 75 Eng. Rep. 96, 108 (C. B. 1550) (emphasis added). Seealso 3 E. Coke, Institutes *542 (describing extortion as "more odious than504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT281Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingbeside the point here--the critical inquiry for our purposesis the American understanding of the crime at the time theHobbs Act was passed in 1946. Cf. Harmelin v.

S. 957, 975 (1991) (plurality opinion) (English historical background is relevant in determining the meaningof a constitutional provision, but the "ultimate question"is the meaning of that provision to the Americans whoadopted it).A survey of 19th- and early 20th-century cases construingstate extortion statutes in light of the common law makesplain that the offense was understood to involve not merelya wrongful taking by a public official, but a wrongful takingunder a false pretense of official right. A typical case isCollier v. State, 55 Ala. 125 (1877). The defendant there wasa local prosecutor who, for a fee, had given legal advice to acriminal suspect. The Alabama Supreme Court rejectedthe State's contention that the defendant's receipt of thefee--even though improper--amounted to "extortion," because he had not taken the money "under color of hisoffice." "The object of the [extortion] statute is . . . notthe obtaining money by mere impropriety of conduct, orby fraud, by persons filling official position."Id., at127. Rather, the court explained, "[a] taking under colorof office is of the essence of the offense. The moneyor thing received must have been claimed, or accepted, inright of office, and the person paying must have been yielding to official authority." Id., at 128 (emphasis added).That a public official took money he was not due wasnot enough. "[T]hough the defendant may have beenguilty of official infidelity, the wrong was to the Stateonly, and no wrong was done the person paying themoney. That wrong is not punishable under this indictment. Private and public wrong must concur, to constituterobbery; for robbery is apparent, and hath the face of a crime, but extortion puts on the visure of virtue") (emphasis added).504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT282 EVANS v.

Numerous decisions from other juris-dictions confirm that an official obtained a payment "undercolor of his office" only--as the phrase suggests--when heused the office to assert a false pretense of official right tothe payment.3Because the Court misapprehends the "color of office" requirement, the crime it describes today is not the common-law crime that Congress presumably incorporated into theHobbs Act.

S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingCourt's historical foray has the single-minded purpose ofproving that common-law extortion didnot include an element of "inducement"; in its haste to reach that conclusion,the Court fails to consider the elements that common-lawextortion did include. Even if the Court were correct thatan official could commit extortion at common law simply byreceiving (but not "inducing") an unlawful payment, it doesnot follow either historically or logically that an official automatically committed extortion whenever he received sucha payment.The Court, therefore, errs in asserting that common-lawextortion is the "rough equivalent of what we would nowdescribe as `taking a bribe.' " Ante, at 260. Regardless ofwhether extortion contains an "inducement" requirement,bribery and extortion are different crimes. An official whosolicits or takes a bribe does not do so "under color of office";i. e., under any pretense of official entitlement. "The distinction between bribery and extortion seems to be that theformer offense consists in offering a present or receiving one,the latter in demanding a fee or present by color of office."State v. Pritchard, 107 N. C. 921, 929, 12 S. E. 50, 52 (1890)(emphasis added). Where extortion is at issue, the publicofficial is the sole wrongdoer; because he acts "under color ofoffice," the law regards the payor as an innocent victim andnot an accomplice. See, e. g., 1 W. Burdick, Law of Crime$$ 273-275, pp. 392-396 (1946). With bribery, in contrast,the payor knows the recipient official is not entitled to thepayment; he, as well as the official, may be punished for theoffense. See, e. g., id., $$ 288-292, at 426-436. Congress iswell aware of the distinction between the crimes; it has always treated them separately. Compare 18 U. S. C. $ 872("[e]xtortion by officers or employees of the United States"(emphasis added), which criminalizes extortion by federal officials, and makes no provision for punishment of the payor),with 18 U. S. C. $ 201 ("[b]ribery of public officials and witnesses" (emphasis added), which criminalizes bribery of and504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT284 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingby federal officials). By stretching the bounds of extortionto make it encompass bribery, the Court today blurs the traditional distinction between the crimes.44 The Court alleges a "complete absence of support" for the definition ofcommon-law extortion set forth in this dissent, and cites five Americancases that allegedly support its understanding of the crime. Ante, at 269-271. The Court is mistaken on both counts: even a brief perusal of 19thand early 20th-century cases, as well as treatises and hornbooks, showsthat my description of the crime is anything but novel, and the cases citedby the Court in no way support its argument.The Court first cites two intermediate-court cases from Pennsylvania,Commonwealth v. Wilson, 30 Pa. Super. 26 (1906), and Commonwealth v.Brown, 23 Pa. Super. 470 (1903). Those opinions, both written by oneJudge Rice, display an obvious misunderstanding of the meaning of "colorof office." Citing the definition of that phrase set forth in the Cyclopediaof Law and Practice, see n. 1, supra, the Court confuses a false pretenseof official authority to receive a payment with a false pretense of officialauthority to do an official act. See Wilson, supra, at 31 ("Bribery on thepart of an officer and extortion are not identical, but they are very closelyallied; and whilst the former does not necessarily involve a pretense ofofficial authority to do the act for which the bribe is given, yet, if suchpretense is used to induce its payment, we see no reason to doubt that thetaking of it is common-law extortion as well as bribery") (emphasis added).But, as Hawkins, Blackstone, and all other expositors of black-letter lawmake clear, the crux of common-law extortion was the unlawful taking ofmoney by color of office, not the unlawful taking of money to do an act bycolor of office.In any event, the Pennsylvania court's unorthodox understanding ofcommon-law extortion in no way supports the Court's definition of thecrime, as the Pennsylvania court explicitly required a pretense of authority to induce the unlawful payment--precisely the requirement the Courttoday rejects. See also Commonwealth v. Francis, 201 Pa. Super. 313,322-323, 191 A. 2d 884, 889 (1963) (citing Wilson and Brown for the proposition that "the extraction of money or other things of value under a threatof using the power of one's office may constitute extortion" and explainingthat "[a]lthough we have recognized that the crimes of common law extortion and bribery may coincide at times, . . . it is generally held that theyare mutually exclusive crimes") (emphasis added).The third case cited by the Court, State v. Sweeney, 180 Minn. 450, 231N. W. 225 (1930), does not involve extortion at all--it upheld a Minneapolisalderman's conviction for bribery. At trial on one charge of receiving a504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT285Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingBPerhaps because the common-law crime--as the Court de-fines it--is so expansive, the Court, at the very end of itsopinion, appends a qualification: "We hold today that thebribe, the State introduced evidence that the defendant had received otherbribes, some from gambling houses. He challenged the admission of theevidence of other crimes; the court rejected that challenge on evidentiarygrounds. In passing, however, the court said: "It may be noted, however,that it may be that the defendant and [another alderman], in dealing withthe gambling houses, were guilty of extortion under [the state statute]."Id., at 456, 231 N. W., at 228 (emphasis added). That is all. The Court'sparenthetical claim that "dicta" in the opinion support the proposition that"alderman's acceptance of money for the erection of a barn, the runningof a gambling house, and the opening of a filling station would constituteextortion" is, at best, a gross overstatement. Ante, at 270.Fourth, the Court cites State v. Barts, 132 N. J. L. 74, 76, 83, 38 A. 2d838, 841, 844 (1944), which upheld the extortion conviction of a police officer, based essentially on a bribery rationale. As the New Jersey SupremeCourt has neatly explained, however, that case represented a departurefrom the traditional common law of extortion:"Our extortion statute, which had its origin at least as early as 1796,appears on its face to have been originally intended to be reiterative ofthe common law. The essence of that offense was the receiving or takingby any public officer, by color of his office, of any fee or reward not allowedby law for performing his duties. The purpose would seem to be simplyto penalize the officer who non-innocently insisted upon a larger fee thanhe was entitled to or a fee where none was permitted or required to bepaid for the performance of an obligatory function of his office. Thematter was obviously of particular importance in the days when publicofficials received their compensation through fees collected and not byfixed salary. Our early cases dealt with precisely this kind of a situation.[Citing, inter alia, Cutter v. State and Loftus v. State, see n. 3, supra]."After a couple of opinions possibly indicating an extension to coverpayments demanded for the favorable exercise of discretionary powers ofthe officer, an enlarged construction of the statute to its present day scopewas announced in State v. Barts . . . . This present construction of thecrime thus overlaps the offense of bribery since extortion is committedeven where the object of the payment is in reality to influence an officerin his official behavior or conduct without such having to be established."State v. Begyn, 34 N. J. 35, 46-47, 167 A. 2d 161, 166-167 (1961) (emphasisadded; citations omitted). If the Court wishes to adopt the "modern"504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT286 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingGovernment need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing thatthe payment was made in return for official acts." Ante,at 268 (emphasis added). This quid pro quo requirement issimply made up. The Court does not suggest that it has anybasis in the common law or the language of the Hobbs Act,and I have found no treatise or dictionary that refers to anysuch requirement in defining "extortion."Its only conceivable source, in fact, is our opinion last Termin McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991). Quitesensibly, we insisted in that case that, unless the Governmentestablished the existence of a quid pro quo, a public officialcould not be convicted of extortion under the Hobbs Act foraccepting a campaign contribution. We did not purport todiscern that requirement in the common law or statutorytext, but imposed it to prevent the Hobbs Act from effectinga radical (and absurd) change in American political life. "Toview of extortion, fine; but it should not attempt to present that view as"common-law history."Finally, the Court cites White v. State, 56 Ga. 385 (1876). There theGeorgia Supreme Court reversed the extortion conviction of a special constable who was charged with improperly keeping a fee that he had collected. The court first explained that a transaction was not extortion ifthe defendant "took the money in good faith, without any claim to it."Id., at 389 (emphasis added). The court then went on, in dicta, to assertthat if an officer "should use his authority, or any process of law in hishands, for the purpose of awing or seducing any person into paying hima bribe, that would, doubtless, be extortion." Ibid. (emphasis added).For this latter proposition the Georgia court cited no authority. Thecourt's error is manifest: it confused the common-law meaning of extortion(an officer wrongfully taking money under color of his office) with thecolloquial meaning of the term (which conjures up coercion, and thus is atonce broader and narrower than the common law). To the extent thatWhite's dicta cuts against my understanding of common-law extortion, ofcourse, it cuts equally strongly against the Court's, for, like the Pennsylvania cases cited earlier in this footnote, it quite obviously requires that theextorted payment be "induced" by the officer--the very requirement theCourt today rejects.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT287Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentinghold otherwise would open to prosecution not only conductthat has long been thought to be well within the law but alsoconduct that in a very real sense is unavoidable so long aselection campaigns are financed by private contributions orexpenditures, as they have been from the beginning of theNation. It would require statutory language more explicitthan the Hobbs Act contains to justify a contrary conclusion." Id., at 272-273. We expressly limited our holdingto campaign contributions. Id., at 274, n. 10 ("[W]e do notdecide whether a quid pro quo requirement exists in othercontexts, such as when an elected official receives gifts,meals, travel expenses, or other items of value").Because the common-law history of extortion was neitherproperly briefed nor argued in McCormick, see id., at 268,n. 6; id., at 276-277 (Scalia, J., concurring), the quid pro quolimitation imposed there represented a reasonable first stepin the right direction. Now that we squarely consider thathistory, however, it is apparent that that limitation was infact overly modest: at common law, McCormick was innocentof extortion not because he failed to offer a quid pro quo inreturn for campaign contributions, but because he did nottake the contributions under color of official right. Today'sextension of McCormick's reasonable (but textually and historically artificial) quid pro quo limitation to all cases of official extortion is both unexplained and inexplicable--exceptinsofar as it may serve to rescue the Court's definition ofextortion from substantial overbreadth.IIAs serious as the Court's disregard for history is its disregard for well-established principles of statutory construction. The Court chooses not only the harshest interpretation of a criminal statute, but also the interpretation thatmaximizes federal criminal jurisdiction over state and localofficials. I would reject both choices.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT288 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingAThe Hobbs Act defines "extortion" as "the obtaining ofproperty from another, with his consent,induced by wrong-ful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, orunder color of official right." 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(2) (em-phasis added).5 Evans argues, in part, that he did not"induce" any payment. The Court rejects that argument,concluding that the verb "induced" applies only to the firstportion of the definition. Ante, at 265. Thus, according tothe Court, the statute should read: " `The term "extortion"means the obtaining of property from another, with his con-sent,either [1] induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-ened force, violence, or fear, or [2] under color of officialright.' " Ante, at 265, n. 15. That is, I concede, a conceiv-able construction of the words. But it is--at the veryleast--forced, for it sets up an unnatural and ungrammaticalparallel between theverb "induced" and the preposition"under."The more natural construction is that the verb "induced"applies to both types of extortion described in the statute.Thus, the unstated "either" belongs after "induced": "Theterm `extortion' means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced either [1] by wrongful useof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear,or [2] undercolor of official right." This construction comports with correct grammar and standard usage by setting up a parallelbetween two prepositional phrases, the first beginning with"by"; the second with "under." 65 I have no quarrel with the Court's suggestion, see ante at 260, n. 4, thatthere is no difference of substance between the classic common-law phrase"by colour of his office" and the Hobbs Act's formulation "under color ofofficial right." The Act's formulation, of course, only underscores extortion's essential element of a false assertion of official right to a payment.6 This is, moreover, the construction long espoused by the Justice Department. See U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual$ 9-131.180 (1984) ("[T]here is some question as to whether the Hobbs Act504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT289Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingOur duty in construing this criminal statute, then, is clear:"The Court has often stated that when there are two rationalreadings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other,we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has spokenin clear and definite language." McNally v. United States,483 U. S. 350, 359-360 (1987). See alsoUnited States v.Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.). Becausethe Court's expansive interpretation of the statute is notthe only plausible one, the rule of lenity compels adoption ofthe narrower interpretation. That rule, as we have ex-plained on many occasions, serves two vitally importantfunctions:"First, `a fair warning should be given to the world inlanguage that the common world will understand, ofwhat the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.To make the warning fair, so far as possible the lineshould be clear.' Second, because of the seriousness ofcriminal penalties, and because criminal punishmentusually represents the moral condemnation of the com-munity, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity." United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348(1971) (citations omitted; footnote omitted).Given the text of the statute and the rule of lenity, I believethat inducement is an element of official extortion under theHobbs Act.Perhaps sensing the weakness of its position, the Courtsuggests an alternative interpretation: even if the statutedoes set forth an "inducement" requirement for officialextortion, that requirement is always satisfied, because"the coercive element is provided by the public office itself."defines [official] extortion as `the obtaining of property from another undercolor of official right,' or as `the obtaining of property from another, withhis consent, induced under color of official right.'. . . [T]he grammaticalstructure of the Hobbs Act would appear to support the latter language")(emphasis added).504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT290 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingAnte, at 266. I disagree. A particular public official, to besure, may wield his power in such a way as to coerceunlawful payments, even in the absence of any explicitdemand or threat. But it ignores reality to assert thatevery public official, in every context, automatically exertscoercive influence on others by virtue of his office. If thechairman of General Motors meets with a local court clerk,for example, whatever implicit coercive pressures exist willsurely not emanate from the clerk. In Miranda v. Arizona,384 U. S. 436 (1966), of course, this Court established apresumption of "inherently compelling pressures" in the con-text of official custodial interrogation.Id., at 467. Now,apparently, we assume thatall public officials exude an auraof coercion at all places and at all times. That is notprogress. BThe Court's construction of the Hobbs Act is repugnantnot only to the basic tenets of criminal justice reflected inthe rule of lenity, but also to basic tenets of federalism.Over the past 20 years, the Hobbs Act has served as theengine for a stunning expansion of federal criminal juris-diction into a field traditionally policed by state and locallaws--acts of public corruption by state and local officials.See generally Ruff, Federal Prosecution of Local Corruption: A Case Study in the Making of Law EnforcementPolicy, 65 Geo. L. J. 1171 (1977). That expansion was bornof a single sentence in a Third Circuit opinion: "[The`under color of official right' language in the Hobbs Act]repeats the common law definition of extortion, a crimewhich could only be committed by a public official, and whichdid not require proof of threat, fear, or duress." UnitedStates v. Kenny, 462 F. 2d 1205, 1229, cert. denied, 409 U. S.914 (1972). As explained above, that sentence is not neces-sarily incorrect in its description of what common-law extortion did not require; unfortunately, it omits an importantpart of what common-law extortion did require. By over504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT291Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentinglooking the traditional meaning of "under color of officialright,"Kenny obliterated the distinction between extortionand bribery, essentially creating a new crime encompassingboth."As effectively as if there were federal common lawcrimes, the court inKenny . . . amend[ed] the Hobbs Actand [brought] into existence a new crime--local briberyaffecting interstate commerce. Hereafter, for purposesof Hobbs Act prosecutions, such bribery was to be calledextortion. The federal policing of state corruption hadbegun." J. Noonan, Bribes 586 (1984).After Kenny, federal prosecutors came to view the HobbsAct as a license for ferreting out all wrongdoing at the stateand local level--" `a special code of integrity for public officials.' " United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 694 (CA21984) (en banc) (quoting letter from Raymond J. Dearie,United States Attorney for the Eastern District of NewYork, to the United States Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit, dated Jan. 21, 1983). In short order, most other Circuits followed Kenny's lead and upheld, based on a briberyrationale, the Hobbs Act extortion convictions of an astonishing variety of state and local officials, from a State Governor,seeUnited States v. Hall, 536 F. 2d 313, 320-321 (CA10),cert. denied, 429 U. S. 919 (1976), down to a local policeman,see United States v. Braasch, 505 F. 2d 139, 151 (CA7 1974),cert. denied, 421 U. S. 910 (1975).Our precedents, to be sure, suggest that Congress enjoysbroad constitutional power to legislate in areas traditionallyregulated by the States--power that apparently extendseven to the direct regulation of the qualifications, tenure, andconduct of state governmental officials. See, e. g., Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528,547-554 (1985). As we emphasized only last Term, however,concerns of federalism require us to give a narrow construction to federal legislation in such sensitive areas unless504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT292 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingCongress' contrary intent is "unmistakably clear in thelanguage of the statute."Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.452, 460 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Thisplain statement rule is nothing more than an acknowledgment that the States retain substantial sovereignpowers under our constitutional scheme, powers with whichCongress does not readily interfere."Id., at 461. Gregory's teaching is straightforward: because we "assumeCongress does not exercise lightly" its extraordinary powerto regulate state officials, id., at 460, we will construeambiguous statutory provisions in the least intrusive manner that can reasonably be inferred from the statute, id.,at 467.Gregory's rule represents nothing more than a restatement of established law:"Congress has traditionally been reluctant to define asa federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminalby the States. . . . As this Court emphasized only lastTerm in Rewis v. United States, [401 U. S. 808 (1971)--a case involving the Hobbs Act's counterpart, the TravelAct], we will not be quick to assume that Congress hasmeant to effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction. Intraditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affectingthe federal balance, the requirement of clear statementassures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involvedin the judicial decision."

Baxter, Federal Dis7 Prior to our decision in McNally, the Government's theory had beenaccepted by every Court of Appeals to consider the issue. We did notconsider that acceptance to cure the ambiguity we perceived in thestatutory language; we simply reiterated the traditional learning that afederal criminal statute, particularly as applied to state officials, mustbe construed narrowly. See 483 U. S., at 359-360. "If Congress desiresto go further," we said, "it must speak more clearly than it has." Id.,at 360.The dissent in McNally argued strenuously that the Court's interpretation of the statute should be informed by the majority view among theCourts of Appeals and Congress' subsequent silence:"Perhaps the most distressing aspect of the Court's action today is itscasual--almost summary--rejection of the accumulated wisdom of themany distinguished federal judges who have thoughtfully considered andcorrectly answered the question these cases present. . . . I [can]not join arejection of such a longstanding, consistent interpretation of a federalstatute. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Fink, 483 U.

S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring)." Id., at 376-377 (opinion of Stevens, J.).The interpretation given a statute by a majority of the Courts ofAppeals, of course, is due our most respectful consideration. Ultimately, however, our attention must focus on the reasons given forthat interpretation. Error is not cured by repetition, and we do not discharge our duty simply by counting up the circuits on either side of thesplit. Here, the minority position of the Second and Ninth Circuits(both en banc) is far more thoughtfully reasoned than the position ofthe majority of Circuits, which have followed the Third Circuit's lead inUnited States v.

Rev. 321, 336-343 (1983).The reader of today's opinion, however, will search in vainfor any consideration of the principles of federalism that animated Gregory, Rewis, Bass, and McNally. It is clear, ofcourse, that the Hobbs Act's proscription of extortion "undercolor of official right" applies to all public officials, includingthose at the state and local level. As our cases emphasize,however, even when Congress has clearly decided to engagein some regulation of the state governmental officials, concerns of federalism play a vital role in evaluating the scopeof the regulation.8 The Court today mocks this jurisprudence by reading two significant limitations (the textual requirement of "inducement" and the common-law requirementof "under color of office") out of the Hobbs Act's definition ofofficial extortion.proval" of judicial interpretation of a statute) (internal quotation marksomitted).I find it unfortunate that the arguments we rejected in McNally todaybecome the law of the land. See ante, at 268-269 ("Our conclusion isbuttressed by the fact that so many other courts that have considered theissue over the last 20 years have interpreted the statute in the same way.Moreover, given the number of appellate court decisions . . . it is obviousthat Congress is aware of the prevailing view" and has ratified that viewthrough its silence).8 This case is, if anything, more compelling than Gregory v. Ashcroft,501 U. S. 452 (1991). In both cases, Congress clearly chose to engage insome regulation of state governmental officials. In Gregory, however,that regulation was sweeping on its face, and our task was to construe anexemption from that otherwise broad coverage. We decided the case onthe ground that the exemption must be assumed to include judges unlessa contrary intent were manifest. "[I]n this case we are not looking for aplain statement that judges are excluded. We will not read the [statute]to cover state judges unless Congress has made it clear that judges areincluded. . . . [I]t must be plain to anyone reading the Act that it coversjudges." Id., at 467. Here, in contrast, our task is to construe the primary scope of the Hobbs Act.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT295Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)Thomas, J., dissentingIIII have no doubt that today's opinion is motivated by nobleaims. Political corruption at any level of government is aserious evil, and, from a policy perspective, perhaps one wellsuited for federal law enforcement. But federal judges arenot free to devise new crimes to meet the occasion. ChiefJustice Marshall's warning is as timely today as ever: "Itwould be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that acase which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, iswithin its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumer-ated in the statute, because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated." UnitedStates v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat., at 96.Whatever evils today's opinion may redress, in my view,pale beside those it will engender. "Courts must resist th[e]temptation [to stretch criminal statutes] in the interest ofthe long-range preservation of limited and even-handed government." United States v. Mazzei, 521 F. 2d 639, 656 (CA31975) (en banc) (Gibbons, J., dissenting). All Americans, including public officials, are entitled to protection from prose-cutorial abuse. Cf.Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 727-732 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The facts of this casesuggest a depressing erosion of that protection.Petitioner Evans was elected to the Board of Commission-ers of DeKalb County, Georgia, in 1982. He was no localtyrant--just one of five part-time commissioners earning anannual salary of approximately $16,000. The board's activities were entirely local, including the quintessentially localactivity of zoning property. The United States does notsuggest that there were any allegations of corruption or mal-feasance against Evans.In early 1985, as part of an investigation into "allegationsof public corruption in the Atlanta area," a Federal Bureauof Investigation agent, Clifford Cormany, Jr., set up a bogusfirm, "WDH Developers," and pretended to be a land developer. Cormany sought and obtained a meeting with Evans.504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT296 EVANS v. UNITED STATESThomas, J., dissentingFrom March 1985 until October 1987, a period of some twoand a half years, Cormany or one of his associates held 33conversations with Evans. Every one of these contacts wasinitiated by the agents. During these conversations, theagents repeatedly requested Evans' assistance in securing afavorable zoning decision, and repeatedly brought up thesubject of campaign contributions. Agent Cormany eventually contributed $8,000 to Evans' reelection campaign, andEvans accepted the money. There is no suggestion that heclaimed an official entitlement to the payment. Nonetheless,he was arrested and charged with Hobbs Act extortion.The Court is surely correct that there is sufficient evidenceto support the jury's verdict that Evans committed "extortion" under the Court's expansive interpretation of thecrime. But that interpretation has no basis in the statutethat Congress passed in 1946. If the Court makes up thisversion of the crime today, who is to say what version it willmake up tomorrow when confronted with the next perceivedrascal? Until now, the Justice Department, with good reason, has been extremely cautious in advancing the theorythat official extortion contains no inducement requirement."Until the Supreme Court decides upon the validity of thistype of conviction, prosecutorial discretion should be used toinsure that any case which might reach that level of review isworthy of federal prosecution. Such restraint would require that only significant amounts of money and reasonablyhigh levels of office should be involved." See U. S. Dept. ofJustice, United States Attorneys' Manual $ 9-131.180 (1984)(emphasis added). Having detected no "[s]uch restraint" inthis case, I certainly have no reason to expect it in the future.Our criminal justice system runs on the premise thatprosecutors will respect, and courts will enforce, the boundaries on criminal conduct set by the legislature. Where, ashere, those boundaries are breached, it becomes impossibleto tell where prosecutorial discretion ends and prosecutorialabuse, or even discrimination, begins.

He nowchallenges that conviction on the ground that the jury was given improperinstructions. He did not, however, challenge those instructions at trialor in the Court of Appeals. Thus, his current challenge is not properlybefore this Court. See Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 362(1981); Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.

NORTH DAKOTA, by and throughits TAX COMMISSIONER, HEITKAMPcertiorari to the supreme court of north dakotaNo. 91-194. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided May 26, 1992Respondent North Dakota, through its Tax Commissioner, filed an actionin state court to require petitioner Quill Corporation--an out-of-statemail-order house with neither outlets nor sales representatives in theState--to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use in theState. The trial court ruled in Quill's favor. It found the case indistinguishable from National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue ofIll., 386 U. S. 753, which, in holding that a similar Illinois statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and created anunconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, concluded that a "sellerwhose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrieror the . . . mail" lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State.Id., at 758. The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding, inter alia,that, pursuant to Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,and its progeny, the Commerce Clause no longer mandated the sort ofphysical-presence nexus suggested in Bellas Hess; and that, with respect to the Due Process Clause, cases following Bellas Hess had notconstrued minimum contacts to require physical presence within a Stateas a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of state power.Held:1. The Due Process Clause does not bar enforcement of the State'suse tax against Quill. This Court's due process jurisprudence hasevolved substantially since Bellas Hess, abandoning formalistic tests focused on a defendant's presence within a State in favor of a more flexibleinquiry into whether a defendant's contacts with the forum made it reasonable, in the context of the federal system of Government, to requireit to defend the suit in that State. See Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S.186, 212. Thus, to the extent that this Court's decisions have indicatedthat the Clause requires a physical presence in a State, they are overruled. In this case, Quill has purposefully directed its activities atNorth Dakota residents, the magnitude of those contacts are more thansufficient for due process purposes, and the tax is related to the benefitsQuill receives from access to the State.

S. 298 (1992)Syllabus(a) Bellas Hess was not rendered obsolete by this Court's subsequent decision in Complete Auto, supra, which set forth the four-parttest that continues to govern the validity of state taxes under the Commerce Clause. Although Complete Auto renounced an analytical approach that looked to a statute's formal language rather than its practical effect in determining a state tax statute's validity, the Bellas Hessdecision did not rely on such formalism. Nor is Bellas Hess inconsistent with Complete Auto. It concerns the first part of the CompleteAuto test and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the"substantial nexus" required by the Commerce Clause. Pp. 309-312.(b) Contrary to the State's argument, a mail-order house may havethe "minimum contacts" with a taxing State as required by the DueProcess Clause and yet lack the "substantial nexus" with the State required by the Commerce Clause. These requirements are not identicaland are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies. Dueprocess concerns the fundamental fairness of governmental activity,and the touchstone of due process nexus analysis is often identified as"notice" or "fair warning." In contrast, the Commerce Clause and itsnexus requirement are informed by structural concerns about the effects of state regulation on the national economy. Pp. 312-313.(c) The evolution of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudencedoes not indicate repudiation of the Bellas Hess rule. While cases subsequent to Bellas Hess and concerning other types of taxes have notadopted a bright-line, physical-presence requirement similar to that inBellas Hess, see, e. g., Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Department of Revenue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560, their reasoning does not compel rejectionof the Bellas Hess rule regarding sales and use taxes. To the contrary,the continuing value of a bright-line rule in this area and the doctrineand principles of stare decisis indicate that the rule remains good law.Pp. 314-318.(d) The underlying issue here is one that Congress may be betterqualified to resolve and one that it has the ultimate power to resolve.Pp. 318-319.470 N.

NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtor overrule Bellas Hess. While we agree with much of thestate court's reasoning, we take the former course.IQuill is a Delaware corporation with offices and ware-houses in Illinois, California, and Georgia. None of its employees work or reside in North Dakota, and its ownershipof tangible property in that State is either insignificant ornonexistent.1 Quill sells office equipment and supplies;it solicits business through catalogs and flyers, advertisements in national periodicals, and telephone calls. Its an-nual national sales exceed $200 million, of which almost $1million are made to about 3,000 customers in North Dakota.It is the sixth largest vendor of office supplies in the State.It delivers all of its merchandise to its North Dakota custom-ers by mail or common carrier from out-of-state locations.As a corollary to its sales tax, North Dakota imposes a usetax upon property purchased for storage, use, or consumption within the State. North Dakota requires every "re-tailer maintaining a place of business in" the State to collectthe tax from the consumer and remit it to the State. N. D.Cent. Code $ 57-40.2-07 (Supp. 1991). In 1987, North Dakota amended the statutory definition of the term "retailer"to include "every person who engages in regular or system1 In the trial court, the State argued that because Quill gave its customers an unconditional 90-day guarantee, it retained title to the merchandiseduring the 90-day period after delivery. The trial court held, however,that title passed to the purchaser when the merchandise was received.See App. to Pet. for Cert. A40-A41. The State Supreme Court assumedfor the purposes of its decision that that ruling was correct. 470 N. W. 2d203, 217, n. 13 (1991). The State Supreme Court also noted that Quilllicensed a computer software program to some of its North Dakota customers that enabled them to check Quill's current inventories and pricesand to place orders directly. Id., at 216-217. As we shall explain, Quill'sinterests in the licensed software does not affect our analysis of the dueprocess issue and does not comprise the "substantial nexus" required bythe Commerce Clause. See n. 8, infra.504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the Courtatic solicitation of a consumer market in th[e] state." $ 57-40.2-01(6). State regulations in turn define "regular or systematic solicitation" to mean three or more advertisementswithin a 12-month period. N. D. Admin. Code $ 81-04.1-01-03.1 (1988). Thus, since 1987, mail-order companies that engage in such solicitation have been subject to the tax even ifthey maintain no property or personnel in North Dakota.Quill has taken the position that North Dakota does nothave the power to compel it to collect a use tax from itsNorth Dakota customers. Consequently, the State, throughits Tax Commissioner, filed this action to require Quill to paytaxes (as well as interest and penalties) on all such salesmade after July 1, 1987. The trial court ruled in Quill'sfavor, finding the case indistinguishable from Bellas Hess;specifically, it found that because the State had not shownthat it had spent tax revenues for the benefit of the mailorder business, there was no "nexus to allow the state todefine retailer in the manner it chose." App. to Pet. forCert. A41.The North Dakota Supreme Court reversed, concludingthat "wholesale changes" in both the economy and the lawmade it inappropriate to follow Bellas Hess today. 470N. W. 2d, at 213. The principal economic change noted bythe court was the remarkable growth of the mail-order business "from a relatively inconsequential market niche" in 1967to a "goliath" with annual sales that reached "the staggeringfigure of $183.3 billion in 1989." Id., at 208, 209. Moreover,the court observed, advances in computer technology greatlyeased the burden of compliance with a " `welter of complicated obligations' " imposed by state and local taxing authorities. Id., at 215 (quoting Bellas Hess, 386 U. S., at 759-760).Equally important, in the court's view, were the changesin the "legal landscape." With respect to the CommerceClause, the court emphasized that Complete Auto Transit,Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), rejected the line of casesholding that the direct taxation of interstate commerce was504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT304 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtimpermissible and adopted instead a "consistent and rationalmethod of inquiry [that focused on] the practical effect of[the] challenged tax." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner ofTaxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980). This and subsequentrulings, the court maintained, indicated that the CommerceClause no longer mandated the sort of physical-presencenexus suggested in Bellas Hess.Similarly, with respect to the Due Process Clause, theNorth Dakota court observed that cases following BellasHess had not construed "minimum contacts" to require physical presence within a State as a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of state power. The state court then concluded that "the Due Process requirement of a `minimalconnection' to establish nexus is encompassed within theComplete Auto test" and that the relevant inquiry under thelatter test was whether "the state has provided some protection, opportunities, or benefit for which it can expect a return." 470 N. W. 2d, at 216.Turning to the case at hand, the state court emphasizedthat North Dakota had created "an economic climate thatfosters demand for" Quill's products, maintained a legal infrastructure that protected that market, and disposed of 24tons of catalogs and flyers mailed by Quill into the Stateevery year. Id., at 218-219. Based on these facts, thecourt concluded that Quill's "economic presence" in NorthDakota depended on services and benefits provided by theState and therefore generated "a constitutionally sufficientnexus to justify imposition of the purely administrative dutyof collecting and remitting the use tax." Id., at 219.22 The court also suggested that, in view of the fact that the "touchstoneof Due Process is fundamental fairness" and that the "very object" of theCommerce Clause is protection of interstate business against discriminatory local practices, it would be ironic to exempt Quill from this burdenand thereby allow it to enjoy a significant competitive advantage overlocal retailers. 470 N. W. 2d, at 214-215.504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT305Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIIAs in a number of other cases involving the application ofstate taxing statutes to out-of-state sellers, our holding inBellas Hess relied on both the Due Process Clause and theCommerce Clause. Although the "two claims are closely related," Bellas Hess, 386 U. S., at 756, the Clauses pose distinct limits on the taxing powers of the States. Accordingly,while a State may, consistent with the Due Process Clause,have the authority to tax a particular taxpayer, impositionof the tax may nonetheless violate the Commerce Clause.See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington StateDept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).The two constitutional requirements differ fundamentally,in several ways. As discussed at greater length below, seePart IV, infra, the Due Process Clause and the CommerceClause reflect different constitutional concerns. Moreover,while Congress has plenary power to regulate commerceamong the States and thus may authorize state actions thatburden interstate commerce, see International Shoe Co. v.Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 315 (1945), it does not similarlyhave the power to authorize violations of the Due ProcessClause.Thus, although we have not always been precise in distinguishing between the two, the Due Process Clause and theCommerce Clause are analytically distinct." `Due process' and `commerce clause' conceptions arenot always sharply separable in dealing with theseproblems. . . . To some extent they overlap. If there isa want of due process to sustain the tax, by that factalone any burden the tax imposes on the commerceamong the states becomes `undue.' But, though overlapping, the two conceptions are not identical. Theremay be more than sufficient factual connections, witheconomic and legal effects, between the transaction andthe taxing state to sustain the tax as against due process504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT306 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtobjections. Yet it may fall because of its burdening ef-fect upon the commerce. And, although the two notionscannot always be separated, clarity of consideration andof decision would be promoted if the two issues are approached, where they are presented, at least tentativelyas if they were separate and distinct, not intermingledones." International Harvester Co. v. Department ofTreasury, 322 U. S. 340, 353 (1944) (Rutledge, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part).Heeding Justice Rutledge's counsel, we consider each consti-tutional limit in turn.IIIThe Due Process Clause "requires some definite link, someminimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax," Miller Brothers Co. v.Maryland, 347 U. S. 340, 344-345 (1954), and that the "in-come attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to `values connected with the taxing State,' "Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978) (citationomitted). Here, we are concerned primarily with the firstof these requirements. Prior to Bellas Hess, we had heldthat that requirement was satisfied in a variety of circumstances involving use taxes. For example, the presence ofsales personnel in the State3 or the maintenance of local retail stores in the State 4 justified the exercise of that powerbecause the seller's local activities were "plainly accordedthe protection and services of the taxing State." BellasHess, 386 U. S., at 757. The furthest extension of that powerwas recognized in Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207(1960), in which the Court upheld a use tax despite the factthat all of the seller's in-state solicitation was performed byindependent contractors. These cases all involved somesort of physical presence within the State, and in Bellas Hess3 Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62 (1939).4 Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 359 (1941).504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT307Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthe Court suggested that such presence was not only suffi-cient for jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but alsonecessary. We expressly declined to obliterate the "sharpdistinction . . . between mail-order sellers with retail outlets,solicitors, or property within a State, and those who do nomore than communicate with customers in the State by mailor common carrier as a part of a general interstate business."386 U. S., at 758.Our due process jurisprudence has evolved substantiallyin the 25 years sinceBellas Hess, particularly in the area ofjudicial jurisdiction. Building on the seminal case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), wehave framed the relevant inquiry as whether a defendant hadminimum contacts with the jurisdiction "such that the main-tenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fairplay and substantial justice.' " Id., at 316 (quoting Millikenv.Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940)). In that spirit, we haveabandoned more formalistic tests that focused on a defendant's "presence" within a State in favor of a more flexibleinquiry into whether a defendant's contacts with the forummade it reasonable, in the context of our federal system ofGovernment, to require it to defend the suit in that State.In Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 212 (1977), the Courtextended the flexible approach thatInternational Shoe hadprescribed for purposes of in personam jurisdiction to inrem jurisdiction, concluding that "all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny."Applying these principles, we have held that if a foreigncorporation purposefully avails itself of the benefits of aneconomic market in the forum State, it may subject itself tothe State's in personam jurisdiction even if it has no physicalpresence in the State. As we explained inBurger KingCorp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462 (1985):"Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not beavoided merely because the defendant did not physi504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT308 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtcally enter the forum State. Although territorial pres-ence frequently will enhance a potential defendant'saffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonableforeseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact ofmodern commercial life that a substantial amount ofbusiness is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need forphysical presence within a State in which business isconducted. So long as a commercial actor's efforts are`purposefully directed' toward residents of anotherState, we have consistently rejected the notion thatan absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there." Id., at 476 (emphasis in original).Comparable reasoning justifies the imposition of the collec-tion duty on a mail-order house that is engaged in continuousand widespread solicitation of business within a State. Sucha corporation clearly has "fair warning that [its] activity maysubject [it] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign." Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S., at 218 (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment). In "modern commercial life" it matters littlethat such solicitation is accomplished by a deluge of catalogsrather than a phalanx of drummers: The requirements of dueprocess are met irrespective of a corporation's lack of physi-cal presence in the taxing State. Thus, to the extent thatour decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clauserequires physical presence in a State for the imposition ofduty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as su-perseded by developments in the law of due process.In this case, there is no question that Quill has purpose-fully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, thatthe magnitude of those contacts is more than sufficient fordue process purposes, and that the use tax is related to thebenefits Quill receives from access to the State. We there-fore agree with the North Dakota Supreme Court's conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not bar enforcementof that State's use tax against Quill.504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT309Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIVArticle I, $ 8, cl. 3, of the Constitution expressly authorizesCongress to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, andamong the several States." It says nothing about the pro-tection of interstate commerce in the absence of any actionby Congress. Nevertheless, as Justice Johnson suggestedin his concurring opinion inGibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,231-232, 239 (1824), the Commerce Clause is more than anaffirmative grant of power; it has a negative sweep as well.The Clause, in Justice Stone's phrasing, "by its own force"prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstatecommerce.South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barn-well Brothers, Inc., 303 U. S. 177, 185 (1938).Our interpretation of the "negative" or "dormant" Com-merce Clause has evolved substantially over the years,particularly as that Clause concerns limitations on state tax-ation powers. See generally P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation $$ 2:9-2:17 (1981). Ourearly cases, beginning withBrown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat.419 (1827), swept broadly, and in Leloup v. Port of Mobile,127 U. S. 640, 648 (1888), we declared that "no State has theright to lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form." Welater narrowed that rule and distinguished between directburdens on interstate commerce, which were prohibited, andindirect burdens, which generally were not. See, e. g., Sanford v. Poe, 69 F. 546 (CA6 1895), aff 'd sub nom. AdamsExpress Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 220 (1897).Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 256-258 (1938), and subsequent decisions rejected this formal,categorical analysis and adopted a "multiple-taxation doc-trine" that focused not on whether a tax was "direct" or "indirect" but rather on whether a tax subjected interstatecommerce to a risk of multiple taxation. However, inFree-man v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 256 (1946), we embraced againthe formal distinction between direct and indirect taxation,invalidating Indiana's imposition of a gross receipts tax on a504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT310 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtparticular transaction because that application would "impos[e] a direct tax on interstate sales." Most recently, inComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 285, werenounced the Freeman approach as "attaching constitutional significance to a semantic difference." We expresslyoverruled one of Freeman's progeny, Spector Motor Service,Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), which held that a taxon "the privilege of doing interstate business" was unconstitutional, while recognizing that a differently denominatedtax with the same economic effect would not be unconstitutional. Spector, as we observed in Railway ExpressAgency, Inc. v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434, 441 (1959), created asituation in which "magic words or labels" could "disable anotherwise constitutional levy." Complete Auto emphasizedthe importance of looking past "the formal language of thetax statute [to] its practical effect," 430 U. S., at 279, and setforth a four-part test that continues to govern the validityof state taxes under the Commerce Clause.5Bellas Hess was decided in 1967, in the middle of this latest rally between formalism and pragmatism. Contrary tothe suggestion of the North Dakota Supreme Court, this timing does not mean that Complete Auto rendered Bellas Hess"obsolete." Complete Auto rejected Freeman and Spector'sformal distinction between "direct" and "indirect" taxes oninterstate commerce because that formalism allowed the validity of statutes to hinge on "legal terminology," "draftsmanship and phraseology." 430 U. S., at 281. Bellas Hess5 Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share ofstate taxes." D. H. Holmes Co. v.

S. 609, 623-624 (1981)("It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engagedin interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden eventhough it increases the cost of doing business") (internal quotation marksand citation omitted).504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT311Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the Courtdid not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore didnot automatically fall withFreeman and its progeny.While contemporary Commerce Clause jurisprudencemight not dictate the same result were the issue to arisefor the first time today, Bellas Hess is not inconsistentwith Complete Auto and our recent cases. Under CompleteAuto's four-part test, we will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the "tax [1] is applied toan activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State,[2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate againstinterstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the servicesprovided by the State." 430 U. S., at 279. Bellas Hess concerns the first of these tests and stands for the propositionthat a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State areby mail or common carrier lacks the "substantial nexus" required by the Commerce Clause.Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down,we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed thecase at some length. In National Geographic Society v.California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 559 (1977),we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess' "sharpdistinction . . . between mail-order sellers with [a physicalpresence in the taxing] State and those . . . who do no morethan communicate with customers in the State by mail orcommon carrier as part of a general interstate business."We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval eversince. For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263(1989), we expressed "doubt that termination of an interstatetelephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexusfor a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess . . .(receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus)." See also D. H.Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981);Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437;National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559. For thesereasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court's conclu504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT312 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtsion that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the BellasHess rule.The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Autoand more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed bythe Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent andthat if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacksa physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfiesthe due process "minimum contacts" test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause "substantial nexus"test. We disagree. Despite the similarity in phrasing, thenexus requirements of the Due Process and CommerceClauses are not identical. The two standards are animatedby different constitutional concerns and policies.Due process centrally concerns the fundamental fairnessof governmental activity. Thus, at the most general level,the due process nexus analysis requires that we ask whetheran individual's connections with a State are substantialenough to legitimate the State's exercise of power over him.We have, therefore, often identified "notice" or "fair warning" as the analytic touchstone of due process nexus analysis.In contrast, the Commerce Clause and its nexus requirementare informed not so much by concerns about fairness for theindividual defendant as by structural concerns about the effects of state regulation on the national economy. Underthe Articles of Confederation, state taxes and duties hindered and suppressed interstate commerce; the Framers intended the Commerce Clause as a cure for these structuralills. See generally The Federalist Nos. 7, 11 (A. Hamilton).It is in this light that we have interpreted the negative implication of the Commerce Clause. Accordingly, we have ruledthat that Clause prohibits discrimination against interstatecommerce, see, e. g., Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S.617 (1978), and bars state regulations that unduly burdeninterstate commerce, see, e. g., Kassel v. ConsolidatedFreightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662 (1981).504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT313Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe Complete Auto analysis reflects these concerns aboutthe national economy. The second and third parts of thatanalysis, which require fair apportionment and non-discrimination, prohibit taxes that pass an unfair share of thetax burden onto interstate commerce. The first and fourthprongs, which require a substantial nexus and a relationshipbetween the tax and state-provided services, limit the reachof state taxing authority so as to ensure that state taxationdoes not unduly burden interstate commerce.6 Thus, the"substantial nexus" requirement is not, like due process'"minimum contacts" requirement, a proxy for notice, butrather a means for limiting state burdens on interstatecommerce. Accordingly, contrary to the State's suggestion, acorporation may have the "minimum contacts" with a taxingState as required by the Due Process Clause, and yet lackthe "substantial nexus" with that State as required by theCommerce Clause.76 North Dakota's use tax illustrates well how a state tax might undulyburden interstate commerce. On its face, North Dakota law imposes acollection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three timesin a single year. Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whoseradio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, anda corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State,all would be subject to the collection duty. What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation's 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions. See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.,386 U. S. 753, 759-760 (1967) (noting that the "many variations in rates oftax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keepingrequirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter ofcomplicated obligations") (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895,925-926 (1992).7 We have sometimes stated that the "Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well . . . due processrequirement[s]." Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 498 U. S.358, 373 (1991). Although such comments might suggest that every taxthat passes contemporary Commerce Clause analysis is also valid underthe Due Process Clause, it does not follow that the converse is as well504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT314 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the CourtThe State Supreme Court reviewed our recent CommerceClause decisions and concluded that those rulings signaleda "retreat from the formalistic constrictions of a stringentphysical presence test in favor of a more flexible substantiveapproach" and thus supported its decision not to apply BellasHess. 470 N. W. 2d, at 214 (citing Standard Pressed SteelCo. v. Department of Revenue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560 (1975),and Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept.of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987)). Although we agree withthe state court's assessment of the evolution of our cases, wedo not share its conclusion that this evolution indicates thatthe Commerce Clause ruling of Bellas Hess is no longergood law.First, as the state court itself noted, 470 N. W. 2d, at 214,all of these cases involved taxpayers who had a physicalpresence in the taxing State and therefore do not directlyconflict with the rule ofBellas Hess or compel that it beoverruled. Second, and more importantly, although ourCommerce Clause jurisprudence now favors more flexiblebalancing analyses, we have never intimated a desire to reject all established "bright-line" tests. Although we havenot, in our review of other types of taxes, articulated thesame physical-presence requirement that Bellas Hess estab-lished for sales and use taxes, that silence does not implyrepudiation of the Bellas Hess rule.Complete Auto, it is true, renounced Freeman and itsprogeny as "formalistic." But not all formalism is alike.Spector's formal distinction between taxes on the "privilegeof doing business" and all other taxes served no purposewithin our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, but stood "onlyas a trap for the unwary draftsman."Complete Auto, 430U. S., at 279. In contrast, the bright-line rule of Bellas Hessfurthers the ends of the dormant Commerce Clause. Unduetrue: A tax may be consistent with due process and yet unduly burdeninterstate commerce. See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT315Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)Opinion of the Courtburdens on interstate commerce may be avoided not only bya case-by-case evaluation of the actual burdens imposed byparticular regulations or taxes, but also, in some situations,by the demarcation of a discrete realm of commercial activitythat is free from interstate taxation. Bellas Hess followedthe latter approach and created a safe harbor for vendors"whose only connection with customers in the [taxing] Stateis by common carrier or the United States mail." UnderBellas Hess, such vendors are free from state-imposed dutiesto collect sales and use taxes.8Like other bright-line tests, the Bellas Hess rule appearsartificial at its edges: Whether or not a State may compel avendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the presencein the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office. Cf.National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S.207 (1960). This artificiality, however, is more than offsetby the benefits of a clear rule. Such a rule firmly estab-lishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to imposea duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigationconcerning those taxes. This benefit is important, for as wehave so frequently noted, our law in this area is somethingof a "quagmire" and the "application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for contro-versy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides tothe States in the exercise of their indispensable power of8 In addition to its common-carrier contacts with the State, Quill alsolicensed software to some of its North Dakota clients. See n. 1, supra.The State "concedes that the existence in North Dakota of a few floppydiskettes to which Quill holds title seems a slender thread upon which tobase nexus." Brief for Respondent 46. We agree. Although title to "afew floppy diskettes" present in a State might constitute some minimalnexus, in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization,430 U. S. 551, 556 (1977), we expressly rejected a " `slightest presence'standard of constitutional nexus." We therefore conclude that Quill's licensing of software in this case does not meet the "substantial nexus"requirement of the Commerce Clause.504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT316 QUILL CORP. v.

S. 450, 457-458 (1959).Moreover, a bright-line rule in the area of sales and usetaxes also encourages settled expectations and, in doing so,fosters investment by businesses and individuals.9 Indeed,it is not unlikely that the mail-order industry's dramaticgrowth over the last quarter century is due in part to thebright-line exemption from state taxation created inBellasHess.Notwithstanding the benefits of bright-line tests, we have,in some situations, decided to replace such tests with morecontextual balancing inquiries. For example, in ArkansasElectric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n,461 U. S. 375 (1983), we reconsidered a bright-line test setforth inPublic Util. Comm'n of R. I. v. Attleboro Steam &Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83 (1927). Attleboro distinguished between state regulation of wholesale sales of electricity, whichwas constitutional as an "indirect" regulation of interstatecommerce, and state regulation of retail sales of electricity,which was unconstitutional as a "direct regulation" of commerce. In Arkansas Electric, we considered whether to9 It is worth noting that Congress has, at least on one occasion, followeda similar approach in its regulation of state taxation. In response to thisCourt's indication in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 452 (1959), that, so long as the taxpayer has anadequate nexus with the taxing State, "net income from the interstateoperations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation,"Congress enacted Pub. L. 86-272, codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 381. That statute provides that a State may not impose a net income tax on any personif that person's "only business activities within such State [involve] thesolicitation of orders [approved] outside the State [and] filled . . . outsidethe State." Ibid. As we noted in Heublein, Inc. v. South Carolina TaxComm'n, 409 U. S. 275, 280 (1972), in enacting $ 381, "Congress attemptedto allay the apprehension of businessmen that `mere solicitation' wouldsubject them to state taxation. . . . Section 381 was designed to defineclearly a lower limit for the exercise of [the State's power to tax]. Claritythat would remove uncertainty was Congress' primary goal."

We first observed that "theprinciple ofstare decisis counsels us, here as elsewhere, notlightly to set aside specific guidance of the sort we find inAttleboro." Id., at 391. In deciding to reject the Attleboroanalysis, we were influenced by the fact that the "mechanicaltest" was "anachronistic," that the Court had rarely reliedon the test, and that we could "see no strong reliance interests" that would be upset by the rejection of that test. 461U. S., at 391-392. None of those factors obtains in this case.First, the Attleboro rule was "anachronistic" because it relied on formal distinctions between "direct" and "indirect"regulation (and on the regulatory counterparts of our Freeman line of cases); as discussed above, Bellas Hess turnedon a different logic and thus remained sound after the Courtrepudiated an analogous distinction in Complete Auto. Second, unlike the Attleboro rule, we have, in our decisions, frequently relied on the Bellas Hess rule in the last 25 years,see supra, at 311, and we have never intimated in our reviewof sales or use taxes that Bellas Hess was unsound. Finally,again unlike the Attleboro rule, the Bellas Hess rule has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of thebasic framework of a sizable industry. The "interest in stability and orderly development of the law" that undergirdsthe doctrine of stare decisis, see Runyon v. McCrary, 427U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring), thereforecounsels adherence to settled precedent.In sum, although in our cases subsequent to Bellas Hessand concerning other types of taxes we have not adopted asimilar bright-line, physical-presence requirement, our reasoning in those cases does not compel that we now reject therule that Bellas Hess established in the area of sales and usetaxes. To the contrary, the continuing value of a bright-linerule in this area and the doctrine and principles of stare decisis indicate that the Bellas Hess rule remains good law. For504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT318 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTAOpinion of the Courtthese reasons, we disagree with the North Dakota SupremeCourt's conclusion that the time has come to renounce thebright-line test of Bellas Hess.This aspect of our decision is made easier by the fact thatthe underlying issue is not only one that Congress may bebetter qualified to resolve,10 but also one that Congress hasthe ultimate power to resolve. No matter how we evaluatethe burdens that use taxes impose on interstate commerce,Congress remains free to disagree with our conclusions.SeePrudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408(1946). Indeed, in recent years Congress has consideredlegislation that would "overrule" the Bellas Hess rule.11 Itsdecision not to take action in this direction may, of course,have been dictated by respect for our holding in Bellas Hessthat the Due Process Clause prohibits States from imposingsuch taxes, but today we have put that problem to rest. Ac-cordingly, Congress is now free to decide whether, when, andto what extent the States may burden interstate mail-orderconcerns with a duty to collect use taxes.Indeed, even if we were convinced that Bellas Hess wasinconsistent with our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "thisvery fact [might] giv[e us] pause and counse[l] withholdingour hand, at least for now. Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even unde-sirable burdens." Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,453 U. S., at 637 (White, J., concurring). In this situation, it10 Many States have enacted use taxes. See App. 3 to Brief for DirectMarketing Association as Amicus Curiae. An overruling of Bellas Hessmight raise thorny questions concerning the retroactive application ofthose taxes and might trigger substantial unanticipated liability for mailorder houses. The precise allocation of such burdens is better resolvedby Congress rather than this Court.11 See, e. g., H. R. 2230, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); S. 480, 101st Cong.,1st Sess.
