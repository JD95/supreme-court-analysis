Jefferson County, Alabama, imposes an occupational tax onpersons working within the county who are not otherwiserequired to pay a license fee under state law. The controversy before us stems from proceedings the county commenced to collect the tax from two federal judges who holdcourt in the county. Preliminarily, the parties disputewhether, as the federal judges assert, the collection proceedings may be removed to, and adjudicated in, federal court.On the merits, the judges maintain that they are shieldedfrom payment of the tax by the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, while the county urges that the doctrinedoes not apply unless the tax discriminates against an officeholder because of the source of his pay or compensation.We hold that the case was properly removed under thefederal officer removal statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3), andthat the Tax Injunction Act, $ 1341, does not bar federalcourt adjudication. We further conclude that JeffersonCounty's tax operates as a nondiscriminatory tax on thejudges' compensation, to which the Public Salary Tax Act of1939, 4 U. S. C. $ 111, consents.*Charles DuBose Cole filed a brief for Seven United States DistrictJudges of the Northern District of Alabama as amici curiae urgingaffirmance.#For the reasons stated in the opinion of Justice Scalia, The ChiefJustice, Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas do notbelieve this case was properly removed from state court.

Alabama,the parties to this litigation agree, has not authorized itscounties to levy an income tax. See Jefferson County v.Acker, 850 F. Supp. 1536, 1537-1538, n. 2 (ND Ala. 1994);McPheeter v.

Clemon areUnited States District Judges for the Northern Districtof Alabama. Both maintain their principal office in Jef-ferson County, and both resist payment of the county's"license or privilege tax" on the ground that it violatesthe intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The countyinstituted a collection suit in Alabama small claims courtagainst each of the judges, which each removed to the Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute,28 U. S. C. $ 1442 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). After denyingthe county's motions to remand, the federal court consoli-dated the cases, and eventually granted summary judgmentfor respondents; the court held Jefferson County's tax un-constitutional under the intergovernmental tax immunitydoctrine to the extent that the tax reached the compensationof federal judges. See Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at1537, 1545-1546.22 The District Court also held that applying the tax to the judgesdiminished their pay and therefore violated the Compensation Clauseof Article III of the Constitution. See Jefferson County v. Acker, 850F. Supp., at 1548; U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1 (federal judges "shall . . . receivefor their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished duringtheir Continuance in Office"). The Court of Appeals declined to addressthat question, and it is not before this Court.

Acker, 92 F. 3d 1561, 1576 (1996).We granted Jefferson County's initial petition for certiorariand remanded the case for further consideration of the ques-tion whether the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.

Weagain granted certiorari to consider both the threshold TaxInjunction Act issue and the merits of the case. 525 U. S.1039-1040 (1998). We take up as well an anterior questionraised by the Solicitor General: Was removal from statecourt to federal court unauthorized by the federal officerremoval statute? IIThe federal officer removal provision at issue states:"(a) A civil action or criminal prosecution commencedin a State court against any of the following may beremoved by them to the district court of the UnitedStates for the district and division embracing the placewherein it is pending:. . . . ."(3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, forany act under color of office or in the performance of hisduties." 28 U. S. C. $ 1442 (1994 ed. and Supp. III).3It is the general rule that an action may be removed fromstate court to federal court only if a federal district courtwould have original jurisdiction over the claim in suit. See28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a). To remove a case as one falling within3 Other subsections of $ 1442 establish similar removal rights for otherfederal officers. See 28 U. S. C. $$ 1442(a), (b) (1994 ed. and Supp. III).527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN431Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the Courtfederal-question jurisdiction, the federal question ordinarilymust appear on the face of a properly pleaded complaint; ananticipated or actual federal defense generally does not qualify a case for removal. See Louisville & Nashville R. Co.v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908). Suits against federalofficers are exceptional in this regard. Under the federalofficer removal statute, suits against federal officers may beremoved despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint; thefederal-question element is met if the defense depends onfederal law.To qualify for removal, an officer of the federal courts mustboth raise a colorable federal defense, see Mesa v. California, 489 U. S. 121, 139 (1989), and establish that the suit is"for a[n] act under color of office," 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). To satisfy the latter requirement, the officermust show a nexus, a " `causal connection' between thecharged conduct and asserted official authority." Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 409 (1969) (quoting Marylandv. Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9, 33 (1926)).In construing the colorable federal defense requirement,we have rejected a "narrow, grudging interpretation" of thestatute, recognizing that "one of the most important reasonsfor removal is to have the validity of the defense of officialimmunity tried in a federal court." 395 U. S., at 407. Wetherefore do not require the officer virtually to "win his casebefore he can have it removed." Ibid. Here, the judgesargued, and the Eleventh Circuit held, that Jefferson County's tax falls on "the performance of federal judicial dutiesin Jefferson County" and "risk[s] interfering with the operation of the federal judiciary" in violation of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine; that argument, although weultimately reject it, see infra, at 435-443, presents a colorable federal defense. Jefferson County, 92 F. 3d, at 1572.There is no dispute on this point. See post, at 448 (Scalia,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN432 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKEROpinion of the CourtWe next consider whether the judges have shown that thecounty's tax collection suits are "for a[n] act under color ofoffice." 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a)(3) (emphasis added). The es-sence of the judges' colorable defense is that Jefferson County's Ordinance expressly declares it "unlawful" for them to"engage in [their] occupation" without paying the tax, Ordi-nance No. 1120, $ 2, and thus subjects them to an impermissible licensing scheme. The judges accordingly see JeffersonCounty's enforcement actions as suits "for" their having "engage[d] in [their] occupation." The Solicitor General, in con-trast, argues that there is no causal connection between thesuits and the judges' official acts because "[t]he tax . . . wasimposed only upon [the judges] personally and not upon theUnited States or upon any instrumentality of the UnitedStates." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. Tochoose between those readings of the Ordinance is to decidethe merits of this case. Just as requiring a "clearly sustainable defense" rather than a colorable defense would defeatthe purpose of the removal statute, Willingham, 395 U. S.,at 407, so would demanding an airtight case on the merits inorder to show the required causal connection. Accordingly,we credit the judges' theory of the case for purposes of bothelements of our jurisdictional inquiry and conclude that thejudges have made an adequate threshold showing that thesuit is "for a[n] act under color of office." 28 U. S. C.$ 1442(a)(3).Justice Scalia maintains that the county's lawsuit wasnot grandly "for" the judges' performance of their officialduties, but narrowly "for" their having refused to pay thetax. The judges' resistance to payment of the tax, he states,was neither required by the responsibilities of their officesnor undertaken in the course of job performance. See post,at 447. The county's lawsuit, however, was not simply "for"a refusal; it was "for" payment of a tax. The county asserted that the judges had failed to comply with the Ordinance; read literally, as the judges urge and as we accept527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN433Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the Courtsolely for purposes of this jurisdictional inquiry, that meas-ure required the judges to pay a license fee before "engag[ing] in [their] occupation." Ordinance No. 1120, $ 2. Thecircumstances that gave rise to the tax liability, not just thetaxpayers' refusal to pay, "constitute the basis" for the taxcollection lawsuits at issue. SeeWillingham, 395 U. S., at409 (" It is enough that [petitioners'] acts or [their] presenceat the place in performance of [their] official duty constitutethe basis . . . of the state prosecution." (internal quotationmarks omitted)). Here, those circumstances encompassholding court in the county and receiving income for thatactivity. In this light, we are satisfied that the judges haveshown the essential nexus between their activity "undercolor of office" and the county's demand, in the collectionsuits, for payment of the local tax.IIIThe Tax Injunction Act provides:"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or re-strain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax underState law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedymay be had in the courts of such State." 28 U. S. C.$ 1341.This statutory text "is to be enforced according to its terms"and should be interpreted to advance "its purpose" of "confin[ing] federal-court intervention in state government."Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., 520 U. S.821, 826-827 (1997). By its terms, the Act bars anticipatoryrelief, suits to stop ("enjoin, suspend or restrain") the collec-tion of taxes. Recognizing that there is "little practical difference" between an injunction and anticipatory relief in theform of a declaratory judgment, the Court has held that declaratory relief falls within the Act's compass. Californiav.Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 408 (1982). But asuit to collect a tax is surely not brought to restrain state527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN434 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKEROpinion of the Courtaction, and therefore does not fit the Act's description of suitsbarred from federal district court adjudication. See Louisiana Land & Exploration Co. v. Pilot Petroleum Corp., 900F. 2d 816, 818 (CA5 1990) ("The Tax Injunction Act doesnot bar federal court jurisdiction [of a] suit . . . to collect astate tax.").Nevertheless, in Keleher v. New England Telephone &Telegraph Co., 947 F. 2d 547 (CA2 1991), the Court ofAppeals concluded:"[I]n removing the federal courts' power to `enjoin,suspend or restrain' state and local taxes, [Congress]necessarily intended for federal courts to abstain fromhearing tax enforcement actions in which the validityof a state or local tax might reasonably be raised as adefense."Id., at 551.4We do not agree that the Act's purpose requires us to dis-regard the text formulation Congress adopted.Congress modeled the Tax Injunction Act, which passedin 1937, upon previously enacted federal "statutes of similarimport," measures that parallel state laws barring "actionsin State courts to enjoin the collection of State and countytaxes." S. Rep. No. 1035, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937).The federal statute Congress had in plain view was an 1867measure depriving courts of jurisdiction over suits brought"for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection"of any federal tax. Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 169, $ 10, 14 Stat.475, now codified at 26 U. S. C. $ 7421(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III).The 1867 provision, of course, does not bar federal-court ad4 The Second Circuit further stated that "[e]ven if Congress did not intend the Act's jurisdictional bar to reach so far, . . . we believe that generalprinciples of federal court abstention would nonetheless require us to stayour hand here." 947 F. 2d, at 551. Keleher was a diversity action raising" `difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantialpublic import.' " Ibid. (quoting Colorado River Water ConservationDist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 814 (1976)). See infra, at 435, n. 5.527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN435Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the Courtjudication of suits initiated by the United States to collectfederal taxes; it precludes only suits brought by taxpayersto restrain the United States from assessing or collectingsuch taxes. Similarly, the state laws to which Congress referred surely do not preclude the States from enforcing theirtaxes in court.The Tax Injunction Act was thus shaped by state and fed-eral provisions barring anticipatory actions by taxpayers tostop the tax collector from initiating collection proceedings.It was not the design of these provisions to prohibit taxpayers from defending suits brought by a government to obtaincollection of a tax. Congress, it appears, sought particularlyto stop out-of-state corporations from using diversity juris-diction to gain injunctive relief against a state tax in federalcourt, an advantage unavailable to in-state taxpayers deniedanticipatory relief under state law. See S. Rep. No. 1035,supra, at 2. In sum, we hold that the Tax Injunction Act,as indicated by its terms and purpose, does not bar collectionsuits, nor does it prevent taxpayers from urging defenses insuch suits that the tax for which collection is sought isinvalid.5 IVThe Eleventh Circuit held that Jefferson County's licensetax, as applied to federal judges, amounts to "a direct tax onthe federal government or its instrumentalities" in violationof the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.

S. 706, 719-721(1996) (in a case seeking damages, rather than equitable relief, a federalcourt may not abstain, but can stay the action pending resolution of thestate-law issue). No one has argued for the application of such doctrines here.527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN436 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKEROpinion of the CourtCounty, 92 F. 3d, at 1576. That ruling extends the doctrinebeyond the tight limits this Court has set and is inconsistentwith the controlling federal statute. The county's Ordi-nance lays no "demands directly on the Federal Government," United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, 735(1982); it is, and operates as, a tax on employees' compensation. The Public Salary Tax Act allows a State and itstaxing authorities to tax the pay federal employees receive"if the taxation does not discriminate against the [federal]employee because of the source of the pay or compensation."4 U. S. C. $ 111. We hold that Jefferson County's tax fallswithin that allowance.AUntil 1938, the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrinewas expansively applied to prohibit Federal and State Governments from taxing the salaries of another sovereign's em-ployees. See,e. g., Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie Cty.,16 Pet. 435, 450 (1842);Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124(1871). In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466,486-487 (1939), the Court expressly overruled prior decisions and held that a State's imposition of a tax on federalemployees' salaries "lays [no] unconstitutional burden upon[the Federal Government]." 6 Although taxes "upon the in-comes of employees of a government, state or national, . . .may be passed on economically to that government," theCourt reasoned, the federal design tolerates such "indirect[and] incidental" burdens. Id., at 487. Since Graves, we6 Graves carried out the doctrinal contraction presaged in Helvering v.Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 424 (1938), which held that the Federal Government could tax the salaries of employees of the Port of New York Authority. See also James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 138, 149,159-161 (1937) (in determining that a state "privilege ta[x]" on federalcontractors did not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine,the Court rejected the theory that a tax on income is a tax on its source(internal quotation marks omitted)).527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN437Cite as: 527 U.

Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803,811 (1989). In contracting the once expansive intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, we have recognized that thearea is one over which Congress is the principal superintendent. See New Mexico, 455 U. S., at 737-738.Indeed, congressional action coincided with theGravesturnaround. In the Public Salary Tax Act, under consider-ation beforeGraves was announced and enacted shortlythereafter, see Davis, 489 U. S., at 811-812, Congress consented to nondiscriminatory state and local taxation of fed-eral employees' "pay or compensation for personal service,"4 U. S. C. $ 111.8 Section 111 effectively "codified the resultinGraves," and thereby "foreclosed the possibility that subsequent judicial reconsideration . . . might reestablish thebroader interpretation of the immunity doctrine."Davis,489 U. S., at 812; see also id., at 813 (the immunity for which$ 111 provides is "coextensive with the prohibition againstdiscriminatory taxes embodied in the modern constitutionaldoctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity").7 New Mexico held that New Mexico transgressed no constitutional limitwhen it required federal contractors to pay the State's gross receipts taxfor the "privilege" of doing business with the Federal Government in theState. 455 U.

ACKEROpinion of the CourtIn Howard v. Commissioners of Sinking Fund of Louis-ville, 344 U. S. 624 (1953), the Court held that a "license fee"similar in relevant respects to Jefferson County's was an "in-come tax" for purposes of a federal statute that defines "income tax" as "any tax levied on, with respect to, or measuredby, net income, gross income, or gross receipts," 4 U. S. C.$ 110(c). See 344 U. S., at 625, n. 2, 629.9 The Court so con-cluded even though the local tax was styled as "a tax uponthe privilege of working within [the municipality]," was notan "income tax" under state law, and deviated from textbookincome tax characteristics. Id., at 628-629; see also id., at629 (Douglas, J., dissenting) ("Many kinds of income are excluded, e. g., dividends, interest, capital gains. The exclu-sions emphasize that the tax is on theprivilege of workingor doing business in [the municipality].").109 Howard construed the Buck Act, which authorizes state and local governments to collect "income tax[es]" from individuals who work in a "Federal area" "to the same extent . . . as though such area was not a Federalarea." 4 U. S. C. $ 106(a). The Buck Act defines "Federal area" to mean"any lands or premises held or acquired by or for the use of the UnitedStates." $ 110(e). The United States submits that "[t]his definition appears, by its terms, to encompass premises used by the United States forthe purposes of operating a federal courthouse," but further notes thatthe "origin and purpose of the Buck Act . . . were . . . limited . . . toensur[ing] that federal officers and employees who reside or work withinexclusive federal enclaves would be treated equally with those who resideand work outside such areas." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae28, n. 8 (citing S. Rep. No. 1625, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 3 (1940)). As weconclude that the Public Salary Tax Act consents to Jefferson County'stax, we need not decide whether the Buck Act applies to this case.10 Justice Breyer both recapitulates the reasoning of Justice Douglas'dissenting opinion in Howard and endeavors to distinguish the Court'sdecision in that case as involving "only [a] jurisdictional issue."

S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the CourtAs Howard indicates, whether Jefferson County's licensetax fits within the Public Salary Tax Act's allowance is aquestion of federal law. The practical impact, not theState's name tag, determines the answer to that question.See also Detroit v. Murray Corp. of America, 355 U. S. 489,492 (1958) ("[I]n determining whether th[e] ta[x] violate[s]the Government's constitutional immunity we must lookthrough form and behind labels to substance."); cf.Ohio OilCo. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930) (compatibly with theFourteenth Amendment, a State "may impose different spe-cific taxes upon different trades and professions"; "[i]n levying such taxes, the State is not required to resort to closedistinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformitywith reference to composition, use or value"). This much isbeyond genuine debate.BThe judges acknowledge that Jefferson County's Ordi-nance is valid if it "impose[s] a true tax on . . . income," butargue that the Ordinance ranks instead as an impermissiblelicensing scheme. Brief for Respondents 13-14, 27-33.Two aspects of the Ordinance, they say, remove the tax fromthe Public Salary Tax Act shelter for "taxation of pay orcompensation for personal service," 4 U. S. C. $ 111, and ren-der the tax unconstitutional. First, the judges urge, thevery words of the Ordinance make it unlawful for them andothers to engage in their occupations without paying the license fee. Second, they maintain, the complete exclusion ofpersons who hold other Alabama licenses, however low thefee in comparison to Jefferson County's tax, is inconsistentwith a true tax on income, but entirely consistent with aregulatory scheme requiring persons to have one and onlyone occupational license in a State. We are not persuaded.Jefferson County's Ordinance declares it "unlawful . . . toengage in" a covered occupation (as pertinent here, to carryout the duties of a federal judge) without paying the licensefee. Ordinance No. 1120, $ 2. Based on the quoted words,527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN440 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKEROpinion of the Courtthe respondent judges urge, as the Eleventh Circuit ruled,that the Ordinance is invalid under Johnson v. Maryland,254 U. S. 51, 57 (1920), which held that a State could notrequire a federal postal employee to obtain a state driver'slicense before performing his federal duties. See JeffersonCounty, 92 F. 3d, at 1572-1573. In reading the Ordinanceto impose a license requirement resembling the driver's license at issue in Johnson, the judges stress the Ordinance'sincautious "unlawful . . . to engage in" language. Thosewords, however, likely were written with nonfederal employees, the vast majority of the occupational taxpayers, in frontview. As earlier observed, see supra, at 439, the actual operation of the Ordinance, i. e., its practical impact, is critical.See Murray Corp., 355 U. S., at 492.In practice, Jefferson County's license tax serves arevenue-raising, not a regulatory, purpose. JeffersonCounty neither issues licenses to taxpayers, nor in any wayregulates them in the performance of their duties based ontheir status as licensed taxpayers. Cf. Johnson, 254 U.

S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the Courtduties of a federal office without local permission, and in factdoes not endeavor to do so.11We consider next the judges' argument that the wholesaleexemption for those who hold another state or county licensereveals the Ordinance's true character as a licensing scheme,not an income tax. If the tax were genuinely an incometax, they urge, those license holders would not be excluded,although they might be allowed to claim their other licensefees as credits or deductions against the county tax. Alabama's enabling Act does not allow its counties to so provide;those otherwise subject to license or privilege taxes under11 The shortcomings Justice Breyer identifies in his first three objections, post, at 449-452, are of a sort this Court routinely rejects as causefor federal curtailment of the taxing power of state and local governments.See Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930). His fourth objection, post, at 452-453, speaks of burdens Jefferson County imposes directlyon the Federal Government--obligations to withhold the tax, to makecomplicated calculations, to keep detailed records. Justice Breyeroverlooks that it is the actual operation of the Ordinance--what is and notwhat might be--that counts in determining the merits of this case. SeeDetroit v. Murray Corp. of America, 355 U. S. 489, 492 (1958).As a matter of undisputed fact, the burdens Justice Breyer posits arehypothetical, not real. As the parties stipulated, "[a]ll active judges ofthe Northern District of Alabama except [respondents] have paid theCounty Occupational Tax on differing percentages of their judicial salaries," but "neither the Administrative Office of the United States Courtsnor any Article III judge in the Northern District of Alabama . . . hasever made an oath certifying the alleged amounts of a federal judge's salary earned within and without Jefferson County," and "[t]he Administrative Office . . . has never withheld County Occupational Tax from anyfederal judge or court employee." Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at1549; see also 5 U. S. C. $ 5520(a) (authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into tax withholding agreements with local taxing authorities). Should Jefferson County someday exceed constitutional limits inits enforcement endeavors, a federal court would no doubt conserve whatis constitutional, in line with the severability clauses contained in the statelaw and county Ordinance. See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 8; Jefferson CountyOrdinance No. 1120, $ 13 (1987).527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 JEFFERSON COUNTY v. ACKEROpinion of the CourtAlabama's laws may not be reached by a county's occupa-tional tax. See 1967 Ala. Acts 406, $ 4.12 The dispositivemeasure, however, is the Public Salary Tax Act, which doesnot require the local tax to be a typical "income tax." Justas the statute in Howard consented broadly to "any taxmeasured by net income, gross income, or gross receipts,"344 U. S., at 629, the Public Salary Tax Act consents to anytax on "pay or compensation," which Jefferson County'ssurely is. The sole caveat is that the tax "not dis-criminate . . . because of the [federal] source of the pay orcompensation," 4 U. S. C. $ 111, and we next consider thatmatter.13CIn Davis, the Court held that a state tax exempting retire-ment benefits paid by the State but not those paid by theFederal Government violated the Public Salary Tax Act'snondiscrimination requirement. See 489 U. S., at 817-818.Jefferson County's tax, by contrast, does not discriminate12 Justice Breyer observes that these exemptions are various, numerous, and large. See post, at 451-452, 458-464. In this regard, we notethe representation of counsel for Jefferson County at oral argument that"92 percent of the people who earn wages in [the] county pay [the] tax."Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. Counsel further stated that federal employees are atleast proportionately represented among the eight percent exempt fromthe county's tax because they pay license fees to the State of Alabama.These figures are not in the record, counsel explained, "because this issuewas never raised until we got to this Court." Ibid.; see also id., at 14-15(counsel for Jefferson County represented that of 12,000 federal employeesin the county, 1,209 pay state license taxes and do not pay the county'soccupational tax).13 The District Court ruled that the judges had failed to establish thatthe county's tax discriminates against federal officers or employees because of the source of their pay or compensation. See Jefferson County,850 F. Supp., at 1539-1540. On appeal there was no contention that thisdetermination was erroneous. See Jefferson County, 92 F. 3d, at 1566,n. 9. The judges nevertheless press the argument that the tax is discriminatory as an alternative ground for affirmance. See Brief for Respondents 34-37.527US1 Unit: $U81 [05-02-01 19:09:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 527 U. S. 423 (1999)Opinion of the Courtagainst federal judges in particular, or federal officeholdersin general, based on the federal source of their pay or compensation. The tax is paid by all State District and CircuitCourt judges in Jefferson County and the three State Supreme Court justices who have satellite offices in the county.See Jefferson County, 850 F. Supp., at 1549.The judges urge that, as federal judges can never fit withinthe county's exemption for those who hold licenses underother state or county laws, that exemption unlawfully disfavors them. See Brief for Respondents 14-15. The recordshows no discrimination, however, between similarly situated federal and state employees. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at814 ("It is undisputed that Michigan's tax system discriminates in favor of retired state employees and against retiredfederal employees."). Should Alabama or Jefferson Countyauthorities take to exempting state officials while leavingfederal officials (or a subcategory of them) subject to the tax,that would indeed present a starkly different case. Here,however, there is no sound reason to deny Alabama countiesthe right to tax with an even hand the compensation of federal, state, and local officeholders whose services are rendered within the county. See United States v. County ofFresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462 (1977) (upholding requirement thatemployees of U. S. Forest Service pay California propertytax on homes located on federal land and provided to employees as part of their compensation; Court observed that statetax does not discriminate unconstitutionally against federalemployees if the tax is "imposed equally on . . . similarlysituated constituents of the State").* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
