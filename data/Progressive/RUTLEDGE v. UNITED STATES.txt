A jury found petitioner guilty of participating in a conspir-acy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 84 Stat.1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 846, and of conducting a con-tinuing criminal enterprise (CCE) in violation of $ 848. The"in concert" element of his CCE offense was based on thesame agreement as the $ 846 conspiracy. The question presented is whether it was therefore improper for the DistrictCourt to sentence him to concurrent life sentences on thetwo counts. IPetitioner organized and supervised a criminal enterprisethat distributed cocaine in Warren County, Illinois, from 1988until December 1990, when he was arrested by federalagents. He was charged with several offenses, of which onlyCount One, the CCE charge, and Count Two, the conspiracycharge, are relevant to the issue before us.Count One alleged that during the period between early1988 and late 1990, petitioner violated $ 8481 by engaging in1 Section 848(c) provides:"(c) `Continuing criminal enterprise' defined"For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person is engaged in acontinuing criminal enterprise if--517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT295Cite as: 517 U.

App. 2-3.Count Two separately alleged that during the same period,petitioner violated 21 U. S.

The count alleged that each of the conspirators had furthered the conspiracy by performing an overt actinvolving the delivery, purchase, or distribution of cocaine.App. 3-5.After a 9-day trial, a jury found petitioner guilty on allcounts. The trial court entered judgment of conviction onboth Count One and Count Two and imposed a sentence oflife imprisonment without possible release on each count, thesentences to be served concurrently. Id., at 8-10. Pursuant to 18 U. S.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtOn appeal, petitioner contended in a pro se supplementalbrief that even though the life sentences were concurrent,entering both convictions and sentences impermissibly punished him twice for the same offense. The Court of Appealsfor the Seventh Circuit accepted the premise of his argument, namely, that the conspiracy charge was a lesser included offense of the CCE charge. 40 F. 3d 879, 886 (1994).The Court of Appeals nonetheless affirmed his convictionsand sentences. Relying on its earlier decision in UnitedStates v. Bond, 847 F. 2d 1233, 1238 (1988), and our decisionin Jeffers v. United States, 432 U. S. 137 (1977), it held thatconvictions and concurrent sentences may be imposed forconspiracy and CCE, "provided the cumulative punishmentdoes not exceed the maximum under the CCE act." 40F. 3d, at 886.The decision of the Seventh Circuit is at odds with thepractice of other Circuits. Most federal courts that haveconfronted the question hold that only one judgment shouldbe entered when a defendant is found guilty on both a CCEcount and a conspiracy count based on the same agreements.4The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an intermediateposition, allowing judgment to be entered on both counts butpermitting only one sentence rather than the concurrent sen4 See, e. g., United States v.

In ac-cord with principles rooted in common law and constitutionaljurisprudence, see Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 168-170(1874), we presume that "where two statutory provisionsproscribe the `same offense,' " a legislature does not intend toimpose two punishments for that offense.Whalen v. UnitedStates, 445 U. S. 684, 691-692 (1980); Ball v. United States,470 U.

S. 299, 304 (1932). If "the same act or transactionconstitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are twooffenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proofof a fact which the other does not."Ibid. In subsequentapplications of the test, we have often concluded that twodifferent statutes define the "same offense," typically be-cause one is a lesser included offense of the other.65 United States v. Aiello, 771 F. 2d 621, 634 (CA2 1985); United Statesv. Fernandez, 916 F. 2d 125, 128-129 (CA3 1990), cert. denied, 500 U. S.948 (1991).6 See, e. g., Ball v. United States, 470 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn this case it is perfectly clear that the CCE offense re-quires proof of a number of elements that need not be established in a conspiracy case.7 The Blockburger test requiresus to consider whether the converse is also true--whetherthe $ 846 conspiracy offense requires proof of any elementthat is not a part of the CCE offense. That question couldbe answered affirmatively only by assuming that while the$ 846 conspiracy requires proof of an actual agreementamong the parties, the "in concert" element of the CCE offense might be satisfied by something less.The Government advanced this precise argument inJeffers v. United States, 432 U. S. 137 (1977),8 but it managed topersuade only one Justice.Id., at 158 (White, J., concurring). The position was rejected, to varying degrees, by thev. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), to confirm state-court conclusionthat offense of "joyriding" was a lesser included offense of auto theft).7 The defendant must, for example, commit a series of substantive violations, be a leader of the criminal enterprise, and derive substantial incomefrom it. The Government need not prove any of those elements to establish a conspiracy in violation of $ 846. Even the "in concert" element ofthe CCE offense is broader than any requirement in $ 846 because it requires at least five participants, while a conspiracy requires only two.8 In Jeffers, we considered whether the Government could prosecute thedefendant under $ 848 even though he had previously been convicted of$ 846 conspiracy on the basis of the same agreements. The Governmentargued that the multiple prosecution was permissible because the crimeswere not the "same offense." "The Government's position is premised onits contention that agreement is not an essential element of the $ 848 offense, despite the presence in $ 848(b)(2)(A) of the phrase `in concert with.'If five `innocent dupes' each separately acted `in concert with' the ringleader of the continuing criminal enterprise, the Government asserts, thestatutory requirement would be satisfied.

As Justice Blackmun pointed out, however, thelanguage of $ 1955 was significantly different from $ 848 in that it omittedthe words "in concert" and left open "the possibility that the five persons`involved' in the gambling operation might not be acting together." 432U.

The four dissenters adopted, without comment,the proposition that conspiracy was a lesser included offenseof CCE. See id., at 158, 159, n. 5. The remaining Justicesjoined Justice Blackmun's plurality opinion which, while declining to hold that conspiracy was a lesser included offense,9nonetheless explained why the Government's argument wasinconsistent with the statute's text, with the way the words"in concert" have been used in other statutes, and with thelegislative history of this statute.10 Based on its under-standing of the "more likely" interpretation of $ 848, the plurality assumed, arguendo, "that $ 848 does require proof of9 The plurality did not need to hold that conspiracy was a lesser includedoffense because it found that even if it was, the petitioner waived whateverright he may have had to object to the second prosecution under $ 848when he opposed the Government's motion, brought before the first trial,to consolidate the proceedings. Id., at 149-150, 153-154.10 The language of $ 848 "restricts the definition of the crime to a continuing series of violations undertaken by the accused `in concert with fiveor more other persons.' " Id., at 148. As a result, "a conviction [under$ 848] would be impossible unless concerted activity were present. . . .Even if $ 848 were read to require individual agreements between theleader . . . and each of the other five necessary participants, enough wouldbe shown to prove a conspiracy." Ibid.Furthermore, "[w]hen the phrase `in concert' has been used in otherstatutes, it has generally connoted cooperative action and agreement. . . .This suggests that Congress intended the same words to have the samemeaning in $ 848. . . . Since the word `concert' commonly signifies agreement of two or more persons in a common plan or enterprise, a clearlyarticulated statement from Congress to the contrary would be necessarybefore that meaning should be abandoned." Id., at 149, n. 14 (citationsomitted); see 3 Oxford English Dictionary 658 (2d ed. 1989) (defining "concert" as "[a]greement of two or more persons or parties in a plan, design,or enterprise; union formed by such mutual agreement"; "esp[ecially] inphrase in concert"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 470(1981) (defining "concert" as "agreement in a design or plan: union formedby mutual communication of opinions and views: accordance in a scheme").Thus, "[i]n the absence of any indication from the legislative history orelsewhere to the contrary, the far more likely explanation is that Congressintended the word `concert' to have its common meaning of agreement ina design or plan." Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 148-149.517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT300 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtan agreement among the persons involved in the continuingcriminal enterprise. So construed, $ 846 is a lesser includedoffense of $ 848, because $ 848 requires proof of every factnecessary to show a violation under $ 846 as well as proof ofseveral additional elements." Id., at 149-150.In the years since Jeffers was decided, the Courts of Ap-peals have also consistently rejected the Government's interpretation of the "in concert" language of $ 848; they haveconcluded, without exception, that conspiracy is a lesser included offense of CCE.11 We think it is appropriate now toresolve the point definitively: For the reasons set forth inJeffers, and particularly because the plain meaning of thephrase "in concert" signifies mutual agreement in a commonplan or enterprise, we hold that this element of the CCEoffense requires proof of a conspiracy that would also violate$ 846. Because $ 846 does not require proof of any fact thatis not also a part of the CCE offense, a straightforward appli-cation of theBlockburger test leads to the conclusion thatconspiracy as defined in $ 846 does not define a different of-fense from the CCE offense defined in $ 848. Furthermore,since the latter offense is the more serious of the two, andbecause only one of its elements is necessary to prove a $ 846conspiracy, it is appropriate to characterize $ 846 as a lesserincluded offense of $ 848.1211 See, e. g., Rivera-Martinez, 931 F. 2d, at 152 (CA1); Aiello, 771 F. 2d,at 633 (CA2); Neal, 27 F. 3d, at 1054 (CA5); United States v.

S. 292 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIIIThe Government contends that even if conspiracy is alesser included offense of CCE, the resulting presumptionagainst multiple punishments does not invalidate either ofpetitioner's convictions. The second conviction, the Government first argues, may not amount to a punishment at all.We begin by noting that 18 U. S. C. $ 3013 requires a federal district court to impose a $50 special assessment forevery conviction, and that such an assessment was imposedon both convictions in this case. As long as $ 3013 stands, asecond conviction will amount to a second punishment. Cf.Ray v. United States, 481 U. S. 736, 737 (1987) (per curiam)(presence of $50 assessment precludes application of "concurrent sentence doctrine"). The Government urges us not torely on the assessment, however, pointing out that petitionerdid not challenge it below, and noting that the question pre-sented "presupposes" fully concurrent sentences. Brief forUnited States 7, n. 1.If we ignore the assessment as the Government requests,the force of its argument would nonetheless be limited byour decision inBall v. United States, 470 U. S. 856 (1985).There, we concluded that Congress did not intend to allowpunishment for both illegally "receiving" and illegally "pos-sessing" a firearm.Id., at 861-864. In light of that conclu-sion, we held that "the only remedy consistent with the contative difference between conspiracy-like crimes and the substantive offenses upon which they are predicated. See, e. g., United States v. Felix,503 U. S. 378, 389-390 (1992) (allowing prosecution for conspiracy afterpetitioner was convicted of underlying substantive offense, and citing Garrett as a similar case). No such difference is present here. In contrastto the crimes involved in Garrett, this case involves two conspiracy-likeoffenses directed at largely identical conduct. Jeffers v. United States,432 U. S., at 157; Garrett, 471 U. S., at 794 ("[T]he plurality [in Jeffers]reasonably concluded that the dangers posed by a conspiracy and a CCEwere similar and thus there would be little purpose in cumulating thepenalties").517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT302 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtgressional intent is for the District Court . . . to exercise itsdiscretion to vacate one of the underlying convictions" aswell as the concurrent sentence based upon it. Id., at 864.We explained further:"The second conviction, whose concomitant sentenceis served concurrently, does not evaporate simply because of the concurrence of the sentence. The separateconviction, apart from the concurrent sentence, has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not beignored. For example, the presence of two convictionson the record may delay the defendant's eligibility forparole or result in an increased sentence under a recidi-vist statute for a future offense. Moreover, the secondconviction may be used to impeach the defendant's credi-bility and certainly carries the societal stigma accompanying any criminal conviction. See Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 790-791 (1969); Sibron v. New York,392 U. S. 40, 54-56 (1968). Thus, the second conviction,even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment." Id., at 864-865.Under Ball, the collateral consequences of a second conviction make it as presumptively impermissible to impose asit would be to impose any other unauthorized cumulativesentence.The Government suggests, however, that petitioner willnever be exposed to collateral consequences like those described in Ball because he is subject to multiple life sentences without possibility of release. We need not conclusively resolve the matter, for there is no doubt that thesecond conviction carried with it, at very least, a $50 assessment. Although petitioner did not challenge the assessmentbelow, 18 U. S. C. $ 3013 required the District Court to impose it, and the assessment was therefore as much a collateral consequence of the conspiracy conviction as the con517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 517 U. S. 292 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsequences recognized by Ball would be. As a result, theconviction amounts to cumulative punishment not authorizedby Congress. IVThe Government further argues that even if the secondconviction amounts to punishment, the presumption againstallowing multiple punishments for the same crime may beovercome if Congress clearly indicates that it intended toallow courts to impose them. Hunter, 459 U. S., at 366 (cit-ingWhalen, 445 U. S., at 691-692); Garrett v. United States,471 U. S. 773, 779 (1985) (allowing multiple punishment inlight of Congress' "plainly expressed" view). The Govern-ment submits that such clear intent can be found here.The Government finds support for its position in thisCourt's judgment in Jeffers because that judgment allowedconvictions under both $$ 846 and 848 to stand. Those con-victions, however, had been entered in separate trials andour review only addressed the conviction under $ 848. TheCourt affirmed that conviction not because anyone on theCourt suggested that Congress had intended to authorizedual convictions for the same offense,13 but rather becausethe four-Justice plurality decided that Jeffers had waived anyright to object to Jeffers' prosecution for that conviction, seeJeffers, 432 U. S., at 152-154, and because Justice White be-lieved that the two prosecutions were for different offenses.The sole ground for Justice White's critical fifth vote toaffirm the judgment was his belief, set forth in a single shortparagraph, that conspiracy was not a lesser included offense13 Indeed, the parties insisted that the case did not involve multiple punishment concerns, Jeffers, 432 U. S., at 154, and n. 23, and the Governmentdid not contend that Congress intended to authorize the imposition of dualpunishments. Because neither the Court nor the parties addressed theissue, Jeffers is a singularly unlikely source for a holding that Congressclearly authorized multiple convictions. Cf. United States v. L. A. TuckerTruck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952).517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT304 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof CCE. Id., at 158 (opinion concurring in judgment in partand dissenting in part). In Part II of this opinion we haverejected that view. Accordingly, even if we could infer thatthe plurality had silently reached the rather bizarre conclusion that Congress intended to allow dual convictions but topreclude other multiple punishments, only four Justiceswould have supported it, with four others explicitly disagree-ing. As to this issue, then, the judgment amounts at best tonothing more than an unexplained affirmance by an equallydivided court--a judgment not entitled to precedentialweight no matter what reasoning may have supported it.SeeNeil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 192 (1972). The more im-portant message conveyed byJeffers is found not in the barejudgment, but in the plurality's conclusion, joined by the fourdissenters, that CCE and conspiracy are insufficiently dis-tinct to justify a finding that Congress intended to allow punishments for both when they rest on the same activity.1414 The Government suggests that convictions are authorized for both$$ 846 and 848 because they are different sections of the United StatesCode. Brief for United States 16. This does not rise to the level of theclear statement necessary for us to conclude that despite the identity ofthe statutory elements, Congress intended to allow multiple punishments.After all, we concluded in Ball that the statutes at issue did not authorizeseparate convictions, and they were even more distant in the Code. See470 U. S., at 863-864 (discussing 18 U. S. C. $ 922(h) and 18 U. S. C. App.$ 1202(a) (1984)). If anything, the proximity of $$ 846 and 848 indicatesthat Congress understood them to be directed to similar, rather than separate, evils. Cf. Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 343 (1981).The Government further discerns congressional intent to allow multiplepunishment from "significant differences" between Ball and this case.Brief for United States 19-24. None of its arguments, however, demonstrates that Congress "specially authorized" convictions for both thegreater and lesser included offenses we address today. Whalen, 445 U. S.,at 693. The Government suggests, for example, that the statutes in Ballwere directed at virtually identical activity, while CCE and conspiracyare not. As we have already concluded, however, every proof of a CCEwill demonstrate a conspiracy based on the same facts. That overlap isenough to conclude, absent more, that Congress did not intend to allowpunishments for both.517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT305Cite as: 517 U. S. 292 (1996)Opinion of the CourtVFinally, the Government argues that Congress must haveintended to allow multiple convictions because doing sowould provide a "backup" conviction, preventing a defendantwho later successfully challenges his greater offense fromescaping punishment altogether--even if the basis for thereversal does not affect his conviction under the lesser.Brief for United States 20-22. We find the argument unper-suasive, for there is no reason why this pair of greater andlesser offenses should present any novel problem beyondthat posed by any other greater and lesser included offenses,for which the courts have already developed rules to avoidthe perceived danger.In Tinder v. United States, 345 U. S. 565, 570 (1953), thedefendant had been convicted of theft from a mailbox andimproperly sentenced to prison for more than one year eventhough the evidence only supported a misdemeanor conviction. Exercising our "power to do justice as the case re-quires" pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2106, we ordered the District Court to correct the sentence without vacating theunderlying conviction. Relying onTinder and the practicein "state courts, including courts governed by statutes virtually the same as Section 2106," the Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit later decided that its "power tomodify erroneous judgments authorizes reduction to a lesserincluded offense where the evidence is insufficient to supportan element of the [greater] offense stated in the verdict."Austin v. United States, 382 F. 2d 129, 140, 141-143 (1967).1515 The Court of Appeals used this same power in Allison v. UnitedStates, 409 F. 2d 445 (CADC 1969), but noted: "[T]he circumstances inwhich such authority may be exercised are limited. It must be clear (1)that the evidence adduced at trial fails to support one or more elementsof the crime of which appellant was convicted, (2) that such evidence sufficiently sustains all the elements of another offense, (3) that the latter is alesser included offense of the former, and (4) that no undue prejudice willresult to the accused." Id., at 450-451.517us1$39I 02-16-99 19:38:38 PAGES OPINPGT306 RUTLEDGE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtConsistent with the views expressed by the District of Co-lumbia Circuit, federal appellate courts appear to have uniformly concluded that they may direct the entry of judgmentfor a lesser included offense when a conviction for a greateroffense is reversed on grounds that affect only the greateroffense. See 8A J. Moore, Federal Practice || 31.03[5], andn. 54 (2d ed. 1995); United States v. Ward, 37 F. 3d 243, 251(CA6 1994) (after finding insufficient evidence to supportCCE count, Court of Appeals vacated CCE conviction andsentence and remanded for entry of conspiracy conviction,which District Court had previously vacated as lesser included offense of CCE), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1030 (1995);United States v. Silvers, 888 F. Supp. 1289, 1306-1309 (NDMd. 1995) (reinstating conspiracy conviction previously vacated after granting motion for new trial on CCE convic-tion). This Court has noted the use of such a practice withapproval. Morris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237, 246-247 (1986)(approving process of reducing erroneous greater offense tolesser included offense as long as the defendant is not ableto demonstrate that "but for the improper inclusion of the[erroneous] charge, the result of the proceeding probablywould have been different"). See also Jones v. Thomas, 491U. S. 376, 384-385, n. 3 (1989) (citingMorris).There is no need for us now to consider the precise limitson the appellate courts' power to substitute a conviction ona lesser offense for an erroneous conviction of a greater of-fense.16 We need only note that the concern motivating theGovernment in asking us to endorse either the Seventh Circuit's practice of entering concurrent sentences on CCE andconspiracy counts, or the Second Circuit's practice of enter16 Indeed, because of our holding today, problems like the one presentedin this case are unlikely to arise in the future. A jury is generally instructed not to return a verdict on a lesser included offense once it hasfound the defendant guilty of the greater offense. See, e. g., SeventhCircuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction 2.03, in 1 L. Sand, J. Siffert,W. Loughlin, & S.
