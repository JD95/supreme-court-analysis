Petitioner Lloyd E. Schlup, Jr., a Missouri prisoner currently under a sentence of death, filed a second federalhabeas corpus petition alleging that constitutional error deprived the jury of critical evidence that would have established his innocence. The District Court, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, declined to reach the merits ofthe petition, holding that petitioner could not satisfy thethreshold showing of "actual innocence" required by Sawyerv. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992). Under Sawyer, the petitioner must show "by clear and convincing evidence that, butfor a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would havefound the petitioner" guilty. Id., at 336. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted certiorari to consider whetherthe Sawyer standard provides adequate protection againstthe kind of miscarriage of justice that would result from theexecution of a person who is actually innocent.IOn February 3, 1984, on Walk 1 of the high security areaof the Missouri State Penitentiary, a black inmate named Arthur Dade was stabbed to death.

DELOOpinion of the CourtWalk 2, including petitioner, were charged in connection withDade's murder.At petitioner's trial in December 1985, the State's evidenceconsisted principally of the testimony of two corrections officers who had witnessed the killing. On the day of the mur-der, Sergeant Roger Flowers was on duty on Walk 1 andWalk 2, the two walks on the lower floor of the prison's highsecurity area. Flowers testified that he first released theinmates on Walk 2 for their noon meal and relocked theircells. After unlocking the cells to release the inmates onWalk 1, Flowers noticed an inmate named Rodnie Stewartmoving against the flow of traffic carrying a container ofsteaming liquid. Flowers watched as Stewart threw theliquid in Dade's face. According to Flowers, Schlup thenjumped on Dade's back, and Robert O'Neal joined in the at-tack. Flowers shouted for help, entered the walk, andgrabbed Stewart as the two other assailants fled.Officer John Maylee witnessed the attack from Walk 7,which is three levels and some 40-50 feet above Walks 1 and2.1 Maylee first noticed Schlup, Stewart, and O'Neal as theywere running from Walk 2 to Walk 1 against the flow of traf-fic. According to Maylee's testimony, Stewart threw a container of liquid at Dade's face, and then Schlup jumped onDade's back. O'Neal then stabbed Dade several times inthe chest, ran down the walk, and threw the weapon out awindow. Maylee did not see what happened to Schlup orStewart after the stabbing.The State produced no physical evidence connectingSchlup to the killing, and no witness other than Flowers andMaylee testified to Schlup's involvement in the murder.21 Maylee was unavailable to testify at Schlup's trial. Testimony fromMaylee's pretrial deposition was admitted in evidence and was read tothe jury.2 In contrast, the evidence of the involvement of Stewart and O'Neal inDade's murder was substantial. Stewart, for example, was apprehended513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the CourtSchlup's defense was that the State had the wrong man.3He relied heavily on a videotape from a camera in the prisoners' dining room. The tape showed that Schlup was the firstinmate to walk into the dining room for the noon meal, andthat he went through the line and got his food. Approxi-mately 65 seconds after Schlup's entrance, several guardsran out of the dining room in apparent response to a distresscall. Twenty-six seconds later, O'Neal ran into the diningroom, dripping blood.4 Shortly thereafter, Schlup andO'Neal were taken into custody.Schlup contended that the videotape, when considered inconjunction with testimony that he had walked at a normalpace from his cell to the dining room,5 demonstrated thathe could not have participated in the assault. Because thevideotape showed conclusively that Schlup was in the diningroom 65 seconds before the guards responded to the distresscall, a critical element of Schlup's defense was determin-ing when the distress call went out. Had the distress callsounded shortly after the murder, Schlup would not havehad time to get from the prison floor to the dining room, andby Flowers during the struggle itself. And when O'Neal was taken intocustody, his clothes were covered with blood and he was bleeding fromlacerations on his right hand.3 Schlup did not testify at the guilt phase of the trial. At the sentencinghearing, Schlup did testify and maintained his innocence of the offense.He continued to maintain his innocence even after the jury had sentencedhim to death.4 After stabbing Dade, O'Neal broke a window with his hand and threwthe knife out the window. That resulted in multiple lacerations to hisright hand. Before leaving the prison floor, O'Neal paused briefly at autilities sink on Walk 2 to try to wash off the blood, and then continuedon to the dining room.O'Neal was followed into the dining room by inmate Randy Jordan, whois identified in some affidavits attesting to petitioner's innocence as thethird participant in the crime. See infra, at 308-309. However, Jordan'sname was not mentioned at Schlup's trial.5 Schlup's cell was at the end of Walk 2, closest to the dining room.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT304 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the Courtthus he could not have participated in the murder. Con-versely, had there been a delay of several minutes betweenthe murder and the distress call, Schlup might have had suf-ficient time to participate in the murder and still get to thedining room over a minute before the distress call went out.6The prosecutor adduced evidence tending to establish thatsuch a delay had in fact occurred. First, Flowers testifiedthat none of the officers on the prison floor had radios, thusimplying that neither he nor any of the other officers on thefloor was able to radio for help when the stabbing occurred.Second, Flowers testified that after he shouted for help, ittook him "a couple [of] minutes" to subdue Stewart.7 Flowers then brought Stewart downstairs, encountered CaptainJames Eberle, and told Eberle that there had been a "disturbance." 8 Eberle testified that he went upstairs to theprison floor, and then radioed for assistance. Eberle estimated that the elapsed time from when he first saw Flowers6 A necessary element of Schlup's defense was that Flowers and Mayleewere mistaken in their identification of Schlup as one of the participantsin the murder. Schlup suggested that Flowers had taken a visitor toSchlup's cell just 30 minutes before the murder. Schlup argued thatFlowers had therefore had Schlup "on the brain," Trial Tr. 493-494, thusexplaining why, in the confusion surrounding the murder, Flowers mighthave mistakenly believed that he had seen Schlup.Schlup argued that Maylee's identification was suspect because Mayleewas three floors away from the murder and did not have an unobstructedview of the murder scene. Schlup further suggested that Maylee's identification of Schlup had been influenced by a postincident conversation between Maylee and another officer who had talked to Flowers.Schlup also argued that there were inconsistencies between the description of the murder provided by Flowers and that provided by Maylee.For example, Maylee testified that he saw Schlup, Stewart, and O'Nealrunning together against the flow of traffic, and that the three men hadstopped when they encountered Dade. See id., at 332. Flowers noticedonly Stewart running against the flow of traffic, and he testified thatO'Neal and Schlup were at the other end of the walk on the far side ofDade. See id., at 249.7 Id., at 243.8 Id., at 245.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT305Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the Courtuntil he radioed for help was "approximately a minute." 9The prosecution also offered testimony from a prison investigator who testified that he was able to run from the scene ofthe crime to the dining room in 33 seconds and to walk thedistance at a normal pace in a minute and 37 seconds.Neither the State nor Schlup was able to present evidenceestablishing the exact time of Schlup's release from his cellon Walk 2, the exact time of the assault on Walk 1, or theexact time of the radio distress call. Further, there was noevidence suggesting that Schlup had hurried to the diningroom.10After deliberating overnight, the jury returned a verdictof guilty. Following the penalty phase, at which the victimof one of Schlup's prior offenses testified extensively aboutthe sordid details of that offense,11 the jury sentenced Schlupto death. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed Schlup'sconviction and death sentence,State v. Schlup, 724 S. W. 2d236 (Mo. 1987), and this Court denied certiorari, Schlup v.Missouri, 482 U. S. 920 (1987).129 Id., at 212, 214-215.10 In fact, the evidence presented was to the contrary. Two inmates,Bernard Bailey and Arthur St. Peter, testified that they were behindSchlup in line on the way to the dining room and that they had all walkedat a normal pace. Lieutenant Robert Faherty, the corrections officer onduty in the corridor leading from the prison floor to the dining room, testified that Schlup was the first inmate into the corridor on the day of themurder. Faherty also testified that he saw Schlup pause and yell something out one of the windows in the corridor, and that he told Schlup tomove on. Faherty testified that nothing else unusual had occurred whileSchlup was in the corridor.On the other hand, both Maylee's testimony and the videotape establishthat O'Neal ran from Walk 1 to the dining room.11 Schlup had been convicted of sodomy and assault in connection witha series of attacks on a cellmate while he was being held in a county jail.12 The other alleged participants in the crime were convicted in earlier,separate trials. O'Neal, who did the stabbing, was sentenced to death,see State v. O'Neal, 718 S. W. 2d 498 (Mo. 1986); Stewart, who was apprehended by Flowers at the scene, was sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT306 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the CourtIIOn January 5, 1989, after exhausting his state collateralremedies,13 Schlup filed a pro se petition for a federal writ ofhabeas corpus, asserting the claim, among others, that histrial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview and tocall witnesses who could establish Schlup's innocence.14 TheDistrict Court concluded that Schlup's ineffectiveness claimwas procedurally barred, and it denied relief on that claimwithout conducting an evidentiary hearing.15 The Court ofAppeals affirmed, though it did not rely on the alleged proce-dural bar.Schlup v. Armontrout, 941 F. 2d 631 (CA8 1991).Instead, based on its own examination of the record, theCourt found that trial counsel's performance had not beenconstitutionally ineffective, both because counsel had reviewed statements that Schlup's potential witnesses hadgiven to prison investigators, and because the testimony ofthose witnesses "would be repetitive of the testimony to bepresented at trial."Id., at 639.16 But cf. 11 F. 3d 738, 746,without eligibility for probation or parole, see State v. Stewart, 714 S. W.2d 724 (Mo. App. 1986).13 The denial of Schlup's motion for postconviction relief was affirmed bythe Missouri Supreme Court on October 18, 1988. See Schlup v. State,758 S. W. 2d 715 (Mo. 1988).14 Schlup identified three nonparticipant witnesses who he claimed hadwitnessed the murder: Van Robinson, Lamont Griffin Bey, and RickyMcCoy. Schlup also faulted trial counsel for failing to interview RandyJordan, whom Schlup identified as the third participant in the murder.15 Schlup had presented the ineffectiveness claim in his state postconviction motion, but had failed to raise it on appeal. See Schlup v. Armontrout, No. 89-0020C(3), 1989 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 18285, *11-*13 (ED Mo.,May 31, 1989).Schlup's first federal habeas petition also raised several other claims, allof which were denied either as procedurally barred or on the merits.16 The Court of Appeals also addressed Schlup's other claims. OverJudge Heaney's dissent, the court rejected Schlup's claim that his counselhad been ineffective for failing to adduce available mitigating evidence atthe penalty hearing. Schlup v. Armontrout, 941 F. 2d, at 639. The court513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT307Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the Courtn. 3 (CA8 1993) (Heaney, J., dissenting) (challenging the conclusion that such testimony would have been "repetitive").The Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing andsuggestion for rehearing en banc, Schlup v. Armontrout, 945F. 2d 1062 (1991), and we denied a petition for certiorari, 503U. S. 909 (1992).On March 11, 1992, represented by new counsel, Schlupfiled a second federal habeas corpus petition. That petitionraised a number of claims, including that (1) Schlup was actually innocent of Dade's murder, and that his execution wouldtherefore violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993); (2) trial counselwas ineffective for failing to interview alibi witnesses; and(3) the State had failed to disclose critical exculpatory evidence. The petition was supported by numerous affidavitsfrom inmates attesting to Schlup's innocence.The State filed a response arguing that various proceduralbars precluded the District Court from reaching the meritsof Schlup's claims and that the claims were in any event meritless. Attached to the State's response were transcripts ofinmate interviews conducted by prison investigators just fivedays after the murder. One of the transcripts contained aninterview with John Green, an inmate who at the time wasthe clerk for the housing unit. In his interview, Greenstated that he had been in his office at the end of the walkswhen the murder occurred. Green stated that Flowers hadalso rejected Schlup's separate claim challenging the denial of his requestfor an evidentiary hearing in the District Court. Schlup had requestedsuch a hearing to develop evidence so that he could in turn challenge thefailure of the state court to grant his request for a continuance of his statepostconviction proceedings. Schlup had requested that continuance to obtain additional evidence to support his claim of innocence. The Court ofAppeals held that Schlup's challenge to the state court's failure to grant acontinuance was not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. Id.,at 642.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT308 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the Courttold him to call for help, and that Green had notified base ofthe disturbance shortly after it began.17Schlup immediately filed a traverse arguing that Green'saffidavit provided conclusive proof of Schlup's innocence.Schlup contended that Green's statement demonstrated thata call for help had gone out shortly after the incident. Because the videotape showed that Schlup was in the diningroom some 65 seconds before the guards received the distress call, Schlup argued that he could not have been involved in Dade's murder. Schlup emphasized that Green'sstatement was not likely to have been fabricated, because atthe time of Green's interview, neither he nor anyone elsewould have realized the significance of Green's call to base.Schlup tried to buttress his claim of innocence with affidavitsfrom inmates who stated that they had witnessed the eventand that Schlup had not been present.18 Two of those affi17 "BROOKS: John, whenever you saw Dade fall what did you do then?"GREEN: I stepped out of the office and I heard Sgt. Flowers calling forofficers cause they had had a fight. Couldn't get nobody so he told me tocall base to notify them of the fight and that's what I did."DEARIXON: That's all I have, John. Thank you very much." Response to Order To Show Cause Why a Writ of Habeas Corpus ShouldNot Be Granted, Exhibit T (Transcripts of Inmate Interviews), p. 31.If the total time required for Green to respond to Flowers' instructionand for the base to send out a distress call in response to Green's callamounted to a mere 15-17 seconds, O'Neal running at top speed wouldhave had 8-10 seconds to wash his hands and still would have been ableto arrive in the dining room some 26 seconds after the distress call.18 In the District Court, Schlup attempted to supplement the record withseveral detailed affidavits from inmates attesting to his innocence. Forexample, Lamont Griffin Bey, a black inmate, submitted an affidavit inwhich he stated: "The first thing I saw of the fight was Rodney [sic]Stewart throw liquid in Arthur Dade's face, and O'Neal stab him. . . . Iknew Lloyd Schlup at that time, but we were not friends. Lloyd Schlupwas not present at the scene of the fight." Affidavit of Lamont GriffinBey, pp. 2-3 (Apr. 7, 1993). Griffin Bey also stated: "When this happened,there was a lot of racial tension in the prison. . . . I would not stick myneck out to help a white person under these circumstances normally, but513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT309Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdavits suggested that Randy Jordan--who occupied the cellbetween O'Neal and Stewart in Walk 2, and who, as notedabove, see n. 4, supra, is shown on the videotape arriving atlunch with O'Neal--was the third assailant.On August 23, 1993, without holding a hearing, the DistrictCourt dismissed Schlup's second habeas petition and vacatedthe stay of execution that was then in effect. The DistrictCourt concluded that Schlup's various filings did not provideadequate cause for failing to raise his new claims morepromptly. Moreover, the court concluded that Schlup hadfailed to meet the Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992),standard for showing that a refusal to entertain those claimswould result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. In itsdiscussion of the evidence, the court made no separate comment on the significance of Green's statement.19On September 7, 1993, petitioner filed a motion to set asidethe order of dismissal, again calling the court's attention toI am willing to testify because I know Lloyd Schlup is innocent." Id.,at 4.Similarly, inmate Donnell White swore an affidavit in which he stated:"Three white guys were coming the opposite way. One of them had atumbler of something that he threw in [Dade's] face. One or two of theother ones started sticking [Dade] with an ice-pick-type knife." Affidavitof Donnell White, at 1 (Apr. 21, 1993). White further stated: "I have seenLloyd Schlup, and I know who he is. He is definitely not one of the guysI saw jump Arthur Dade . . . . I know that one of the three men involvedhas never been prosecuted, and I know that Lloyd Schlup is innocent. Ibarely know Lloyd Schlup, and I have no reason to lie for him. I told theinvestigators that I didn't see anything because I didn't want to get involved." Id., at 3.Though the District Court ultimately denied Schlup's motion to supplement the record, the inmate affidavits are part of the record on appeal.19 The District Court focused primarily on the "suspect" nature of affidavits that are produced after a long delay, cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.390, 423-424 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring), and that come from inmates. The court concluded that the affidavits presented by Schlup, whenconsidered against the positive identifications made by Flowers andMaylee, failed to constitute a sufficiently persuasive showing of actualinnocence.

Two days later, Schlup filed a supplemental motion stating that his counsel had located JohnGreen 20 and had obtained an affidavit from him. That affidavit confirmed Green's postincident statement that he hadcalled base shortly after the assault. Green's affidavit alsoidentified Jordan rather than Schlup as the third assailant.2120 Green had been released from prison on January 29, 1986. GreenAffidavit, at 4 (Sept. 7, 1993).21 Green's affidavit stated:"I looked down one walk, and I saw Randy Jordan holding Arthur Dade.Jordan was standing behind Dade, and had Dade's arms pinned to his sidesfrom behind. I saw Robert O'Neal stab Dade several times in the chestwhile Jordan was holding him."Dade broke loose and ran straight toward me. I saw him collide withRodnie Stewart and fall to the ground near the paint storage area. Sergeant Flowers hollered for help. I think there was so much noise that hedidn't think the other guards in the Housing Unit heard him, so he toldme to call base. He was on his way to break up the fight when he toldme to call base. I immediately went into the office, picked up the phone,and called base."A sergeant at the base picked up the phone. I told him there was afight in Housing Unit 5A. He said something like, `OK,' and I hung upthe phone." Id., at 2-3.Green stated that his call to base came "within seconds of Dade hittingthe ground. It could not have been more than a half minute or a minuteafter he was stabbed by Jordan and O'Neal. It happened very fast." Id.,at 4.Green also explained why he had earlier denied witnessing the murder:"I told [investigators] I didn't [see the murder] because I was concernedabout my safety. I know that Jordan and O'Neal were in the AryanBrotherhood, and if I said I saw them do it, they could easily have mekilled." Id., at 3-4.Green continued: "If I had been contacted before Schlup's trial, I wouldhave told his attorney that he was not there when Dade was stabbed, andI would have testified that I called base within seconds after Dade hit theground. I might have been reluctant to snitch on Jordan and O'Neal.I'm not afraid now because I haven't been in prison for more than 71/2years, and I have been working steadily ever since. I have no intentionof going back to prison." Id., at 6.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT311Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe District Court denied the motion and the supplementalmotion without opinion.Petitioner then sought from the Court of Appeals a stayof execution pending the resolution of his appeal. Relyingon Justice Powell's plurality opinion in Kuhlmann v. Wilson,477 U. S. 436 (1986), Schlup argued that the District Courtshould have entertained his second habeas corpus petition,because he had supplemented his constitutional claim "witha colorable claim of factual innocence." Id., at 454.On October 15, 1993, the Court of Appeals denied the stayapplication. In an opinion that was subsequently vacated,the majority held that petitioner's claim of innocence wasgoverned by the standard announced in Sawyer v. Whitley,505 U. S. 333 (1992), and it concluded that under that standard, the evidence of Schlup's guilt that had been adduced attrial foreclosed consideration of petitioner's current constitutional claims.22Judge Heaney dissented. Relying on Green's affidavit,the videotape, and the affidavits of four other eyewitnesses,Judge Heaney concluded that the petitioner had met boththe Kuhlmann standard and a proper reading of the Sawyerstandard.23 Cf. infra, at 331. He believed that the DistrictCourt should have conducted an evidentiary hearing inwhich the affiants would have been subjected to examination by the State so "their credibility could be accuratelydetermined."24In the meantime, petitioner's counsel obtained an affidavitfrom Robert Faherty, the former lieutenant at the prisonwhom Schlup had passed on the way to lunch on the day ofthe murder and who had reprimanded Schlup for shoutingout the window. See n. 10, supra. Faherty's affidavitstated that Schlup had been in Faherty's presence for at least22 Schlup v.

The majority adhered to its earlierconclusion that Sawyer stated the appropriate standard forevaluating Schlup's claim of actual innocence. 11 F. 3d, at740. The opinion also contained an extended discussion ofSchlup's new evidence. The court noted in particular thatGreen's new affidavit was inconsistent in part with both hisprison interview and his testimony at the Stewart trial. Id.,at 742. The court viewed Faherty's affidavit as simply "aneffort to embellish and expand upon his testimony" and concluded "that a habeas court should not permit retrial on sucha basis." Id., at 743.Judge Heaney again dissented, concluding that Schlup had"presented truly persuasive evidence that he is actually innocent," and that the District Court should therefore have addressed the merits of Schlup's constitutional claims. Id., at744. Judge Heaney also argued that Schlup's ineffectiveness claim was substantial. He noted that Schlup's trialcounsel failed to conduct individual interviews with GriffinBey, McCoy, or any of the other inmates who told investigators that they had seen the killing. Moreover, counsel failedto interview Green about his statement that he had called25 Faherty had testified at Schlup's trial, but he had not been asked aboutthe significant details of his encounter with Schlup that are recited in hisaffidavit.

In fact, counsel apparently failed to conduct individ-ual interviews with any of the potential witnesses to thecrime.Judge Heaney adhered to his conclusion that Schlup'scounsel was ineffective, even though counsel allegedly hadreviewed 100 interviews conducted by prison investigators.26Judge Heaney argued that counsel's review of the interviewtranscripts--rather than demonstrating counsel's effectiveness--made counsel's failure to conduct his own interviewswith Green and the few inmates who admitted seeing theattack even more troubling. See id., at 747, n. 5. JudgeHeaney concluded that Schlup's case should be remanded tothe District Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing and, ifappropriate, to address the merits of Schlup's constitutionalclaims.On November 17, 1993, the Court of Appeals denied a suggestion for rehearing en banc. Dissenting from that denial,three judges joined an opinion describing the questionwhether the majority should have applied the standard an-nounced in Sawyer v. Whitley, supra, rather than the Kuhlmann standard as "a question of great importance in habeascorpus jurisprudence." 11 F. 3d, at 755. We granted certiorari to consider that question. 511 U. S. 1003 (1994).27IIIAs a preliminary matter, it is important to explain the dif-ference between Schlup's claim of actual innocence and the26 The transcripts of the individual interviews conducted by the prisoninvestigators were relatively brief: The entire written transcript of theinvestigators' interview with Green, for example, takes up less than onepage. The vast majority of the interviews consisted of simple statementsthat the interviewee had not seen Dade's killing.27 Though the Court of Appeals denied Schlup's motion for a stay ofexecution, the Governor of Missouri granted a stay one day before Schlup'sexecution date. The Governor then ordered a Board of Inquiry to conductclemency proceedings. Those proceedings are apparently continuing.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT314 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the Courtclaim of actual innocence asserted in Herrera v. Collins, 506U. S. 390 (1993). In Herrera, the petitioner advanced hisclaim of innocence to support a novel substantive constitu-tional claim, namely, that the execution of an innocent personwould violate the Eighth Amendment.28 Under petitioner'stheory in Herrera, even if the proceedings that had resultedin his conviction and sentence were entirely fair and errorfree, his innocence would render his execution a "constitutionally intolerable event." Id., at 419 (O'Connor, J.,concurring).Schlup's claim of innocence, on the other hand, is proce-dural, rather than substantive. His constitutional claimsare based not on his innocence, but rather on his contentionthat the ineffectiveness of his counsel, seeStrickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), and the withholding of evi-dence by the prosecution, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.83 (1963), denied him the full panoply of protections affordedto criminal defendants by the Constitution. Schlup, however, faces procedural obstacles that he must overcome be-fore a federal court may address the merits of those constitutional claims. Because Schlup has been unable to establish"cause and prejudice" sufficient to excuse his failure to present his evidence in support of his first federal petition, seeMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.

S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the Courtwithin the "narrow class of cases . . . implicating a fundamen-tal miscarriage of justice,"id., at 494. Schlup's claim of innocence is offered only to bring him within this "narrow classof cases."Schlup's claim thus differs in at least two important waysfrom that presented in Herrera. First, Schlup's claim of innocence does not by itself provide a basis for relief. Instead,his claim for relief depends critically on the validity of hisStrickland and Brady claims.30 Schlup's claim of innocenceis thus "not itself a constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to havehis otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on themerits." Herrera, 506 U. S., at 404; see also 11 F. 3d, at740.31More importantly, a court's assumptions about the validityof the proceedings that resulted in conviction are fundamentally different in Schlup's case than in Herrera's. In Herrera, petitioner's claim was evaluated on the assumption thatthe trial that resulted in his conviction had been error free.In such a case, when a petitioner has been "tried before ajury of his peers, with the full panoply of protections thatour Constitution affords criminal defendants," 506 U. S., at419 (O'Connor, J., concurring), it is appropriate to apply an30 In light of our conclusion that the courts below applied the wrongstandard in evaluating Schlup's gateway innocence claim, see infra, at326-327, we need not express a view concerning the merits of Schlup'sunderlying constitutional claims.31 In his submissions to the federal courts, Schlup has consistently argued that his execution would violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because he is actually innocent. That Herrera claim was rejectedin the District Court and in the Court of Appeals. In the dissent fromthe denial of rehearing en banc, three judges stated that they were persuaded by Judge Heaney's dissent that there was "at least a substantiallikelihood" that Schlup could meet even the extraordinarily high showingrequired by Herrera. We denied certiorari on Schlup's Herrera claim,and accordingly we express no opinion as to its merits.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT316 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the Court" `extraordinarily high' " standard of review, id., at 426(O'Connor, J., concurring).32Schlup, in contrast, accompanies his claim of innocencewith an assertion of constitutional error at trial. For thatreason, Schlup's conviction may not be entitled to the samedegree of respect as one, such as Herrera's, that is the prod-uct of an error-free trial. Without any new evidence of innocence, even the existence of a concededly meritorious con-stitutional violation is not in itself sufficient to establish amiscarriage of justice that would allow a habeas court toreach the merits of a barred claim. However, if a petitionersuch as Schlup presents evidence of innocence so strong thata court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trialunless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free ofnonharmless constitutional error, the petitioner should beallowed to pass through the gateway and argue the meritsof his underlying claims.Consequently, Schlup's evidence of innocence need carryless of a burden. InHerrera (on the assumption that peti-tioner's claim was, in principle, legally well founded), the evidence of innocence would have had to be strong enough tomake his execution "constitutionally intolerable"even if hisconviction was the product of a fair trial. For Schlup, theevidence must establish sufficient doubt about his guilt tojustify the conclusion that his execution would be a miscarriage of justice unless his conviction was the product of afair trial.Our rather full statement of the facts illustrates the fore-going distinction between a substantiveHerrera claim andSchlup's procedural claim. Three items of evidence are particularly relevant: the affidavit of black inmates attesting tothe innocence of a white defendant in a racially motivatedkilling; the affidavit of Green describing his prompt call for32 In Herrera, it was not necessary to determine the appropriate standard of review because petitioner had failed to make "a truly persuasivedemonstration of `actual innocence' " under any reasonable standard.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT317Cite as: 513 U.

If therewere no question about the fairness of the criminal trial, aHerrera-type claim would have to fail unless the federal habeas court is itself convinced that those new facts unques-tionably establish Schlup's innocence. On the other hand, ifthe habeas court were merely convinced that those new factsraised sufficient doubt about Schlup's guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial without the assurance thatthat trial was untainted by constitutional error, Schlup'sthreshold showing of innocence would justify a review of themerits of the constitutional claims.IVAs this Court has repeatedly noted, "[a]t common law, resjudicata did not attach to a court's denial of habeas relief."McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 479. Instead, " `a renewed applica-tion could be made to every other judge or court in therealm, and each court or judge was bound to consider thequestion of the prisoner's right to a discharge independently,and not to be influenced by the previous decisions refusingdischarge.' " Ibid., quoting W. Church, Writ of Habeas Corpus $ 386, p. 570 (2d ed. 1893).The Court has explained the early tolerance of successivepetitions, in part, by the fact that the writ originally per-formed only the narrow function of testing either the jurisdiction of the sentencing court or the legality of Executivedetention. SeeMcCleskey, 499 U. S., at 478; Wainwright v.Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 78 (1977).33 The scope of the writ laterexpanded beyond its original narrow purview to encompass33 As this Court noted in Wainwright v.

That broad-ening of the scope of the writ created the risk that repetitious filings by individual petitioners might adversely affectthe administration of justice in the federal courts. Such filings also posed a threat to the finality of state-court judg-ments and to principles of comity and federalism. See,e. g.,McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 491; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S.478, 487 (1986).To alleviate the increasing burdens on the federal courtsand to contain the threat to finality and comity, Congressattempted to fashion rules disfavoring claims raised in second and subsequent petitions. For example, in 1966, Con-gress amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) "to introduce `a greaterdegree of finality of judgments in habeas corpus proceed-ings.' "Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S., at 450, quotingS. Rep. No. 1797, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1966) (Senate Report); see also McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 486. Similarly, in1976, Congress promulgated Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Proceedings in part to deal with theproblem of repetitive filings.These same concerns resulted in a number of recent deci-sions from this Court that delineate the circumstances underwhich a district court may consider claims raised in a secondor subsequent habeas petition. In those decisions, theCourt held that a habeas court may not ordinarily reach themerits of successive claims, Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S.436 (1986), or abusive claims, McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 493,absent a showing of cause and prejudice, see Wainwright v.Sykes, 433 U.

S., at 490-491("The doctrines of procedural default and abuse of the writimplicate nearly identical concerns flowing from the significant costs of federal habeas corpus review"). See generallySawyer, 505 U. S., at 338-340. The net result of this congressional and judicial action has been the adoption in habeascorpus of a " `qualified application of the doctrine of res judicata.' " McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 486, quoting Senate Report, at 2.35At the same time, the Court has adhered to the principlethat habeas corpus is, at its core, an equitable remedy. ThisCourt has consistently relied on the equitable nature ofhabeas corpus to preclude application of strict rules of resjudicata. Thus, for example, in Sanders v. United States,373 U. S. 1 (1963), this Court held that a habeas court mustadjudicate even a successive habeas claim when required todo so by the "ends of justice." Id., at 15-17; see also McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 495. The Sanders Court applied thisequitable exception even to petitions brought under 28to the relief he seeks.' " Ibid., quoting Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S.1, 17-19 (1963).35 This Court has repeatedly noted the interplay between statutory language and judicially managed equitable considerations in the developmentof habeas corpus jurisprudence. For example, in McCleskey, the Courtnoted that the doctrine of abuse of the writ of habeas corpus "refers to acomplex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlledby historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions." 499U. S., at 489. Similarly, in Wainwright v. Sykes, the Court noted its "historic willingness to overturn or modify its earlier views of the scope ofthe writ, even where the statutory language authorizing judicial actionhas remained unchanged." 433 U.

In Kuhlmann, seven Members of this Court squarelyrejected the argument that in light of the 1966 amendments,"federal courts no longer must consider the `ends of justice'before dismissing a successive petition." 477 U. S., at 451(plurality opinion); id., at 468-471 (Brennan, J., dissenting);id., at 476-477 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also Sawyer,505 U.

S., at 452. Similarly, writingfor the Court in Carrier, Justice O'Connor observed thatthe Court had adopted the cause and prejudice standard inpart because of its confidence that that standard would provide adequate protection to " `victims of a fundamental miscarriage of justice,' " 477 U. S., at 495-496, quoting Engle v.Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982); however, Justice O'Connoralso noted that the Court has candidly refused to "pretendthat this will always be true," Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496.For that reason, " `[i]n appropriate cases,' the principles ofcomity and finality that inform the concepts of cause andprejudice `must yield to the imperative of correcting a funda513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT321Cite as: 513 U.

In subsequent cases, we have consistently re-affirmed the existence and importance of the exception forfundamental miscarriages of justice. See, e. g., Sawyer, 505U. S., at 339-340;McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 494-495; Duggerv. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 414 (1989) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).To ensure that the fundamental miscarriage of justice ex-ception would remain "rare" and would only be applied inthe "extraordinary case," while at the same time ensuringthat the exception would extend relief to those who weretruly deserving, this Court explicitly tied the miscarriage ofjustice exception to the petitioner's innocence. InKuhl-mann, for example, Justice Powell concluded that a prisonerretains an overriding "interest in obtaining his release fromcustody if he is innocent of the charge for which he was incarcerated. That interest does not extend, however, to pris-oners whose guilt is conceded or plain." 477 U. S., at 452.Similarly, Justice O'Connor wrote in Carrier that "in anextraordinary case, where a constitutional violation hasprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actuallyinnocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even inthe absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default."477 U. S., at 496; see also Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S., at 537,quotingCarrier, 477 U. S., at 496.The general rule announced in Kuhlmann, Carrier, andSmith, and confirmed in this Court's more recent decisions,rests in part on the fact that habeas corpus petitions thatadvance a substantial claim of actual innocence are ex-tremely rare.36 Judge Friendly's observation a quarter of a36 Indeed, neither party called our attention to any decision from a Courtof Appeals in which a petitioner had satisfied any definition of actual innocence. Though some such decisions exist, see, e. g., Henderson v. Sargent,926 F. 2d 706, 713-714 (CA8), reaff'd in relevant part on rehearing, 939F. 2d 586 (CA8 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.

DELOOpinion of the Courtcentury ago that "the one thing almost never suggested oncollateral attack is that the prisoner was innocent of thecrime" remains largely true today.37 Explicitly tying themiscarriage of justice exception to innocence thus accommodates both the systemic interests in finality, comity, and conservation of judicial resources, and the overriding individualinterest in doing justice in the "extraordinary case," Carrier,477 U. S., at 496.In addition to linking miscarriages of justice to innocence,Carrier and Kuhlmann also expressed the standard of proofthat should govern consideration of those claims. In Carrier, for example, the Court stated that the petitioner mustshow that the constitutional error "probably" resulted in theconviction of one who was actually innocent. The Kuhlmann plurality, though using the term "colorable claim offactual innocence," elaborated that the petitioner would berequired to establish, by a " `fair probability,' " that " `thetrier of the facts would have entertained a reasonable doubtof his guilt.' " 477 U. S., at 454, 455, n. 17.In the years following Kuhlmann and Carrier, we did notexpound further on the actual innocence exception. Inthose few cases that mentioned the standard, the Court continued to rely on the formulations set forth in Kuhlmannand Carrier. In McCleskey, for example, while establishingthat cause and prejudice would generally define the situations in which a federal court might entertain an abusivepetition, the Court recognized an exception for cases inwhich the constitutional violation "probably has caused theconviction of one innocent of the crime." 499 U. S., at 494,citing Carrier, 477 U. S., at 485.891 F. 2d 1335, 1342 (CA8 1987) (relying on Carrier's actual innocenceexception as an alternative ground of decision), independent research confirms that such decisions are rare.37 Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant?

S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThen, in Sawyer, the Court examined the miscarriage ofjustice exception as applied to a petitioner who claimed hewas "actually innocent of the death penalty." In that opin-ion, the Court struggled to define "actual innocence" in thecontext of a petitioner's claim that his death sentence wasinappropriate. The Court concluded that such actual innocence "must focus on those elements which render a defend-ant eligible for the death penalty." 505 U. S., at 347. However, in addition to defining what it means to be "innocent"of the death penalty, the Court departed fromCarrier's useof "probably" and adopted a more exacting standard of proofto govern these claims: The Court held that a habeas peti-tioner "must show byclear and convincing evidence thatbut for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would havefound the petitioner eligible for the death penalty." 505U. S., at 336 (emphasis added).38 No attempt was made inSawyer to reconcile this stricter standard with Carrier's useof "probably."VIn evaluating Schlup's claim of innocence, the Court of Ap-peals applied Eighth Circuit precedent holding thatSawyer,rather than Carrier, supplied the proper legal standard.The court then purported to apply the Sawyer standard.Schlup argues that Sawyer has no application to a petitionerwho claims that he is actually innocent of the crime, and thatthe Court of Appeals misapplied Sawyer in any event. Respondent contends that the Court of Appeals was correct inboth its selection and its application of theSawyer standard.Though the Court of Appeals seems to have misapplied Sawyer,39 we do not rest our decision on that ground because we38 Even the high standard of proof set forth in Sawyer falls short of theJackson standard governing habeas review of claims of insufficiency of theevidence. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979) ("[N]o rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonabledoubt") (emphasis added). See infra, at 330.39 See infra, at 331.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT324 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the Courtconclude that in a case such as this, the Sawyer standarddoes not apply.As we have stated, the fundamental miscarriage of justiceexception seeks to balance the societal interests in finality,comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with theindividual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinarycase. We conclude that Carrier, rather than Sawyer, properly strikes that balance when the claimed injustice is thatconstitutional error has resulted in the conviction of one whois actually innocent of the crime.Claims of actual innocence pose less of a threat to scarcejudicial resources and to principles of finality and comitythan do claims that focus solely on the erroneous impositionof the death penalty. Though challenges to the propriety ofimposing a sentence of death are routinely asserted in capitalcases, experience has taught us that a substantial claim thatconstitutional error has caused the conviction of an innocentperson is extremely rare. See supra, at 321-322. To becredible, such a claim requires petitioner to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence--whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthyeyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence--that wasnot presented at trial. Because such evidence is obviouslyunavailable in the vast majority of cases, claims of actualinnocence are rarely successful. Even under the preSawyer regime, "in virtually every case, the allegation ofactual innocence has been summarily rejected." 40 Thethreat to judicial resources, finality, and comity posed byclaims of actual innocence is thus significantly less than thatposed by claims relating only to sentencing.Of greater importance, the individual interest in avoidinginjustice is most compelling in the context of actual innocence. The quintessential miscarriage of justice is the exe40 Steiker, Innocence and Federal Habeas, 41 UCLA L.

S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcution of a person who is entirely innocent.41 Indeed, con-cern about the injustice that results from the conviction ofan innocent person has long been at the core of our criminaljustice system. That concern is reflected, for example, inthe "fundamental value determination of our society that itis far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guiltyman go free." In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 372 (1970)(Harlan, J., concurring). See also T. Starkie, Evidence 756(1824) ("The maxim of the law is . . . that it is better thatninety-nine . . . offenders should escape, than that one innocent man should be condemned"). See generally Newman,Beyond "Reasonable Doubt," 68 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 979, 980-981 (1993).The overriding importance of this greater individual interest merits protection by imposing a somewhat less exactingstandard of proof on a habeas petitioner alleging a fundamental miscarriage of justice than on one alleging that his sen-tence is too severe. As this Court has noted, "a standard ofproof represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder con-cerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he shouldhave in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particulartype of adjudication." In re Winship, 397 U. S., at 370 (Har-lan, J., concurring); see alsoAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S.418, 423 (1979). The standard of proof thus reflects "the rel-ative importance attached to the ultimate decision."Ibid.Though the Sawyer standard was fashioned to reflect therelative importance of a claim of an erroneous sentence, application of that standard to petitioners such as Schlup wouldgive insufficient weight to the correspondingly greater injustice that is implicated by a claim of actual innocence. The41 See, e. g., Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S. 110, 125 (1991); Clemons v.Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 750, n. 4 (1990); Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S.496, 509, n. 12 (1987); Solem v. Helm, 463 U.

DELOOpinion of the Courtparamount importance of avoiding the injustice of executingone who is actually innocent thus requires application of theCarrier standard.42We recognize, as the State has reminded us, that inSawyer the Court applied its new standard not only to the pen-alty phase of the case but also to Sawyer's responsibility forarson, one of the elements of the offense of first-degree murder.43 This fact does not require application of the Sawyerstandard to a case such as Schlup's. Though formulated asan element of the offense of first-degree murder, the arsonfunctioned essentially as a sentence enhancer. That claim,therefore, is readily distinguishable from a claim, like theone raised by Schlup, that the petitioner is actually innocent.Fealty to the doctrine of stare decisis does not, therefore,preclude application of theCarrier standard to the facts ofthis case.44Accordingly, we hold that theCarrier "probably resulted"standard rather than the more stringent Sawyer standardmust govern the miscarriage of justice inquiry when a peti42 By our references to Winship, of course, we do not suggest that Schlupcomes before a habeas court in the same situation as one who has merelybeen accused of a crime. Having been convicted by a jury of a capitaloffense, Schlup no longer has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. Cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S., at 399 (O'Connor, J., concurring).To the contrary, Schlup comes before the habeas court with a strong--andin the vast majority of the cases conclusive--presumption of guilt. Ourreference to Winship is intended merely to demonstrate that it is quiteconsistent with our jurisprudence to give content through a burden ofproof to the understanding that fundamental injustice would result fromthe erroneous conviction and execution of an innocent person.43 See Sawyer, 505 U. S., at 342, n. 8, 349-350.44 Nor do we believe that confining Sawyer's more rigorous standard toclaims involving eligibility for the sentence of death is anomalous. Ourrecognition of the significant difference between the injustice that resultsfrom an erroneous conviction and the injustice that results from an erroneous sentence is reflected in our decisions that permit reduced proceduralprotections at sentencing. See, e. g., Williams v. New York, 337 U. S.241 (1949).513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT327Cite as: 513 U.

S.,at 496. To establish the requisite probability, the petitionermust show that it is more likely than not that no reasonablejuror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence. The petitioner thus is required to make a strongershowing than that needed to establish prejudice.45 At thesame time, the showing of "more likely than not" imposes alower burden of proof than the "clear and convincing" standard required under Sawyer. The Carrier standard thusensures that petitioner's case is truly "extraordinary,"Mc-Cleskey, 499 U. S., at 494, while still providing petitioner ameaningful avenue by which to avoid a manifest injustice.Carrier requires a petitioner to show that he is "actuallyinnocent." As used in Carrier, actual innocence is closelyrelated to the definition set forth by this Court in Sawyer.To satisfy the Carrier gateway standard, a petitioner mustshow that it is more likely than not that no reasonable jurorwould have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt.Several observations about this standard are in order.TheCarrier standard is intended to focus the inquiry onactual innocence. In assessing the adequacy of petitioner'sshowing, therefore, the district court is not bound by therules of admissibility that would govern at trial. Instead,the emphasis on "actual innocence" allows the reviewing tri-bunal also to consider the probative force of relevant evi45 See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.

DELOOpinion of the Courtdence that was either excluded or unavailable at trial. Indeed, with respect to this aspect of the Carrier standard, webelieve that Judge Friendly's description of the inquiry isappropriate: The habeas court must make its determinationconcerning the petitioner's innocence "in light of all the evidence, including that alleged to have been illegally admitted(but with due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidencetenably claimed to have been wrongly excluded or to havebecome available only after the trial." 46The consideration in federal habeas proceedings of abroader array of evidence does not modify the essentialmeaning of "innocence." The Carrier standard reflects theproposition, firmly established in our legal system, that theline between innocence and guilt is drawn with reference toa reasonable doubt. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970).Indeed, even in Sawyer, with its emphasis on eligibility forthe death penalty, the Court did not stray from the understanding that the eligibility determination must be madewith reference to reasonable doubt. Thus, whether a courtis assessing eligibility for the death penalty under Sawyer,or is deciding whether a petitioner has made the requisiteshowing of innocence under Carrier, the analysis mustincorporate the understanding that proof beyond a reasonable doubt marks the legal boundary between guilt andinnocence.4746 38 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 160.47 Actual innocence, of course, does not require innocence in the broadsense of having led an entirely blameless life. Indeed, Schlup's situationprovides a good illustration. At the time of the crime at issue in thiscase, Schlup was incarcerated for an earlier offense, the sordid details ofwhich he acknowledged in his testimony at the punishment phase of histrial. Such earlier criminal activity has no bearing on whether Schlup isactually innocent of Dade's murder.As we have explained, supra, at 313-317, Schlup's claim of innocence isfundamentally different from the claim advanced in Herrera. The standard that we apply today, therefore, will not foreclose the application offactual innocence to the analysis of such claims.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:34 PAGES OPINPGT329Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe meaning of actual innocence as formulated by Sawyerand Carrier does not merely require a showing that a reasonable doubt exists in the light of the new evidence,but rather that no reasonable juror would have found thedefendant guilty. It is not the district court's independentjudgment as to whether reasonable doubt exists that thestandard addresses; rather the standard requires the districtcourt to make a probabilistic determination about what reasonable, properly instructed jurors would do. Thus, a peti-tioner does not meet the threshold requirement unless hepersuades the district court that, in light of the new evi-dence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to findhim guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.We note finally that the Carrier standard requires a petitioner to show that it is more likely than not that "no reason-able juror" would have convicted him. The word "reasonable" in that formulation is not without meaning. It mustbe presumed that a reasonable juror would consider fairlyall of the evidence presented. It must also be presumedthat such a juror would conscientiously obey the instructionsof the trial court requiring proof beyond a reasonabledoubt.4848 The Chief Justice suggests that the Carrier standard is "a classicmixing of apples and oranges." Post, at 339. That standard, however, isno more a mixing of apples and oranges than is the standard adopted bythe Court in Sawyer. See Sawyer, 505 U. S., at 336 (requiring that petitioner show "by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutionalerror, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible forthe death penalty"). Though it is true that " `[m]ore likely than not' " is a"quintessential charge to a finder of fact," post, at 339, that is equally true ofthe "clear and convincing evidence" component of the Sawyer formulation.There is thus no reason to believe that the Carrier standard is any morelikely than the Sawyer standard to be "a source of confusion." Post, at 339.Nor do we accept The Chief Justice's description of the Carrierstandard as a "hybrid." Post, at 339. Finders of fact are often calledupon to make predictions about the likely actions of hypothetical "reasonable" actors. Thus, the application of "more likely than not" to the habeascourt's assessment of the actions of reasonable jurors is neither illogicalnor unusual.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:35 PAGES OPINPGT330 SCHLUP v. DELOOpinion of the CourtThough the Carrier standard requires a substantial showing, it is by no means equivalent to the standard of Jacksonv. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), that governs review ofclaims of insufficient evidence. The Jackson standard,which focuses on whether any rational juror could haveconvicted, looks to whether there is sufficient evidencewhich, if credited, could support the conviction. The Jackson standard thus differs in at least two important waysfrom the Carrier standard. First, under Jackson, the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is generally beyondthe scope of review. In contrast, under the gateway standard we describe today, the newly presented evidence mayindeed call into question the credibility of the witnesses presented at trial. In such a case, the habeas court may haveto make some credibility assessments. Second, and morefundamentally, the focus of the inquiry is different underJackson than under Carrier. Under Jackson, the use of theword "could" focuses the inquiry on the power of the trier offact to reach its conclusion. Under Carrier, the use of theword "would" focuses the inquiry on the likely behavior ofthe trier of fact.Indeed, our adoption of the phrase "more likely than not"reflects this distinction. Under Jackson, the questionwhether the trier of fact has power to make a finding of guiltrequires a binary response: Either the trier of fact has poweras a matter of law or it does not. Under Carrier, incontrast, the habeas court must consider what reasonabletriers of fact are likely to do. Under this probabilistic inquiry, it makes sense to have a probabilistic standard suchas "more likely than not." 49 Thus, though under Jacksonthe mere existence of sufficient evidence to convict would bedeterminative of petitioner's claim, that is not true underCarrier.49 The "clear and convincing" standard adopted in Sawyer reflects thissame understanding of the relevant inquiry.513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:35 PAGES OPINPGT331Cite as: 513 U. S. 298 (1995)Opinion of the CourtWe believe that the Eighth Circuit's erroneous applicationof theSawyer standard below illustrates this difference. Indetermining that Schlup had failed to satisfy the Sawyerstandard, the majority noted that "two prison officials, whowere eyewitnesses to the crime, positively identified Mr.Schlup as one of the three perpetrators of the murder. Thisevidence was clearly admissible and stands unrefuted exceptto the extent that Mr. Schlup now questions its credibility."11 F. 3d, at 741.The majority then continued:"[E]ven if we disregard the source of the new evidence,the eleventh-hour nature of the information, and a pres-entation coming almost six years after the trial; it issimply not possible to say that the appellant has shownby clear and convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error no reasonable jury would have found himguilty."Ibid.However, Schlup's evidence includes the sworn statementsof several eyewitnesses that Schlup was not involved in thecrime. Moreover, Schlup has presented statements fromGreen and Faherty that cast doubt on whether Schlup couldhave participated in the murder and still arrived at the din-ing room 65 seconds before the distress call was received.Those new statements may, of course, be unreliable. But ifthey are true--as the Court of Appeals assumed for the pur-pose of applying its understanding of theSawyer standard--it surely cannot be said that a juror, conscientiously followingthe judge's instructions requiring proof beyond a reasonabledoubt, would vote to convict. Under a proper application ofeither Sawyer or Carrier, petitioner's showing of innocenceis not insufficient solely because the trial record containedsufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.In this case, the application of the Carrier standard arisesin the context of a request for an evidentiary hearing. Inapplying the Carrier standard to such a request, the District513us2$19I 04-09-98 16:25:35 PAGES OPINPGT332 SCHLUP v. DELOO'Connor, J., concurringCourt must assess the probative force of the newly presentedevidence in connection with the evidence of guilt adduced attrial. Obviously, the court is not required to test the newevidence by a standard appropriate for deciding a motion forsummary judgment. Cf. Agosto v. INS, 436 U. S. 748, 756(1978) ("[A] district court generally cannot grant summaryjudgment based on its assessment of the credibility of theevidence presented"); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477U. S. 242, 249 (1986) ("[A]t the summary judgment stage thejudge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and de-termine the truth of the matter but to determine whetherthere is a genuine issue for trial"). Instead, the court mayconsider how the timing of the submission and the likelycredibility of the affiants bear on the probable reliability ofthat evidence.Because both the Court of Appeals and the District Courtevaluated the record under an improper standard, furtherproceedings are necessary. The fact-intensive nature of theinquiry, together with the District Court's ability to take testimony from the few key witnesses if it deems that courseadvisable, convinces us that the most expeditious procedureis to order that the decision of the Court of Appeals be vacated and that the case be remanded to the Court of Appealswith instructions to remand to the District Court for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.
