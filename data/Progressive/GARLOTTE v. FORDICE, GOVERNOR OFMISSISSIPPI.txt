To petition a federal court for habeas corpus relief froma state-court conviction, the applicant must be "in custodyin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of theUnited States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a); see also 28 U. S. C.$ 2241(c)(3). In Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), we heldthat the governing federal prescription permits prisoners incarcerated under consecutive state-court sentences to applyfor federal habeas relief from sentences they had not yetbegun to serve. We said in Peyton that, for purposes ofhabeas relief, consecutive sentences should be treated as acontinuous series; a prisoner is "in custody in violation of the*Harold J.

Id., at 64-65.The case before us is appropriately described as Peyton'scomplement, or Peyton in reverse. Like the habeas peti-tioners inPeyton, petitioner Harvey Garlotte is incarceratedunder consecutive sentences. Unlike the Peyton petitioners, however, Garlotte does not challenge a conviction under-lying a sentence yet to be served. Instead, Garlotte seeksto attack a conviction underlying the sentence that ran firstin a consecutive series, a sentence already served, but onethat nonetheless persists to postpone Garlotte's eligibilityfor parole. FollowingPeyton, we do not disaggregate Gar-lotte's sentences, but comprehend them as composing a continuous stream. We therefore hold that Garlotte remains"in custody" under all of his sentences until all are served,and now may attack the conviction underlying the sentencescheduled to run first in the series.IOn September 16, 1985, at a plea hearing held in a Missis-sippi trial court, Harvey Garlotte entered simultaneousguilty pleas to one count of possession with intent to distrib-ute marijuana and two counts of murder. Pursuant to a pleaagreement, the State recommended that Garlotte be sen-tenced to a prison term of three years on the marijuanacount, to run consecutively with two concurrent life sen-tences on the murder counts. App. 43. State law requiredGarlotte to serve at least ten months on the marijuana count,Miss. Code Ann. $ 47-7-3(1)(c)(ii) (Supp. 1994), and at leastten years on the concurrent life sentences. $ 47-7-3(1).At the plea hearing, the trial judge inquired whether theState wanted Garlotte to serve the life sentences before thethree-year sentence: "[A] three year sentence [on the marijuana possession count] to run consecutive to th[e] two life515us1$65P 08-11-98 16:52:07 PAGES OPINPGT42 GARLOTTE v. FORDICEOpinion of the Courtsentences?" the judge asked. The prosecutor expressed indifference about the order in which the sentences would run:"Either that way, your Honor or allow the three years to runfirst. In other words, we're just talking about a total ofthree years and then life or life and then three years." App.43. The judge next asked Garlotte's counsel about his understanding of the State's recommendation. Defense counsel replied, without elaboration: "[I]t's my understandingthat the possession case is to run first and then the two lifesentences." Id., at 44. The court saw "no reason not togo along with the recommendation of the State." Id., at50. Without further explanation, the court imposed thesentences in this order: the three-year sentence first, then,consecutively, the concurrent life sentences. Ibid.Garlotte wrote to the trial court seven months after theSeptember 16, 1985 hearing, asking for permission to withdraw his guilty plea on the marijuana count. The court'sreply notified Garlotte of the Mississippi statute under whichhe could pursue postconviction collateral relief. Id., at 51.Garlotte unsuccessfully moved for such relief. Nearly twoyears after the denial of Garlotte's motion, the MississippiSupreme Court rejected his appeal. Garlotte v. State, 530So. 2d 693 (1988). On January 18, 1989, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied further postconviction motions filed byGarlotte. By this time, Garlotte had completed the periodof incarceration set for the marijuana offense, and had commenced serving the life sentences.On October 6, 1989, Garlotte filed a habeas corpus petitionin the United States District Court for the Southern Districtof Mississippi, naming as respondent Kirk Fordice, the Governor of Mississippi.1 Adopting the recommendation of a1 Garlotte asserted that he was entitled to relief because his guilty pleawas not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, he did not receive effectiveassistance of trial counsel, he was subjected to double jeopardy, and hissentence was unusual and disproportionate.

App. 18.Before the United States Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit, the State argued for the first time that the DistrictCourt lacked jurisdiction over Garlotte's petition. 29 F. 3d216, 217 (1994). The State asserted that Garlotte, prior tothe District Court filing, had already served out the prisontime imposed for the marijuana conviction; therefore, theState maintained, Garlotte was no longer "in custody" underthat conviction within the meaning of the federal habeasstatute. Ibid. Garlotte countered that he remained "incustody" until all sentences were served, emphasizing thatthe marijuana conviction continued to postpone the date onwhich he would be eligible for parole. Id., at 218.Adopting the State's position, the Fifth Circuit dismissedGarlotte's habeas petition for want of jurisdiction. Ibid.The Courts of Appeals have divided over the questionwhether a person incarcerated under consecutive sentencesremains "in custody" under a sentence that (1) has beencompleted in terms of prison time served, but (2) continuesto postpone the prisoner's date of potential release.2 Wegranted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 513 U. S. 1123(1995), and now reverse.3 IIThe federal habeas statute authorizes United States dis-trict courts to entertain petitions for habeas relief fromstate-court judgments only when the petitioner is "in cus-tody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of2 Compare Fawcett v. Bablitch, 962 F. 2d 617, 618 (CA7 1992) ("in custody"); Bernard v. Garraghty, 934 F. 2d 52, 55 (CA4 1991) (same); and Foxv. Kelso, 911 F. 2d 563, 568 (CA11 1990) (same), with Allen v.

C. $ 2254(a); see also 28 U. S. C.$ 2241(c)(3). InPeyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), we heldthat the statute authorized the exercise of habeas jurisdic-tion over the petitions of two State of Virginia prisoners,Robert Rowe and Clyde Thacker. Rowe and Thacker wereincarcerated under consecutive sentences; both sought tochallenge sentences slated to run in the future. Virginia,relying on McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), argued thatthe habeas petitions were premature. OverrulingMcNally,we explained:"[I]n common understanding `custody' comprehends respondents' status for the entire duration of their impris-onment. Practically speaking, Rowe is in custody for50 years, or for the aggregate of his 30- and 20-yearsentences. For purposes of parole eligibility, under Virginia law he is incarcerated for 50 years. Nothing onthe face of $ 2241 militates against an interpretationwhich views Rowe and Thacker as being `in custody'under the aggregate of the consecutive sentences imposed on them. Under that interpretation, they are `incustody in violation of the Constitution' if any consecutive sentence they are scheduled to serve was imposedas the result of a deprivation of constitutional rights."391 U. S., at 64-65 (citations omitted).The habeas petitioners in Peyton sought to present challenges that, if successful, would advance their release dates.That was enough, we concluded, to permit them to invokethe Great Writ. Id., at 66-67.Had the Mississippi trial court ordered that Garlotte's lifesentences run before his marijuana sentence--an optionabout which the prosecutor expressed indifference--Peytonunquestionably would have instructed the District Court toentertain Garlotte's present habeas petition.

S. 39 (1995)Opinion of the Courttion (following state-court proceedings) after prison time hadrun on the marijuana sentence, Mississippi urges that Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989) (per curiam), rather thanPeyton, controls.The question presented in Maleng was "whether a habeaspetitioner remains `in custody' under a conviction after thesentence imposed for it has fully expired, merely because ofthe possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent crimes ofwhich he is convicted." 490 U. S., at 492. We held that thepotential use of a conviction to enhance a sentence for subsequent offenses did not suffice to render a person "in custody"within the meaning of the habeas statute. Ibid.Maleng recognized that we had "very liberally construedthe `in custody' requirement for purposes of federal habeas,"but stressed that the Court had "never extended it to thesituation where a habeas petitioner suffers no present restraint from a conviction." Ibid. "[A]lmost all States havehabitual offender statutes, and many States provide . . . forspecific enhancement of subsequent sentences on the basis ofprior convictions," ibid.; hence, the construction of "in custody" urged by the habeas petitioner in Maleng would haveleft nearly all convictions perpetually open to collateral attack. The Maleng petitioner's interpretation, we thereforecommented, "would read the `in custody' requirement out ofthe statute." Ibid.4Unlike the habeas petitioner in Maleng, Garlotte is serving consecutive sentences. In Peyton, we held that "a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is `in custody' under anyone of them" for purposes of the habeas statute. 391 U. S.,4 We left open the possibility, however, that the conviction underlyingthe expired sentence might be subject to challenge in a collateral attackupon the subsequent sentence that the expired sentence was used to enhance.

Having construed the statutory term "in custody" torequire that consecutive sentences be viewed in the aggregate, we will not now adopt a different construction simplybecause the sentence imposed under the challenged conviction lies in the past rather than in the future.5Mississippi urges, as a prime reason for its construction ofthe "in custody" requirement, that allowing a habeas attackon a sentence nominally completed would "encourage andreward delay in the assertion of habeas challenges." Brieffor Respondent 28. As Mississippi observes, in Peyton werejected the prematurity rule ofMcNally in part becauseof "the harshness of a rule which may delay determinationof federal claims for decades."Peyton, 391 U. S., at 61.Mississippi argues that Garlotte's reading of the words "incustody" would undermine the expeditious adjudicationrationale of Peyton. Brief for Respondent 6-7, 27-28.Our holding today, however, is unlikely to encourage delay.A prisoner naturally prefers release sooner to release later.Further, because the habeas petitioner generally bears theburden of proof, delay is apt to disadvantage the petitionermore than the State. Nothing in this record, we note, suggests that Garlotte has been dilatory in challenging his marijuana conviction. Finally, under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(a),a district court may dismiss a habeas petition if the State5 That Mississippi itself views consecutive sentences in the aggregate forvarious penological purposes reveals the difficulties courts and prisonerswould face trying to determine when one sentence ends and a consecutivesentence begins. For example, Mississippi aggregates consecutive sentences for the purpose of determining parole eligibility, see Miss. CodeAnn. $ 47-7-3(1) (Supp. 1994) ("Every prisoner . . . who has served not lessthan one-fourth (1/4) of the total of such term or terms for which suchprisoner was sentenced . . . may be released on parole as hereinafter provided . . . .") (emphasis added), and for the purpose of determining commutation of sentences for meritorious earned-time credit. See Miss. CodeAnn. $ 47-5-139(3) (1981) ("An offender under two (2) or more consecutivesentences shall be allowed commutation based upon the total term of thesentences.") (emphasis added).515us1$65P 08-11-98 16:52:08 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 515 U. S. 39 (1995)Thomas, J., dissenting"has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petitionby [inexcusable] delay in its filing."* * *Under Peyton, we view consecutive sentences in the ag-gregate, not as discrete segments. Invalidation of Garlotte's marijuana conviction would advance the date of hiseligibility for release from present incarceration. Garlotte'schallenge, which will shorten his term of incarceration if heproves unconstitutionality, implicates the core purpose ofhabeas review. We therefore hold that Garlotte was "incustody" under his marijuana conviction when he filed hisfederal habeas petition. Accordingly, the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
