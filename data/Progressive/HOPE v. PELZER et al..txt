The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concludedthat petitioner Larry Hope, a former prison inmate at theLimestone Prison in Alabama, was subjected to cruel andunusual punishment when prison guards twice handcuffedhim to a hitching post to sanction him for disruptive conduct.Because that conclusion was not supported by earlier caseswith "materially similar" facts, the court held that the re-spondents were entitled to qualified immunity, and thereforeaffirmed summary judgment in their favor. We granted cer-tiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals' qualifiedimmunity holding comports with our decision in UnitedStates v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259 (1997).IIn 1995, Alabama was the only State that followed thepractice of chaining inmates to one another in work squads.It was also the only State that handcuffed prisoners to"hitching posts" if they either refused to work or otherwisedisrupted work squads.1 Hope was handcuffed to a hitching*Mark R. Brown, James K. Green, and Steven R.

We do the same. Saucier v.Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). The Court of Appeals also referencedfacts established in Austin v. Hopper, 15 F. Supp. 2d 1210 (MD Ala. 1998).240 F. 3d, at 978, n. 6. This was appropriate because Austin is a classaction suit brought by Alabama prisoners, including Hope, and the DistrictCourt opinion in that case discusses Hope's allegations at some length.15 F. Supp. 2d, at 1247-1248. In their summary judgment papers, bothHope and respondents referenced the findings in Austin, and thus those536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN734 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courtpost on two occasions. On May 11, 1995, while Hope wasworking in a chain gang near an interstate highway, he gotinto an argument with another inmate. Both men weretaken back to the Limestone prison and handcuffed to ahitching post. Hope was released two hours later, after theguard captain determined that the altercation had beencaused by the other inmate. During his two hours on thepost, Hope was offered drinking water and a bathroom breakevery 15 minutes, and his responses to these offers were recorded on an activity log. Because he was only slightlytaller than the hitching post, his arms were above shoulderheight and grew tired from being handcuffed so high.Whenever he tried moving his arms to improve his circulation, the handcuffs cut into his wrists, causing pain anddiscomfort.On June 7, 1995, Hope was punished more severely. Hetook a nap during the morning bus ride to the chain gang'sworksite, and when it arrived he was less than prompt inresponding to an order to get off the bus. An exchange ofvulgar remarks led to a wrestling match with a guard. Fourother guards intervened, subdued Hope, handcuffed him,placed him in leg irons and transported him back to theprison where he was put on the hitching post. The guardsmade him take off his shirt, and he remained shirtless allfindings are part of the record in this case. See, e. g., Plaintiff's Preliminary Response to Defendants' Special Report, Record 30; Defendants' Response to Court Order, App. 61. Accordingly, for purposes of our reviewof the grant of summary judgment, the Austin findings may also be assumed true, and we reference them when appropriate.As Austin explained, the hitching post is a horizontal bar " `made ofsturdy, nonflexible material,' " placed between 45 and 57 inches from theground. Inmates are handcuffed to the hitching post in a standing position and remain standing the entire time they are placed on the post.Most inmates are shackled to the hitching post with their two hands relatively close together and at face level. 15 F.

During this 7-hour period, he was given water only once or twice and wasgiven no bathroom breaks.3 At one point, a guard tauntedHope about his thirst. According to Hope's affidavit: "[Theguard] first gave water to some dogs, then brought the watercooler closer to me, removed its lid, and kicked the coolerover, spilling the water onto the ground." App. 11.Hope filed suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,in the United States District Court for the Northern Districtof Alabama against three guards involved in the May incident, one of whom also handcuffed him to the hitching postin June. The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge whotreated the responsive affidavits filed by the defendants as amotion for summary judgment. Without deciding whether"the very act of placing him on a restraining bar for a periodof hours as a form of punishment" had violated the EighthAmendment, the Magistrate concluded that the guards wereentitled to qualified immunity.4 Supplemental App. to Pet.for Cert. 21. The District Court agreed, and entered judgment for respondents.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 240 F. 3d 975 (2001). Before reaching the2 "The most repeated complaint of the hitching post, however, was thestrain it produced on inmates' muscles by forcing them to remain in astanding position with their arms raised in a stationary position for a longperiod of time. In addition to their exposure to sunburn, dehydration,and muscle aches, the inmates are also placed in substantial pain when thesun heats the handcuffs that shackle them to the hitching post, or heatsthe hitching post itself. Several of the inmates described the way inwhich the handcuffs burned and chafed their skin during their placementon the post." Id., at 1248.3 The Court of Appeals noted that respondents had not produced anyactivity log for this incident, despite the policy that required that such alog be maintained. 240 F. 3d, at 977, n. 1.4 Supplemental App. to Pet. for Cert. 21-27.536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN736 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courtqualified immunity issue, however, it answered the constitu-tional question that the District Court had bypassed. Thecourt found that the use of the hitching post for punitivepurposes violated the Eighth Amendment. Nevertheless,applying Circuit precedent concerning qualified immunity,the court stated that " `the federal law by which the government official's conduct should be evaluated must be pre-existing, obvious and mandatory,' " and established, not by" `abstractions,' " but by cases that are " `materially similar' "to the facts in the case in front of us."Id., at 981. Thecourt then concluded that the facts in the two precedents onwhich Hope primarily relied--Ort v. White, 813 F. 2d 318(CA11 1987), and Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291 (CA51974)--"[t]hough analogous," were not " `materially similar'to Hope's situation.' " 240 F. 3d, at 981. We granted certiorari to review the Eleventh Circuit's qualified immunityholding. 534 U. S. 1073 (2002).IIThe threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a quali-fied immunity analysis is whether plaintiff 's allegations, iftrue, establish a constitutional violation. Saucier v. Katz,533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). The Court of Appeals held that"the policy and practice of cuffing an inmate to a hitchingpost or similar stationary object for a period of time thatsurpasses that necessary to quell a threat or restore order isa violation of the Eighth Amendment." 240 F. 3d, at 980-981. The court rejected respondents' submission that Hopecould have ended his shackling by offering to return to work,finding instead that the purpose of the practice was puni-tive,5 and that the circumstances of his confinement created5 In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals stated: "While theDOC claims that Hope would have been released from the hitching posthad he asked to return to work, the evidence suggests this is not the case.First, Hope never refused to work. During the May incident, he was thevictim in an altercation on the work site, but he never refused to do his536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN737Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)Opinion of the Courta substantial risk of harm of which the officers were aware.Moreover, the court relied on Circuit precedent condemningsimilar practices6 and the results of a United States Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) report that found Alabama's systematic use of the hitching post to be improper corporal pun-ishment.7 We agree with the Court of Appeals that theattachment of Hope to the hitching post under the circum-stances alleged in this case violated the Eighth Amendment." `[T]he unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . con-stitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by theEighth Amendment.' " Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319(1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted). We havesaid that "[a]mong `unnecessary and wanton' inflictions ofpain are those that are `totally without penological justification.' " Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981). Inmaking this determination in the context of prison condijob. During the June incident, Hope was involved in an altercation withprison guards. There is nothing in the record, however, claiming that herefused to work or encouraged other inmates to refuse to work. Therefore, it is not clear that the solution to his hitching post problem was toask to return to work. Second, Hope was placed in a car and driven backto Limestone to be cuffed to the hitching post on both occasions. Giventhe facts, it is improbable that had Hope said, `I want to go back to work,'a prison guard would have left his post at Limestone to drive Hope backto the work site. It is more likely that the guards left Hope on the postuntil his work detail returned to teach the other inmates a lesson." 240F. 3d, at 980.6 "Since abolishing the pillory over a century ago, our system of justicehas consistently moved away from forms of punishment similar to hitchingposts in prisons. In Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974), inregard to `handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods oftime' and other such punishments, we stated that `[w]e have no difficultyin reaching the conclusion that these forms of corporal punishment runafoul of the Eighth Amendment, offend contemporary concepts of decency,human dignity, and precepts of civilization which we profess to possess.'Gates, 501 F. 2d at 1306." Id., at 979.7 The DOJ report apparently was not before the District Court in thiscase, but the Court of Appeals took judicial notice of the report and referenced it throughout the decision below. Id., at 979, n. 8.536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN738 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courttions, we must ascertain whether the officials involved actedwith "deliberate indifference" to the inmates' health orsafety. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8 (1992). Wemay infer the existence of this subjective state of mind fromthe fact that the risk of harm is obvious. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 842 (1994).As the facts are alleged by Hope, the Eighth Amendmentviolation is obvious. Any safety concerns had long sinceabated by the time petitioner was handcuffed to the hitchingpost because Hope had already been subdued, handcuffed,placed in leg irons, and transported back to the prison. Hewas separated from his work squad and not given the opportunity to return to work. Despite the clear lack of an emergency situation, the respondents knowingly subjected him toa substantial risk of physical harm, to unnecessary paincaused by the handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a 7-hour period, to unnecessary exposure to theheat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to adeprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.8 The use of the hitchingpost under these circumstances violated the "basic conceptunderlying the Eighth Amendment[, which] is nothing lessthan the dignity of man." Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100(1958). This punitive treatment amounts to gratuitous infliction of "wanton and unnecessary" pain that our precedentclearly prohibits.8 The awareness of the risk of harm attributable to any individual respondent may be evaluated in part by considering the pattern of treatmentthat inmates generally received when attached to the hitching post. InAustin v. Hopper, the District Court cited examples of humiliating incidents resulting from the denial of bathroom breaks. One inmate "was notpermitted to use the restroom or to change his clothing for four and onehalf hours after he had defecated on himself." 15 F. Supp. 2d, at 1246."Moreover, certain corrections officers not only ignored or denied inmates'requests for water or access to toilet facilities, but taunted them whilethey were clearly suffering from dehydration . . . ."

Harlow v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). In assessing whetherthe Eighth Amendment violation here met the Harlow test,the Court of Appeals required that the facts of previouscases be " `materially similar' to Hope's situation." 240F. 3d, at 981. This rigid gloss on the qualified immunitystandard, though supported by Circuit precedent,9 is not consistent with our cases.As we have explained, qualified immunity operates "to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are onnotice their conduct is unlawful."Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.,at 206. For a constitutional right to be clearly established,its contours "must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable of-ficial would understand that what he is doing violates thatright. This is not to say that an official action is protectedby qualified immunity unless the very action in question haspreviously been held unlawful, see Mitchell [v. Forsyth, 472U. S. 511,] 535, n. 12; but it is to say that in the light ofpre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987).Officers sued in a civil action for damages under 42 U. S. C.$ 1983 have the same right to fair notice as do defendantscharged with the criminal offense defined in 18 U. S. C. $ 242.Section 242 makes it a crime for a state official to act "will-fully" and under color of law to deprive a person of rightsprotected by the Constitution. In United States v. Lanier,520 U. S. 259 (1997), we held that the defendant was entitled9 See, e. g., Suissa v. Fulton County, 74 F. 3d 266-270 (CA11 1996); Lassiter v. Alabama A&M Univ.

Id., at 263 (citing UnitedStates v. Lanier, 73 F. 3d 1380, 1393 (CA6 1996)). The Courtof Appeals had assumed that the defendant in a criminal casewas entitled to a degree of notice " `substantially higher thanthe "clearly established" standard used to judge qualified immunity' " in civil cases under $ 1983. 520 U. S., at 263. Wereversed, explaining that the "fair warning" requirement isidentical under $ 242 and the qualified immunity standard.We pointed out that we had "upheld convictions under $ 241or $ 242 despite notable factual distinctions between theprecedents relied on and the cases then before the Court, solong as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that theconduct then at issue violated constitutional rights." Id., at269. We explained:"This is not to say, of course, that the single warningstandard points to a single level of specificity sufficientin every instance.

The fact that one has a civil andthe other a criminal law role is of no significance; both serve the sameobjective, and in effect the qualified immunity test is simply the adaptationof the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments) the same protection from civil liability and its consequences thatindividuals have traditionally possessed in the face of vague criminal statutes. To require something clearer than `clearly established' would, then,call for something beyond `fair warning.' " 520 U. S., at 270-271.536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN741Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)Opinion of the Courtearlier case expressly leaves open whether a generalrule applies to the particular type of conduct at issue, avery high degree of prior factual particularity may benecessary. But general statements of the law are notinherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply withobvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, eventhough `the very action in question has [not] previouslybeen held unlawful,' Anderson, supra, at 640." Id., at270-271 (citation omitted).Our opinion in Lanier thus makes clear that officials canstill be on notice that their conduct violates established laweven in novel factual circumstances. Indeed, inLanier, weexpressly rejected a requirement that previous cases be"fundamentally similar." Although earlier cases involving"fundamentally similar" facts can provide especially strongsupport for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding. The same is trueof cases with "materially similar" facts. Accordingly, pursu-ant toLanier, the salient question that the Court of Appealsought to have asked is whether the state of the law in 1995gave respondents fair warning that their alleged treatmentof Hope was unconstitutional. It is to this question that wenow turn.IVThe use of the hitching post as alleged by Hope "unnecessar[ily] and wanton[ly] inflicted pain," Whitley, 475 U. S., at319 (internal quotation marks omitted), and thus was a clearviolation of the Eighth Amendment. See Part II, supra.Arguably, the violation was so obvious that our own EighthAmendment cases gave respondents fair warning that theirconduct violated the Constitution. Regardless, in light ofbinding Eleventh Circuit precedent, an Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) regulation, and a DOJ report536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN742 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courtinforming the ADOC of the constitutional infirmity in its useof the hitching post, we readily conclude that the respondents' conduct violated "clearly established statutory or con-stitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818.Cases decided by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit today. See Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F. 2d 1206 (CA111981). In one of those cases, decided in 1974, the Court ofAppeals reviewed a District Court decision finding a numberof constitutional violations in the administration of Mississippi's prisons. Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291. That opinionsquarely held that several of those "forms of corporal punishment run afoul of the Eighth Amendment [and] offend contemporary concepts of decency, human dignity, and preceptsof civilization which we profess to possess." Id., at 1306.Among those forms of punishment were "handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time, . . .and forcing inmates to stand, sit or lie on crates, stumps, orotherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods." Ibid. The fact that Gates found several forms ofpunishment impermissible does not, as respondents suggest,lessen the force of its holding with respect to handcuffinginmates to cells or fences for long periods of time. Nor, forthe purpose of providing fair notice to reasonable officersadministering punishment for past misconduct, is there anyreason to draw a constitutional distinction between a practice of handcuffing an inmate to a fence for prolonged periodsand handcuffing him to a hitching post for seven hours. TheCourt of Appeals' conclusion to the contrary exposes the danger of a rigid, overreliance on factual similarity. As theGovernment submits in its brief amicus curiae: "No reasonable officer could have concluded that the constitutional holding of Gates turned on the fact that inmates were handcuffedto fences or the bars of cells, rather than a specially designedmetal bar designated for shackling. If anything, the use of536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN743Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)Opinion of the Courta designated hitching post highlights the constitutional prob-lem." Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 22. Inlight of Gates, the unlawfulness of the alleged conduct shouldhave been apparent to respondents.The reasoning, though not the holding, in a case decidedby the Eleventh Circuit in 1987 sent the same message toreasonable officers in that Circuit. In Ort v. White, 813 F. 2d318, the Court of Appeals held that an officer's temporarydenials of drinking water to an inmate who repeatedly refused to do his share of the work assigned to a farm squad"should not be viewed as punishment in the strict sense, butinstead as necessary coercive measures undertaken to obtaincompliance with a reasonable prison rule, i. e., the requirement that all inmates perform their assigned farm squad duties." Id., at 325. "The officer's clear motive was to encourage Ort to comply with the rules and to do the workrequired of him, after which he would receive the water likeeveryone else." Ibid. The court cautioned, however, thata constitutional violation might have been present "if later,once back at the prison, officials had decided to deny [Ort]water as punishment for his refusal to work." Id., at 326.So too would a violation have occurred if the method of coercion reached a point of severity such that the recalcitrantprisoner's health was at risk. Ibid. Although the facts ofthe case are not identical, Ort's premise is that "physicalabuse directed at [a] prisoner after he terminate[s] his resistance to authority would constitute an actionable eighthamendment violation." Id., at 324. This premise has clearapplicability in this case. Hope was not restrained at theworksite until he was willing to return to work. Rather, hewas removed back to the prison and placed under conditionsthat threatened his health. Ort therefore gave fair warningto respondents that their conduct crossed the line of what isconstitutionally permissible.Relevant to the question whether Ort provided fair warning to respondents that their conduct violated the Constitu536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN744 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courttion is a regulation promulgated by ADOC in 1993.11 Theregulation authorizes the use of the hitching post when aninmate refuses to work or is otherwise disruptive to a worksquad. It provides that an activity log should be completedfor each such inmate, detailing his responses to offers ofwater and bathroom breaks every 15 minutes. Such a logwas completed and maintained for petitioner's shackling inMay, but the record contains no such log for the 7-hourshackling in June and the record indicates that the periodicoffers contemplated by the regulation were not made. App.43-48. The regulation also states that an inmate "will beallowed to join his assigned squad" whenever he tells an officer "that he is ready to go to work." Id., at 103. Thefindings inAustin v. Hopper, 15 F. Supp. 2d 1210, 1244-1246(MD Ala. 1998), as well as the record in this case, indicatethat this important provision of the regulation was fre-quently ignored by corrections officers. If regularly observed, a requirement that would effectively give the inmatethe keys to the handcuffs that attached him to the hitchingpost would have made this case more analogous to the prac-tice upheld inOrt, rather than the kind of punishment Ortdescribed as impermissible. A course of conduct that tendsto prove that the requirement was merely a sham, or thatrespondents could ignore it with impunity, provides equallystrong support for the conclusion that they were fully awareof the wrongful character of their conduct.Respondents violated clearly established law. Our con-clusion that "a reasonable person would have known," Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818, of the violation is buttressed by thefact that the DOJ specifically advised the ADOC of the unconstitutionality of its practices before the incidents in thiscase took place. The DOJ had conducted a study in 1994of Alabama's use of the hitching post. 240 F. 3d, at 979.11 The regulation was not provided to the District Court, but it wasadded to the record at the request of the Court of Appeals. See App.100-106.536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN745Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAmong other findings, the DOJ report noted that ADOC'sofficers consistently failed to comply with the policy ofimmediately releasing any inmate from the hitching postwho agrees to return to work. The DOJ concluded thatthe systematic use of the restraining bar in Alabama consti-tuted improper corporal punishment.Ibid. Accordingly,the DOJ advised the ADOC to cease use of the hitching postin order to meet constitutional standards. The ADOC re-plied that it thought the post could permissibly be used" `to preserve prison security and discipline.' " Ibid. In re-sponse, the DOJ informed the ADOC that, " `[a]lthough anemergency situation may warrant drastic action by corrections staff, our experts found that the "rail" is being usedsystematically as an improper punishment for relatively trivial offenses. Therefore, we have concluded that the useof the "rail" is without penological justification.' " Ibid.Although there is nothing in the record indicating that theDOJ's views were communicated to respondents, this exchange lends support to the view that reasonable officialsin the ADOC should have realized that the use of the hitching post under the circumstances alleged by Hope violatedthe Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.The obvious cruelty inherent in this practice should haveprovided respondents with some notice that their allegedconduct violated Hope's constitutional protection againstcruel and unusual punishment. Hope was treated in a wayantithetical to human dignity--he was hitched to a post foran extended period of time in a position that was painful,and under circumstances that were both degrading and dangerous. This wanton treatment was not done of necessity,but as punishment for prior conduct. Even if there mightonce have been a question regarding the constitutionality ofthis practice, the Eleventh Circuit precedent of Gates andOrt, as well as the DOJ report condemning the practice, puta reasonable officer on notice that the use of the hitching536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN746 HOPE v. PELZEROpinion of the Courtpost under the circumstances alleged by Hope was unlawful.The "fair and clear warning," Lanier, 520 U. S., at 271, thatthese cases provided was sufficient to preclude the defenseof qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage.VIn response to Justice Thomas' thoughtful dissent, wemake the following three observations. The first is that ingranting certiorari to review the summary judgment enteredin favor of the officers, we did not take any question aboutthe sufficiency of pleadings and affidavits to raise a genuinepossibility that the three named officers were responsible forthe punitive acts of shackling alleged. All questions raisedby petitioner (the plaintiff against whom summary judgmentwas entered) go to the application of the standard that noimmunity is available for official acts when "it would be clearto a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in thesituation he confronted."Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 202.The officers' brief in opposition to certiorari likewise addressed only the legal standard of what is clearly established.The resulting focus in the case was the Eleventh Circuit'sposition that a violation is not clearly established unless it isthe subject of a prior case of liability on facts " `materiallysimilar' " to those charged. 240 F. 3d, at 981. We did nottake, and do not pass upon, the questions whether or to whatextent the three named officers may be held responsible forthe acts charged, if proved. Nothing in our decision forecloses any defense other than qualified immunity on theground relied upon by the Court of Appeals.Second, we may address the immunity question on the as-sumption that the act of field discipline charged on each occasion was handcuffing Hope to a hitching post for an extendedperiod apparently to inflict gratuitous pain or discomfort,with no justification in threatened harm or a continuingrefusal to work.Id., at 980 (on neither occasion did Hope"refus[e] to work or encourag[e] other inmates to refuse to536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN747Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)Opinion of the Courtwork"). The Court of Appeals clearly held the act of cuffingpetitioner to the hitching post itself to suffice as an unconstitutional act: "We find that cuffing an inmate to a hitchingpost for a period of time extending past that required toaddress an immediate danger or threat is a violation of theEighth Amendment." Ibid. Although the court continuedthat "[t]his violation is exacerbated by the lack of properclothing, water, or bathroom breaks," ibid., this embellishment was not the basis of its decision, and our own decisionadequately rests on the same assumption that sufficed forthe Court of Appeals.Third, in applying the objective immunity test of what areasonable officer would understand, the significance of federal judicial precedent is a function in part of the Judiciary'sstructure. The unreported District Court opinions cited bythe officers are distinguishable on their own terms.12 Butregardless, they would be no match for the Circuit precedents13 in Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d, at 1306, which held that"handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time" was unconstitutional, and Ort v. White, 813F. 2d, at 326, which suggested that it would be unconstitutional to inflict gratuitous pain on an inmate (by refusinghim water) when punishment was unnecessary to enforce12 In three of the decisions, the inmates were given the choice betweenworking or being restrained.
