Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 170(1985); United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 224 (1967). Theentry of a guilty plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felonycharge, ranks as a "critical stage" at which the right to counsel adheres. Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 34 (1972);White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (1963) (per curiam).Waiver of the right to counsel, as of constitutional rights inthe criminal process generally, must be a "knowing, intelligent ac[t] done with sufficient awareness of the relevant cir-cumstances."Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748(1970). This case concerns the extent to which a trial judge,before accepting a guilty plea from an uncounseled defend-ant, must elaborate on the right to representation.Beyond affording the defendant the opportunity to consultwith counsel prior to entry of a plea and to be assisted bycounsel at the plea hearing, must the court, specifically:(1) advise the defendant that "waiving the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty [entails] the risk thata viable defense will be overlooked"; and (2) "admonis[h]"the defendant "that by waiving his right to an attorney hewill lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinionon whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise toplead guilty"? 656 N. W. 2d 112, 121 (Iowa 2003). TheIowa Supreme Court held both warnings essential to the"knowing and intelligent" waiver of the Sixth Amendmentright to the assistance of counsel. Ibid.We hold that neither warning is mandated by the SixthAmendment. The constitutional requirement is satisfiedwhen the trial court informs the accused of the nature of thecharges against him, of his right to be counseled regardinghis plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendantupon the entry of a guilty plea.IOn November 2, 1996, respondent Felipe Edgardo Tovar,then a 21-year-old college student, was arrested in Ames,541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN82 IOWA v.

See Iowa Code $ 321J.2 (1995).1 An intoxilyzer test administered the night of Tovar's arrestshowed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.194. App. 24. Thearresting officer informed Tovar of his rights under Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Tovar signed a form stating that he waived those rights and agreed to answer ques-tions.

Dept. of Public Safety, Rights Warnings (Nov. 2,1996), Lodging of Petitioner.Some hours after his arrest, Tovar appeared before ajudge in the Iowa District Court for Story County. Thejudge indicated on the initial appearance form that Tovarappeared without counsel and waived application for court-appointed counsel.

The judge alsomarked on the form's checklist that Tovar was "informed ofthe charge and his . . . rights and receive[d] a copy of theComplaint." Ibid. Arraignment was set for November 18,1996. In the interim, Tovar was released from jail.At the November 18 arraignment,2 the court's inquiries ofTovar began: "Mr. Tovar appears without counsel and I see,Mr. Tovar, that you waived application for a court appointedattorney. Did you want to represent yourself at today'shearing?" App. 8-9. Tovar replied: "Yes, sir." Id., at 9.The court soon after asked: "[H]ow did you wish to plead?"Tovar answered: "Guilty." Ibid. Tovar affirmed that he1 "A person commits the offense of operating while intoxicated if theperson operates a motor vehicle in this state in either of the following conditions: a. While under the influence of an alcoholic beverage . . . .b. While having an alcohol concentration . . . of .10 or more."

Proc. 8(1992),3 the court explained that, if Tovar pleaded not guilty,he would be entitled to a speedy and public trial by jury,App. 15, and would have the right to be represented at thattrial by an attorney, who "could help [Tovar] select a jury,question and cross-examine the State's witnesses, presentevidence, if any, in [his] behalf, and make arguments to thejudge and jury on [his] behalf,"id., at 16. By pleadingguilty, the court cautioned, "not only [would Tovar] give up[his] right to a trial [of any kind on the charge against him],[he would] give up [his] right to be represented by an attor-ney at that trial."Ibid. The court further advised Tovarthat, if he entered a guilty plea, he would relinquish the rightto remain silent at trial, the right to the presumption of innocence, and the right to subpoena witnesses and compel theirtestimony. Id., at 16-19.Turning to the particular offense with which Tovar hadbeen charged, the court informed him that an OWI conviction carried a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000fine, and a minimum penalty of two days in jail and a $500fine. Id., at 20. Tovar affirmed that he understood his exposure to those penalties. Ibid. The court next explainedthat, before accepting a guilty plea, the court had to assureitself that Tovar was in fact guilty of the charged offense.Id., at 21-22. To that end, the court informed Tovar thatthe OWI charge had only two elements: first, on the date inquestion, Tovar was operating a motor vehicle in the Stateof Iowa; second, when he did so, he was intoxicated.

Tovar confirmed that he had been driving in Ames,Iowa, on the night he was apprehended and that he did notdispute the results of the intoxilyzer test administered by3 The Rule has since been renumbered 2.8.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN84 IOWA v.

Id., at23-24.After the plea colloquy, the court asked Tovar if he stillwished to plead guilty, and Tovar affirmed that he did. Id.,at 27-28. The court then accepted Tovar's plea, observingthat there was "a factual basis" for it, and that Tovar hadmade the plea "voluntarily, with a full understanding of [his]rights, [and] . . . of the consequences of [pleading guilty]."Id., at 28.On December 30, 1996, Tovar appeared for sentencing onthe OWI charge 4 and, simultaneously, for arraignment on asubsequent charge of driving with a suspended license. Id.,at 45-46; see Iowa Code $ 321J.21 (1995).5 Noting thatTovar was again in attendance without counsel, the courtinquired: "Mr. Tovar, did you want to represent yourself attoday's hearing or did you want to take some time to hire anattorney to represent you?" App. 46.6 Tovar replied thathe would represent himself. Ibid. The court then engagedin essentially the same plea colloquy on the suspensioncharge as it had on the OWI charge the previous month.Id., at 48-51. After accepting Tovar's guilty plea on thesuspension charge, the court sentenced him on both counts:For the OWI conviction, the court imposed the minimum sentence of two days in jail and a $500 fine, plus a surcharge and4 At that stage, it was still open to Tovar to request withdrawal of hisguilty plea on the OWI charge and to substitute a plea of not guilty. SeeIowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992).5 In order to appear at the OWI arraignment, Tovar drove to the courthouse despite the suspension of his license; he was apprehended en routehome. App. 50, 53.6 Prior to asking Tovar whether he wished to hire counsel, the courtnoted that Tovar had applied for a court-appointed attorney but that hisapplication had been denied because he was financially dependent upon hisparents. Id., at 46. Tovar does not here challenge the absence of counselat sentencing.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN85Cite as: 541 U.

Id., at 55.On March 16, 1998, Tovar was convicted of OWI for a second time. He was represented by counsel in that proceeding, in which he pleaded guilty. Record 60; see App. to Pet.for Cert. 24, n. 1.On December 14, 2000, Tovar was again charged withOWI, this time as a third offense, see Iowa Code $ 321J.2(1999), and additionally with driving while license barred,see $ 321.561. Iowa law classifies first-offense OWI as aserious misdemeanor and second-offense OWI as an aggravated misdemeanor. $$ 321J.2(2)(a)-(b). Third-offenseOWI, and any OWI offenses thereafter, rank as class "D"felonies. $ 321J.2(2)(c). Represented by an attorney, Tovarpleaded not guilty to both December 2000 charges. Record55.In March 2001, through counsel, Tovar filed a motion foradjudication of law points; 7 the motion urged that Tovar'sfirst OWI conviction, in 1996, could not be used to enhancethe December 2000 OWI charge from a second-offense aggravated misdemeanor to a third-offense felony. App. 3-5.8Significantly, Tovar did not allege that he was unaware atthe November 1996 arraignment of his right to counsel priorto pleading guilty and at the plea hearing. Instead, hemaintained that his 1996 waiver of counsel was invalid--not"full knowing, intelligent, and voluntary"--because he "wasnever made aware by the court . . . of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation." Id., at 3-4.7 See Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 10(2) (1992) ("Any defense, objection, orrequest which is capable of determination without the trial of the generalissue may be raised before trial by motion."); State v. Wilt, 333 N. W. 2d457, 460 (Iowa 1983) (approving use of motions for adjudication of lawpoints under Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 10(2) where material factsare undisputed).8 Tovar conceded that the 1998 OWI conviction could be used for enhancement purposes. Record 60.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN86 IOWA v. TOVAROpinion of the CourtThe court denied Tovar's motion in May 2001, explaining:"Where the offense is readily understood by laypersons andthe penalty is not unduly severe, the duty of inquiry whichis imposed upon the court is only that which is required toassure an awareness of [the] right to counsel and a willing-ness to proceed without counsel in the face of such awareness." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36-37 (brackets in original).Tovar then waived his right to a jury trial and was foundguilty by the court of both the OWI third-offense charge anddriving while license barred.Id., at 33. Four months afterthat adjudication, Tovar was sentenced. On the OWI thirdoffense charge, he received a 180-day jail term, with all but30 days suspended, three years of probation, and a $2,500 fineplus surcharges and costs. App. 70-71. For driving whilelicense barred, Tovar received a 30-day jail term, to run concurrently with the OWI sentence, and a suspended $500 fine.Id., at 71.The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed, App. to Pet. for Cert.23-30, but the Supreme Court of Iowa, by a 4-to-3 vote, reversed and remanded for entry of judgment without consid-eration of Tovar's first OWI conviction, 656 N. W. 2d 112(2003). Iowa's highest court acknowledged that "the dan-gers of proceeding pro se at a guilty plea proceeding will bedifferent than the dangers of proceeding pro se at a jurytrial, [therefore] the inquiries made at these proceedings willalso be different." Id., at 119. The court nonetheless heldthat the colloquy preceding acceptance of Tovar's 1996 guiltyplea had been constitutionally inadequate, and instructeddispositively:"[A] defendant such as Tovar who chooses to plead guiltywithout the assistance of an attorney must be advisedof the usefulness of an attorney and the dangers of self-representation in order to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. . . . [T]he trial judge[must] advise the defendant generally that there aredefenses to criminal charges that may not be known by541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN87Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)Opinion of the Courtlaypersons and that the danger in waiving the assistanceof counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the riskthat a viable defense will be overlooked. The defendantshould be admonished that by waiving his right to anattorney he will lose the opportunity to obtain an inde-pendent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty. In addition, the courtmust ensure the defendant understands the nature ofthe charges against him and the range of allowable pun-ishments."Id., at 121.9We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. 987 (2003), in view of thedivision of opinion on the requirements the Sixth Amendment imposes for waiver of counsel at a plea hearing, com-pare,e. g., United States v. Akins, 276 F. 3d 1141, 1146-1147(CA9 2002), with State v. Cashman, 491 N. W. 2d 462, 465-466 (S. D. 1992), and we now reverse the judgment of theIowa Supreme Court.IIThe Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant who facesincarceration the right to counsel at all "critical stages" ofthe criminal process. See, e. g., Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S.,at 170;United States v. Wade, 388 U. S., at 224. A plea hear-ing qualifies as a "critical stage." White v. Maryland, 373U. S., at 60. Because Tovar received a two-day prison termfor his 1996 OWI conviction, he had a right to counsel bothat the plea stage and at trial had he elected to contest thecharge.Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S., at 34, 37.A person accused of crime, however, may choose to forgorepresentation. While the Constitution "does not force a9 The dissenting justices criticized the majority's approach as "rigid" andout of line with the pragmatic approach this Court described in Pattersonv. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 298 (1988). 656 N. W. 2d, at 122. They notedthat, in addition to advice concerning the constitutional rights a guiltyplea relinquishes, Tovar was "made fully aware of the penal consequencesthat might befall him if he went forward without counsel and pleadedguilty." Ibid.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN88 IOWA v. TOVAROpinion of the Courtlawyer upon a defendant," Adams v. United States ex rel.McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942), it does require that anywaiver of the right to counsel be knowing, voluntary, andintelligent, seeJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).Tovar contends that his waiver of counsel in November 1996,at his first OWI plea hearing, was insufficiently informed,and therefore constitutionally invalid. In particular, heasserts that the trial judge did not elaborate on the value,at that stage of the case, of an attorney's advice and thedangers of self-representation in entering a plea. Brief forRespondent 15.10We have described a waiver of counsel as intelligent whenthe defendant "knows what he is doing and his choice is madewith eyes open." Adams, 317 U. S., at 279. We have not,however, prescribed any formula or script to be read to adefendant who states that he elects to proceed without coun-sel. The information a defendant must possess in order tomake an intelligent election, our decisions indicate, willdepend on a range of case-specific factors, including the defendant's education or sophistication, the complex or easilygrasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding. See Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464.As to waiver of trial counsel, we have said that before adefendant may be allowed to proceed pro se, he must be10 The United States as amicus curiae reads our decision in Scott v.Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), to hold that a constitutionally defectivewaiver of counsel in a misdemeanor prosecution, although warrantingvacation of any term of imprisonment, affords no ground for disturbingthe underlying conviction. Amicus accordingly contends that the Constitution should not preclude use of an uncounseled misdemeanor convictionto enhance the penalty for a subsequent offense, regardless of the validityof the prior waiver. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11,n. 3. The State, however, does not contest the Iowa Supreme Court'sdetermination that a conviction obtained without an effective waiver ofcounsel cannot be used to enhance a subsequent charge. See ibid. Wetherefore do not address arguments amicus advances questioning thatpremise. See also id., at 29, n. 12.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN89Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)Opinion of the Courtwarned specifically of the hazards ahead. Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975), is instructive. The defendantin Faretta resisted counsel's aid, preferring to represent him-self. The Court held that he had a constitutional rightto self-representation. In recognizing that right, however,we cautioned: "Although a defendant need not himself havethe skill and experience of a lawyer in order competentlyand intelligently to choose self-representation, he should bemade aware of the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation, so that the record will establish that heknows what he is doing . . . ."Id., at 835 (internal quotationmarks omitted).Later, in Pat terson v. Ill ino is, 487 U. S. 285 (1988),we elaborated on "the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation" to which Faretta referred. "[A]t trial," weobserved, "counsel is required to help even the most giftedlayman adhere to the rules of procedure and evidence, comprehend the subtleties of voir dire, examine and crossexamine witnesses effectively . . . , object to improper prosecution questions, and much more." 487 U. S., at 299, n. 13.Warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel, we therefore said, must be "rigorous[ly]" conveyed. Id.,at 298. We clarified, however, that at earlier stages of thecriminal process, a less searching or formal colloquy may suffice. Id., at 299.Patterson concerned postindictment questioning by policeand prosecutor. At that stage of the case, we held, thewarnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436(1966), adequately informed the defendant not only of hisFifth Amendment rights, but of his Sixth Amendment rightto counsel as well. 487 U. S., at 293. Miranda warnings,we said, effectively convey to a defendant his right to havecounsel present during questioning. In addition, they inform him of the "ultimate adverse consequence" of makinguncounseled admissions, i. e., his statements may be usedagainst him in any ensuing criminal proceeding. 487 U. S.,541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN90 IOWA v. TOVAROpinion of the Courtat 293. The Miranda warnings, we added, "also sufficed . . .to let [the defendant] know what a lawyer could `do for him,' "namely, advise him to refrain from making statements thatcould prove damaging to his defense. 487 U. S., at 294.Patterson describes a "pragmatic approach to the waiverquestion," one that asks "what purposes a lawyer can serveat the particular stage of the proceedings in question, andwhat assistance he could provide to an accused at thatstage," in order "to determine the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the type of warnings and procedures that should be required before a waiver of that rightwill be recognized." Id., at 298. We require less rigorouswarnings pretrial, Patterson explained, not because pretrialproceedings are "less important" than trial, but because,at that stage, "the full dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation . . . are less substantial and more obvious toan accused than they are at trial." Id., at 299 (citation andinternal quotation marks omitted).In Tovar's case, the State maintains that, like the Mirandawarnings we found adequate in Patterson, Iowa's plea colloquy suffices both to advise a defendant of his right to counsel,and to assure that his guilty plea is informed and voluntary.Brief for Petitioner 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3. The plea colloquy,according to the State, "makes plain that an attorney's rolewould be to challenge the charge or sentence," and thereforeadequately conveys to the defendant both the utility of counsel and the dangers of self-representation. Brief for Petitioner 25. Tovar, on the other hand, defends the preciseinstructions required by the Iowa Supreme Court, see supra,at 86-87, as essential to a knowing, voluntary, and intelligentplea stage waiver of counsel. Brief for Respondent 15.To resolve this case, we need not endorse the State's position that nothing more than the plea colloquy was needed tosafeguard Tovar's right to counsel. Preliminarily, we notethat there were some things more in this case. Tovar first541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN91Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)Opinion of the Courtindicated that he waived counsel at his initial appearance, seesupra, at 82, affirmed that he wanted to represent himself atthe plea hearing, see supra, at 82, and declined the court'soffer of "time to hire an attorney" at sentencing, when it wasstill open to him to request withdrawal of his plea, see supra,at 84, and n. 4. Further, the State does not contest that adefendant must be alerted to his right to the assistance ofcounsel in entering a plea. See Brief for Petitioner 19 (acknowledging defendant's need to know "retained or appointed counsel can assist" at the plea stage by "work[ing]on the issues of guilt and sentencing"). Indeed, the IowaSupreme Court appeared to assume that Tovar was informedof his entitlement to counsel's aid or, at least, to have pretermitted that issue. See 656 N. W. 2d, at 117. Accordingly,the State presents a narrower question: "Does the SixthAmendment require a court to give a rigid and detailedadmonishment to a pro se defendant pleading guilty of theusefulness of an attorney, that an attorney may provide anindependent opinion whether it is wise to plead guilty andthat without an attorney the defendant risks overlooking adefense?" Pet. for Cert. i.Training on that question, we turn to, and reiterate, theparticular language the Iowa Supreme Court employed inannouncing the warnings it thought the Sixth Amendmentrequired: "[T]he trial judge [must] advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that maynot be known by laypersons and that the danger in waivingthe assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guiltyis the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked," 656N. W. 2d, at 121; in addition, "[t]he defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney he willlose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion onwhether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise toplead guilty," ibid. Tovar did not receive such advice, andthe sole question before us is whether the Sixth Amendment541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 IOWA v. TOVAROpinion of the Courtcompels the two admonitions here in controversy.11 We holdit does not.This Court recently explained, in reversing a lower courtdetermination that a guilty plea was not voluntary: "[T]helaw ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, andsufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in generalin the circumstances--even though the defendant may notknow the specific detailed consequences of invoking it."United States v. Ruiz, 536 U. S. 622, 629 (2002) (emphasisin original). We similarly observed in Patterson: "If [thedefendant] . . . lacked a full and complete appreciation of allof the consequences flowing from his waiver, it does not defeat the State's showing that the information it provided tohim satisfied the constitutional minimum." 487 U. S., at 294(internal quotation marks omitted). The Iowa SupremeCourt gave insufficient consideration to these guiding decisions. In prescribing scripted admonitions and holdingthem necessary in every guilty plea instance, we furthernote, the Iowa high court overlooked our observations thatthe information a defendant must have to waive counsel intelligently will "depend, in each case, upon the particularfacts and circumstances surrounding that case,"Johnson, 304U. S., at 464; supra, at 88.Moreover, as Tovar acknowledges, in a collateral attack onan uncounseled conviction, it is the defendant's burden toprove that he did not competently and intelligently waive hisright to the assistance of counsel. See Watts v. State, 257N. W. 2d 70, 71 (Iowa 1977); Brief for Respondent 5, 26-27.In that light, we note that Tovar has never claimed that hedid not fully understand the charge or the range of punish-ment for the crime prior to pleading guilty. Further, he has11 The Supreme Court of Iowa also held that "the court must ensure thedefendant understands the nature of the charges against him and therange of allowable punishments." 656 N. W. 2d, at 121. The parties donot dispute that Tovar was so informed.541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN93Cite as: 541 U. S. 77 (2004)Opinion of the Courtnever "articulate[d] with precision" the additional information counsel could have provided, given the simplicity of thecharge. See Patterson, 487 U. S., at 294; supra, at 83. Nordoes he assert that he was unaware of his right to be counseled prior to and at his arraignment. Before this Court, hesuggests only that he "may have been under the mistakenbelief that he had a right to counsel at trial, but not if hewas merely going to plead guilty." Brief for Respondent 16(emphasis added).12Given "the particular facts and circumstances surrounding[this] case," see Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464, it is far from clearthat warnings of the kind required by the Iowa SupremeCourt would have enlightened Tovar's decision whether toseek counsel or to represent himself. In a case so straightforward, the United States as amicus curiae suggests, theadmonitions at issue might confuse or mislead a defendantmore than they would inform him: The warnings the IowaSupreme Court declared mandatory might be misconstruedas a veiled suggestion that a meritorious defense exists orthat the defendant could plead to a lesser charge, when neither prospect is a realistic one. If a defendant delays hisplea in the vain hope that counsel could uncover a tenablebasis for contesting or reducing the criminal charge, theprompt disposition of the case will be impeded, and theresources of either the State (if the defendant is indigent)or the defendant himself (if he is financially ineligible forappointed counsel) will be wasted. Brief for United Statesas Amicus Curiae 9, 28-29; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21.12 The trial court's comment that Tovar appeared without counsel at thearraignment and the court's inquiry whether Tovar wanted to representhimself at that hearing, see App. 8-9, hardly lend support to Tovar's suggestion of what he "may have" believed. See also id., at 46 (court's inquiry at sentencing whether Tovar "want[ed] to take some time to hirean attorney"); Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992) ("[a]t any time beforejudgment," defendant may request withdrawal of guilty plea and substitution of not guilty plea).541US1 Unit: $U30 [05-08-06 13:44:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 IOWA v. TOVAROpinion of the CourtWe note, finally, that States are free to adopt by statute,rule, or decision any guides to the acceptance of an uncounseled plea they deem useful. See, e. g., Alaska Rule Crim.Proc. 39(a) (2003); Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.111(d) (2003); Md.Ct. Rule 4-215 (2002); Minn. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.02 (2003);Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 121, comment (2003). We hold onlythat the two admonitions the Iowa Supreme Court orderedare not required by the Federal Constitution.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the SupremeCourt of Iowa is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
