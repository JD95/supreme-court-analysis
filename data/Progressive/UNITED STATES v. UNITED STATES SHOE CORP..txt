Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5. We held in United States v.International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843 (1996)(IBM), that the Export Clause categorically bars Congressfrom imposing any tax on exports. The Clause, however,does not rule out a "user fee," provided that the fee lacksthe attributes of a generally applicable tax or duty and is,instead, a charge designed as compensation for Government-supplied services, facilities, or benefits. SeePace v. Bur-gess, 92 U. S. 372, 375-376 (1876). This case presents thequestion whether the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT), 26U. S. C. $ 4461(a), as applied to goods loaded at United Statesports for export, is an impermissible tax on exports or, in-stead, a legitimate user fee. We hold, in accord with theFederal Circuit, that the tax, which is imposed on an ad valo-rem basis, is not a fair approximation of services, facilities,or benefits furnished to the exporters, and therefore does notqualify as a permissible user fee.IThe HMT, enacted as part of the Water Resources Devel-opment Act of 1986, 26 U. S. C. $$ 4461-4462, imposes a uniform charge on shipments of commercial cargo through theNation's ports. The charge is currently set at 0.125 percentof the cargo's value. Exporters, importers, and domesticshippers are liable for the HMT, $ 4461(c)(1), which is imposed at the time of loading for exports and unloading forother shipments, $ 4461(c)(2). The HMT is collected by theCustoms Service and deposited in the Harbor MaintenanceTrust Fund (Fund). Congress may appropriate amountsfrom the Fund to pay for harbor maintenance and develop-ment projects, including costs associated with the St. Lawrence Seaway, or related expenses. $ 9505.Respondent United States Shoe Corporation (U. S. Shoe)paid the HMT for articles the company exported during theperiod April to June 1994 and then filed a protest with theCustoms Service alleging the unconstitutionality of the toll523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES SHOE CORP.Opinion of the Courtto the extent it applies to exports. The Customs Serviceresponded with a form letter stating that the HMT is a statutorily mandated fee assessment on port users, not an unconstitutional tax on exports. On November 3, 1994, U. S. Shoebrought this action against the Government in the Court ofInternational Trade (CIT). The company sought a refundon the ground that the HMT is unconstitutional as appliedto exports.Sitting as a three-judge court, the CIT held that its jurisdiction was properly invoked under 28 U. S. C. $ 1581(i); onthe merits, the CIT agreed with U. S. Shoe that the HMTqualifies as a tax. 907 F. Supp. 408 (1995). Rejecting theGovernment's characterization of the HMT as a user feerather than a tax, the CIT reasoned: "The Tax is assessedad valorem directly upon the value of the cargo itself, notupon any services rendered for the cargo . . . . Congresscould not have imposed the Tax any closer to exportation,or more immediate to the articles exported." Id., at 418.Relying on the Export Clause, the CIT entered summaryjudgment for U. S. Shoe.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting as afive-judge panel, affirmed. 114 F. 3d 1564 (1997). On auxiliary questions, the Federal Circuit upheld the CIT's exerciseof jurisdiction under $ 1581(i) and agreed with the lowercourt that the HMT applied to goods in export transit.1Concluding that the HMT is not based on a fair approximation of port use, the Federal Circuit also agreed that theHMT imposes a tax, not a user fee. In making this determination, the Court of Appeals emphasized that the HMT doesnot depend on the amount or manner of port use, but is determined solely by the value of cargo. Judge Mayer dissented; in his view, Congress properly designed the HMT asa user fee, a toll on shippers that supplies funds not for the1 The Government does not here challenge the determination that theHMT applies to goods in export transit.523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN365Cite as: 523 U. S. 360 (1998)Opinion of the Courtgeneral support of government, but exclusively for the facilitation of commercial navigation.Numerous cases challenging the constitutionality of theHMT as applied to exports are currently pending in the CITand the Court of Federal Claims.2 We granted certiorari,522 U. S. 944 (1997), to review the Federal Circuit's determination that the HMT violates the Export Clause.IIAs an initial matter, we conclude that the CIT properlyentertained jurisdiction in this case. The complaint allegedexclusive original jurisdiction in that tribunal under 28U. S. C. $ 1581(a) or, alternatively, $ 1581(i). App. 26. Weagree with the CIT and the Federal Circuit that $ 1581(i) isthe applicable jurisdictional prescription. The key directiveis stated in 26 U. S. C. $ 4462(f)(2), which instructs that forjurisdictional purposes, the HMT "shall be treated as if suchtax were a customs duty."Section 1581(a) surely concerns customs duties. It confers exclusive original jurisdiction on the CIT in "any civilaction commenced to contest the [Customs Service's] denialof a protest." A protest, as indicated in 19 U. S. C. $ 1514,is an essential prerequisite when one challenges an actualCustoms decision. As to the HMT, however, the FederalCircuit correctly noted that protests are not pivotal, for Customs "performs no active role," it undertakes "no analysis[or adjudication]," "issues no directives," "imposes no liabilities"; instead, Customs "merely passively collects" HMT payments. 114 F. 3d, at 1569.Section 1581(i) describes the CIT's residual jurisdictionover2 According to the Government, some 4,000 cases raising this claim arecurrently stayed in the CIT, with more than 100 additional cases stayedin the Court of Federal Claims. See Brief for United States 4.523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES SHOE CORP.Opinion of the Court"any civil action commenced against the United States. . . that arises out of any law of the United States providing for --"(1) revenue from imports or tonnage;. . . . ."(4) administration and enforcement with respect tothe matters referred to in paragraphs (1)-(3) of thissubsection . . . ."This dispute, as the Federal Circuit stated, "involve[s] the`administration and enforcement' of a law providing for revenue from imports because the HMT statute, although appliedto exports here, does apply equally to imports." 114 F. 3d,at 1571. True, $ 1581(i) does not use the word "exports."But that is hardly surprising in view of the Export Clause,which confines customs duties to imports. Revenue fromimports and revenue from customs duties are thus synonymous in this setting. In short, as the CIT correctly con-cluded and the Federal Circuit correctly affirmed, "Congress[in $ 4462(f)(2)] directed [that] the [HMT] be treated as a cus-toms duty for purposes of jurisdiction. Such duties, by theirvery nature, provide for revenue from imports, and are en-compassed within [$ ]1581(i)(1)." 907 F. Supp., at 421. Accordingly, CIT jurisdiction over controversies regarding theadministration and enforcement of the HMT accords with$ 1581(i)(4).3 IIITwo Terms ago, in IBM, this Court considered the ques-tion whether a tax on insurance premiums paid to protect3 Because we determine that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction overchallenges to the HMT under $ 1581(i)(4), it follows that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over the challenges to the HMT currentlypending there. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(b). The plaintiffs in these challenges may invoke $ 1631, which authorizes intercourt transfers, when "inthe interest of justice," to cure want of jurisdiction. See also $ 610 (asused in Title 28, the term "court" includes the Court of Federal Claimsand the CIT).523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN367Cite as: 523 U. S. 360 (1998)Opinion of the Courtexports against loss violated the Export Clause. Distin-guishing case law developed under the Commerce Clause,517 U. S., at 850-852, and the Import-Export Clause, id., at857-861, the Court held that the Export Clause allows noroom for any federal tax, however generally applicable ornondiscriminatory, on goods in export transit. Before thisCourt's decision inIBM, the Government argued that theHMT, even if characterized as a "tax" rather than a "userfee," should survive constitutional review "because it applieswithout discrimination to exports, imports and domesticcommerce alike." Reply Brief for United States 9, n. 2.Recognizing that IBM "rejected an indistinguishable contention," the Government now asserts only that HMT is " `apermissible user fee,' " Reply Brief for United States 9,n. 2, a toll within the tolerance of Export Clause precedent.Adhering to the Court's reasoning in IBM, we reject theGovernment's current position.The HMT bears the indicia of a tax. Congress expresslydescribed it as "a tax on any port use," 26 U. S. C. $ 4461(a)(emphasis added), and codified the HMT as part of the Internal Revenue Code. In like vein, Congress provided that, foradministrative, enforcement, and jurisdictional purposes, theHMT should be treated "as if [it] were a customs duty."$$ 4462(f )(1), (2). However, "we must regard things ratherthan names," Pace v. Burgess, 92 U. S., at 376, in determiningwhether an imposition on exports ranks as a tax. The crucial question is whether the HMT is a tax on exports in operation as well as nomenclature or whether, despite the labelCongress has put on it, the exaction is instead a bona fideuser fee.In arguing that the HMT constitutes a user fee, the Government relies on our decisions in United States v. SperryCorp., 493 U. S. 52 (1989), Massachusetts v. United States,435 U. S. 444 (1978), and Evansville-Vanderburgh AirportAuthority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972).In those cases, this Court upheld flat and ad valorem charges523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES SHOE CORP.Opinion of the Courtas valid user fees. See United States v. Sperry Corp., 493U. S., at 62 (11/2 percent ad valorem fee applied to awardscertified by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal qualifiesas a user fee and is not so excessive as to violate the TakingsClause); Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S., at 463-467 (flat federal registration fee imposed annually on all civilaircraft meets genuine user fee standards and, as applied tostate-owned aircraft, does not dishonor State's immunityfrom federal taxation);Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority, 405 U. S., at 717-721 (flat charge for each passengerenplaning, levied for the maintenance of State's airport facilities, does not run afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause).Those decisions involved constitutional provisions other thanthe Export Clause, however, and thus do not govern here.IBM plainly stated that the Export Clause's simple, direct,unqualified prohibition on any taxes or duties distinguishes itfrom other constitutional limitations on governmental taxingauthority. The Court there emphasized that the "text of theExport Clause . . . expressly prohibits Congress from layingany tax or duty on exports." 517 U. S., at 852; see also id.,at 861 ("[T]he Framers sought to alleviate . . . concerns [thatNorthern States would tax exports to the disadvantage ofSouthern States] by completely denying to Congress thepower to tax exports at all."). Accordingly, the Court reasoned in IBM, "[o]ur decades-long struggle over the meaningof the nontextual negative command of the dormant Commerce Clause does not lead to the conclusion that our interpretation of the textual command of the Export Clause isequally fluid." Id., at 851; see also id., at 857 ("We havegood reason to hesitate before adopting the analysis of ourrecent Import-Export Clause cases into our Export Clausejurisprudence. . . . [M]eaningful textual differences exist [between the two Clauses] and should not be overlooked."). InSperry, moreover, we noted that the Takings Clause imposesfewer constraints on user fees than does the dormant Commerce Clause. See 493 U. S., at 61, n. 7 (analysis under Tak523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 523 U. S. 360 (1998)Opinion of the Courtings Clause is less "exacting" than under the dormant Com-merce Clause).A fortiori, therefore, the Takings Clause isless restrictive than the Export Clause.The guiding precedent for determining what constitutes abona fide user fee in the Export Clause context remains ourtime-tested decision in Pace. Pace involved a federal excisetax on tobacco. Congress provided that the tax would notapply to tobacco intended for export. To prevent fraud,however, Congress required that tobacco the manufacturerplanned to export carry a stamp indicating that intention.Each stamp cost 25 cents (later 10 cents) per package of tobacco. Congress did not limit the quantity or value of thetobacco packaged for export or the size of the stamped package; "[t]hese were unlimited, except by the discretion of theexporter or the convenience of handling." 92 U. S., at 375.The Court upheld the charge, concluding that it was "in nosense a duty on exportation," but rather "compensationgiven for services [in fact] rendered." Ibid. In so ruling,the Court emphasized two characteristics of the charge: It"bore no proportion whatever to the quantity or value of thepackage on which [the stamp] was affixed"; and the fee wasnot excessive, taking into account the cost of arrangementsneeded both "to give to the exporter the benefit of exemption from taxation, and . . . to secure . . . against the perpetration of fraud." Ibid.Pace establishes that, under the Export Clause, the connection between a service the Government renders and thecompensation it receives for that service must be closer thanis present here. Unlike the stamp charge in Pace, the HMTis determined entirely on an ad valorem basis. The value ofexport cargo, however, does not correlate reliably with thefederal harbor services used or usable by the exporter. Asthe Federal Circuit noted, the extent and manner of port usedepend on factors such as the size and tonnage of a vessel,the length of time it spends in port, and the services it requires, for instance, harbor dredging. See 114 F. 3d, at 1572.523US1 Unit: $U48 [04-29-00 21:12:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 UNITED STATES v. UNITED STATES SHOE CORP.Opinion of the CourtIn sum, if we are "to guard against . . . the imposition ofa [tax] under the pretext of fixing a fee," Pace v. Burgess, 92U. S., at 376, and resist erosion of the Court's decision inIBM, we must hold that the HMT violates the Export Clauseas applied to exports. This does not mean that exportersare exempt from any and all user fees designed to defray thecost of harbor development and maintenance. It does mean,however, that such a fee must fairly match the exporters'use of port services and facilities.* * *For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit is
