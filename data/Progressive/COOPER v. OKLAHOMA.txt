In Oklahoma the defendant in a criminal prosecution ispresumed to be competent to stand trial unless he proves hisincompetence by clear and convincing evidence. Okla. Stat.,Tit. 22, $ 1175.4(B) (1991). Under that standard a defendantmay be put to trial even though it is more likely than notthat he is incompetent. The question we address in thiscase is whether the application of that standard to petitionerviolated his right to due process under the FourteenthAmendment.IIn 1989 petitioner was charged with the brutal killing ofan 86-year-old man in the course of a burglary. After anOklahoma jury found him guilty of first-degree murder andrecommended punishment by death, the trial court imposedthe death penalty. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.Petitioner's competence was the focus of significant attention both before and during his trial. On five separate occasions a judge considered whether petitioner had the abilityto understand the charges against him and to assist defensecounsel. On the first occasion, a pretrial judge relied on theopinion of a clinical psychologist employed by the State tofind petitioner incompetent. Based on that determination,he committed petitioner to a state mental health facility fortreatment.Assistant Attorney General, and Carol Clawson, Solicitor General, JohnM.

S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the CourtUpon petitioner's release from the hospital some threemonths later, the trial judge heard testimony concerningpetitioner's competence from two state-employed psycholo-gists. These experts expressed conflicting opinions regarding petitioner's ability to participate in his defense. Thejudge resolved the dispute against petitioner, ordering himto proceed to trial.At the close of a pretrial hearing held one week before thetrial was scheduled to begin, the lead defense attorney raisedthe issue of petitioner's competence for a third time. Counsel advised the court that petitioner was behaving oddly andrefusing to communicate with him. Defense counsel opinedthat it would be a serious matter "if he's not faking." App.6. After listening to counsel's concerns, however, the judgedeclined to revisit his earlier determination that petitionerwas competent to stand trial.Petitioner's competence was addressed a fourth time onthe first day of trial, when petitioner's bizarre behaviorprompted the court to conduct a further competency hearingat which the judge observed petitioner and heard testimonyfrom several lay witnesses, a third psychologist, and peti-tioner himself.1 The expert concluded that petitioner was1 During the hearing petitioner, who had refused to change out of prisonoveralls for the trial because the proffered clothes were "burning" him,Tr. of Pretrial Motions and Competency Hearings 3-4 (May 4-5, 1992),talked to himself and to an imaginary "spirit" who petitioner claimed gavehim counsel. On the witness stand petitioner expressed fear that the leaddefense attorney wanted to kill him.In his argument at the close of the proceeding, defense counsel remindedthe court of an incident that occurred during petitioner's testimony:"Every time I would get close to his space where he is seated in thislittle witness enclave . . . he would stand up and he would get away fromme as far as he could and so I would back off and I'd give him a littlespace. . . . So, I've approached him from every side. . . . except I haven'tapproached him from the front. So yesterday, I approach him from thefront. And that's the last thing I did.

While stating thathe did not dispute the psychologist's diagnosis, the trialjudge ruled against petitioner. In so holding, however, thecourt voiced uncertainty:"Well, I think I've used the expression . . . in the pastthat normal is like us.

S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIncidents that occurred during the trial,2 as well as thesordid history of petitioner's childhood that was recountedduring the sentencing phase of the proceeding, were consistent with the conclusions expressed by the expert. In a finaleffort to protect his client's interests, defense counsel movedfor a mistrial or a renewed investigation into petitioner'scompetence. After the court summarily denied these motions, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death.In the Court of Criminal Appeals, petitioner contendedthat Oklahoma's presumption of competence, combined withits statutory requirement that a criminal defendant establishincompetence by clear and convincing evidence, Okla. Stat.,Tit. 22, $ 1175.4(B) (1991),3 placed such an onerous burden onhim as to violate his right to due process of law. The appellate court rejected this argument. After noting that it canbe difficult to determine whether a defendant is malingering,given "the inexactness and uncertainty attached to [competency] proceedings," the court held that the standard wasjustified because the "State has great interest in assuring itscitizens a thorough and speedy judicial process," and becausea "truly incompetent criminal defendant, through his attorneys and experts, can prove incompetency with relativeease." 889 P. 2d 293, 303 (1995). We granted certiorari toreview the Court of Criminal Appeals' conclusion that appli2 Petitioner did not communicate with or sit near defense counsel duringthe trial. Through much of the proceedings he remained in prison overalls, crouching in the fetal position and talking to himself.3 Section 1175.4(B) provides, in relevant part: "The court, at the hearingon the application [for determination of competency], shall determine, byclear and convincing evidence, if the person is incompetent. The personshall be presumed to be competent for the purposes of the allocation ofthe burden of proof and burden of going forward with the evidence."Section 1175.4 was amended in 1991, during the pretrial period ofpetitioner's prosecution. The amendment did not alter the text ofsubsection B.517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT354 COOPER v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtcation of the clear and convincing evidence standard does notviolate due process. 516 U. S. 910 (1995).IINo one questions the existence of the fundamental rightthat petitioner invokes. We have repeatedly and consistently recognized that "the criminal trial of an incompetentdefendant violates due process." Medina v. California, 505U. S. 437, 453 (1992); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172 (1975);Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966). Noris the significance of this right open to dispute. AsJusticeKennedy recently emphasized:"Competence to stand trial is rudimentary, for upon itdepends the main part of those rights deemed essentialto a fair trial, including the right to effective assistanceof counsel, the rights to summon, to confront, and tocross-examine witnesses, and the right to testify onone's own behalf or to remain silent without penalty fordoing so. Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172(1975)." Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139-140(1992) (opinion concurring in judgment).4The test for incompetence is also well settled. A defendantmay not be put to trial unless he " `has sufficient presentability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree ofrational understanding . . . [and] a rational as well as factualunderstanding of the proceedings against him.' " Dusky v.United States, 362 U. S. 402, 402 (1960) (per curiam).54 Indeed, the right not to stand trial while incompetent is sufficientlyimportant to merit protection even if the defendant has failed to make atimely request for a competency determination. See Pate v. Robinson,383 U. S. 375, 384 (1966).5 The Oklahoma statute defines competence as "the present ability of aperson arrested for or charged with a crime to understand the nature ofthe charges and proceedings brought against him and to effectively and517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT355Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the CourtOur recent decision in Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437(1992), establishes that a State may presume that the defendant is competent and require him to shoulder the burden ofproving his incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. Id., at 449. In reaching that conclusion we held thatthe relevant inquiry was whether the presumption " `offendssome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and con-science of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' "Id.,at 445 (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202(1977)). We contrasted the "deep roots in our common-lawheritage" underlying the prohibition against trying the incompetent with the absence of any settled tradition concern-ing the allocation of the burden of proof in a competencyproceeding. 505 U. S., at 446. Our conclusion that the pre-sumption of competence offends no recognized principle of"fundamental fairness" rested in part on the fact that theprocedural rule affects the outcome "only in a narrow classof cases where the evidence is in equipoise; that is, wherethe evidence that a defendant is competent is just as strongas the evidence that he is incompetent." Id., at 449.6The question we address today is quite different from thequestion posed in Medina. Petitioner's claim requires us toconsider whether a State may proceed with a criminal trialafter the defendant has demonstrated that he is more likelythan not incompetent. Oklahoma does not contend that itmay require the defendant to prove incompetence beyond areasonable doubt.7 The State maintains, however, that theclear and convincing standard provides a reasonable accomrationally assist in his defense." Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, $ 1175.1(1) (Supp.1996).6 In her concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor expressed the view thatplacing the burden on the defendant in this limited group of cases waspermissible because it provided the defendant with an incentive to cooperate with the information-gathering process necessary to a reliable competency determination.

OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtmodation of the opposing interests of the State and the de-fendant. We are persuaded, by both traditional and modernpractice and the importance of the constitutional interest atstake, that the State's argument must be rejected.III"Historical practice is probative of whether a proceduralrule can be characterized as fundamental," Medina, 505U. S., at 446. In this case, unlike in Medina, there is noindication that the rule Oklahoma seeks to defend has anyroots in prior practice. Indeed, it appears that a rule sig-nificantly more favorable to the defendant has had a long andconsistent application.We turn first to an examination of the relevant commonlaw traditions of England and this country. The prohibitionagainst trying the incompetent defendant was well established by the time Hale and Blackstone wrote their famouscommentaries. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24 ("[I]f aman in his sound memory commits a capital offence . . . [a]ndif, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he shallnot be tried: for how can he make his defence?"); 1 M. Hale,Pleas of the Crown *34-*35 (same). The English caseswhich predate our Constitution provide no guidance, how-ever, concerning the applicable standard of proof in competency determinations. See Trial of Charles Bateman(1685), reported in 11 How. St. Tr. 464, 467 (1816), andHawles, Remarks on the Trial of Mr. Charles Bateman, 11How. St. Tr. 474, 476 (1816) (noting that the court in the 1685trial incurred "censure" for proceeding to trial with a doubtas to the defendant's competence);Kinloch's Case (1746), 18How. St. Tr. 395, 411 (1813);King v. Steel, 1 Leach 452, 168Eng. Rep. 328 (1787).Beginning in the late 18th century, cases appear whichprovide an inkling of the proper standard. InKing v. Frith,22 How. St. Tr. 307 (1790), for example, the court instructed517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT357Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthe jury to "diligently inquire . . . whether John Frith, thenow prisoner at the bar . . . be of sound mind and understanding or not . . . ." Id., at 311. Some 50 years later the jurorsreceived a nearly identical admonition in Queen v. Goode, 7Ad. & E. 536, 112 Eng. Rep. 572 (K. B. 1837): " `You shalldiligently inquire, and true presentment make . . . whetherJohn Goode . . . be insane or not . . . .' " Id., at 536, n. (a),112 Eng. Rep., at 572-573, n.(a)2.8 Similarly, in King v.Pritchard, 7 Car. & P. 303, 173 Eng. Rep. 135 (1836), thecourt empaneled a jury to consider "whether the prisoner ismute of malice or not; secondly, whether he can plead to theindictment or not; thirdly, whether he is of sufficient intellectto comprehend the course of proceedings on the trial . . . ."Ibid. See also King v. Dyson, 73 Car. & P. 305, n. (a), 173Eng. Rep. 135-136, n.(a) (1831); Queen v. Southey, 4 F. & F.864, 895, 176 Eng. Rep. 825, 838 (1865); Queen v. Berry, 1Q. B. Rep. 447, 449 (1876). Ibid.9These authorities, while still speaking less clearly than wemight wish, are instructive. By phrasing the inquiry in asimple disjunctive, Frith, Goode, and Pritchard suggest thattraditional practice required the jury to determine whetherthe defendant was "more likely than not" incompetent.Nothing in the jury instructions of these cases will bear theinterpretation of a clear and convincing standard. What ismore, the cases contain no indication that the use of a pre8 Courts often referred to the prisoner's insanity (or present insanity)rather than incompetence, even when the proceeding concerned the defendant's competence to stand trial. Beginning with the earliest cases,the issue at a sanity or competency hearing has been "whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial,so as to make a proper defence to the charge." King v. Pritchard, 7Car. & P. 303, 304, 173 Eng. Rep. 135 (1836).9 In 1800 England codified the common-law rule that a court couldempanel a jury to determine whether a defendant charged with treason,murder, or a felony offense was competent to stand trial.

OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtponderance standard represented a departure from earlier(pre-Constitution) practice.10Modern English authority confirms our interpretation ofthese early cases as applying a preponderance standard.Relying on "principles . . . laid down in a number of cases,"includingPritchard and King v. Dyson, 7 Car. & P. 305,n. (a), 173 Eng. Rep. 135, n. (a) (1831), the court in Queen v.Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220, 3 All E. R. 418 (1959), ruled:"If the contention that the accused is insane is put forward by the defence and contested by the prosecution,there is, in our judgment, a burden upon the defence ofsatisfying the jury of the accused's insanity. In such acase, as in other criminal cases in which the onus ofproof rests upon the defence, the onus is discharged ifthe jury are satisfied on the balance of probabilities thatthe accused's insanity has been made out." Id., at 235,3 All E. R., at 429.1110 Indeed, although in Medina we concluded that it is permissible for aState to require the defendant to shoulder the burden of demonstratinghis incompetence, we noted that some 19th-century English authoritiesplaced the burden on the prosecutor once competence was put in issue.Medina v. California, 505 U. S., at 447. See Queen v. Davies, 3 Car. &K. 328, 329, 175 Eng. Rep. 575, 575 (1853) (judge ruled that "[the prosecutor] should begin, and call his witnesses, to show that the prisoner is sane,and capable of pleading"); Ley's Case, 1 Lewin 239, 240, 168 Eng. Rep.1026 (1828) (" `If there be a doubt as to the prisoner's sanity . . . you cannotsay that he is in a fit state to be put upon his trial' "). See also Halsbury,10 Laws of England 403 (3d ed. 1955) ("Where a jury is so empanelled[to determine competency], the onus is on the prosecution to prove thesanity of the defendant"). But see Queen v. Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220,236, 3 All E. R. 418, 430 (1959) (explicitly rejecting the suggestion thatthe prosecutor must prove the defendant's competence to stand trial).Given the disagreement among English courts concerning which partybore the burden of proof, it is unlikely that in cases in which the burdenwas placed on the defendant that burden was as weighty as clear andconvincing evidence.11 The Podola court opined that the tests laid down in Pritchard "havebeen followed so often that they may be said to be firmly embodied in ourlaw." 43 Crim. App., at 238, 3 All E. R., at 431.517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT359Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the CourtLikewise, we are aware of no decisional law from thiscountry suggesting that any State employed Oklahoma'sheightened standard until quite recently. Rather, the ear-liest available sources typically refer to English authorities, see, e. g., Freeman v. People, 47 Am. Dec. 216, 223-225(N. Y. 1847),State v. Harris, 78 Am. Dec. 272, 272-275(N.

Rep. 135 (1836)),and employ the disjunctive language used by the Englishcourts, see,e. g., Commonwealth v. Hathaway, 13 Mass. 299(1816); People v. Kleim, 1 N.

Chisolm, 149 F. 284, 290 (SDAla. 1906).12 By the turn of the 20th century, however,American courts were explicitly applying a preponderancestandard. In 1896, Ohio juries were instructed that "[t]heburden is upon the prisoner to show by a preponderanceof the proof that he is insane." State v. O'Grady, 5 OhioDec. 654, 655 (1896).13 Some 15 years later, the TennesseeSupreme Court described the competency determination as12 In Commonwealth v. Braley, 1 Mass. 102, 103 (1804), a case decidedshortly after the Constitution was ratified, the court instructed the juryto consider "whether [the accused] neglected or refused to plead to theindictment against him for murder, of his free will and malice, or whetherhe did so neglect by the act of God." This instruction may be a precursorto the "sane or insane" disjunctive.13 See also State v. Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P. 443, 444 (1898) ("What I mean bythe preponderance of the evidence is that the accused must show that heis now at the time of this trial probably not sane"). Cf. People v. AhYing, 42 Cal. 18, 20 (1872) (jury should find defendant presently insane if"satisfied" by the evidence supporting that conclusion).Both Tyler and State v. O'Grady are instructive concerning the properinterpretation of the authorities which articulate no standard of proofbut phrase the inquiry in the disjunctive. In each case the jury was toldthat its task was to determine whether the accused "is or is not sane,"Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P., at 443, see also O'Grady, 5 Ohio Dec., at 654, andthen explicitly instructed that the defendant bore the burden of proof bya preponderance of the evidence. Tyler, 7 Ohio N.

Congress has directedthat the accused in a federal prosecution must prove incompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U. S. C.$ 4241.The near-uniform application of a standard that is moreprotective of the defendant's rights than Oklahoma's clearand convincing evidence rule supports our conclusion thatthe heightened standard offends a principle of justice that isdeeply "rooted in the traditions and conscience of our peo-ple."Medina v. California, 505 U. S., at 445 (internal quo-tation marks omitted). We turn next to a consideration ofwhether the rule exhibits " `fundamental fairness' in opera-tion."Id., at 448 (quoting Dowling v. United States, 493U. S. 342, 352 (1990)).IVContemporary and historical procedures are fully consist-ent with our evaluation of the risks inherent in Oklahoma'spractice of requiring the defendant to prove incompetenceby clear and convincing evidence. InAddington v. Texas,441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979), we explained that:"The function of a standard of proof, as that concept isembodied in the Due Process Clause and in the realm offactfinding, is to `instruct the factfinder concerning thedegree of confidence our society thinks he should havein the correctness of factual conclusions for a particulartype of adjudication.'In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,370 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)."The "more stringent the burden of proof a party must bear,the more that party bears the risk of an erroneous decision."18 See, e. g., Haw. Rev.

For that reason, we have held that due processplaces a heightened burden of proof on the State in civil pro-ceedings in which the "individual interests at stake . . . areboth `particularly important' and `more substantial thanmere loss of money.' "Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745,756 (1982) (termination of parental rights) (quoting Addington, 441 U. S., at 424).19Far from "jealously guard[ing]," Jacob v. New York City,315 U. S. 752, 752-753 (1942), an incompetent criminal de-fendant's fundamental right not to stand trial, Oklahoma'spractice of requiring the defendant to prove incompetenceby clear and convincing evidence imposes a significant riskof an erroneous determination that the defendant is compe-tent. InMedina we found no comparable risk because thepresumption would affect only the narrow class of cases inwhich the evidence on either side was equally balanced.19 See also Addington v. Texas (involuntary civil commitment); Woodbyv. INS, 385 U. S. 276, 285-286 (1966) (deportation); Chaunt v. UnitedStates, 364 U. S. 350, 353 (1960) (denaturalization); Schneiderman v.United States, 320 U. S. 118, 125 (1943) (denaturalization).Our opinions in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261(1990), and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502(1990), are not to the contrary. In Cruzan we held that the Due ProcessClause does not prohibit Missouri from requiring a third party who seeksto terminate life-sustaining treatment to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the incompetent person receiving such treatmentwould wish that step to be taken. 497 U. S., at 280. We reasoned thatthe heightened standard of proof was permissible because the decisionmaker was a surrogate for the incompetent individual, id., at 280-281, andbecause the consequences of an erroneous decision were irreversible, id.,at 283. In Akron Center for Reproductive Health we upheld an Ohiostatute that required an unmarried, unemancipated minor woman whosought to obtain an abortion without notifying a parent to prove by clearand convincing evidence that judicial bypass of the notification requirement was appropriate in her case. We approved the heightened standardof proof in that case largely because the proceeding at issue was ex parte.497 U. S., at 515-516.517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT364 COOPER v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Court"Once a State provides a defendant access to procedures formaking a competency evaluation," we stated, there is "nobasis for holding that due process further requires the Stateto assume the burden of vindicating the defendant's constitutional right by persuading the trier of fact that the defendantis competent to stand trial." 505 U. S., at 449. Unlike thepresumption at issue inMedina, however, Oklahoma's clearand convincing evidence standard affects a class of cases inwhich the defendant has already demonstrated that he ismore likely than not incompetent.For the defendant, the consequences of an erroneous determination of competence are dire. Because he lacks theability to communicate effectively with counsel, he may beunable to exercise other "rights deemed essential to a fairtrial." Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S., at 139 (Kennedy, J.,concurring in judgment). After making the "profound"choice whether to plead guilty, Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S.389, 398 (1993), the defendant who proceeds to trial"will ordinarily have to decide whether to waive his`privilege against compulsory self-incrimination,'Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243 (1969), by taking thewitness stand; if the option is available, he may have todecide whether to waive his `right to trial by jury,' ibid.;and, in consultation with counsel, he may have to decidewhether to waive his `right to confront [his] accusers,'ibid., by declining to cross-examine witnesses for theprosecution." Ibid.With the assistance of counsel, the defendant also is calledupon to make myriad smaller decisions concerning the courseof his defense. The importance of these rights and decisionsdemonstrates that an erroneous determination of compe-tence threatens a "fundamental component of our criminaljustice system" 20--the basic fairness of the trial itself.20 United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653 (1984).517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT365Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the CourtBy comparison to the defendant's interest, the injury tothe State of the opposite error--a conclusion that the defendant is incompetent when he is in fact malingering--is mod-est. To be sure, such an error imposes an expense on thestate treasury and frustrates the State's interest in theprompt disposition of criminal charges. But the error issubject to correction in a subsequent proceeding and theState may detain the incompetent defendant for "the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there isa substantial probability that he will attain [competence] inthe foreseeable future." Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715,738 (1972).21The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals correctly ob-served that the "inexactness and uncertainty" that characterize competency proceedings may make it difficult to deter-mine whether a defendant is incompetent or malingering.889 P. 2d, at 303. We presume, however, that it is unusualfor even the most artful malingerer to feign incompetencesuccessfully for a period of time while under professionalcare.22 In this regard it is worth reiterating that only fourjurisdictions currently consider it necessary to impose on thecriminal defendant the burden of proving incompetence byclear and convincing evidence. Moreover, there is no reasonto believe that the art of dissimilation is new. Eighteenthand nineteenth century courts, for example, warned jurorscharged with making competency determinations that" `there may be great fraud in this matter,' " King v. Dyson,7 Car. & P. 305, n.(a), 173 Eng. Rep., at 136, n. (a) (quoting21 Under Jackson, if the defendant regains competence or is found to bemalingering, the State may proceed to trial.22 Sir John Hawles, Solicitor General to King William III (who reignedfrom 1689-1702), noted that "there is a great difference between pretencesand realities, and sana and non sana memoria hath been often tryed incapital matters, and the prisoners have reaped so little benefit by theirpretences, it being always discovered, that we rarely hear of it." Hawles,Remarks on the Trial of Mr. Charles Bateman (1685), 11 How. St. Tr. 474,478 (1816).517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT366 COOPER v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Court1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at *35), and that "[i]t would bea reproach to justice if a guilty man . . . postponed his trialupon a feigned condition of mind, as to his inability to aidin his defense," United States v. Chisolm, 149 F., at 288.23Although they recognized this risk, the early authorities didnot resort to a heightened burden of proof in competencyproceedings. See Part III, supra.More fundamentally, while the difficulty of ascertainingwhere the truth lies may make it appropriate to place theburden of proof on the proponent of an issue, it does notjustify the additional onus of an especially high standard ofproof. As theChisolm Court continued,"[I]t would be likewise a reproach to justice and ourinstitutions, if a human being . . . were compelled to goto trial at a time when he is not sufficiently in possessionof his mental faculties to enable him to make a rationaland proper defense. The latter would be a more griev-ous error than the former; since in the one case an individual would go unwhipped of justice, while in the otherthe great safeguards which the law adopts in the punishment of crime and the upholding of justice would berudely invaded by the tribunal whose sacred duty it isto uphold the law in all its integrity." 149 F., at 288.A heightened standard does not decrease the risk of error,but simply reallocates that risk between the parties. SeeCruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S., at 283.In cases in which competence is at issue, we perceive nosound basis for allocating to the criminal defendant the largeshare of the risk which accompanies a clear and convincingevidence standard. We assume that questions of compe-tence will arise in a range of cases including not only thosein which one side will prevail with relative ease, but alsothose in which it is more likely than not that the defendant23 See also People v. Lake, 2 N. Y. 215, 220, 222 (1855); State v. Harris,78 Am. Dec. 272, 274 (N. C. 1860); State v. Tyler, 7 Ohio N. P., at 444.517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT367Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the Courtis incompetent but the evidence is insufficiently strong tosatisfy a clear and convincing standard. While importantstate interests are unquestionably at stake, in these lattercases the defendant's fundamental right to be tried onlywhile competent outweighs the State's interest in the effi-cient operation of its criminal justice system.VOklahoma makes two additional arguments in support ofits procedural rule that warrant discussion. First, Oklahoma correctly reminds us that it is normally within thepower of the State to establish the procedures through whichits laws are given effect, including those related to the bur-den of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion.See Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 201-202. In Patterson we upheld New York's requirement that in a prosecutionfor second-degree murder the defendant must bear the burden of proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotionaldisturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter.Id., at 207-208. After observing that the rule was consist-ent with common-law practice,id., at 202, we held that "[t]heDue Process Clause . . . does not put New York to the choiceof abandoning [statutory] defenses or undertaking to dis-prove their existence in order to convict of a crime whichotherwise is within its constitutional powers to sanction bysubstantial punishment,"id., at 207-208.Although we found no violation in Patterson, we notedthat the State's power to regulate procedural burdens wassubject to proscription under the Due Process Clause if it"offends some principle of justice so rooted in the tradi-tions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental," id., at 201-202 (internal quotation marks omitted).This case involves such a rule. UnlikePatterson, whichconcerned procedures for proving a statutory defense, weconsider here whether a State's procedures for guaranteeinga fundamental constitutional right are sufficiently protective517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT368 COOPER v. OKLAHOMAOpinion of the Courtof that right. The deep roots and fundamental character ofthe defendant's right not to stand trial when it is more likelythan not that he lacks the capacity to understand the natureof the proceedings against him or to communicate effectivelywith counsel mandate constitutional protection.Finally, Oklahoma suggests that our decision inAddingtonv. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), in which we held that due process requires a clear and convincing standard of proof in aninvoluntary civil commitment proceeding, supports imposition of such a rule in competency proceedings. The argu-ment is unpersuasive because commitment and competencyproceedings address entirely different substantive issues.Although we have not had the opportunity to consider theouter limits of a State's authority to civilly commit an unwill-ing individual,O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 573-574 (1975), our decision in Donaldson makes clear that dueprocess requires at a minimum a showing that the person ismentally ill and either poses a danger to himself or othersor is incapable of "surviving safely in freedom," id., at 573-576. The test for competence to stand trial, by contrast, iswhether the defendant has the present ability to understandthe charges against him and communicate effectively withdefense counsel. Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S., at 402.Even if we were to uphold Oklahoma's imposition of the clearand convincing evidence rule in competency proceedings, thecomparable standards in the two proceedings would notguarantee parallel results.24More importantly, our decision today is in complete accordwith the basis for our ruling in Addington. Both cases con-cern the proper protection of fundamental rights in circumstances in which the State proposes to take drastic actionagainst an individual. The requirement that the grounds forcivil commitment be shown by clear and convincing evidence24 For example, a mentally retarded defendant accused of a nonviolentcrime may be found incompetent to stand trial but not necessarily be subject to involuntary civil commitment.517US2$44I 02-07-99 16:49:58 PAGES OPINPGT369Cite as: 517 U. S. 348 (1996)Opinion of the Courtprotects the individual's fundamental interest in liberty.The prohibition against requiring the criminal defendant todemonstrate incompetence by clear and convincing evidencesafeguards the fundamental right not to stand trial whileincompetent. Because Oklahoma's procedural rule allowsthe State to put to trial a defendant who is more likely thannot incompetent, the rule is incompatible with the dictatesof due process.25VIFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed, andthe case is remanded to the Oklahoma Court of CriminalAppeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with thisopinion.
