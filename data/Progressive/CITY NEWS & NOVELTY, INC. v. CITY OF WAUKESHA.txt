S. 278 (2001)Opinion of the CourtThose requirements included assurance of "a prompt finaljudicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license." Id., at 59.Twenty-five years later, in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S.215 (1990), the Court applied some of the Freedman stand-ards to a municipal ordinance conditioning the operation ofsexually oriented businesses on receipt of a license. Unsuc-cessful applicants for an adult business license, the opinionannouncing the judgment stated, must be accorded "an ave-nue for prompt judicial review." 493 U. S., at 229.Courts have divided over the meaning of FW/PBS's"prompt judicial review" requirement. Some have held thatthe unsuccessful applicant for an adult business license mustbe assured a prompt judicial determination on the merits ofthe permit denial. See, e. g., Baby Tam & Co. v. Las Vegas,154 F. 3d 1097, 1101-1102 (CA9 1998);11126 Baltimore Blvd.,Inc. v. Prince George's County, 58 F. 3d 988, 999-1000 (CA41995) (en banc). Others, like the Court of Appeals of Wis-consin whose judgment is before us, 231 Wis. 2d 93, 115-116,604 N. W. 2d 870, 882 (1999), have held that prompt accessto court review suffices. See,e. g., Boss Capital, Inc. v.Casselberry, 187 F. 3d 1251, 1256-1257 (CA11 1999); TK'sVideo, Inc. v. Denton County, 24 F. 3d 705, 709 (CA5 1994).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 530 U. S. 1242(2000). We now find, however, that the issue stemming fromFreedman is not genuinely presented to us in this case. Wetherefore dismiss the petition and leave the judgment of theWisconsin court undisturbed.IThe City of Waukesha, Wisconsin (City), requires sellersof sexually explicit materials to obtain and annually renewadult business licenses. See Waukesha Municipal Code$$ 8.195(2), (7) (1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 101,104. Petitioner City News and Novelty, Inc. (City News),pursuant to a City license first obtained in 1989, owned and531US2 Unit: $U16 [04-16-02 14:30:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 CITY NEWS & NOVELTY, INC. v. WAUKESHAOpinion of the Courtoperated an adult-oriented shop in downtown Waukesha. InNovember 1995, City News applied for a renewal of its license, then due to expire in two months. In December 1995,Waukesha's Common Council denied the application, findingthat City News had violated the City's ordinance by permit-ting minors to loiter on the premises, failing to maintain anunobstructed view of booths in the store, and allowing pa-trons to engage in sexual activity inside the booths. Waukesha's refusal to renew City News's license was upheld in ad-ministrative proceedings and on judicial review in the statecourts.Petitioning for certiorari, City News raised three questions. First, City News asserted that the persuasion bur-den had been improperly assigned to it. Second, City Newsurged that Waukesha's ordinance unconstitutionally accordedCity officials unbridled discretion to vary punishments forordinance violations. Third, City News asked us to "resolvethe conflict among the circuits concerning whether the guarantee of prompt judicial review that must accompany [anadult business] licensing scheme means a prompt judicial determination or simply the right to promptly file for judicialreview." Pet. for Cert. 13. We granted the petition onlyon the third question. Accordingly, City News cannot nowcontend that any of the substantive requirements governingadult business licenses in Waukesha conflict with the FirstAmendment. Nor does City News contend that the evidence failed to substantiate the charged violations. We nowexplain why City News is not properly situated to raise thequestion on which we granted review.IIIn letters sent to Waukesha two months after petitioningfor review in this Court, City News gave notice that it wouldwithdraw its renewal application and close its business uponthe City's grant of a license to another corporation, B. J. B.,Inc., "a larger and more modern business" with which City531US2 Unit: $U16 [04-16-02 14:30:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 531 U. S. 278 (2001)Opinion of the CourtNews felt "it [could not] effectively compete." Lettersfrom Jeff Scott Olson to Vince Moschella (June 12 and 19,2000), Respondent's Lodging, Vol. 1, Tab No. 14. Wau-kesha granted B. J. B.'s license application on June 20. Itis undisputed that City News has ceased to operate as anadult business and no longer seeks to renew its license.Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15.Observing that City News neither now pursues nor cur-rently expresses an intent to pursue a license under Waukesha law, Waukesha asserts that the case has become moot,for City News no longer has "a legally cognizable interest inthe outcome." County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U. S.625, 631 (1979) (citing Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486,496 (1969)). We agree that the case no longer qualifies forjudicial review. Urging that the case remains fit for adjudication, City News tenders two points. We find neitherpersuasive.Noting that it "has never promised not to apply for a license" in the future, Reply Brief 1, City News first contendsthat, notwithstanding the voluntary termination of its licenserenewal effort, a live controversy remains under the Court'sreasoning in Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277 (2000). Inour view, Erie differs critically from this case. In Erie, wesimilarly granted a petition to review a state-court judgmentaddressing an adult business' First Amendment challenge toa city ordinance. We concluded that the controversy persisted, even though the adult business had shut down. Wereached that conclusion, it is true, in part because the business "could again decide to operate." Id., at 287. Thatspeculation standing alone, however, did not shield thecase from a mootness determination. Another factor figured prominently. The nude dancing entrepreneur in Eriesought "to have the case declared moot" after the businesshad "prevailed below," obtaining a judgment that invalidatedErie's ordinance. Id., at 288. Had we accepted the entrepreneur's plea, then consistent with our practice when a case531US2 Unit: $U16 [04-16-02 14:30:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 CITY NEWS & NOVELTY, INC. v. WAUKESHAOpinion of the Courtbecomes moot on review from a state court, we would havedismissed the petition, leaving intact the judgment below.See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 621, n. 1 (1989);Erie, 529 U. S., at 305 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).Thus, had we declaredErie moot, the defendant municipalitywould have been saddled with an "ongoing injury," i. e., thejudgment striking its law. Id., at 288. And the plaintiffarguably would have prevailed in an "attemp[t] to manipulate the Court's jurisdiction to insulate a favorable decisionfrom review."Ibid.In this case, we confront no parallel circumstance. Theadult enterprise before us left the fray as a loser, not a win-ner. Our dismissal here does not keep Waukesha under theweight of an adverse judgment, or deprive Waukesha of itsvictory in state court. Nor does a mootness dismissal reward an arguable manipulation of our jurisdiction, for plain-tiff City News, unlike the nude dancing entrepreneur inErie, opposes a declaration of mootness.1City News also urges that it experiences ongoing injurybecause it is conclusively barred by Waukesha's ordinancefrom reopening as an adult business until 2005. It is far1 City News appears to rely on the general rule that voluntary cessationof a challenged practice rarely moots a federal case. See, e. g., Friendsof Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.167, 189 (2000). But that rule traces to the principle that a party shouldnot be able to evade judicial review, or to defeat a judgment, by temporarily altering questionable behavior. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 66-67 (1987) ("Mootnessdoctrine . . . protects plaintiffs from defendants who seek to evade sanctionby predictable `protestations of repentance and reform.' ") (quoting UnitedStates v. Oregon State Medical Soc., 343 U. S. 326, 333 (1952)); see alsoFriends of Earth, 528 U. S., at 189 (Courts are not "compelled to leave`[t]he defendant . . . free to return to his old ways.' ") (quoting City ofMesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289, n. 10 (1982), in turnquoting United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632 (1953)). Thatprinciple does not aid City News. For it is City News, not its adversary,whose conduct saps the controversy of vitality, and City News can gainnothing from our dismissal.531US2 Unit: $U16 [04-16-02 14:30:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN285Cite as: 531 U. S. 278 (2001)Opinion of the Courtfrom clear, however, whether City News actually suffers thatdisability.2 And as our prior discussion suggests, supra, at283, a live controversy is not maintained by speculation thatCity News might be temporarily disabled from reentering abusiness that City News has left and currently asserts noplan to reenter. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 15-16(1998).City News's contention that it remains a qualified complainant also fails for a separate reason. Full briefing andargument have revealed that the question City News tendered, and which we took up for review, is not now and neverwas accurately reflective of City News's grievance. Unlikethe initial license applicant whose expression cannot beginprepermission (the situation of the complainant inFreed-man), City News was already licensed to conduct an adultbusiness and sought to fend off a stop order. Swift judicialreview is the remedy needed by those held back from speaking. We do not doubt that an ongoing adult enterprise fac-ing loss of its license to do business may allege First Amendment injuries. Such an establishment's typical concern,however, is not the speed of court proceedings, but the avail2 City News points to Waukesha's rule that to receive an adult entertainment license, an applicant "shall not have been found to have previouslyviolated [the adult business ordinance] within 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application." Waukesha Municipal Code $ 8.195(4)(a)(2)(1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 103. It was in 1995, however,that Waukesha last found City News to have violated the City ordinance.As City News recognizes, the disabilities from these violations expired in2000. Reply Brief 2. City News asserts that it remains vulnerable tothe bar because, in violation of the ordinance, it operated without a licenseinto the year 2000. But this argument runs up against the facts that,since 1995, City News has not "been found" by Waukesha's Common Council to have violated the ordinance, and that the council expressly permittedCity News to continue in business during the pendency of state-court proceedings. See Petitioner's Lodging, Tab No. 3. If City News seeks alicense in the future, and if Waukesha attempts to invoke its five-year bar,nothing in the prior proceedings or in our disposition today will disableCity News from contesting the bar's application.531US2 Unit: $U16 [04-16-02 14:30:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 CITY NEWS & NOVELTY, INC. v.

TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuitNo. 99-901. Argued October 11, 2000--Decided February 20, 2001Respondent not-for-profit athletic association (Association) regulates interscholastic sport among Tennessee public and private high schools.Most of the State's public high schools are members, representing 84%of the Association's membership. School officials make up the votingmembership of the Association's governing council and control board,which typically hold meetings during regular school hours. The Association is largely funded by gate receipts. Association staff, although notstate employees, may join the state retirement system. The Association sets membership standards and student eligibility rules and has thepower to penalize any member school that violates those rules. TheState Board of Education (State Board) has long acknowledged theAssociation's role in regulating interscholastic competition in publicschools, and its members sit as nonvoting members of the Association'sgoverning bodies. When the Association penalized petitioner Brentwood Academy for violating a recruiting rule, Brentwood sued the Association and its executive director under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming thatthe rule's enforcement was state action that violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court granted Brentwood summaryjudgment, enjoining the rule's enforcement, but the Sixth Circuit foundno state action and reversed.Held: The Association's regulatory activity is state action owing to thepervasive entwinement of state school officials in the Association'sstructure, there being no offsetting reason to see the Association's actsin any other way. Pp. 295-305.(a) State action may be found only if there is such a "close nexusbetween the State and the challenged action" that seemingly privatebehavior "may be fairly treated as that of the State itself." Jackson v.Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345, 351. No one fact is a necessarycondition for finding state action, nor is any set of circumstances sufficient, for there may be some countervailing reason against attributingactivity to the government. The facts that can bear on an attribution'sfairness--e. g., a nominally private entity may be a state actor when itis entwined with governmental policies or when government is en531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Syllabustwined in its management or control, Evans v. Newton, 382 U. S. 296,299, 301--unequivocally show that a legal entity's character is determined neither by its expressly private characterization in statutory law,nor by the law's failure to acknowledge its inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies. In National Collegiate AthleticAssn. v. Tarkanian, 488 U. S. 179, this Court anticipated that state action could be found when there is public entwinement in the management or control of an organization whose member public schools are allwithin a single State. Pp. 295-298.(b) The necessarily fact-bound inquiry leads to the conclusion of stateaction here. The Association's nominally private character is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and publicofficials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantialreason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it. Tothe extent of 84% of its membership, the Association is an organizationof public schools represented by their officials acting in their officialcapacity to provide an integral element of secondary public schooling,interscholastic athletics. There would be no recognizable Associationwithout the public school officials, who overwhelmingly determine andperform all but the Association's purely ministerial acts. Only the 16%minority of private school memberships keeps the entwinement of theAssociation and public schools from being total and their identities totally indistinguishable. To complement the entwinement from the bottom up, the State has provided entwinement from the top down: StateBoard members sit ex officio on the Association's governing bodies andAssociation employees participate in the state retirement system. Entwinement to the degree shown here requires that the Association becharged with a public character and judged by constitutional standards. Pp. 298-302.(c) Entwinement is also the answer to the Association's several arguments that the instant facts would not support a state-action findingunder various other criteria, e. g., the public function test, RendellBaker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830, distinguished. Pp. 302-303.(d) Although facts showing public action may be outweighed in thename of a value at odds with finding public accountability in the circumstances, e. g., Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 322, no such countervailing value is present here. The Association's fear that reversing thejudgment will trigger an epidemic of federal litigation is unfounded.Save for the Sixth Circuit, every Court of Appeals to consider a statewide athletic association like this one has found it to be a state actor,and there has been no litigation explosion in those jurisdictions. Norshould the Association have dispensation merely because the public531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN290 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v.

S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the Courtby their dues and income received in their stead, and hashistorically been seen to regulate in lieu of the State Boardof Education's exercise of its own authority. We hold thatthe association's regulatory activity may and should betreated as state action owing to the pervasive entwinementof state school officials in the structure of the association,there being no offsetting reason to see the association's actsin any other way.IRespondent Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Associa-tion (Association) is a not-for-profit membership corporationorganized to regulate interscholastic sport among the publicand private high schools in Tennessee that belong to it. Noschool is forced to join, but without any other authority actu-ally regulating interscholastic athletics, it enjoys the memberships of almost all the State's public high schools (some290 of them or 84% of the Association's voting membership),far outnumbering the 55 private schools that belong. Amember school's team may play or scrimmage only againstthe team of another member, absent a dispensation.The Association's rulemaking arm is its legislative council,while its board of control tends to administration. The vot-ing membership of each of these nine-person committees islimited under the Association's bylaws to high school princi-pals, assistant principals, and superintendents elected by themember schools, and the public school administrators who soserve typically attend meetings during regular school hours.Although the Association's staff members are not paid by theState, they are eligible to join the State's public retirementsystem for its employees. Member schools pay dues to theAssociation, though the bulk of its revenue is gate receiptsat member teams' football and basketball tournaments, manyof them held in public arenas rented by the Association.The constitution, bylaws, and rules of the Association setstandards of school membership and the eligibility of students to play in interscholastic games. Each school, for531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN292 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtexample, is regulated in awarding financial aid, most coachesmust have a Tennessee state teaching license, and playersmust meet minimum academic standards and hew to limitson student employment. Under the bylaws, "in all matterspertaining to the athletic relations of his school," App. 138,the principal is responsible to the Association, which has thepower "to suspend, to fine, or otherwise penalize any member school for the violation of any of the rules of the Associa-tion or for other just cause,"id., at 100.Ever since the Association was incorporated in 1925, Ten-nessee's State Board of Education (State Board) has (to useits own words) acknowledged the corporation's functions "inproviding standards, rules and regulations for interscholasticcompetition in the public schools of Tennessee," id., at 211.More recently, the State Board cited its statutory authority, Tenn. Code Ann. $ 49-1-302 (1996) (App. 220), when itadopted language expressing the relationship between theAssociation and the State Board. Specifically, in 1972, itwent so far as to adopt a rule expressly "designat[ing]" theAssociation as "the organization to supervise and regulatethe athletic activities in which the public junior and seniorhigh schools in Tennessee participate on an interscholasticbasis." Tennessee State Board of Education, Administrative Rules and Regulations, Rule 0520-1-2-.26 (1972) (latermoved to Rule 0520-1-2-.08). The Rule provided that "theauthority granted herein shall remain in effect until revoked" and instructed the State Board's chairman to "designate a person or persons to serve in an ex-officio capacityon the [Association's governing bodies]." App. 211. Thatsame year, the State Board specifically approved the Association's rules and regulations, while reserving the right toreview future changes. Thus, on several occasions over thenext 20 years, the State Board reviewed, approved, or reaffirmed its approval of the recruiting Rule at issue in thiscase. In 1996, however, the State Board dropped the original Rule 0520-1-2-.08 expressly designating the Association531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN293Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the Courtas regulator; it substituted a statement "recogniz[ing] thevalue of participation in interscholastic athletics and the roleof [the Association] in coordinating interscholastic athleticcompetition," while "authoriz[ing] the public schools of thestate to voluntarily maintain membership in [the Associa-tion]."Id., at 220.The action before us responds to a 1997 regulatory enforcement proceeding brought against petitioner, BrentwoodAcademy, a private parochial high school member of the Association. The Association's board of control found thatBrentwood violated a rule prohibiting "undue influence" inrecruiting athletes, when it wrote to incoming students andtheir parents about spring football practice. The Association accordingly placed Brentwood's athletic program on probation for four years, declared its football and boys' basketball teams ineligible to compete in playoffs for two years,and imposed a $3,000 fine. When these penalties were imposed, all the voting members of the board of control andlegislative council were public school administrators.Brentwood sued the Association and its executive directorin federal court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,claiming that enforcement of the Rule was state action anda violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. TheDistrict Court entered summary judgment for Brentwoodand enjoined the Association from enforcing the Rule. 13F. Supp. 2d 670 (MD Tenn. 1998). In holding the Associationto be a state actor under $ 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court found that the State had delegatedauthority over high school athletics to the Association, characterized the relationship between the Association and itspublic school members as symbiotic, and emphasized the predominantly public character of the Association's membershipand leadership. The court relied on language in NationalCollegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, 488 U. S. 179, 193,n. 13 (1988), suggesting that statewide interscholastic athletic associations are state actors, and on other federal cases531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN294 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtin which such organizations had uniformly been held to beacting under color of state law.The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitreversed. 180 F. 3d 758 (1999). It recognized that there isno single test to identify state actions and state actors butapplied three criteria derived from Blum v. Yaretsky, 457U. S. 991 (1982), Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922(1982), andRendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830 (1982), andfound no state action under any of them. It said the DistrictCourt was mistaken in seeing a symbiotic relationship be-tween the State and the Association, it emphasized that theAssociation was neither engaging in a traditional and exclu-sive public function nor responding to state compulsion, andit gave short shrift to the language from Tarkanian on whichthe District Court relied. Rehearing en banc was later denied over the dissent of two judges, who criticized the paneldecision for creating a conflict among state and federalcourts, for being inconsistent with Tarkanian, and for lack-ing support in the "functional" analysis of private activityrequired by West v. Atkins, 487 U.

S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIIAOur cases try to plot a line between state action subjectto Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny and private conduct(however exceptionable) that is not. Tarkanian, supra, at191; Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345, 349(1974). The judicial obligation is not only to " `preserv[e] anarea of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federallaw' and avoi[d] the imposition of responsibility on a Statefor conduct it could not control," Tarkanian, supra, at 191(quoting Lugar, supra, at 936-937), but also to assure thatconstitutional standards are invoked "when it can be saidthat the State is responsible for the specific conduct of whichthe plaintiff complains,"Blum, supra, at 1004 (emphasis inoriginal). If the Fourteenth Amendment is not to be displaced, therefore, its ambit cannot be a simple line betweenStates and people operating outside formally governmentalorganizations, and the deed of an ostensibly private organiza-tion or individual is to be treated sometimes as if a Statehad caused it to be performed. Thus, we say that state ac-tion may be found if, though only if, there is such a "closenexus between the State and the challenged action" thatseemingly private behavior "may be fairly treated as that ofthe State itself." Jackson, supra, at 351.2What is fairly attributable is a matter of normative judgment, and the criteria lack rigid simplicity. From the rangeof circumstances that could point toward the State behind anindividual face, no one fact can function as a necessary condi-tion across the board for finding state action; nor is any setof circumstances absolutely sufficient, for there may be somescholastic Athletic League, 572 F. 2d 121, 125 (CA3 1978) (state actionconceded).2 If a defendant's conduct satisfies the state-action requirement of theFourteenth Amendment, the conduct also constitutes action "under colorof state law" for $ 1983 purposes. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S.922, 935 (1982).531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN296 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtcountervailing reason against attributing activity to thegovernment. SeeTarkanian, 488 U. S., at 193, 196; PolkCounty v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312 (1981).Our cases have identified a host of facts that can bear onthe fairness of such an attribution. We have, for example,held that a challenged activity may be state action when itresults from the State's exercise of "coercive power," Blum,457 U. S., at 1004, when the State provides "significant en-couragement, either overt or covert,"ibid., or when a private actor operates as a "willful participant in joint activitywith the State or its agents,"Lugar, supra, at 941 (internalquotation marks omitted). We have treated a nominally private entity as a state actor when it is controlled by an"agency of the State," Pennsylvania v. Board of Directorsof City Trusts of Philadelphia, 353 U. S. 230, 231 (1957) (percuriam), when it has been delegated a public function by theState, cf., e. g., West v. Atkins, supra, at 56; Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 627-628 (1991), when itis "entwined with governmental policies," or when government is "entwined in [its] management or control," Evans v.Newton, 382 U. S. 296, 299, 301 (1966).Amidst such variety, examples may be the best teachers,and examples from our cases are unequivocal in showing thatthe character of a legal entity is determined neither by itsexpressly private characterization in statutory law, norby the failure of the law to acknowledge the entity's inseparability from recognized government officials or agencies.Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513U. S. 374 (1995), held that Amtrak was the Government forconstitutional purposes, regardless of its congressional designation as private; it was organized under federal law to attain governmental objectives and was directed and controlled by federal appointees. Pennsylvania v. Board ofDirectors of City Trusts of Philadelphia, supra, held theprivately endowed Girard College to be a state actor andenforcement of its private founder's limitation of admission531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN297Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the Courtto whites attributable to the State, because, consistent withthe terms of the settlor's gift, the college's board of directorswas a state agency established by state law. Ostensibly theconverse situation occurred inEvans v. Newton, supra,which held that private trustees to whom a city had trans-ferred a park were nonetheless state actors barred from enforcing racial segregation, since the park served the publicpurpose of providing community recreation, and "the munici-pality remain[ed] entwined in [its] management [and] control," id., at 301.These examples of public entwinement in the managementand control of ostensibly separate trusts or corporationsforeshadow this case, as this Court itself anticipated inTarkanian. Tarkanian arose when an undoubtedly stateactor, the University of Nevada, suspended its basketballcoach, Tarkanian, in order to comply with rules and recommendations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association(NCAA). The coach charged the NCAA with state action,arguing that the state university had delegated its own functions to the NCAA, clothing the latter with authority tomake and apply the university's rules, the result being jointaction making the NCAA a state actor.To be sure, it is not the strict holding in Tarkanian thatpoints to our view of this case, for we found no state actionon the part of the NCAA. We could see, on the one hand,that the university had some part in setting the NCAA'srules, and the Supreme Court of Nevada had gone so far asto hold that the NCAA had been delegated the university'straditionally exclusive public authority over personnel. 488U. S., at 190. But on the other side, the NCAA's policieswere shaped not by the University of Nevada alone, but byseveral hundred member institutions, most of them havingno connection with Nevada, and exhibiting no color of Nevada law. Id., at 193. Since it was difficult to see theNCAA, not as a collective membership, but as surrogate forthe one State, we held the organization's connection with Ne531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN298 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtvada too insubstantial to ground a state-action claim. Id.,at 193, 196.But dictum in Tarkanian pointed to a contrary result onfacts like ours, with an organization whose member publicschools are all within a single State. "The situation would,of course, be different if the [Association's] membership consisted entirely of institutions located within the same State,many of them public institutions created by the same sovereign." Id., at 193, n. 13. To support our surmise, we approvingly cited two cases: Clark v. Arizona InterscholasticAssn., 695 F. 2d 1126 (CA9 1982), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 818(1983), a challenge to a state high school athletic associationthat kept boys from playing on girls' interscholastic volleyball teams in Arizona; and Louisiana High School AthleticAssn. v. St. Augustine High School, 396 F. 2d 224 (CA51968), a parochial school's attack on the racially segregatedsystem of interscholastic high school athletics maintained bythe athletic association. In each instance, the Court of Appeals treated the athletic association as a state actor.BJust as we foresaw in Tarkanian, the "necessarily factbound inquiry," Lugar, 457 U. S., at 939, leads to the conclusion of state action here. The nominally private characterof the Association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claimunfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.The Association is not an organization of natural personsacting on their own, but of schools, and of public schools tothe extent of 84% of the total. Under the Association's bylaws, each member school is represented by its principal ora faculty member, who has a vote in selecting members ofthe governing legislative council and board of control fromeligible principals, assistant principals, and superintendents.531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN299Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the CourtAlthough the findings and prior opinions in this case in-clude no express conclusion of law that public school officialsact within the scope of their duties when they representtheir institutions, no other view would be rational, the officialnature of their involvement being shown in any number ofways. Interscholastic athletics obviously play an integralpart in the public education of Tennessee, where nearlyevery public high school spends money on competitionsamong schools. Since a pickup system of interscholasticgames would not do, these public teams need some mecha-nism to produce rules and regulate competition. The mechanism is an organization overwhelmingly composed of publicschool officials who select representatives (all of them publicofficials at the time in question here), who in turn adopt andenforce the rules that make the system work. Thus, by giving these jobs to the Association, the 290 public schools ofTennessee belonging to it can sensibly be seen as exercisingtheir own authority to meet their own responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, then, the record indicates that half the councilor board meetings documented here were held during officialschool hours, and that public schools have largely providedfor the Association's financial support. A small portion ofthe Association's revenue comes from membership dues paidby the schools, and the principal part from gate receipts attournaments among the member schools. Unlike mere public buyers of contract services, whose payments for servicesrendered do not convert the service providers into publicactors, see Rendell-Baker, 457 U. S., at 839-843, the schoolshere obtain membership in the service organization and giveup sources of their own income to their collective association.The Association thus exercises the authority of the predominantly public schools to charge for admission to their games;the Association does not receive this money from the schools,but enjoys the schools' moneymaking capacity as its own.In sum, to the extent of 84% of its membership, the Association is an organization of public schools represented by their531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN300 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtofficials acting in their official capacity to provide an integralelement of secondary public schooling. There would be norecognizable Association, legal or tangible, without the pub-lic school officials, who do not merely control but overwhelmingly perform all but the purely ministerial acts by whichthe Association exists and functions in practical terms.Only the 16% minority of private school memberships prevents this entwinement of the Association and the publicschool system from being total and their identities totallyindistinguishable.To complement the entwinement of public school officialswith the Association from the bottom up, the State of Ten-nessee has provided for entwinement from top down. StateBoard members are assigned ex officio to serve as membersof the board of control and legislative council, and the Association's ministerial employees are treated as state employeesto the extent of being eligible for membership in the stateretirement system.It is, of course, true that the time is long past when theclose relationship between the surrogate association and itspublic members and public officials acting as such wasattested frankly. As mentioned, the terms of the StateBoard's Rule expressly designating the Association as regu-lator of interscholastic athletics in public schools were deleted in 1996, the year after a Federal District Court heldthat the Association was a state actor because its rules were"caused, directed and controlled by the Tennessee Board ofEducation," Graham v. TSSAA, No. 1:95-CV-044, 1995 WL115890, *5 (ED Tenn., Feb. 20, 1995).33 The District Court in Graham held that "[t]his delegation of authorityto TSSAA by Tennessee, standing alone, is sufficient to make TSSAA astate actor" under the "state compulsion test," which it understood toprovide that a State could exercise such coercive power or provide suchsignificant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice ofthe private actor must be deemed to be that of the State as a matter of531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN301Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the CourtBut the removal of the designation language from Rule0520-1-2-.08 affected nothing but words. Today the StateBoard's member-designees continue to sit on the Associa-tion's committees as nonvoting members, and the State continues to welcome Association employees in its retirementscheme. The close relationship is confirmed by the Association's enforcement of the same preamendment rules and reg-ulations reviewed and approved by the State Board (including the recruiting Rule challenged by Brentwood), and bythe State Board's continued willingness to allow students tosatisfy its physical education requirement by taking part ininterscholastic athletics sponsored by the Association. Themost one can say on the evidence is that the State Boardonce freely acknowledged the Association's official characterbut now does it by winks and nods.4 The amendment tothe Rule in 1996 affected candor but not the "momentum" ofthe Association's prior involvement with the State Board.Evans v. Newton, 382 U. S., at 301. The District Courtspoke to this point in finding that because of "custom andlaw. 1995 WL 115890, at *4-*5 (citing Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991,1004 (1982)).4 The significance of winks and nods in state-action doctrine seems to beone of the points of the dissenters' departure from the rest of the Court.In drawing the public-private action line, the dissenters would emphasizethe formal clarity of the legislative action providing for the appointmentof Girard College's trustees, see supra, at 296-297; post, at 310, in preference to our reliance on the practical certainty in this case that publicofficials will control operation of the Association under its bylaws. Similarly, the dissenters stress the express formality of the special statutedefining Amtrak's ties to the Government, see supra, at 296; post, at 310,in contrast to the reality in this case that the Association's organizersstructured the Association's relationships to the officialdom of public education. But if formalism were the sine qua non of state action, the doctrine would vanish owing to the ease and inevitability of its evasion, andfor just that reason formalism has never been controlling. For example,a criterion of state action like symbiosis (which the dissenters accept, post,at 311) looks not to form but to an underlying reality.531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN302 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Courtpractice," "the conduct of the parties has not materiallychanged" since 1996, "the connections between TSSAA andthe State [being] still pervasive and entwined." 13 F. Supp.2d, at 681.The entwinement down from the State Board is thereforeunmistakable, just as the entwinement up from the memberpublic schools is overwhelming. Entwinement will supporta conclusion that an ostensibly private organization ought tobe charged with a public character and judged by constitu-tional standards; entwinement to the degree shown here requires it. CEntwinement is also the answer to the Association's sev-eral arguments offered to persuade us that the facts wouldnot support a finding of state action under various criteriaapplied in other cases. These arguments are beside thepoint, simply because the facts justify a conclusion of stateaction under the criterion of entwinement, a conclusion in nosense unsettled merely because other criteria of state actionmay not be satisfied by the same facts.The Association places great stress, for example, on theapplicati on of a public functi on test, as exempli fied inRendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830 (1982). There, anapparently private school provided education for studentswhose special needs made it difficult for them to finish highschool. The record, however, failed to show any tradition ofproviding public special education to students unable to copewith a regular school, who had historically been cared for (orignored) according to private choice. It was true that vari-ous public school districts had adopted the practice of referring students to the school and paying their tuition, and noone disputed that providing the instruction aimed at aproper public objective and conferred a public benefit. Butwe held that the performance of such a public function didnot permit a finding of state action on the part of the schoolunless the function performed was exclusively and tradition531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN303Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Opinion of the Courtally public, as it was not in that case. The Association ar-gues that application of the public function criterion wouldproduce the same result here, and we will assume, arguendo,that it would. But this case does not turn on a public function test, any more than Rendell-Baker had anything to dowith entwinement of public officials in the special school.For the same reason, it avails the Association nothing tostress that the State neither coerced nor encouraged the actions complained of. "Coercion" and "encouragement" arelike "entwinement" in referring to kinds of facts that canjustify characterizing an ostensibly private action as publicinstead. Facts that address any of these criteria are significant, but no one criterion must necessarily be applied.When, therefore, the relevant facts show pervasive entwinement to the point of largely overlapping identity, the implica-tion of state action is not affected by pointing out that thefacts might not loom large under a different test.DThis is not to say that all of the Association's argumentsare rendered beside the point by the public officials' involvement in the Association, for after application of the entwine-ment criterion, or any other, there is a further potentialissue, and the Association raises it. Even facts that sufficeto show public action (or, standing alone, would require sucha finding) may be outweighed in the name of some value atodds with finding public accountability in the circumstances.In Polk County, 454 U. S., at 322, a defense lawyer's actionswere deemed private even though she was employed by thecounty and was acting within the scope of her duty as a pub-lic defender. Full-time public employment would be conclusive of state action for some purposes, see West v. Atkins,487 U. S., at 50, accord,Lugar, 457 U. S., at 935, n. 18, butnot when the employee is doing a defense lawyer's primaryjob; then, the public defender does "not ac[t] on behalf of theState; he is the State's adversary."Polk County, supra, at531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN304 BRENTWOOD ACADEMY v. TENNESSEE SECONDARYSCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSN.Opinion of the Court323, n. 13. The state-action doctrine does not convert oppo-nents into virtual agents.The assertion of such a countervailing value is the nub ofeach of the Association's two remaining arguments, neitherof which, however, persuades us. The Association suggests,first, that reversing the judgment here will somehow triggeran epidemic of unprecedented federal litigation. Brief forRespondents 35. Even if that might be counted as a goodreason for aPolk County decision to call the Association'saction private, the record raises no reason for alarm here.Save for the Sixth Circuit, every Court of Appeals to consider a statewide athletic association like the one here hasfound it a state actor. This majority view began takingshape even before Tarkanian, which cited two such decisionsapprovingly, see supra, at 298 (and this was six years afterBlum, Rendell-Baker, and Lugar, on which the Sixth Circuitrelied here). No one, however, has pointed to any explosionof $ 1983 cases against interscholastic athletic associations inthe affected jurisdictions. Not to put too fine a point on it,two District Courts in Tennessee have previously held theAssociation itself to be a state actor, see Graham, 1995 WL115890, at *5; Crocker v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 735 F. Supp. 753 (MD Tenn. 1990), affirmanceorder, 908 F. 2d 972, 973 (CA6 1990), but there is no evidentwave of litigation working its way across the State. A reversal of the judgment here portends nothing more than theharmony of an outlying Circuit with precedent otherwiseuniform.Nor do we think there is anything to be said for the Association's contention that there is no need to treat it as a stateactor since any public school applying the Association's rulesis itself subject to suit under $ 1983 or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. $$ 1681-1688. Brief for Respondents 30. If Brentwood's claimwere pushing at the edge of the class of possible defendantstate actors, an argument about the social utility of expand531US2 Unit: $U18 [05-01-02 10:51:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN305Cite as: 531 U. S. 288 (2001)Thomas, J., dissentinging that class would at least be on point, but because we arenowhere near the margin in this case, the Association isreally asking for nothing less than a dispensation for itself.Its position boils down to saying that the Association shouldnot be dressed in state clothes because other, concededlypublic actors are; that Brentwood should be kept out of courtbecause a different plaintiff raising a different claim in a dif-ferent case may find the courthouse open. Pleas for specialtreatment are hard to sell, although saying that does not,of course, imply anything about the merits of Brentwood'scomplaint; the issue here is merely whether Brentwoodproperly names the Association as a $ 1983 defendant, notwhether it should win on its claim.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
