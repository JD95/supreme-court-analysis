Petitioner was convicted of "willfully" dealing in fire-arms without a federal license. The question presented iswhether the term "willfully" in 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(1)(D) re-quires proof that the defendant knew that his conduct wasunlawful, or whether it also requires proof that he knew ofthe federal licensing requirement.IIn 1968 Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime Control andSafe Streets Act. 82 Stat. 197-239. In Title IV of that ActCongress made findings concerning the impact of the trafficin firearms on the prevalence of lawlessness and violentcrime in the United States 1 and amended the Criminal Code*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Gun OwnersFoundation by James H. Jeffries III and James H. Wentzel; and for theNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Barbara Bergmanand Stephen P. Halbrook.1 "Sec. 901. (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares--"(1) that there is a widespread traffic in firearms moving in or otherwiseaffecting interstate or foreign commerce, and that the existing Federalcontrols over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to controlthis traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their policepower;"(2) that the ease with which any person can acquire firearms other thana rifle or shotgun (including criminals, juveniles without the knowledgeor consent of their parents or guardians, narcotics addicts, mental defectives, armed groups who would supplant the functions of duly constituted public authorities, and others whose possession of such weaponsis similarly contrary to the public interest) is a significant factor in theprevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States;"(3) that only through adequate Federal control over interstate and foreign commerce in these weapons, and over all persons engaging in thebusinesses of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in them, can this grave524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT187Cite as: 524 U. S. 184 (1998)Opinion of the Courtto include detailed provisions regulating the use and saleof firearms. As amended, 18 U. S. C. $ 922 defined a number of "unlawful acts"; subsection (a)(1) made it unlawful forany person except a licensed dealer to engage in the businessof dealing in firearms.2 Section 923 established the federallicensing program and repeated the prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license, and $ 924 specified the pen-alties for violating "any provision of this chapter." Readliterally, $ 924 authorized the imposition of a fine of up to$5,000 or a prison sentence of not more than five years, "orboth," on any person who dealt in firearms without a licenseeven if that person believed that he or she was acting lawfully.3 As enacted in 1968, $$ 922(a)(1) and 924 omitted anexpress scienter requirement and therefore arguably imposed strict criminal liability on every unlicensed dealer infirearms. The 1968 Act also omitted any definition of theterm "engaged in the business" even though that conductwas an element of the unlawful act prohibited by $ 922(a)(1).In 1986 Congress enacted the Firearms Owners' Protec-tion Act (FOPA), in part, to cure these omissions.

The current version of this provision, which is substantially the same as the 1968 version, is codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 922(a)(1)(A).It states:"(a) It shall be unlawful--"(1) for any person--"(A) except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licenseddealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealingin firearms, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receiveany firearm in interstate or foreign commerce."3 "$ 924.

For three categories of offenses the intent requiredis that the defendant acted "knowingly"; for the fourth category, which includes "any other provision of this chapter,"the required intent is that the defendant acted "willfully." 64 "The Congress finds that--. . . . ."(b)(2) additional legislation is required to reaffirm the intent of theCongress, as expressed in section 101 of the Gun Control Act of 1968, that`it is not the purpose of this title to place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to theacquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose ofhunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any otherlawful activity, and that this title is not intended to discourage or eliminatethe private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawfulpurposes.'

S. 184 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe $ 922(a)(1)(A) 7 offense at issue in this case is an "otherprovision" in the "willfully" category.IIThe jury having found petitioner guilty, we accept theGovernment's version of the evidence. That evidenceproved that petitioner did not have a federal license to dealin firearms; that he used so-called "straw purchasers" in Ohioto acquire pistols that he could not have purchased himself;that the straw purchasers made false statements when purchasing the guns; that petitioner assured the straw purchas-ers that he would file the serial numbers off the guns; andthat he resold the guns on Brooklyn street corners known fordrug dealing. The evidence was unquestionably adequate toprove that petitioner was dealing in firearms, and that heknew that his conduct was unlawful.8 There was, however,no evidence that he was aware of the federal law that pro-hibits dealing in firearms without a federal license.Petitioner was charged with a conspiracy to violate 18U. S. C. $ 922(a)(1)(A), by willfully engaging in the business of dealing in firearms, and with a substantive viola-tion of that provision.9 After the close of evidence, petitioner requested that the trial judge instruct the jury thatpetitioner could be convicted only if he knew of the federal"(C) knowingly imports or brings into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition in violation of section 922(l); or"(D) willfully violates any other provision of this chapter,"shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years,or both."7 See n. 2, supra.8 Why else would he make use of straw purchasers and assure them thathe would shave the serial numbers off the guns? Moreover, the streetcorner sales are not consistent with a good-faith belief in the legality ofthe enterprise.9 Although the prohibition against unlicensed dealing in firearms isset forth in $ 922, see n. 2, supra, the criminal sanction is set forth in$ 924(a)(1), see n. 6, supra.524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT190 BRYAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlicensing requirement,10 but the judge rejected this request.Instead, the trial judge gave this explanation of the term"willfully":"A person acts willfully if he acts intentionally and pur-posely and with the intent to do something the law forbids, that is, with the bad purpose to disobey or to disre-gard the law. Now, the person need not be aware of thespecific law or rule that his conduct may be violating.But he must act with the intent to do something thatthe law forbids." 11Petitioner was found guilty on both counts. On appealhe argued that the evidence was insufficient because therewas no proof that he had knowledge of the federal licensingrequirement, and that the trial judge had erred by failingto instruct the jury that such knowledge was an essentialelement of the offense. The Court of Appeals affirmed.122 F. 3d 90 (CA2 1997). It concluded that the instructionswere proper and that the Government had elicited "ampleproof " that petitioner had acted willfully. App. 22.Because the Eleventh Circuit has held that it is necessaryfor the Government to prove that the defendant acted withknowledge of the licensing requirement, United States v.Sanchez-Corcino, 85 F. 3d 549, 553-554 (1996), we grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict. 522 U. S. 1024 (1997).10 "KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW"The Federal Firearms Statute which the Defendant is charged with,conspiracy to violate and with allegedly violated [sic], is a specific intentstatute. You must accordingly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant at all relevant times charged, acted with the knowledge that itwas unlawful to engage in the business of firearms distribution lawfullypurchased by a legally permissible transferee or gun purchaser.. . . . ."[Y]ou must be persuaded that with the actual knowledge of the federalfirearms licensing laws Defendant acted in knowing and intentional violation of them."

S. 184 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIIIThe word "willfully" is sometimes said to be "a word ofmany meanings" whose construction is often dependent onthe context in which it appears. See, e. g., Spies v. UnitedStates, 317 U. S. 492, 497 (1943). Most obviously it differ-entiates between deliberate and unwitting conduct, but inthe criminal law it also typically refers to a culpable stateof mind. As we explained in United States v. Murdock, 290U. S. 389 (1933), a variety of phrases have been used to de-scribe that concept.12 As a general matter, when used inthe criminal context, a "willful" act is one undertaken witha "bad purpose."13 In other words, in order to establish a12 "The word often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, orvoluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose (Felton v.United States, 96 U. S. 699; Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 438; Spurrv. United States, 174 U. S. 728); without justifiable excuse (Felton v.United States, supra; Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272; 57 Pac. 701; Peoplev. Jewell, 138 Mich 620; 101 N. W. 835; St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry.

The word is also employed to characterize a thingdone without ground for believing it is lawful (Roby v. Newton, 121 Ga.679; 49 S. E. 694), or conduct marked by careless disregard whether or notone has the right so to act, United States v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co.,223 Fed. 207, 210; State v. Savre, 129 Iowa 122; 105 N. W. 387; State v.Morgan, 136 N. C. 628; 48 S. E. 670." 290 U. S., at 394-395.13 See, e. g., Heikkinen v. United States, 355 U. S. 273, 279 (1958) ("Therecan be no willful failure by a deportee, in the sense of $ 20(c), to applyto, and identify, a country willing to receive him in the absence of evidence . . . of a `bad purpose' or `[non-]justifiable excuse,' or the like. . . .[I]t cannot be said that he acted `willfully'--i. e., with a `bad purpose' orwithout `justifiable excuse' "); United States v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"willful" violation of a statute, "the Government must provethat the defendant acted with knowledge that his conductwas unlawful." Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 137(1994).Petitioner argues that a more particularized showing isrequired in this case for two principal reasons. First, heargues that the fact that Congress used the adverb "knowingly" to authorize punishment of three categories of actsmade unlawful by $ 922 and the word "willfully" when it referred to unlicensed dealing in firearms demonstrates thatthe Government must shoulder a special burden in cases likethis. This argument is not persuasive because the term"knowingly" does not necessarily have any reference to aculpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law. As Justice Jackson correctly observed, "the knowledge requisiteto knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law." 14 Thus, in Unitedintent to do it or to omit doing it. `The word "wilfully," ' says Chief Justice Shaw, `in the ordinary sense in which it is used in statutes, means notmerely "voluntarily," but with a bad purpose.' 20 Pick. (Mass.) 220. `Itis frequently understood,' says Bishop, `as signifying an evil intent without justifiable excuse.' Crim. Law, vol. i. sect. 428"); 1 L. Sand, J. Siffert,W. Loughlin, & S. Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions || 3A.01,p. 3A-18 (1997) (" `Willfully' means to act with knowledge that one's conduct is unlawful and with the intent to do something the law forbids, thatis to say with the bad purpose to disobey or to disregard the law").14 In his opinion dissenting from the Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing punishment for the knowing violation of an Interstate Commerce regulation, Justice Jackson wrote:"It is further suggested that a defendant is protected against indefiniteness because conviction is authorized only for knowing violations.The argument seems to be that the jury can find that defendant knowinglyviolated the regulation only if it finds that it knew the meaning of theregulation he was accused of violating. With the exception of Screws v.United States, 325 U. S. 91, which rests on a very particularized basis,the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law. I do not suppose theCourt intends to suggest that if petitioner knew nothing of the existence524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT193Cite as: 524 U. S. 184 (1998)Opinion of the CourtStates v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394 (1980), we held that the prose-cution fulfills its burden of proving a knowing violation ofthe escape statute "if it demonstrates that an escapee knewhis actions would result in his leaving physical confinementwithout permission." Id., at 408. And in Staples v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), we held that a charge that thedefendant's possession of an unregistered machinegun wasunlawful required proof "that he knew the weapon he pos-sessed had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun." Id., at 602. It was not,however, necessary to prove that the defendant knew thathis possession was unlawful. See Rogers v. United States,522 U. S. 252, 254-255 (1998) (plurality opinion). Thus, unless the text of the statute dictates a different result,15 theterm "knowingly" merely requires proof of knowledge of thefacts that constitute the offense.With respect to the three categories of conduct that aremade punishable by $ 924 if performed "knowingly," thebackground presumption that every citizen knows the lawmakes it unnecessary to adduce specific evidence to provethat "an evil-meaning mind" directed the "evil-doing hand."16More is required, however, with respect to the conduct inthe fourth category that is only criminal when done "willfully." The jury must find that the defendant acted with anevil-meaning mind, that is to say, that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.Petitioner next argues that we must read $ 924(a)(1)(D)to require knowledge of the law because of our interof such a regulation its ignorance would constitute a defense." BoyceMotor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 337, 345 (1952).15 Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), was such a case. Wethere concluded that both the term "knowing" in 7 U. S. C. $ 2024(c) andthe term "knowingly" in $ 2024(b)(1) literally referred to knowledge of thelaw as well as knowledge of the relevant facts. See id., at 428-430.16 Justice Jackson's translation of the terms mens rea and actus reus isfound in his opinion for the Court in Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.246, 251 (1952).524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT194 BRYAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtpretation of "willfully" in two other contexts. In certaincases involving willful violations of the tax laws, we haveconcluded that the jury must find that the defendant wasaware of the specific provision of the tax code that he wascharged with violating. See, e. g., Cheek v. United States,498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991).17 Similarly, in order to satisfy awillful violation inRatzlaf, we concluded that the jury hadto find that the defendant knew that his structuring ofcash transactions to avoid a reporting requirement was unlawful. See 510 U. S., at 138, 149. Those cases, however,are readily distinguishable. Both the tax cases 18 and Ratzlaf 19 involved highly technical statutes that presented thedanger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct.20 As a result, we held that these statutes17 Even in tax cases, we have not always required this heightened mensrea. In United States v. Pomponio, 429 U. S. 10 (1976) (per curiam), forexample, the jury was instructed that a willful act is one done "with [the]bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law." Id., at 11. Weapproved of this instruction, concluding that "[t]he trial judge . . . adequately instructed the jury on willfulness." Id., at 13.18 As we stated in Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199-200 (1991):"The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made itdifficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of theduties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. Congress has accordinglysoftened the impact of the common-law presumption by making specificintent to violate the law an element of certain federal criminal tax offenses. Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutoryterm `willfully' as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving outan exception to the traditional rule [that every person is presumed toknow the law]. This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largelydue to the complexity of the tax laws."19 See Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 31, n. 6 (1997) (noting thatRatzlaf's holding was based on the "particular statutory context of currency structuring"); Ratzlaf, 510 U. S., at 149 (Court's holding based on"particular contex[t]" of currency structuring statute).20 Id., at 144-145 ("[C]urrency structuring is not inevitably nefarious. . . .Nor is a person who structures a currency transaction invariably motivated by a desire to keep the Government in the dark"; Government'sconstruction of the statute would criminalize apparently innocent activity); Cheek, 498 U.

'United States v. Bishop, 412 U. S. 346, 360-361 (1973) (quoting Spies v.United States, 317 U. S. 492, 496 (1943))"); Murdock, 290 U. S., at 396("Congress did not intend that a person, by reason of a bona fide misunderstanding as to his liability for the tax, as to his duty to make a return, oras to the adequacy of the records he maintained, should become a criminalby his mere failure to measure up to the prescribed standard of conduct").21 Cheek, 498 U. S., at 200; see also Ratzlaf, 510 U. S., at 149 (noting the"venerable principle that ignorance of the law generally is no defense to acriminal charge," but concluding that Congress intended otherwise in the"particular contex[t]" of the currency structuring statute).22 Even before Ratzlaf was decided, then-Chief Judge Breyer explainedwhy there was a need for specificity under those statutes that is inapplicable when there is no danger of conviction of a defendant with an innocentstate of mind. He wrote:"I believe that criminal prosecutions for `currency law' violations, of thesort at issue here, very much resemble criminal prosecutions for tax lawviolations. Compare 26 U. S. C. $$ 6050I, 7203 with 31 U. S. C. $$ 5322,5324. Both sets of laws are technical; and both sets of laws sometimescriminalize conduct that would not strike an ordinary citizen as immoralor likely unlawful. Thus, both sets of laws may lead to the unfair resultof criminally prosecuting individuals who subjectively and honestly believe they have not acted criminally. Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S.192 . . . (1991), sets forth a legal standard that, by requiring proof that thedefendant was subjectively aware of the duty at issue, would avoid suchunfair results." United States v. Aversa, 984 F. 2d 493, 502 (CA1 1993)(concurring opinion).He therefore concluded that the "same standards should apply in both"the tax cases and in cases such as Ratzlaf. 984 F. 2d, at 503.23 Moreover, requiring only knowledge that the conduct is unlawful isfully consistent with the purpose of FOPA, as FOPA was enacted to protect law-abiding citizens who might inadvertently violate the law. See524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT196 BRYAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThus, the willfulness requirement of $ 924(a)(1)(D) does notcarve out an exception to the traditional rule that ignoranceof the law is no excuse; knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is all that is required.IVPetitioner advances a number of additional argumentsbased on his reading of congressional intent. Petitioner firstpoints to the legislative history of FOPA, but that historyis too ambiguous to offer petitioner much assistance. Petitioner's main support lies in statements made by opponentsof the bill.24 As we have stated, however, "[t]he fears anddoubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to theconstruction of legislation." Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S. 384, 394 (1951). "In theirzeal to defeat a bill, they understandably tend to overstateits reach." NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58, 66 (1964).25Petitioner next argues that, at the time FOPA was passed,the "willfulness" requirements in other subsections ofthe statute--$$ 923(d)(1)(C)-(D)--had uniformly been interpreted by lower courts to require knowledge of the law; petitioner argues that Congress intended that "willfully" shouldhave the same meaning in $ 924(a)(1)(D). As an initial matter, the lower courts had come to no such agreement. Whilesome courts had stated that willfulness in $ 923(d)(1) is satisn. 4, supra; see also United States v. Andrade, 135 F. 3d 104, 108-109(CA1 1998).24 For example, Representative Hughes, a staunch opponent of the bill,stated that the willfulness requirement would "make it next to impossibleto convict dealers, particularly those who engage in business without acquiring a license, because the prosecution would have to show that thedealer was personally aware of every detail of the law, and that he made aconscious decision to violate the law." 132 Cong. Rec. 6875 (1986). Evenpetitioner's amicus acknowledges that this statement was "undoubtedlyan exaggeration."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcases support the notion that disregard of a known legal obli-gation is sufficient to establish a willful violation, they in noway stand for the proposition that it is required.31Finally, petitioner argues that $ 922(b)(3), which is governed by $ 924(a)(1)(D)'s willfulness standard, indicates thatCongress intended "willfully" to include knowledge of thelaw. Section 922(b)(3) prohibits licensees from selling fire-arms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonablecause to believe does not reside in the licensee's State, exceptwhere,inter alia, the transaction fully complies with thelaws of both the seller's and buyer's State. The subsectionfurther states that the licensee "shall be presumed, . . . inthe absence of evidence to the contrary, to have had actualknowledge of the State laws and published ordinances ofboth States."32 Although petitioner argues that the presumption in $ 922(b)(3) indicates that Congress intended will-fulness to require knowledge of the law for all offenses covered by $ 924(a)(1)(D), petitioner is mistaken. As notedabove, while disregard of a known legal obligation is certhe owner of the pawnshop, as well as his employees, had knowledge ofthe law).31 In Mayesh, for example, the court stated:"The uncontroverted evidence shows clearly that plaintiff was aware ofthe above holding period requirements. Mr. Mayesh had been previouslyadvised on the requirements under Illinois law, and he clearly acknowledged that he was aware of them. . . . Since the material facts are undisputed, as a matter of law the plaintiff clearly and knowingly violated theIllinois holding provisions . . . , and hence, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(b)(2). Thiscourt can only consider such action to have been `wilful' as a matter oflaw. There is no basis for trial of any disputed facts in this connection.This is sufficient to justify refusal of license renewal." 58 F. R. D., at 540.See also, e. g., Perri, 637 F. 2d, at 1336 (stating that when a dealer understands the requirements of the law, but knowingly fails to follow them oris indifferent to them, willfulness "is established," i. e., is satisfied); Stein's,649 F. 2d, at 468 ("Evidence of repeated violations with knowledge of thelaw's requirements has been held sufficient to establish willfulness" (emphasis added)); McLemore, 317 F.

S. 184 (1998)Opinion of the Courttainly sufficient to establish a willful violation, it is not necessary--and nothing in $ 922(b)(3) contradicts this basicdistinction.33VOne sentence in the trial court's instructions to the jury,read by itself, contained a misstatement of the law. In aportion of the instructions that were given after the correctstatement that we have already quoted, the judge stated:"In this case, the government is not required to prove thatthe defendant knew that a license was required, nor is thegovernment required to prove that he had knowledge that hewas breaking the law." App. 19 (emphasis added). If thejudge had added the words "that required a license," thesentence would have been accurate, but as given it was not.Nevertheless, that error does not provide a basis for reversal for four reasons. First, petitioner did not object tothat sentence, except insofar as he had argued that thejury should have been instructed that the Government hadthe burden of proving that he had knowledge of the federallicensing requirement. Second, in the context of the entireinstructions, it seems unlikely that the jury was misled.See, e. g., United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658, 674-675 (1975).Third, petitioner failed to raise this argument in the Courtof Appeals. Finally, our grant of certiorari was limited to33 Petitioner also argues that the statutory language--"willfully violatesany other provision of this chapter"--indicates a congressional intent toattach liability only when a defendant possesses specific knowledge of the"provision[s] of [the] chapter." We rejected a similar argument in UnitedStates v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558 (1971).Although that case involved the word "knowingly" (in the phrase "knowingly violates any such regulation"), the response is the same:"We . . . see no reason why the word `regulations' [or the phrase `anyother provision of this chapter'] should not be construed as a shorthanddesignation for specific acts or omissions which violate the Act. The Act,so viewed, does not signal an exception to the rule that ignorance of thelaw is no excuse . . . ." Id., at 562.524us1$82I 02-22-99 22:42:40 PAGES OPINPGT200 BRYAN v.
