CABRALESOpinion of the Courtfrom the unlawful distribution of cocaine in Missouri. Thedefendant, respondent Vickie S. Cabrales, is not alleged tohave transported funds from Missouri to Florida. Nor is shecharged, in the counts before us, with participation in theMissouri cocaine distribution that generated the funds inquestion. In accord with the Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit, we hold that Missouri is not a proper placefor trial of the money-laundering offenses at issue.IIn a three-count indictment returned in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri, Cabrales, as sole defendant, was charged with the following of-fenses: conspiracy to avoid a transaction-reporting requirement, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii)(Count I); conducting a financial transaction to avoid atransaction-reporting requirement, in violation of $ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii) (Count II); and engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than$10,000, in violation of $ 1957 (Count III). The indictmentalleged that, in January 1991, Cabrales deposited $40,000with the AmSouth Bank of Florida and, within a week'sspan, made four separate withdrawals of $9,500 each fromthat bank. The money deposited and withdrawn was traceable to illegal sales of cocaine in Missouri.Cabrales moved to dismiss the indictment in its entiretyfor improper venue. On recommendation of the Magistrate,the District Court denied the motion as to Count I, the conspiracy count, based on the Government's assertions that Ca-brales "was present in Missouri during the conspiracy, livedwith a conspirator in Missouri, and participated in variousactivities in Missouri in furtherance of the conspiracy."App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a, 14a-15a. Also on the Magistrate'srecommendation, the District Court granted the motion todismiss Counts II and III, the money-laundering counts, be-cause the deposit and withdrawals occurred in Florida and524us1$71P 02-16-99 22:29:48 PAGES OPINPGT5Cite as: 524 U.

(quoting United States v.Anderson, 328 U. S. 699, 703 (1946)). "Continuing offenses,"the Court of Appeals recognized, those "begun in one districtand completed in another," 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a), may be tried" `in any district in which such [an] offense was begun, continued, or completed.' " 109 F. 3d, at 472 (quoting $ 3237(a)).But "Cabrales was not accused of a `continuing offense,' "the Eighth Circuit said, ibid.; "[s]he was charged with moneylaundering, for transactions which began, continued, andwere completed only in Florida," ibid. "That the moneycame from Missouri is of no moment," the Court of Appealsnext observed, for "Cabrales dealt with it only in Florida."Ibid. The money-laundering counts "include[d] no act committed by Cabrales in Missouri," the Eighth Circuit emphasized, nor did "the [G]overnment charge that Cabrales transported the money from Missouri to Florida." Ibid.The Government urges that, in conflict with the EighthCircuit, other Courts of Appeals "have held that venue formoney laundering offenses is proper in the district in whichthe funds were unlawfully generated, even if the financialtransaction that constitutes the laundering occurred whollywithin another district."

Wegranted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 522 U. S. 1072(1998), and now affirm the Eighth Circuit's judgment.IIProper venue in criminal proceedings was a matter of con-cern to the Nation's founders. Their complaints against theKing of Great Britain, listed in the Declaration of Inde-pendence, included his transportation of colonists "beyondSeas to be tried." 1 The Constitution twice safeguards thedefendant's venue right: Article III, $ 2, cl. 3, instructs that"Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State wherethe said Crimes shall have been committed"; the SixthAmendment calls for trial "by an impartial jury of theState and district wherein the crime shall have been committed." Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-cedure, providing that "prosecution shall be had in a districtin which the offense was committed," echoes the constitu-tional commands.We adhere to the general guide invoked and applied bythe Eighth Circuit: "[T]he locus delicti must be determined1 The Declaration recited among injuries and usurpations attributedto the King: "transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretendedoffences." The Declaration of Independence, para. 21 (1776). A complaint of the same tenor appeared earlier, in the 1769 "Virginia Resolves."See Blume, The Place of Trial of Criminal Cases: Constitutional Vicinageand Venue, 43 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 64 (1944). Parliament had decreed thatcolonists charged with treason could be tried in England. See 16 Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to Year 1803,pp. 476-510 (T. Hansard ed. 1813). In response, the Virginia House ofBurgesses unanimously passed a resolution condemning the practice ofsending individuals "beyond the Sea, to be tried" as "highly derogatoryof the Rights of British subjects." Journals of the House of Burgesses ofVirginia, 1766-1769, p. 214 (J. Kennedy ed. 1906).524us1$71P 02-16-99 22:29:48 PAGES OPINPGT7Cite as: 524 U. S. 1 (1998)Opinion of the Courtfrom the nature of the crime alleged and the location of theact or acts constituting it."Anderson, 328 U. S., at 703.Here, the crimes described in Counts II and III are definedin statutory proscriptions, 18 U. S. C. $$ 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii),1957, that interdict only the financial transactions (acts located entirely in Florida), not the anterior criminal conductthat yielded the funds allegedly laundered.Congress has provided by statute for offenses "begun inone district and completed in another"; such offenses may be"prosecuted in any district in which [the] offense was begun,continued, or completed." 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a). The Government urges that the money-laundering crimes describedin Counts II and III of the indictment against Cabrales fitthe $ 3237(a) description. We therefore confront and decidethis question: Do those counts charge crimes begun in Missouri and completed in Florida, rendering venue proper inMissouri, or do they delineate crimes that took place whollywithin Florida?Notably, the counts at issue do not charge Cabrales withconspiracy; they do not link her to, or assert her responsibility for, acts done by others. Nor do they charge her as anaider or abettor in the Missouri drug trafficking. See 18U. S. C. $ 2 (one who aids or abets an offense "is punishable asa principal"). Cabrales is charged in the money-launderingcounts with criminal activity "after the fact" of an offensebegun and completed by others. Cf. $ 3 ("Whoever, knowingthat an offense against the United States has been committed, . . . assists the offender in order to hinder or preventhis . . . punishment, is an accessory after the fact," punishablenot as a principal, but by a term of imprisonment or finegenerally "not more than one-half the maximum . . . prescribed for the punishment of the principal[.]").Whenever a defendant acts "after the fact" to conceal acrime, it might be said, as the Government urges in thiscase, that the first crime is an essential element of thesecond, see Brief for United States 9, and that the second524us1$71P 02-16-99 22:29:48 PAGES OPINPGT8 UNITED STATES v. CABRALESOpinion of the Courtfacilitated the first or made it profitable by impeding its detection, see id., at 14. But the question here is the placeappropriate to try the "after the fact" actor. As the Government recognizes, it is immaterial whether that actorknew where the first crime was committed. See Tr. of OralArg. 5-6. The money launderer must know she is dealingwith funds derived from "specified unlawful activity," here,drug trafficking, but the Missouri venue of that activity is, asthe Eighth Circuit said, "of no moment." 109 F. 3d, at 472.2Money laundering, the Court of Appeals acknowledged,arguably might rank as a "continuing offense," triable inmore than one place, if the launderer acquired the funds inone district and transported them into another. Id., at 473.But that is tellingly not this case. In the counts at issue,the Government indicted Cabrales "for transactions whichbegan, continued, and were completed only in Florida." Id.,at 472. Under these circumstances, venue in Missouri isimproper.The Government identified Hyde v. United States, 225U. S. 347 (1912), and In re Palliser, 136 U. S. 257 (1890), asthe two best cases for its position that money launderers canin all cases be prosecuted at the place where the funds theyhandled were generated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. Neitherdecision warrants the ruling the Government here seeks.In Hyde, the defendants were convicted in the Districtof Columbia of conspiracy to defraud the United States.Although none of the defendants had entered the District aspart of the conspiracy, venue was nevertheless appropriate,the Court ruled, based on the overt acts of a co-conspiratorthere. 225 U. S., at 363. By contrast, the counts at issuein this case allege no conspiracy. They describe activity inwhich Cabrales alone, untied to others, engaged.2 Cf. United States v. Lanoue, 137 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA1 1998) (stating thatcrime of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 922(g)(1), occurs only where the firearm is actually possessed).524us1$71P 02-16-99 22:29:48 PAGES OPINPGT9Cite as: 524 U.

The Courtheld that the defendant could be prosecuted in Connecticut,where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received.136 U. S., at 266-268. The Palliser opinion simply recog-nizes that a mailing to Connecticut is properly ranked as anact completed in that State. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 3237(a) ("Anyoffense involving the use of the mails . . . is a continuingoffense and . . . may be . . . prosecuted in any district from,through, or into which such . . . mail matter . . . moves.");United States v. Johnson, 323 U. S. 273, 275 (1944) (consistentwith the Constitution "an illegal use of the mails . . . maysubject the user to prosecution in the district where he sentthe goods, or in the district of their arrival, or in any intervening district"). Cabrales, however, dispatched no missivefrom one State into another. The counts before us portrayher and the money she deposited and withdrew as movinginside Florida only.Finally, the Government urges the efficiency of tryingCabrales in Missouri, because evidence in that State, and notin Florida, shows that the money Cabrales allegedly laundered derived from unlawful activity. Although recognizingthat the venue requirement is principally a protection for thedefendant, Reply Brief 10, the Government further maintains that its convenience, and the interests of the community victimized by drug dealers, merit consideration.But if Cabrales is in fact linked to the drug-traffickingactivity, the Government is not disarmed from showing thatis the case. She can be, and indeed has been, charged withconspiring with the drug dealers in Missouri. If the Government can prove the agreement it has alleged, Cabralescan be prosecuted in Missouri for that confederacy, and hermoney laundering in Florida could be shown as overt acts infurtherance of the conspiracy. See 18 U. S. C. $ 371 (requiring proof of an "act to effect the object of the conspiracy").524us1$71P 02-16-99 22:29:48 PAGES OPINPGT10 UNITED STATES v.
