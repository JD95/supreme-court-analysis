The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) prohibits discrimina-tion in housing against,inter alios, persons with handicaps.1Section 807(b)(1) of the Act entirely exempts from the FHA'scompass "any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictionsregarding the maximum number of occupants permitted tooccupy a dwelling." 42 U. S. C. $ 3607(b)(1). This case pre-sents the question whether a provision in petitioner Cityof Edmonds' zoning code qualifies for $ 3607(b)(1)'s com-plete exemption from FHA scrutiny. The provision, governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defines"family" as "persons [without regard to number] related bygenetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer[unrelated] persons." Edmonds Community DevelopmentCode (ECDC) $ 21.30.010 (1991).The defining provision at issue describes who may compose a family unit; it does not prescribe "the maximum num-ber of occupants" a dwelling unit may house. We hold that$ 3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the family-defining kind, i. e., provisions designed to foster the familycharacter of a neighborhood. Instead, $ 3607(b)(1)'s absoluteexemption removes from the FHA's scope only total occupancy limits, i. e., numerical ceilings that serve to preventovercrowding in living quarters.IIn the summer of 1990, respondent Oxford House openeda group home in the City of Edmonds, Washington (City), for1 The FHA, as originally enacted in 1968, prohibited discriminationbased on race, color, religion, or national origin. See 82 Stat. 83. Proscription of discrimination based on sex was added in 1974. See Housing andCommunity Development Act of 1974, $ 808(b), 88 Stat. 729. In 1988, Congress extended coverage to persons with handicaps and also prohibited"familial status" discrimination, i. e., discrimination against parents orother custodial persons domiciled with children under the age of 18. 42U.

J., dissenting) (purpose of East Cleveland'ssingle-family zoning ordinance "is the traditional one of pre-serving certain areas as family residential communities").To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipalitymust define the term "family"; thus family composition rulesare an essential component of single-family residential userestrictions.Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, capthe number of occupants per dwelling, typically in relationto available floor space or the number and type of rooms.See, e. g., International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Housing Code $ 503(b) (1988); Building Officials andCode Administrators International, Inc., BOCA NationalProperty Maintenance Code $$ PM-405.3, PM-405.5 (1993)(hereinafter BOCA Code); Southern Building Code Congress, International, Inc., Standard Housing Code $$ 306.1,306.2 (1991); E.

In response to EastCleveland's argument that its aim was to prevent overcrowded dwellings, streets, and schools, we observed thatthe municipality's restrictive definition of family served theasserted, and undeniably legitimate, goals "marginally, atbest."Id., at 500 (footnote omitted). Another East Cleveland ordinance, we noted, "specifically addressed . . . theproblem of overcrowding"; that ordinance tied "the maximum permissible occupancy of a dwelling to the habitablefloor area." Id., at 500, n. 7; accord, id., at 520, n. 16 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Stewart, in dissent, also distinguished restrictions designed to "preserv[e]the character of a residential area," from prescription of "aminimum habitable floor area per person," id., at 539, n. 9, inthe interest of community health and safety.7Section 3607(b)(1)'s language--"restrictions regarding themaximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling"--surely encompasses maximum occupancy restrictions.87 Other courts and commentators have similarly differentiated betweenland-use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions.

In sum, rules that capthe total number of occupants in order to prevent overcrowding of a dwelling "plainly and unmistakably," see A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U. S. 490, 493 (1945), fall within$ 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption from the FHA's governance; rules designed to preserve the family characterof a neighborhood, fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants livingquarters can contain, do not.9BTurning specifically to the City's Community DevelopmentCode, we note that the provisions Edmonds invoked againstOxford House, ECDC $$ 16.20.010 and 21.30.010, are classicexamples of a use restriction and complementing family composition rule. These provisions do not cap the number ofpeople who may live in a dwelling. In plain terms, they di9 Tellingly, Congress added the $ 3607(b)(1) exemption for maximum occupancy restrictions at the same time it enlarged the FHA to include aban on discrimination based on "familial status." See supra, at 728, n. 1.The provision making it illegal to discriminate in housing against familieswith children under the age of 18 prompted fears that landlords would beforced to allow large families to crowd into small housing units. See, e. g.,Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987: Hearings on H.

Section 3607(b)(1) makes itplain that, pursuant to local prescriptions on maximum occupancy, landlords legitimately may refuse to stuff large families into small quarters.Congress further assured in $ 3607(b)(1) that retirement communitieswould be exempt from the proscription of discrimination against familieswith minor children.

Cap-tioned "USES," ECDC $ 16.20.010 provides that the sole"Permitted Primary Us[e]" in a single-family residentialzone is "[s]ingle-family dwelling units." Edmonds itself recognizes that this provision simply "defines those uses per-mitted in a single family residential zone." Pet. for Cert. 3.A separate provision caps the number of occupants adwelling may house, based on floor area:"Floor Area. Every dwelling unit shall have at leastone room which shall have not less than 120 square feetof floor area. Other habitable rooms, except kitchens,shall have an area of not less than 70 square feet.Where more than two persons occupy a room used forsleeping purposes, the required floor area shall be increased at the rate of 50 square feet for each occupantin excess of two." ECDC $ 19.10.000 (adopting UniformHousing Code $ 503(b) (1988)).10This space and occupancy standard is a prototypical maxi-mum occupancy restriction.Edmonds nevertheless argues that its family compositionrule, ECDC $ 21.30.010, falls within $ 3607(b)(1), the FHAexemption for maximum occupancy restrictions, because therule caps at five the number of unrelated persons allowed tooccupy a single-family dwelling. But Edmonds' family com-position rule surely does not answer the question: "What isthe maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy ahouse?" So long as they are related "by genetics, adoption,or marriage," any number of people can live in a house. Tensiblings, their parents and grandparents, for example, coulddwell in a house in Edmonds' single-family residential zonewithout offending Edmonds' family composition rule.10 An exception to this provision sets out requirements for efficiencyunits in apartment buildings.

S. 725 (1995)Opinion of the CourtFamily living, not living space per occupant, is whatECDC $ 21.30.010 describes. Defining family primarily bybiological and legal relationships, the provision also accommodates another group association: Five or fewer unrelatedpeople are allowed to live together as though they were family. This accommodation is the peg on which Edmonds restsits plea for $ 3607(b)(1) exemption. Had the City defined afamily solely by biological and legal links, $ 3607(b)(1) wouldnot have been the ground on which Edmonds staked its case.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12, 16. It is curious reasoning indeed that converts a family values preserver into a maximumoccupancy restriction once a town adds to a related personsprescription "and also two unrelated persons." 11Edmonds additionally contends that subjecting singlefamily zoning to FHA scrutiny will "overturn Euclidian zoning" and "destroy the effectiveness and purpose of singlefamily zoning." Brief for Petitioner 11, 25. This contentionboth ignores the limited scope of the issue before us andexaggerates the force of the FHA's antidiscrimination provisions. We address only whether Edmonds' family composition rule qualifies for $ 3607(b)(1) exemption. Moreover, theFHA antidiscrimination provisions, when applicable, requireonly "reasonable" accommodations to afford persons withhandicaps "equal opportunity to use and enjoy" housing.$$ 3604(f )(1)(A) and (f )(3)(B).11 This curious reasoning drives the dissent. If Edmonds allowed onlyrelated persons (whatever their number) to dwell in a house in a singlefamily zone, then the dissent, it appears, would agree that the $ 3607(b)(1)exemption is unavailable. But so long as the City introduces a specificnumber--any number (two will do)--the City can insulate its single-familyzone entirely from FHA coverage. The exception-takes-the-rule readingthe dissent advances is hardly the "generous construction" warranted forantidiscrimination prescriptions. See Trafficante v. Metropolitan LifeIns. Co., 409 U.
