In 1983 and thereafter the Florida Legislature enacted aseries of statutes authorizing the department of correctionsto award early release credits to prison inmates when thepopulation of the state prison system exceeded predetermined levels. The question presented by this case iswhether a 1992 statute canceling such credits for certainclasses of offenders after they had been awarded--indeed,after they had resulted in the prisoners' release from custody--violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the FederalConstitution.IIn 1986 petitioner pleaded nolo contendere to a charge ofattempted murder and received a sentence of 22 years (8,030days) in prison. In 1992 the Florida Department of Correc-tions released him from prison based on its determinationthat he had accumulated five different types of early releasecredits totaling 5,668 days.1 Of that total, 1,860 days were*Chet Kaufman filed a brief for the Florida Public Defender Association, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal.A brief of amici curiae urging affirmance was filed for the State ofNevada et al. by Frankie Sue Del Papa, Attorney General of Nevada, andAnne B.

Shortly after petitioner's release, the state attorney general issued an opinion interpreting a 1992 statute ashaving retroactively canceled all provisional credits awardedto inmates convicted of murder or attempted murder. Peti-tioner was therefore rearrested and returned to custody.His new release date was set for May 19, 1998.In 1994 petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the retroactive cancellation of provisionalcredits violated theEx Post Facto Clause. Relying on Elev-enth Circuit2 and Florida 3 precedent holding that the revocation of provisional credits did not violate the Ex Post FactoClause because their sole purpose was to alleviate prisonovercrowding, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissalof the petition. The District Court adopted that recommendation, dismissed the petition, and denied a certificate ofprobable cause. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit also denied a certificate of probable cause in an unpub-lished order. Because the Court of Appeals for the TenthCircuit reached a different conclusion on similar facts, Arnold v. Cody, 951 F. 2d 280 (1991), we granted certiorari toresolve the conflict. 517 U.

See 1983 Fla.

Relying on Dugger, the Florida Supreme Court held in Griffin v.Singletary, 638 So. 2d 500 (1994), that cancellation of provisional creditsactually awarded to a prisoner did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.Respondents have not suggested any reason why the Florida courts wouldhave decided petitioner's case differently.5 In 1980 the Florida Department of Corrections consented to the entryof a decree establishing a limit on the prison population that could notbe exceeded without court approval. See Costello v. Wainwright, 489F. Supp. 1100 (MD Fla. 1980). In 1982 a special session of the legislaturecreated a Corrections Overcrowding Task Force, which drafted the 1983legislation.6 1983 Fla.

In conveyingthis information, the secretary of the department shall certify the rateddesign capacity, maximum capacity, lawful capacity, system maximum capacity, and current population of the state correctional system. When theGovernor verifies such certification by letter, the secretary shall declare astate of emergency."(2) Following the declaration of a state of emergency, the sentences ofall inmates in the system who are eligible to earn gain-time shall be re519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 LYNCE v.

In 1987 the legislatureraised the threshold for awarding emergency release creditsfrom 98% to 99% of capacity. At the same time, the legislature authorized a new form of overcrowding credit, administrative gain-time, with a 98% threshold, which authorized upto a maximum of 60 days additional gain-time to inmatesalready earning incentive gain-time. Inmates serving sentences for certain offenses were ineligible for the awards.In 1988 the legislature repealed the administrative gain-timeprovision, and replaced it with a provisional credits system.9The language of the provisional credits statute was virtuallyidentical to that of the administrative gain-time statute--italso authorized up to 60 days of gain-time but was triggeredwhen the inmate population reached 97.5% of capacity. Inaddition, the legislature expanded the list of offenders whowere ineligible for the awards.Having received overcrowding gain-time under the administrative gain-time and provisional credits statutes, as wellas basic and incentive gain-time, petitioner was releasedfrom prison in 1992. That same year, the legislature canceled provisional overcrowding credits for certain classes ofduced by the credit of up to 30 days gain-time in 5-day increments asmay be necessary to reduce the inmate population to 97 percent of lawfulcapacity." 1983 Fla.

The only overcrowding credit system in place today in Florida is the "control release"provision, first enacted in 1989, which authorizes release from incarceration rather than gain-time to control prison population.

We consider the arguments separately.IIIThe presumption against the retroactive application ofnew laws is an essential thread in the mantle of protectionthat the law affords the individual citizen. That presump-tion "is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies alegal doctrine centuries older than our Republic." Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265 (1994).

Stat. $ 944.277 (1989). The Florida Department ofCorrections interpreted the 1989 amendments, and subsequent amendments enacted in 1990 and 1991 which contained the same exclusion, toapply prospectively. The 1992 amendment at issue in this case was originally interpreted by the department of corrections to apply only prospectively, but the subsequent 1992 opinion by the attorney general concludedthat the statute applied retroactively.11 Department of Corrections Letter of July 9, 1996, App. to Brief forFlorida Public Defender Association, Inc., as Amicus Curiae. The petitioner's administrative gain-time credits were also canceled, but he doesnot challenge that action.519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN440 LYNCE v.

In both the civil andthe criminal context, the Constitution places limits on thesovereign's ability to use its lawmaking power to modify bar-gains it has made with its subjects. The basic principle isone that protects not only the rich and the powerful, UnitedStates v. Winstar Corp., 518 U. S. 839 (1996), but also theindigent defendant engaged in negotiations that may lead toan acknowledgment of guilt and a suitable punishment.Article I, $ 10, of the Federal Constitution provides that"[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law." In hisopinion for the Court inBeazell v. Ohio, 269 U.

S. 433 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe bulk of our ex post facto jurisprudence has involvedclaims that a law has inflicted "a greater punishment, thanthe law annexed to the crime, when committed." Calder v.Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (emphasis deleted).13 We haveexplained that such laws implicate the central concerns oftheEx Post Facto Clause: "the lack of fair notice and govern-mental restraint when the legislature increases punishmentbeyond what was prescribed when the crime was consum-mated." Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 30 (1981).To fall within the ex post facto prohibition, a law mustbe retrospective--that is, "it must apply to events occurringbefore its enactment"--and it "must disadvantage the of-fender affected by it,"id., at 29, by altering the definition ofcriminal conduct or increasing the punishment for the crime,see Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 50 (1990). In thiscase the operation of the 1992 statute to effect the cancellation of overcrowding credits and the consequent reincar-ceration of petitioner was clearly retrospective. The narrow issue that we must decide is thus whether thoseconsequences disadvantaged petitioner by increasing hispunishment.In arguing that the cancellation of overcrowding creditsinflicts greater punishment, petitioner relies primarily onour decision inWeaver v. Graham, in which we consideredwhether retroactively decreasing the amount of gain-timeawarded for an inmate's good behavior violated the Ex PostFacto Clause. In that case the petitioner had pleaded guilty13 This case falls in the third of the four categories of ex post facto lawsdescribed by Justice Chase: "1st. Every law that makes an action donebefore the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal;and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, ormakes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law thatchanges the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the lawannexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters thelegal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than thelaw required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order toconvict the offender."

MATHISOpinion of the Courtto second-degree murder and had been sentenced to prisonfor 15 years. At the time of Weaver's plea, Florida law provided credits contingent on the good conduct of the prisonerof 5 days per month for the first two years of his sentence,10 days per month for the third and fourth years, and 15days per month thereafter. The law therefore provided himwith an opportunity to be released after serving less thannine years of his sentence. In 1978 the Florida Legislatureenacted a new formula for computing gain-time; instead of5, 10, and 15 days per month, it authorized only 3, 6, and 9days. The new statute did not withdraw any credits alreadyawarded to Weaver, but by curtailing the availability of future credits it effectively postponed the date when he wouldbecome eligible for early release. Because the statute madethe punishment for crimes committed before its enactment"more onerous," we unanimously concluded that it ran "afoulof the prohibition against ex post facto laws." 450 U. S., at 36.According to petitioner, although this case involves overcrowding credits, it is essentially like Weaver because theissuance of these credits was dependent on an inmate's goodconduct. Respondents, on the other hand, submit thatWeaver is not controlling because it was the overcrowdedcondition of the prison system, rather than the character ofthe prisoner's conduct, that gave rise to the award. In ourview, both of these submissions place undue emphasis on thelegislature's subjective intent in granting the credits ratherthan on the consequences of their revocation.In arriving at our holding in Weaver, we relied not on thesubjective motivation of the legislature in enacting the gaintime credits, but rather on whether objectively the new statute "lengthen[ed] the period that someone in petitioner's position must spend in prison." Id., at 33. Similarly, in thiscase, the fact that the generous gain-time provisions in Florida's 1983 statute were motivated more by the interest inavoiding overcrowding than by a desire to reward good behavior is not relevant to the essential inquiry demanded by519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 519 U. S. 433 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthe Ex Post Facto Clause: whether the cancellation of 1,860days of accumulated provisional credits had the effect oflengthening petitioner's period of incarceration.In our post-Weaver cases, we have also consideredwhether the legislature's action lengthened the sentencewithout examining the purposes behind the original sentencing scheme. In Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), weunanimously concluded that a revision in Florida's sentencing guidelines that went into effect between the date of peti-tioner's offense and the date of his conviction violated theEx Post Facto Clause. Our determination that the newguideline was " `more onerous than the prior law,' "id., at431 (quotingDobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)),rested entirely on an objective appraisal of the impact of thechange on the length of the offender's presumptive sentence.482 U. S., at 431 ("Looking only at the change in primaryoffense points, the revised guidelines law clearly disadvan-tages petitioner and similarly situated defendants").In California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.499 (1995), we also relied entirely on objective considerationsto support our conclusion that an amendment to California'sparole procedures that decreased the frequency of parolehearings for certain offenders had not made any "change inthe `quantum of punishment,' "id., at 508. The amendmentat issue in Morales allowed the parole board, after holdingan initial parole hearing, to defer for up to three years subse-quent parole suitability hearings for prisoners convicted ofmultiple murders if the board found that it was unreasonableto expect that parole would be granted at a hearing duringthe subsequent years. We stated that the relevant inquiryis whether the "change alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punish-able."Id., at 507, n. 3.14 After making that inquiry, we14 Later in the opinion we restated the test in similar language: "In evaluating the constitutionality of the 1981 amendment, we must determinewhether it produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punish519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN444 LYNCE v.

Our holding rested squarely onthe conclusion that "a prisoner's ultimate date of releasewould be entirely unaffected by the change in the timing ofsuitability hearings."Id., at 513. Although we held that"speculative and attenuated possibilit[ies]" of increasing themeasure of punishment do not implicate the Ex Post FactoClause, id., at 509, the bulk of our analysis focused on theeffect of the law on the inmate's sentence.We did not imply in Morales, as respondents contend, thatthe constitutionality of retroactive changes in the quantumof punishment depended on the purpose behind the parolesentencing system. The only mention of legislative purposeinMorales was in the following passage:"In contrast to the laws at issue in Lindsey [v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937)], Weaver, and Miller (which hadthe purpose and effect of enhancing the range of available prison terms, see Miller, supra, at 433-434), theevident focus of the California amendment was merely` " `to relieve the [Board] from the costly and time-consuming responsibility of scheduling parole hearings' " ' for prisoners who have no reasonable chanceof being released.In re Jackson, 39 Cal. 3d 464, 473,703 P. 2d 100, 106 (1985) (quoting legislative history)."Id., at 507.Thus, we concluded, the change at issue had neither the pur-pose nor the effect of increasing the quantum of punishment.Whether such a purpose alone would be a sufficient basis forconcluding that a law violated theEx Post Facto Clausewhen it actually had no such effect is a question the Courthas never addressed. Moreover, in Morales our statementsregarding purpose did not refer to the purpose behind thement attached to the covered crimes." California Dept. of Correctionsv. Morales, 514 U.

S. 433 (1997)Opinion of the Courtcreation of the original sentencing scheme; they referred in-stead to the question whether, in changing that sentencingscheme, the legislature intended to lengthen the inmate'ssentence. To the extent that any purpose might be relevantin this case, it would only be the purpose behind the legisla-ture's 1992 enactment of the offense-based exclusion. Here,unlike in Morales, there is no evidence that the legislature'schange in the sentencing scheme was merely to save time ormoney. Rather, it is quite obvious that the retrospectivechange was intended to prevent the early release of prisoners convicted of murder-related offenses who had accumu-lated overcrowding credits.15Respondents also argue that the retroactive cancellationof overcrowding credits is permissible because overcrowdinggain-time--unlike the incentive gain-time at issue in Weaverwhich is used to encourage good prison behavior and prisoner rehabilitation--"b[ears] no relationship to the originalpenalty assigned the crime or the actual penalty calculatedunder the sentencing guidelines." Brief for RespondentMathis 20. To the extent that respondents' argument restson the notion that overcrowding gain-time is not "in sometechnical sense part of the sentence," Weaver, 450 U. S., at32, this argument is foreclosed by our precedents. As werecognized inWeaver, retroactive alteration of parole orearly release provisions, like the retroactive application ofprovisions that govern initial sentencing, implicates the ExPost Facto Clause because such credits are "one determinantof petitioner's prison term . . . and . . . [the petitioner's] effec-tive sentence is altered once this determinant is changed."Ibid. We explained in Weaver that the removal of such pro-visions can constitute an increase in punishment, because a"prisoner's eligibility for reduced imprisonment is a signifi15 Indeed, the attorney general issued the 1992 opinion interpreting thestatute to apply retroactively in response to concerns about the release ofa notorious sex offender and murderer. See Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 92-96, at283, reprinted in Lodging, at 53.519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 LYNCE v. MATHISOpinion of the Courtcant factor entering into both the defendant's decision to pleabargain and the judge's calculation of the sentence to be imposed." Ibid.Respondents argue that this reasoning does not apply toovercrowding credits because, when petitioner pleaded nolocontendere, he could not reasonably have expected to receiveany such credits. The State, after all, could have alleviatedthe overcrowding problem in various ways: It could havebuilt more prisons; it could have paroled a large category ofnonviolent offenders; or it might have discontinued prosecu-tion of some classes of victimless crimes. Respondents thusargue that the 1992 statute does not violate the Ex PostFacto Clause because, like the California amendment at issuein Morales, it "create[d] only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of in-creasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes."514 U. S., at 509.16 Given the fact that this petitioner wasactually awarded 1,860 days of provisional credits and thefact that those credits were retroactively canceled as a resultof the 1992 amendment, we find this argument singularlyunpersuasive. In this case, unlike in Morales, the actualcourse of events makes it unnecessary to speculate aboutwhat might have happened. The 1992 statute has unques16 The support for our conclusion in Morales that the Act was merelyspeculative has no counterpart in this case. In Morales, we first reliedon the fact that the amendment affected a class of prisoners--multiplemurderers--who had little chance of being released on parole. Second,we found that the amendment did not alter the date of the prisoner's initialparole suitability hearing, and therefore only affected those initiallydeemed unsuitable for parole. Lastly, we recognized that the paroleboard "retain[ed] the authority to tailor the frequency of subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of the individual prisoner."514 U. S., at 511. Simply put, we rejected the inmate's claim in Morales,because it could not be said with any certainty that the amended statutoryscheme was more "onerous" than at the time of the crime. See id., at509-510 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977), for "refusing to accept `speculation' that the effective punishment under a new statutory scheme would be `more onerous' than under the old one").519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 519 U. S. 433 (1997)Opinion of the Courttionably disadvantaged petitioner because it resulted in hisrearrest and prolonged his imprisonment. Unlike the California amendment at issue in Morales, the 1992 Florida stat-ute did more than simply remove a mechanism that createdan opportunity for early release for a class of prisonerswhose release was unlikely; rather, it made ineligible forearly release a class of prisoners who were previously eligible--including some, like petitioner, who had actually beenreleased.17IVAlthough it does not appear that respondents advancedthis argument in the papers filed in the District Court, theCourt of Appeals, or in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari in this Court, they now argue that petitioner is not entitled to relief because his overcrowding credits were awarded pursuant to statutes enacted after the dateof his offense rather than pursuant to the 1983 statute.We disagree.The overcrowding statute in effect at the time of petitioner's crime was modified in subsequent years, but its basicelements remained the same: The statute provided for reductions in a prisoner's sentence when the population of theprison system exceeded a certain percentage of lawful capacity. At the time of petitioner's sentence in 1986, the emergency gain-time statute was in effect. Under that statute,when the prison population reached 98% of lawful capacity,17 We note that respondents do not argue, as the Magistrate Judge found,that the revocation of overcrowding credits is constitutional because suchan act is merely "procedural." There is no merit to this argument in anycase. We explained in Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282 (1977), that aprocedural statute is one that "simply alter[s] the methods employed indetermining" whether the punishment is "to be imposed" rather than"chang[ing] . . . the quantum of punishment attached to the crime." Id.,at 293-294. Because the 1992 law did not change the method of determining the sentence, but rather lengthened the sentences of certain prisonersby making them ineligible for early release, it was not merely procedural.519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 LYNCE v.

Fla. Stat.$ 944.598(2) (1983).18The later statutes slightly modified the procedures out-lined in the 1983 statute. The administrative gain-timestatute enacted in 1987 (after petitioner's plea of nolo contendere) provided that the secretary, after certification tothe Governor, "may grant up to a maximum of 60 days administrative gain-time." Fla. Stat $ 944.276(1). Unlike theemergency gain-time statute, the administrative gain-timestatute made the issuance of gain-time discretionary, andit contained certain offense-based exclusions. The provisional credits provision was enacted to replace administra-tive gain-time and is essentially the same, except that it provides for the issuance of gain-time when the prison reaches18 Respondent Attorney General Butterworth suggests that under theemergency gain-time statute, the maximum award petitioner could haverealized was 30 days of emergency gain-time. Therefore, according to theattorney general, it is unlikely that the gain-time statute would have hadany effect on petitioner's sentence. We do not agree that the statutelends itself to such a reading. The statute required the department ofcorrections to advise the Governor "whenever the population of the statecorrectional system exceeds 98 percent of lawful capacity." Fla. Stat.$ 944.598(1) (1983) (emphasis added). The duty to grant up to 30 daysgain-time in 5-day increments was continuing until the inmate populationreached 97% of lawful capacity. If the inmate population were to riseagain to 98%, the Secretary was required to issue additional gain-time.Moreover, the attorney general's reading of the emergency gain-timestatute would also limit the award of gain-time under the administrativegain-time and provisional credits statute. These statutes contain wording similar to the emergency gain-time statute, see Fla. Stat. $ 944.276(1)(1987); Fla. Stat. $ 944.277(1) (1989), yet the State has not interpreted thestatutes to limit the award of gain-time to a total of 60 days.519US2 Unit: $U27 [06-14-99 21:00:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 519 U. S. 433 (1997)Opinion of Thomas, J.97.5% of lawful capacity, rather than 98%. Fla. Stat.$ 944.277 (1988). SeeGriffin v. Singletary, 638 So. 2d 500(Fla. 1994).The changes in the series of statutes authorizing theaward of overcrowding gain-time do not affect petitioner'score ex post facto claim. Petitioner could have accumulatedgain-time under the emergency gain-time provision in muchthe same manner as he did under the provisional credits stat-ute. We recognize, however, that although the differencesin the statutes did not affect petitioner's central entitlementto gain-time, they may have affected the precise amount ofgain-time he received. Between 1988 and 1992, the provi-sional credits were authorized when the prison reached97.5% capacity rather than 98% capacity as under the emergency gain-time statute. If the prison population did notexceed 98% of capacity between 1988 and 1992, and if petitioner received provisional credits during those years, thereis force to the argument that the cancellation of that portionof the 1,860-day total did not violate the Ex Post FactoClause. Because this point was not adequately developedearlier in the proceeding, and because it may not in any eventaffect petitioner's entitlement to release, we leave it open forfurther consideration on remand.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
