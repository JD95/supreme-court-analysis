In United States v. Holmes, 680 F. 2d 1372, 1373 (1982),cert. denied, 460 U. S. 1015 (1983), the Court of Appeals forthe Eleventh Circuit held that "a defendant who flees afterconviction, but before sentencing, waives his right to appealfrom the conviction unless he can establish that his absencewas due to matters completely beyond his control." Relyingon that authority, and without further explanation, the courtdismissed petitioner's appeal.1 Because we have not pre1 The Court of Appeals order merely stated that the Government's "motion to dismiss is GRANTED," without actually citing Holmes.

S. 984 (1992).IIn the early evening of November 7, 1988, a Customs Serv-ice pilot was patrolling the Cay Sal Bank area, located midway between Cuba and the Florida Keys. Approximately30 miles southwest of Cay Sal, the pilot observed a low-flyingaircraft circling over a white boat and dropping bales. Theboat, described by the pilot as 40 to 50 feet in length, wascircling with the plane and retrieving the bales from thewater as they dropped. Because the Customs Service planewas flying at an altitude of 2,500 feet, and visibility was lessthan optimal, the pilot was unable to identify the name ofthe boat. United States v.

Ortega-Rodriguez, No. 88-10035-CR-KING (SD Fla., Feb. 23, 1989).The following morning, another Customs Service pilotfound the Wilfred, a boat resembling the one spotted approximately 12 hours earlier. This boat, located just off thebeach of Cay Sal, was described as a 30- to 40-foot sportfishing vessel. Upon making this discovery, the pilot firstflew to the drop point identified the night before, 30 milesaway, and found no activity. Returning to Cay Sal, he founda number of bales stacked on the beach, and theWilfredunderway and headed toward Cuba.The pilot alerted the captain of a Coast Guard cutter, whointercepted, boarded, and searched theWilfred. He foundno narcotics, weapons, or other incriminating evidence on theboat. Nevertheless, the three members of the crew failed toconvince the Coast Guard that they were fishing for dolphin,although a large number of similar vessels frequently do soin the area.

After the trial, the District Court setJune 15, 1989, as the date for sentencing. Petitioner did notappear and was sentenced in absentia to a prison term of 19years and 7 months, to be followed by 5 years of supervisedrelease.2 Though petitioner's codefendants appealed theirconvictions and sentences, no appeal from the judgment wasfiled on petitioner's behalf.The District Court issued a warrant for petitioner's arrest,and 11 months later, on May 24, 1990, he was apprehended.Petitioner was indicted and found guilty of contempt ofcourt 3 and failure to appear.4 Pursuant to the Sentencing2 No. 88-10035-CR-KING (SD Fla., June 23, 1989).3 Title 18 U.

The District Court denied the latter but grantedthe former, vacating the judgment previously entered on thecocaine convictions.7 The District Court then resentenced"(iv) a misdemeanor, a fine under this chapter or imprisonment for notmore than one year, or both; and"(B) if the person was released for appearance as a material witness,a fine under this chapter or imprisonment for not more than one year,or both."(2) A term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be consecutive to the sentence of imprisonment for any other offense."(c) Affirmative Defense.--It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that uncontrollable circumstances prevented theperson from appearing or surrendering, and that the person did not contribute to the creation of such circumstances in reckless disregard of therequirement to appear or surrender, and that the person appeared or surrendered as soon as such circumstances ceased to exist."5 App. 58-63.6 United States v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d 652 (CA11 1990), cert. denied,499 U. S. 980 (1991). The difference in dispositions is explained by a postarrest statement admitted against only one defendant, 919 F. 2d., at 660-661, though the dissenting judge viewed the evidence as insufficient as toboth appealing defendants, id., at 663-664. Petitioner represents that heis situated identically to the codefendant whose conviction was reversed,with nothing in the record that would support a distinction between theircases. The Government does not take issue with that representation, butmaintains that the evidence is sufficient to support all three convictions.Brief for United States 28, n. 7.7 App. 10.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT239Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner to a prison term of 15 years and 8 months, to befollowed by a 5-year period of supervised release.8 Petitioner filed a timely appeal from that final judgment.9On appeal, petitioner argued that the same insufficiency ofthe evidence rationale underlying reversal of his codefend-ant's conviction should apply in his case, because preciselythe same evidence was admitted against the two defendants.Without addressing the merits of this contention, the Government moved to dismiss the appeal. The Government'smotion was based entirely on the fact that petitioner hadbecome a fugitive after his conviction and before his initialsentencing, so that "[u]nder the holding inHolmes, he cannotnow challenge his 1989 conviction for conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine." 10 In a per curiamorder, the Court of Appeals granted the motion to dismiss.IIIt has been settled for well over a century that an appel-late court may dismiss the appeal of a defendant who is afugitive from justice during the pendency of his appeal. TheSupreme Court applied this rule for the first time inSmithv. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), to an escaped defendantwho remained at large when his petition arose before theCourt. Under these circumstances, the Court explained,there could be no assurance that any judgment it issued8 Id., at 51-56.9 Id., at 57. This sequence of events makes petitioner's case somewhatunusual. Had the District Court denied petitioner's motion for resentencing, petitioner would have been barred by applicable time limits from appealing his initial sentence and judgment. Petitioner was able to file atimely appeal only because the District Court granted his motion to resentence. Entry of the second sentence and judgment, from which petitionernoticed his appeal, is treated as the relevant "sentencing" for purposes ofthis opinion. We have no occasion here to comment on the propriety ofeither the District Court's initial decision to sentence in absentia, or itssubsequent decision to resentence.10 Id., at 70-71.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT240 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwould prove enforceable. The Court concluded that it is"clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminalcase in error, unless the convicted party, suing out the writ,is where he can be made to respond to any judgment we mayrender." Ibid. On two subsequent occasions, we gave thesame rationale for dismissals based on the fugitive status ofdefendants while their cases were pending before our Court.Bohanan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Eisler v. UnitedStates, 338 U. S. 189 (1949).11Enforceability is not, however, the only explanation wehave offered for the fugitive dismissal rule. In Molinaro v.New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, 366 (1970), we identified an addi-tional justification for dismissal of an escaped prisoner'spending appeal:"No persuasive reason exists why this Court should pro-ceed to adjudicate the merits of a criminal case after theconvicted defendant who has sought review escapesfrom the restraints placed upon him pursuant to the conviction. While such an escape does not strip the caseof its character as an adjudicable case or controversy,we believe it disentitles the defendant to call upon theresources of the Court for determination of his claims."As applied by this Court, then, the rule allowing dismissalof fugitives' appeals has rested in part on enforceability concerns, and in part on a "disentitlement" theory that con-strues a defendant's flight during the pendency of his appealas tantamount to waiver or abandonment.11 The dissenting Justices in Eisler, noting that the case was not rendered moot by Eisler's escape, believed that the Court should have exercised its discretion to decide the merits in light of the importance of theissue presented. See 338 U. S., at 194 (Murphy, J., dissenting); id., at 195(Jackson, J., dissenting). In United States v. Sharpe, 470 U. S. 675 (1985),despite the respondent's fugitive status, the Court declined to remand thecase to the Court of Appeals with directions to dismiss, and proceeded todecide the merits. Id., at 681, n. 2. See also id., at 688 (Blackmun, J.,concurring); id., at 721-723 (Stevens, J., dissenting).507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT241Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThat ensuring enforceability is not the sole rationale forfugitive dismissals is also evident from our review of stateprovisions regarding escaped prisoners' pending appeals.In Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138 (1897), we upheld not onlya state court's dismissal of a fugitive's appeal, but also itsrefusal to reinstate the appeal after the defendant's recapture, when enforceability would no longer be at issue. WefollowedAllen in Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534 (1975),upholding the constitutionality of a Texas statute providingfor automatic appellate dismissal when a defendant escapesduring the pendency of his appeal, unless the defendant voluntarily returns within 10 days. Although the defendant inEstelle had been recaptured before his appeal was consid-ered and dismissed, resolving any enforceability problems,there were, we held, other reasons for dismissal. Referringto our own dismissal in Molinaro, we found that the statestatute served "similar ends . . . . It discourages the felonyof escape and encourages voluntary surrenders. It promotes the efficient, dignified operation of the Texas Courtof Criminal Appeals." 420 U. S., at 537 (footnotes omitted).Estelle went on to consider whether the Texas statute wasirrational because it applied only to prisoners with appealspending when they fled custody. Citing the "peculiar prob-lems posed by escape of a prisoner during the ongoing appellate process," id., at 542, n. 11, we concluded that it was not.The distinct concerns implicated by an escape pending appeal justified a special rule for such appeals:"Texas was free to deal more severely with those whosimultaneously invoked the appellate process and escaped from its custody than with those who first escapedfrom its custody, returned, and then invoked the appellate process within the time permitted by law. Whileeach class of prisoners sought to escape, the first did soin the very midst of their invocation of the appellateprocess, while the latter did so before returning to custody and commencing that process. If Texas is free to507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT242 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtadopt a policy which deters escapes by prisoners, as allof our cases make clear that it is, it is likewise free toimpose more severe sanctions on those whose escape isreasonably calculated to disrupt the very appellate process which they themselves have set in motion." Id., at541-542.Thus, our cases consistently and unequivocally approvedismissal as an appropriate sanction when a prisoner is afugitive during "the ongoing appellate process." Moreover,this rule is amply supported by a number of justifications.In addition to addressing the enforceability concerns identi-fied inSmith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), and Boha-nan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887), dismissal by an appellate court after a defendant has fled its jurisdiction servesan important deterrent function and advances an interest inefficient, dignified appellate practice. Estelle, 420 U. S., at537. What remains for our consideration is whether thesame rationales support a rule mandating dismissal of an ap-peal of a defendant who flees the jurisdiction of a districtcourt, and is recaptured before he invokes the jurisdiction ofthe appellate tribunal.IIIIn 1982, the Government persuaded the Eleventh Circuitthat our reasoning in Molinaro should be extended to theappeal of a "former fugitive," returned to custody prior tosentencing and notice of appeal.12 The Court of Appeals12 For present purposes, the time of sentencing and the time of appealmay be treated together, as the two dates normally must occur within 10days of one another. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b); see also n. 9, supra;Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 314-315 (1988) (discussingmandatory nature of Rule 4 time limits). Cases in which a defendant fleesduring that 10-day interval will be resolved easily: If the defendant failsto file a timely appeal, his case concludes; if the defendant's attorney filesan appeal for him in his absence, the appeal will be subject to dismissalunder straightforward application of Smith and Molinaro. Should a defendant flee after sentencing but return before appeal--in other words,507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT243Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the Courtrecognized in Holmes that all of the cases on which the Gov-ernment relied were distinguishable, "because each involveda defendant who fled after filing a notice of appeal." 680F. 2d, at 1373 (emphasis added). The court was satisfied,however, that the disentitlement rationale of Molinaro "isequally forceful whether the defendant flees before or aftersentencing." 680 F. 2d, at 1374. The Eleventh Circuit alsoexpressed concern that absent dismissal, the Governmentmight be prejudiced by delays in proceedings resulting frompresentencing escapes.13The rule of Holmes differs from that applied in Molinaroin three key respects. First, of course, theHolmes rulereaches defendants who flee while their cases are before district courts, as well as those who flee while their appealsare pending. Second, the Holmes rule, unlike the rule ofMolinaro, will not mandate dismissal of an entire appealwhenever it is invoked. As the Eleventh Circuit explained,because flight cannot fairly be construed as a waiver of ap-peal from errors occurring after recapture, defendants whoflee presentencing retain their right to appeal sentencing er-rors, though they lose the right to appeal theirconvictions.680 F. 2d, at 1373.14 Finally, as announced in Holmes andshould his period of fugitivity begin after sentencing and end less than 10days later--then a timely filed appeal would be subject to the principleswe apply today.13 The court reasoned that the right of appeal, purely a creature of statute, may be waived by failure to file a timely notice of appeal "or byabandonment through flight which may postpone filing a notice of appealfor years after conviction." Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1373-1374. The courtthen explained: "Such untimeliness would make a meaningful appeal impossible in many cases. In case of a reversal, the government would obviously be prejudiced in locating witnesses and retrying the case." Id.,at 1374.14 "We hold that a defendant who flees after conviction, but before sentencing, waives his right to appeal from the conviction unless he can establish that his absence was due to matters completely beyond his control.Such a defendant does not waive his right to appeal from any allegederrors connected to his sentencing." Id., at 1373 (emphasis added).507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT244 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtapplied in this case, the Eleventh Circuit rule appears to callfor automatic dismissal, rather than an exercise of discretion.See n. 11, supra.In our view, the rationales that supported dismissal incases like Molinaro and Estelle should not be extended asfar as the Eleventh Circuit has taken them. Our review ofrules adopted by the courts of appeals in their supervisorycapacity is limited in scope, but it does demand that suchrules represent reasoned exercises of the courts' authority.SeeThomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985). Accord-ingly, the justifications we have advanced for allowing appellate courts to dismiss pending fugitive appeals all assumesome connection between a defendant's fugitive status andthe appellate process, sufficient to make an appellate sanction a reasonable response.15 These justifications are neces-sarily attenuated when applied to a case in which both flightand recapture occur while the case is pending before the district court, so that a defendant's fugitive status at no timecoincides with his appeal.There is, for instance, no question but that dismissal of aformer fugitive's appeal cannot be justified by reference tothe enforceability concerns that animatedSmith v. UnitedStates, 94 U. S. 97 (1876), and the cases that followed. Adefendant returned to custody before he invokes the appellate process presents no risk of unenforceability; he is withincontrol of the appellate court throughout the period of appealand issuance of judgment. Cf. United States v. Gordon, 538F. 2d 914, 915 (CA1 1976) (dismissing pending appeal of fugi-tive because it is "unlikely that [the] convicted party willrespond to an unfavorable decision").15 The reasonableness standard of Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140 (1985),is not, however, the only reason we require some connection between theappellate process and an appellate sanction. As the dissent notes, post,at 254, n. 2, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, which authorizes thepromulgation of rules by the courts of appeals, limits that authority torules "governing [the] practice" before those courts.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT245Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the CourtSimilarly, in many cases, the "efficient . . . operation" ofthe appellate process, identified as an independent concernin Estelle, 420 U. S., at 537, will not be advanced by dismissalof appeals filed after former fugitives are recaptured. It istrue that an escape may give rise to a "flurry of extraneousmatters," requiring that a court divert its attention from themerits of the case before it. United States v. Puzzanghera,820 F. 2d 25, 26 (CA1), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 900 (1987).The court put to this "additional trouble," 820 F. 2d, at 26,however, at least in the usual course of events, will be thecourt before which the case is pending at the time of escape.When an appeal is filed after recapture, the "flurry," alongwith any concomitant delay, likely will exhaust itself wellbefore the appellate tribunal enters the picture.16Nor does dismissal of appeals filed after recapture operateto protect the "digni[ty]" of an appellate court. Cf. Estelle,420 U. S., at 537. It is often said that a fugitive "flouts" theauthority of the court by escaping, and that dismissal is anappropriate sanction for this act of disrespect. See, e. g.,United States v. DeValle, 894 F. 2d 133, 138 (CA5 1990);United States v. Persico, 853 F. 2d 134, 137-138 (CA2 1988);16 This case well illustrates the way in which preappeal flight may delaydistrict court, but not appellate court, proceedings. Petitioner's sentencing was scheduled for June 1989. Because he fled, however, and becausethe District Court resentenced him upon his return to custody, his finalsentence was not entered until January 1991. Supra, at 237-238. Accordingly, petitioner's 11-month period of fugitivity delayed culmination of theDistrict Court proceedings by as much as 19 months.In the appellate court, on the other hand, the timing of proceedings wasunaffected by petitioner's flight. Had petitioner filed his notice of appealbefore he fled, of course, then the Court of Appeals might have been required to reschedule an already docketed appeal, causing some delay. Buthere, petitioner filed his notice of appeal only after he was returned tocustody, and the Court of Appeals was therefore free to docket his casepursuant to its regular schedule and at its convenience. In short, a lapseof time that precedes invocation of the appellate process does not translate, by itself, into delay borne by the appellate court.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT246 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAli v. Sims, 788 F. 2d 954, 958-959 (CA3 1986); United Statesv. London, 723 F. 2d 1538, 1539 (CA11), cert. denied, 467 U. S.1228 (1984). Indeed, the premise of Molinaro's disentitlement theory is that "the fugitive from justice has demonstrated such disrespect for the legal processes that he has noright to call upon the court to adjudicate his claim." Ali v.Sims, 788 F. 2d, at 959; see Molinaro, 396 U. S., at 366. Wehave no reason here to question the proposition that anappellate court may employ dismissal as a sanction when adefendant's flight operates as an affront to the dignity ofthe court's proceedings.The problem in this case, of course, is that petitioner, whofled before sentencing and was recaptured before appeal,flouted the authority of the District Court, not the Courtof Appeals. The contemptuous disrespect manifested by hisflight was directed at the District Court, before which hiscase was pending during the entirety of his fugitive period.Therefore, under the reasoning of the cases cited above, it isthe District Court that has the authority to defend its owndignity, by sanctioning an act of defiance that occurred solelywithin its domain. See United States v. Anagnos, 853 F. 2d1, 2 (CA1 1988) (declining to follow Holmes because formerfugitive's "misconduct was in the district court, and shouldaffect consequences in that court, not in ours").We cannot accept an expansion of this reasoning thatwould allow an appellate court to sanction by dismissal anyconduct that exhibited disrespect for any aspect of the judicial system, even where such conduct has no connection tothe course of appellate proceedings. See supra, at 244, andn. 15. Such a rule would sweep far too broadly, permitting,for instance, this Court to dismiss a petition solely becausethe petitioner absconded for a day during district courtproceedings, or even because the petitioner once violated acondition of parole or probation. None of our cases callsfor such a result, and we decline today to adopt such an507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT247Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the Courtapproach.17 Accordingly, to the extent that the Holmes rulerests on the premise that Molinaro's disentitlement theoryby itself justifies dismissal of an appeal filed after a formerfugitive is returned to custody, see 680 F. 2d, at 1374, it cannot be sustained.Finally,Estelle's deterrence rationale, 420 U. S., at 537, of-fers little support for the Eleventh Circuit rule. Once jurisdiction has vested in the appellate court, as in Estelle, thenany deterrent to escape must flow from appellate consequences, and dismissal may be an appropriate sanction bywhich to deter. Until that time, however, the district courtis quite capable of defending its own jurisdiction. While acase is pending before the district court, flight can be deterred with the threat of a wide range of penalties availableto the district court judge. SeeKatz v. United States, 920F. 2d 610, 613 (CA9 1990) (when defendant is before districtcourt, "disentitlement doctrine does not stand alone as a de-terrence to escape").Moreover, should this deterrent prove ineffective, and adefendant flee while his case is before a district court, thedistrict court is well situated to impose an appropriate pun-ishment. While an appellate court has access only to theblunderbuss of dismissal, the district court can tailor a morefinely calibrated response. Most obviously, because flight isa separate offense punishable under the Criminal Code, seenn. 3-4,supra, the district court can impose a separate sen-tence that adequately vindicates the public interest in deter17 Even the Eleventh Circuit, we note, seems unprepared to take suchan extreme position. If appellate dismissal were indeed an appropriatesanction for all acts of judicial defiance, then there would be no reason toexempt sentencing errors from the scope of the Holmes rule. See 680 F.2d, at 1373; supra, at 243. Whether or not Holmes' distinction betweenappeals from sentencing errors and appeals from convictions is logicallysupportable, see United States v. Anagnos, 853 F. 2d 1, 2 (CA1 1988) (questioning logic of distinction), it reflects an acknowledgment by the EleventhCircuit that the sanction of appellate dismissal should not be wielded indiscriminately as an all-purpose weapon against defendant misconduct.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT248 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtring escape and safeguards the dignity of the court. In thiscase, for instance, the District Court concluded that a termof imprisonment of 21 months, followed by three years ofsupervised release, would serve these purposes.18 If we assume that there is merit to petitioner's appeal, then theEleventh Circuit's dismissal is tantamount to an additionalpunishment of 15 years for the same offense of flight. Cf.United States v. Snow, 748 F. 2d 928 (CA4 1984).19 Our rea-soning in Molinaro surely does not compel that result.Indeed, as Justice Stewart noted in his dissenting opinionin Estelle v. Dorrough, 420 U. S., at 544-545, punishment byappellate dismissal introduces an element of arbitrarinessand irrationality into sentencing for escape.20 Use of thedismissal sanction as, in practical effect, a second punishmentfor a defendant's flight is almost certain to produce the kindof disparity in sentencing that the Sentencing Reform Actof 198421 and the Sentencing Guidelines were intended toeliminate.2218 See supra, at 237-238.19 "The Court is not condoning [defendant's] flight from justice. However, it presumes his actions constitute an independent crime, i. e., `escapefrom custody.' We refrain from punishing [defendant] twice by dismissinghis appeal." United States v. Snow, 748 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3.20 "[T]he statute imposes totally irrational punishments upon those subject to its application. If an escaped felon has been convicted in violationof law, the loss of his right to appeal results in his serving a sentence thatunder law was erroneously imposed. If, on the other hand, his trial wasfree of reversible error, the loss of his right to appeal results in no punishment at all. And those whose appeals would have been reversed if theirappeals had not been dismissed serve totally disparate sentences, dependent not upon the circumstances of their escape, but upon whatever sentences may have been meted out under their invalid convictions."

S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the CourtAccordingly, we conclude that while dismissal of an appealpending while the defendant is a fugitive may serve substantial interests, the same interests do not support a rule ofdismissal for all appeals filed by former fugitives, returnedto custody before invocation of the appellate system. Ab-sent some connection between a defendant's fugitive statusand his appeal, as provided when a defendant is at large dur-ing "the ongoing appellate process,"Estelle, 420 U. S., at 542,n. 11, the justifications advanced for dismissal of fugitives'pending appeals generally will not apply.We do not ignore the possibility that some actions by adefendant, though they occur while his case is before thedistrict court, might have an impact on the appellate processsufficient to warrant an appellate sanction. For that reason,we do not hold that a court of appeals is entirely withoutauthority to dismiss an appeal because of fugitive status pre-dating the appeal. For example, the Eleventh Circuit, informulating the Holmes rule, expressed concern that a longescape, even if ended before sentencing and appeal, may sodelay the onset of appellate proceedings that the Govern-ment would be prejudiced in locating witnesses and presenting evidence at retrial after a successful appeal. Holmes,680 F. 2d, at 1374; see also United States v. Persico, 853 F.2d, at 137. We recognize that this problem might, in someinstances, make dismissal an appropriate response. In theclass of appeals premised on insufficiency of the evidence,however, in which petitioner's appeal falls, retrial is not permitted in the event of reversal, and this type of prejudice tothe Government will not serve as a rationale for dismissal.Similarly, a defendant's misconduct at the district courtlevel might somehow make "meaningful appeal impossible,"Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1374, or otherwise disrupt the appellateprocess so that an appellate sanction is reasonably imposed.purpose of administering evenhanded justice. In this case, it is the dissent's proposed disposition that would produce inconsistent judgments, aspetitioner served a 15-year sentence while his codefendant's convictionwas reversed for insufficiency of evidence.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT250 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe appellate courts retain the authority to deal with suchcases, or classes of cases,23 as necessary. Here, for instance,petitioner's flight prevented the Court of Appeals from consolidating his appeal with those of his codefendants, whichwe assume would be its normal practice. See United Statesv. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d, at 654, n. 1 (noting that petitioner is absent and not party to appeal). If the EleventhCircuit deems this consequence of petitioner's flight a significant interference with the operation of its appellate process, then, under the reasoning we employ today, a dismissalrule could properly be applied.As this case reaches us, however, there is no reason tobelieve that the Eleventh Circuit has made such a judgment.Application of the Holmes rule, as formulated by the Eleventh Circuit thus far, does not require the kind of connectionbetween fugitivity and the appellate process that we holdnecessary today; instead, it may rest on nothing more thanthe faulty premise that any act of judicial defiance, whetheror not it affects the appellate process, is punishable by appellate dismissal. See Holmes, 680 F. 2d, at 1374; supra, at 246.Accordingly, that the Eleventh Circuit saw fit to dismiss thiscase under Holmes does not by itself reflect a determination23 We cannot agree with petitioner that the courts may only considerwhether to dismiss the appeal of a former fugitive on an individual, casespecific basis. Though dismissal of fugitive appeals is always discretionary, in the sense that fugitivity does not "strip the case of its character asan adjudicable case or controversy," Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S.365, 366 (1970); see also n. 11, supra, appellate courts may exercise thatdiscretion by developing generally applicable rules to cover specific, recurring situations. Indeed, this Court itself has formulated a general ruleallowing for dismissal of petitions that come before it while the petitioneris at large. See Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). The problemwith the Holmes rule is not that the appeals it reaches are subject toautomatic dismissal, but that it reaches too many appeals--including thoseof defendants whose former fugitive status in no way affects the appellate process.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT251Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthat dismissal would be appropriate under the narrower circumstances we now define.Nor is there any indication in the record below--either inthe Government's motion to dismiss, or in the Eleventh Circuit's per curiam order--that petitioner's former fugitivitywas deemed to present an obstacle to orderly appellate review. Thus, we have no reason to assume that the EleventhCircuit would consider the duplication of resources involvedin hearing petitioner's appeal separately from those of hiscodefendants--which can of course be minimized by relianceon the earlier panel decision in United States v. MieresBorges, see supra, at 238, and n. 6--sufficiently disruptive ofthe appellate process that dismissal would be a reasonableresponse, on the facts of this case and under the standard weannounce today. We leave that determination to the Courtof Appeals on remand.24In short, when a defendant's flight and recapture occur before appeal, the defendant's former fugitive status may welllack the kind of connection to the appellate process thatwould justify an appellate sanction of dismissal. In suchcases, fugitivity while a case is pending before a districtcourt, like other contempts of court, is best sanctioned by thedistrict court itself. The contempt for the appellate processmanifested by flight while a case is pending on appeal remains subject to the rule of Molinaro.24 Neither the reasonableness standard of Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140(1985), nor Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, mandates uniformityamong the circuits in their approach to fugitive dismissal rules. SeeThomas, 474 U. S., at 157 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In other words, solong as all circuit rules meet the threshold reasonableness requirement, inthat they mandate dismissal only when fugitivity has some connection tothe appellate process, they may vary considerably in their operation. Forthis additional reason, we hesitate to decide as a general matter whetherand under what circumstances preappeal flight that leads to severance ofcodefendants' appeals will warrant appellate dismissal, and instead leavethat question to the various courts of appeals.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT252 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESRehnquist, C. J., dissentingThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. So ordered.Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White,Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.The Court holds that, in general, a court of appeals maynot dismiss an appeal based on a defendant's fugitive statusif that status does not coincide with the pendency of the ap-peal. We disagree. The only difference between a defendant who absconds preappeal and one who absconds postap-peal is that the former has filed a notice of appeal while thelatter has not. This "distinction" is not strong enough tosupport the Court's holding, for there is as much of a chancethat flight will disrupt the proper functioning of the appellateprocess if it occurs before the court of appeals obtains jurisdiction as there is if it occurs after the court of appealsobtains jurisdiction. As a consequence, there is no reasonwhy the authority to dismiss an appeal should be based onthe timing of a defendant's escape. Although we agree withthe Court that there must be some "connection" betweenescape and the appellate process, we disagree with the conclusion that recapture before appeal generally breaks theconnection.1It is beyond dispute that the courts of appeals have super-visory power to create and enforce "procedural rules governing the management of litigation." Thomas v. Arn, 4741 The Court erroneously strikes the Holmes rule on the basis that "itreaches too many appeals," ante, at 250, n. 23, because there is no overbreadth doctrine applicable in this context. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma,413 U. S. 601, 610-611 (1973) (overbreadth doctrine is the exception ratherthan the rule because "courts are not roving commissions assigned to passjudgment on the validity of the Nation's laws"). As long as the fugitivedismissal rule was applied legally to the facts of this case, the EleventhCircuit's rule cannot be struck down. It is for this reason that we wouldaffirm the Eleventh Circuit rather than vacating and remanding.507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT253Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingU. S. 140, 146 (1985). The only limit on this authority is thatthe rules may not violate the Constitution or a statute, andmust be reasonable in light of the concerns they are designedto address. Seeid., at 146-148. There can be no argumentthat the fugitive dismissal rule employed by the EleventhCircuit violates the Constitution because a convicted crimi-nal has no constitutional right to an appeal.Abney v.United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977). Nor is the rule in-consistent with 28 U. S. C. $ 1291, which grants to criminaldefendants the right of appeal, because that section does notset forth the procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal. Those requirements are set forth in the Federal Rulesof Appellate Procedure and the local rules of the courts ofappeals. Indeed, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47, each court of appeals has authority to make rules"governing its practice" either through rulemaking oradjudication.The fugitive dismissal rule is reasonable in light of theinterests it is designed to protect. In Molinaro v. NewJersey, 396 U. S. 365 (1970), we declined to adjudicate a defendant's case because he fled after appealing his state conviction. We reasoned that by absconding, the defendantforfeited his right to "call upon the resources of the Court fordetermination of his claims." Id., at 366. And in Estelle v.Dorrough, 420 U. S. 534 (1975), we upheld a Texas statutethat mandated dismissal of an appeal if the defendant fledafter invoking the jurisdiction of the appellate court. Werecognized that Texas reasonably has an interest in discouraging felony escape, encouraging voluntary surrenders, andpromoting the "efficient, dignified operation of the TexasCourt of Criminal Appeals." Id., at 537. Both Molinaroand Estelle are premised on the idea that a reviewing courtmay invoke procedural rules to protect its jurisdiction and toensure the orderly and efficient use of its limited resources.While we agree with the Court that there must be someconnection between fugitivity and the appellate process in507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT254 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESRehnquist, C. J., dissentingorder to justify a rule providing for dismissal on that basis,we do not agree that flight generally does not have the required connection simply because it occurs before the defendant or his counsel files a notice of appeal.2 It is fallacious tosuggest that a defendant's actions in fleeing likely will haveno effect upon the appellate process unless those actionsoccur while the court of appeals has jurisdiction over thecase. Indeed, flight during the pendency of an appeal mayhave less of an effect on the appellate process, especially incases where the defendant flees and is recaptured while theappeal is pending. Because there is no delay between conviction and invocation of the appellate process, dismissal insuch a case is premised on the mere threat to the properoperation of the appellate process. Yet the Court concedes,as it must, that courts of appeals may dismiss an appeal inthis situation. Ante, at 239-242; see Allen v. Georgia, 166U. S. 138 (1897).If, as in the present case, the defendant eventually is recaptured and resentenced, he obtains a second chance tochallenge his conviction and sentence, and consequently delays the appellate process by at least the amount of timehe managed to elude law enforcement authorities. We arestartled by the Court's assertion that "any concomitant delay. . . likely will exhaust itself well before the appellate tribunalenters the picture." Ante, at 245. If the defendant obtainsan additional opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal, thecourt of appeals, in the absence of a fugitive dismissal ruleor any jurisdictional defect, must entertain the appeal. At2 The very wording of Rule 47, which gives the appellate courts authority to create local procedural rules, supports the connection requirement:"Each court of appeals by action of a majority of the circuit judges inregular active service may from time to time make and amend rules governing its practice not inconsistent with these rules. In all cases notprovided for by rule, the courts of appeals may regulate their practice inany manner not inconsistent with these rules." Fed. Rule App. Proc. 47(emphasis added).507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT255Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingthe very least, the result is an increase in the court's docketand a blow to docket organization and predictability. Thisdisruption to the management of the court's docketing proce-dures is qualitatively different from delay caused by otherfactors like settlement by the parties. Unlike the fugitive'scase, the settled case will not turn up as an additional andunexpected case on the court's docket some time down theroad. And of course, the burden of delay increases exponen-tially with the number of defendants who abscond preappeal,but are recaptured and invoke the appellate court's jurisdic-tion in a timely manner. The Court fails to explain how thisobvious delay somehow disappears when the defendant is recaptured before invoking the appellate court's jurisdiction.As is demonstrated by the instant case, the delay causedby preappeal flight can thwart the administration of justiceby forcing a severance, requiring duplication of precious appellate resources, and raising the specter of inconsistentjudgments. Here, the appellate process was delayed by approximately 19 months (counting both the period of fugitivityand the time used by the District Court to resentence petitioner). During this delay, the Eleventh Circuit heard anddecided the appeals filed by petitioner's codefendants.United States v. Mieres-Borges, 919 F. 2d 652 (1990), cert.denied, 499 U. S. 980 (1991). Because petitioner fled, theEleventh Circuit was unable to consolidate petitioner'sappeal with those filed by his codefendants and conservejudicial resources. In addition to forcing a severance, petitioner's flight created a real possibility of inconsistent judgments. Petitioner's flight "imposed exactly the same burden of duplication on the court of appeals that it would haveif he had filed his notice of appeal before absconding." Brieffor United States 21. Had petitioner's counsel filed a noticeof appeal on petitioner's behalf while he remained at large,the Court of Appeals could have dismissed the appeal withprejudice. See Molinaro, 396 U. S., at 366. Since petitioner's flight had an adverse effect on the proper functioning of507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT256 ORTEGA-RODRIGUEZ v. UNITED STATESRehnquist, C. J., dissentingthe Eleventh Circuit's process, there is no principled reasonwhy that court should not be able to dismiss petitioner'sappeal.In addition to administration, the Eleventh Circuit's fugitive dismissal rule is supported by an interest in deterringflight and encouraging voluntary surrender. Due to the ad-verse effects that flight, whenever it occurs, can have on theproper functioning of the appellate process, courts of appealshave an obvious interest in deterring escape and encouraging voluntary surrender. Unfortunately, today's opiniononly encourages flight and discourages surrender. To a defendant deciding whether to flee before or after filing a notice of appeal, today's decision makes the choice simple. Ifthe defendant flees preappeal and happens to get caughtafter the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired, he stillhas the opportunity for appellate review if he can persuade adistrict judge to resentence him. If the district judge refuses, the defendant is at no more of a disadvantage than hewould have been had he escaped after filing an appeal sinceflight after appeal can automatically extinguish the right toappellate review. See Molinaro, supra.A rule permitting dismissal when a defendant's flight interrupts the appellate process protects respect for the judicial system. When a defendant escapes, whether before orafter lodging an appeal, he flouts the authority of the judicial process, of which the court of appeals is an integral part.Surely the Court does not mean to argue that a defendantwho escapes during district court proceedings intends onlydisrespect for that tribunal. Quite obviously, a fleeing defendant has no intention of returning, at least voluntarily.His flight therefore demonstrates an equal amount of disrespect for the authority of the court of appeals as it does forthe district court. Viewed in this light, the "finely calibrated response" available to the district court, ante, at 247,does nothing to vindicate the affront to the appellate process.The Court's argument is not enhanced by the use of far507US1$40I 11-18-96 20:15:50 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 507 U. S. 234 (1993)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingfetched hypotheticals, see ante, at 246, because the dignityrationale does not exist in a vacuum. As outlined above, areviewing court may not dismiss an appeal in the absence ofsome effect on its orderly functioning.While the Court recognizes that the reasoning underlyingthe opinion requires an exception for cases in which flightthrows a wrench into the proper workings of the appellateprocess,ante, at 249-250, its rule is too narrow. The Courtlimits the exception to cases in which flight creates a "significant interference with the operation of [the] appellateprocess." Ante, at 250. Translated, the rule applies preappeal only when retrial is hampered, a " `meaningful appeal[is] impossible,' " or the case involves multiple defendants,thereby causing a forced severance. Ante, at 249-250. Thisgrudging concession is insufficient because it fails to includethose cases where sheer delay caused by the fugitivity ofthe lone defendant has an adverse effect on the appellateprocess.In sum, courts of appeals have supervisory authority, bothinherent and under Rule 47, to create and enforce proceduralrules designed to promote the management of their docket.Fugitivity dismissal rules are no exception. In cases wherefugitivity obstructs the orderly workings of the appellateprocess, this authority is properly exercised. Because peti-tioner's flight delayed the appellate process by approximately 19 months, and involved the burden of duplicationand the risk of inconsistent judgments, we would hold thatthe Eleventh Circuit properly applied its fugitive dismissalrule in this case.507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT258 OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusREITER et al. v. COOPER, trustee for CAROLINAMOTOR EXPRESS, INC., et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 91-1496. Argued December 1, 1992--Decided March 8, 1993The Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) requires that motor common carrierscharge the tariff rates they file with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), 49 U. S. C. $ 10762, and that such rates be "reasonable,"$ 10701(a). Between 1984 and 1986, petitioner shippers tendered shipments to Carolina Motor Express, Inc., a motor carrier subject to ICCregulation, at negotiated rates that were lower than the applicable tariffrates on file with the ICC. When Carolina filed for bankruptcy, respondents, the trustee in bankruptcy and a rate auditing firm, broughtadversary proceedings against petitioners in the Bankruptcy Court torecover the difference between the negotiated and tariff rates. Petitioners responded, inter alia, that the tariff rates were unlawful becausethey were unreasonably high. The Bankruptcy Court entered judgment for respondents based on the tariff rates, but the District Courtreversed and referred petitioners' defenses to the ICC. The Court ofAppeals reversed, holding the petitioners' "unreasonable rate" claimswere no obstacle to respondents' actions because, even if the tariff rateswere unreasonable, the "filed rate doctrine" required petitioners to paythose rates first and then seek relief in a separate action under$ 11705(b)(3), which gives shippers an express cause of action againstcarriers for damages (reparations) in the amount of the difference between the tariff rate and the rate determined by the ICC to bereasonable.Held:1. Petitioners' unreasonable-rate claims under $ 11705(b)(3) are subject to the ordinary rules governing counterclaims. Pp. 262-267.(a) While respondents are technically correct that the unreasonablerate issue cannot be asserted as a defense, petitioners' $ 11705(b)(3)claims relate to the same shipments for which respondents seek to collect and, thus, are properly raised here as counterclaims. It makes nodifference that the counterclaims may have been mistakenly designatedas defenses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Pp. 262-263.(b) The 2-year limitation for bringing a civil action under$ 11705(b)(3) is not applicable here since petitioners' claims seek merely507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT259Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)Syllabusrecoupment. See United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S.59, 71. Pp. 263-265.(c) Nothing in the ICA provides that, in a carrier's underchargecollection action, a $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaim is not subject to the normally applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 54(b). That Rule permits a district court to enter separatefinal judgment on any claim or counterclaim after making "an expressdetermination that there is no just reason for delay." The "filed ratedoctrine"--which embodies the principle that a shipper cannot avoidpaying the tariff rate by invoking common-law claims and defenses--does not preclude avoidance of the tariff rate through claims and defenses that are specifically accorded by the ICA itself. Crancer v. Lowden, 315 U. S. 631, distinguished. Pp. 265-267.2. Respondents' arguments that petitioners' counterclaims are notyet cognizable in court are rejected. Pp. 267-270.(a) The contention that paying the tariff rate is a prerequisite forlitigating the reasonableness issue finds no support in the ICA. Rather,the ICA provides that a claim related to shipment of property accrueson delivery or tender of delivery, $ 11706(g). Pp. 267-268.(b) Nor are petitioners required initially to present their claims tothe ICC. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires only that acourt enable "referral" to an administrative agency of a claim containingan issue within the agency's special competence, but does not deprivethe court of jurisdiction. And the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies--which would deprive the court of jurisdiction--is inapplicable here, both because the ICC has long interpreted the ICA asgiving it no power to decree reparations itself, and because the Courtcan discern within the ICA no intent that ICC determination of thereasonable-rate issue must be obtained before filing the civil action.Pp. 268-270.3. The courts below made no "express determination" required underRule 54(b) for entry of a separate judgment on respondents' claims, andit cannot be said categorically that it would be an abuse of discretioneither to grant or to deny such judgment. Although insolvency of theclaimant is a factor weighing against separate judgment in that claimant's favor, this Court cannot say that insolvency is an absolute bar.Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

After the shipmentsare delivered and paid for (sometimes years after), the carrier goes bankrupt and its trustee in bankruptcy sues theshipper to recover the difference between the negotiatedrates and the tariff rates. Shippers' standard defensesagainst such "undercharge" actions have been (1) that thecarrier's attempt to collect more than the agreed-upon ratesis an "unreasonable practice" proscribed by the Act, see$ 10701(a), and (2) that the tariff rates were unlawful becausethey were unreasonably high, see ibid. In 1989, the ICCannounced a policy approving the first of these defenses.See NITL--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on NegotiatedMotor Common Carrier Rates, 5 I. C. C. 2d 623 (1989); seealso NITL--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on NegotiatedMotor Common Carrier Rates, 3 I. C. C. 2d 99 (1986); Maislin, 497 U. S., at 121-122. Our decision in Maislin held thatpolicy invalid under the ICA, because it would "rende[r] nugatory" the specific command of $ 10761 that the carriercharge the filed rate. Id., at 133. While Maislin thus eliminated the shippers' "unreasonable practice" defense, it expressly noted that "[t]he issue of the reasonableness of thetariff rates is open for exploration on remand." Id., at 129,n. 10. The present case presents a problem of timing thathas arisen out of that issue.The shippers here are petitioners California ConsolidatedEnterprises (CCE) and Peter Reiter. Between 1984 and1986, they were engaged in the business of brokering motorcarrier transportation, which essentially involves serving asa middleman between motor carriers and the shipping public.During that period, petitioners tendered shipments to Carolina Motor Express, Inc., which was operating as a certifiedmotor carrier in interstate commerce subject to regulationby the ICC.

COOPEROpinion of the Courtrates on file with the ICC. (Petitioners believed that Caro-lina would publish these negotiated rates in its tariffs, butCarolina never did so.)In 1986, Carolina filed for bankruptcy and respondentLangdon Cooper was appointed trustee. Respondent Mark& Associates of North Carolina was retained to conductan audit of Carolina's shipping bills, which revealed under-charges (below applicable tariff rates) in the amount of$58,793.03 on shipments made by CCE and $13,795.73 onshipments made by Reiter. Respondents brought adversaryproceedings against petitioners in Bankruptcy Court to col-lect those amounts. Petitioners raised the standard "unreasonable practice" and "unreasonable rate" claims, and movedthe Bankruptcy Court to stay proceedings and to refer thoseclaims to the ICC. The Bankruptcy Court refused to do soand entered judgment for respondents. In re CarolinaMotor Express, Inc., 84 B. R. 979 (WDNC 1988). In 1989(prior to our decision in Maislin), the District Court reversed and held that the "unreasonable practice" defenseshould be referred to the ICC. The Court of Appeals, afterholding respondents' appeal in abeyance until our decision inMaislin, reversed the District Court. In re Carolina MotorExpress, Inc., 949 F. 2d 107 (CA4 1991). It held that, inlight of Maislin, there was no need to refer the "unreason-able practice" issue to the ICC, 949 F. 2d, at 109; and thatthe "unreasonable rate" claim was no obstacle to the carrier'saction, since even if the tariff rates were unreasonable the"filed rate" doctrine requires the shipper to pay them firstand then seek relief in a separate action for damages under$ 11705(b)(3), id., at 110-111. We granted certiorari. 504U.

But that doesnot establish that the "unreasonable rate" issue cannot beraised in the present suit, since a defendant having a causeof action against a plaintiff may--indeed, oftenmust--assertthat cause of action as a counterclaim.

Petitioners' claims under $ 11705(b)(3) are certainlyproperly raised here, since they relate to the same shipmentsfor which respondents seek to collect. And it makes no difference that petitioners may have mistakenly designatedtheir counterclaims as defenses, since Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 8(c) provides that "the court on terms, if justiceso requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been aproper designation." See also 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed-eral Practice and Procedure $ 1275, pp. 459-460 (2d ed. 1990)("Inasmuch as it is not clear whether set-offs and recoup-ments should be viewed as defenses or counterclaims, thecourt, by invoking the misdesignation provision in Rule 8(c),should treat matter of this type as if it had been properlydesignated by defendant, and should not penalize improperlabelling").Under 49 U. S. C. $ 11706(c)(2), a shipper "must begin acivil action to recover damages under [$ 11705(b)(3)] withintwo years after the claim accrues," which occurs "on deliveryor tender of delivery by the carrier," $ 11706(g). That limi1 Section 11705(b)(3) provides in relevant part:"A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . is liable for damages resulting from theimposition of rates for transportation or service the Commission finds tobe in violation of this subtitle."507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT264 REITER v. COOPEROpinion of the Courttation is not applicable here, however, since presented in re-sponse to the carrier's suit petitioners' claims seek merely"recoupment"--i. e., the setting off against asserted liabilityof a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction. Recoupment claims are generally not barred by a statute oflimitations so long as the main action is timely. See Bull v.United States, 295 U. S. 247, 262 (1935); 3 J. Moore, B.Ward, & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice || 13.11 (1992).There is no reason not to apply this principle to suits underthe ICA, and we have indeed already done so. In UnitedStates v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 59, 71 (1956), weheld that an ICA limitation provision nearly identical to theone at issue here did not prohibit the shipper (the UnitedStates) from asserting "by way of defense" unreasonablerate claims against a carrier seeking to collect on previousshipments. Respondents seek to distinguish Western Pacific on the ground that the United States has a unique statutory setoff right (now codified at 31 U. S. C. $ 3726), allowingit to deduct from amounts due to a carrier prior overchargesby the carrier. That statute may well have been essentialto the holding in the case, since some of the amounts withheld by the United States were not recoupments (they related to shipments other than those that were the subjectsof the carriers' suits). But the rationale of the case is thesame as the rationale that permits recoupment here: "Onlythe clearest congressional language could force us to a resultwhich would allow a carrier to recover unreasonable chargeswith impunity merely by waiting two years before filingsuit." 352 U. S., at 71. See Glama Dress Co. v. Mid-SouthTransports, Inc., 335 I. C. C. 586, 589 (1969). Courts of Appeals have understood Western Pacific as expressing not justa narrow holding based on the United States setoff statute,but a general principle of recoupment applicable in other contexts. See Distribution Services, Ltd. v. Eddie Parker Interests, Inc., 897 F. 2d 811, 813 (CA5 1990); In re Smith, 737F. 2d 1549, 1554 (CA11 1984); 118 East 60th Owners, Inc.507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)Opinion of the Courtv. Bonner Properties, Inc., 677 F. 2d 200, 203 (CA2 1982);Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States, 312 F. 2d 545, 549, n. 3(CA2 1963).One major consequence does attach to the fact that anunreasonable-rate claim is technically a counterclaim ratherthan a defense: A defense cannot possibly be adjudicatedseparately from the plaintiff 's claim to which it applies; acounterclaim can be. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b)permits a district court to enter separate final judgment onany claim or counterclaim, after making "an express determination that there is no just reason for delay." See Sears,Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U. S. 427 (1956); Cold MetalProcess Co. v. United Engineering & Foundry Co., 351 U. S.445 (1956). This power is largely discretionary, see CurtissWright Corp. v. General Electric Co., 446 U. S. 1, 10 (1980),to be exercised in light of "judicial administrative interestsas well as the equities involved," id., at 8, and giving dueweight to " `the historic federal policy against piecemeal appeals,' " ibid. (quoting Sears, supra, at 438).2Nothing in the ICA provides that, in an action by a carrierto collect undercharges, a $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaim is notsubject to the normally applicable provisions of the FederalRules. Respondents contend that the so-called "filed ratedoctrine" gives them absolute entitlement to judgment ontheir undercharge claims, without defense or counterclaim.2 For purposes of applying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing counterclaims, it does not matter that this action arose in bankruptcy.Rules 8 and 54 are made fully applicable in adversary proceedings byBankruptcy Rules 7008 and 7054, and Rule 13 is made applicable withonly minor variation (not relevant here) by Bankruptcy Rule 7013. It iswell settled, moreover, that a bankruptcy defendant can meet a plaintiffdebtor's claim with a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction, atleast to the extent that the defendant merely seeks recoupment. See Inre B & L Oil Co., 782 F. 2d 155, 157 (CA10 1986); Lee v. Schweiker, 739F. 2d 870, 875 (CA3 1984). Recoupment permits a determination of the"just and proper liability on the main issue," and involves "no element ofpreference." 4 Collier on Bankruptcy || 553.03, p. 553-17 (15th ed. 1991).507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT266 REITER v. COOPEROpinion of the CourtWe disagree. The filed rate doctrine embodies the principlethat a shipper cannot avoid payment of the tariff rate byinvoking common-law claims and defenses such as ignorance,estoppel, or prior agreement to a different rate. SeeTexas& Pacific R. Co. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242, 245 (1906); Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 98 (1915);Pittsburgh, C., C. & S. L. R. Co. v. Fink, 250 U. S. 577, 581-582 (1919). It assuredly does not preclude avoidance of thetariff rate, however, through claims and defenses that arespecifically accorded by the ICA itself. We can agree withrespondents that this latter category does not include any"unreasonable rate defense," derived from the general ICArequirement (now codified in $ 10701(a)) that a carrier's ratesbe "reasonable." See T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States, 359U. S. 464, 468-472 (1959). But we cannot agree that the filedrate doctrine precludes shippers from asserting (by way ofclaim or counterclaim) the reparations rights explicitly conferred by $ 11705(b)(3).Contrary to respondents' contention, the preclusive effectof the filed rate doctrine over reparations counterclaims isnot established by our opinion in Crancer v. Lowden, 315U. S. 631 (1942). There, shippers sued by a rail carrier forpayment of tariff rates challenged them as unreasonable, andsought to stay the collection action until the ICC had anopportunity to rule on that issue. The District Court deniedthe stay and entered judgment for the carrier. But unlikethe present petitioners, the shippers in Crancer had no counterclaim; they had already instituted an administrative reparations proceeding (as the ICA allowed for rail carriage)before they were sued in district court, see Reply Brief forPetitioners 13 and Brief for Respondents 18, in Crancer v.Lowden, O. T. 1941, No. 505, which precluded filing a reparations claim in district court. See 49 U. S. C. $ 9 (1946 ed.).Moreover, all that Crancer held was that "there was noabuse of discretion by the trial judge," since the equities balanced against waiting for the ICC's determination. 315507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT267Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)Opinion of the CourtU. S., at 636. Thus, Crancer held that the court was notrequired to stay the collection proceeding until the ICCruled on the reasonableness of rates; not that the court wasprohibited from doing so. That is entirely consistent withour holding here. IIIRespondents raise two arguments to the effect that peti-tioners' $ 11705(b)(3) counterclaims are not yet cognizable incourt. First, respondents argue that there exists what theydenominate as a "pay first" rule, whereby payment of thetariff rate is a "prerequisite to litigating the rate reasonable-ness issue." Brief for Respondents 23. See alsoMilneTruck Lines, Inc. v. Makita U. S. A., Inc., 970 F. 2d 564,572 (CA9 1992) (embracing similar theory). That argumentwould have merit if the holding in United States ex rel.Louisville Cement Co. v. ICC, 246 U. S. 638 (1918), were stillgood law. In that case, this Court held that a shipper'scause of action for reparations did not accrue "until paymenthad been made of the unreasonable charges."Id., at 644.The opinion noted that "if Congress had intended that thecause of action of the shipper to recover damages for unrea-sonable charges should accrue when the shipment was received, or when it was delivered by the carrier, . . . a simpleand obvious form for expressing that intention would havebeen used." Ibid. Within two years, Congress enacted asimple and obvious provision stating that any "cause of action in respect of a shipment of property shall . . . be deemedto accrue upon delivery or tender of delivery." Transportation Act of 1920, $ 424, 41 Stat. 492. That provision survivesin substantially the same form in text now codified at 49U. S. C. $ 11706(g). While it is theoretically possible for astatute to create a cause of action that accrues at one timefor the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitationsbegins to run, but at another time for the purpose of bringing suit, we will not infer such an odd result in the absenceof any such indication in the statute. We therefore hold that507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT268 REITER v. COOPEROpinion of the Courtpetitioners could assert a claim under $ 11705(b)(3) beforepayment, but after their shipments were delivered.Second, respondents contend that the doctrine of primaryjurisdiction requires petitioners initially to present theirunreasonable-rate claims to the ICC, rather than to a court.That reflects a mistaken understanding of primary jurisdic-tion, which is a doctrine specifically applicable to claimsproperly cognizable in court that contain some issue withinthe special competence of an administrative agency. It requires the court to enable a "referral" to the agency, stayingfurther proceedings so as to give the parties reasonable opportunity to seek an administrative ruling.3 See WesternPacific, 352 U. S., at 63-64; Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U. S. 289, 291, 302 (1973); Port of Boston MarineTerminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400U. S. 62, 65, 68 (1970). Referral of the issue to the adminis-trative agency does not deprive the court of jurisdiction; ithas discretion either to retain jurisdiction or, if the partieswould not be unfairly disadvantaged, to dismiss the case3 "Referral" is sometimes loosely described as a process whereby a courtrefers an issue to an agency. See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 1336. But the ICA(like most statutes) contains no mechanism whereby a court can on itsown authority demand or request a determination from the agency; thatis left to the adversary system, the court merely staying its proceedingswhile the shipper files an administrative complaint under $ 11701(b). See$ 11705(c)(1) (second sentence). Use of the term "referral" to describethis process seems to have originated in Western Pacific, which assertedthat, where issues within the special competence of an agency arise, "thejudicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views." United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352U. S. 59, 64 (1956). At the conclusion of that passage, the Western PacificCourt cited General American Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado TerminalCo., 308 U. S. 422, 433 (1940), which in turn cited Mitchell Coal & Coke Co.v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 230 U. S. 247 (1913). Mitchell Coal spelled outthe actual procedure contemplated, holding that further action by the district court should "be stayed so as to give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity within which to apply to the Commission for a ruling as to thereasonableness of the practice," id., at 267.507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:18 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwithout prejudice. See Carnation Co. v. Pacific WestboundConference, 383 U. S. 213, 222-223 (1966); Mitchell Coal &Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 230 U. S. 247, 266-267(1913); Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1037,1055 (1964).The result that respondents seek would be produced, notby the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, but by the doctrineof exhaustion of administrative remedies. Where relief isavailable from an administrative agency, the plaintiff is ordinarily required to pursue that avenue of redress before pro-ceeding to the courts; and until that recourse is exhausted,suit is premature and must be dismissed. See Myers v.Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U. S. 41, 50-51 (1938);Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 617, 619, and n. 12 (1984).That doctrine is inapplicable to petitioners' reparationsclaims, however, because the ICC has long interpreted itsstatute as giving it no power to decree reparations relief.Shortly after enactment of the provision now codified at$ 11705(b)(3), the ICC said that the law did not "grant theCommission any initial jurisdiction . . . with respect to theaward of reparations"; rather, "shippers' recourse must beto the courts," which would "refer" the issue of rate reasonableness to the Commission. Informal Procedure for Determining Motor Carrier and Freight Forwarder Reparation, 335 I. C. C. 403, 413 (1969). The ICC continues toadhere to that view.

C. 2d, at 106-107; NITL--Petition to Institute Rulemaking on NegotiatedMotor Common Carrier Rates, 5 I. C. C. 2d, at 625, 630-631.We find that to be at least a reasonable interpretation of thestatute, and hence a binding one. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837(1984).Nor can we discern within the ICA an intent that, eventhough the ICC cannot decree relief, ICC determination of507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:19 PAGES OPINPGT270 REITER v. COOPEROpinion of the Courtthe reasonable-rate issue must be obtained before filing thecivil action. Since the limitations period for filing actionsunder $ 11705(b)(3) begins running at the time of delivery ofthe shipment, rather than at the time the ICC enters anorder, compare $$ 11706(c)(2) and (g) with $ 11706(e), theperiod could expire before the ICC acted. We are not disposed to find an implicit prior-agency-determination require-ment that would have such consequences.IVSince we have concluded that petitioners' unreasonable-rate claims are subject to the ordinary rules governing counterclaims, the judgment below must be reversed. Neitherthe Court of Appeals nor the District Court made the "express determination" required under Rule 54(b) for entry ofa separate judgment on respondents' claims, and we cannotsay categorically that it would be an abuse of discretioneither to grant or to deny separate judgment. In the ordinary case, where a carrier is solvent and has promptlyinitiated suit, the equities favor separate judgment on theprincipal claim: referral of the unreasonable-rate issue couldproduce substantial delay, and tariff rates not disapprovedby the ICC are legal rates, binding on both the shipper andthe carrier. SeeKeogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co.,260 U. S. 156, 163 (1922); Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison,T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370, 384 (1932); Lowden v.Simonds-Shields-Lonsdale Grain Co., 306 U. S. 516, 520(1939). The equities change, however, when the suing car-rier is in bankruptcy. Indeed, we have previously held thateven a "threat of insolvency" of the party seeking separatejudgment is a factor weighing against it. SeeCurtiss-Wright, 446 U. S., at 12. Even so, we cannot say that insolvency is an absolute bar. Conceivably, a district court coulddetermine that other equities favor separate judgment--forexample, a threat that the shipper may become insolvent,which Rule 62(h) would allow a court to protect against by507US1$41z 11-18-96 20:24:19 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 507 U. S. 258 (1993)Opinion of the Courtentering separate judgment for the carrier but staying en-forcement on condition that the shipper deposit the amountof the judgment with the court. Id., at 13, n. 3.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
