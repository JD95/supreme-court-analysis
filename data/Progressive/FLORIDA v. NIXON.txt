This capital case concerns defense counsel's strategic deci-sion to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant'scommission of murder, and to concentrate the defense onestablishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing thedefendant's life. Any concession of that order, the Flor-ida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant's express consent--however gruesome the crime and despitethe strength of the evidence of guilt--automatically ranksas prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitatinga new trial. We reverse the Florida Supreme Court'sjudgment.Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 688 (1984). But when a defendant, in-formed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the coursecounsel describes as the most promising means to avert asentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred frompursuing that course. The reasonableness of counsel's per-formance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generallyapplicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Didcounsel's representation "f[a]ll below an objective standardof reasonableness"?Id., at 688, 694.

Nixon v. State, 572 So. 2d1336, 1337 (Fla. 1990) (Nixon I); 13 Record 2464-2466.Bickner had been tied to a tree and set on fire while stillalive. Id., at 2475, 2483-2484.

The next day, police found Bickner's car, aban-doned on a Tallahassee street corner, on fire.Id., at 2520.Police arrested 23-year-old Joe Elton Nixon later that morn-ing, after Nixon's brother informed the sheriff 's office thatNixon had confessed to the murder. Id., at 2559.Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detailhow he had kidnaped Bickner, then killed her.1 He recounted that he had approached Bickner, a stranger, in amall, and asked her to help him jump-start his car. 5id., at919-921. Bickner offered Nixon a ride home in her 1973 MGsports car.Id., at 922. Once on the road, Nixon directedBickner to drive to a remote place; en route, he overpoweredher and stopped the car.Id., at 924, 926-927.

Concerned that Bickner might identify him, Nixondecided to kill her.Id., at 929. He set fire to Bickner's personal belongings and ignited her with burning objects. Id.,at 934-935. Nixon drove away in the MG, and later told hisbrother and girlfriend what he had done. Id., at 938, 961.He burned the MG on Tuesday, August 14, after reading inthe newspaper that Bickner's body had been discovered.Id., at 963, 982.The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishingthat Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described. A witness saw Nixon approach Bickner in themall's parking lot on August 12, and observed Bickner takingjumper cables out of the trunk of her car and giving them toNixon. 13 id., at 2447-2448, 2450. Several witnesses toldpolice they saw Nixon driving around in the MG in the hoursand days following Bickner's death. See id., at 2456, 2487-2488, 2498, 2509. Nixon's palm print was found on the trunkof the car. Id., at 2548-2549. Nixon's girlfriend, WandaRobinson, and his brother, John Nixon, both stated thatNixon told them he had killed someone and showed themtwo rings later identified as Bickner's. 5 id., at 971, 987; 13id., at 2565. According to Nixon's brother, Nixon pawnedthe rings, 5 id., at 986, and attempted to sell the car, id., at973. At a local pawnshop, police recovered the rings and areceipt for them bearing Nixon's driver's license number; thepawnshop owner identified Nixon as the person who sold therings to him. 13 id., at 2568-2569.In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County,Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, andarson. See App. 1, 55. Assistant public defender MichaelCorin, assigned to represent Nixon, see id., at 232, filed aplea of not guilty, id., at 468-469, and deposed all of theState's potential witnesses, id., at 53-58. Corin concluded,given the strength of the evidence, that Nixon's guilt was543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN181Cite as: 543 U. S. 175 (2004)Opinion of the Courtnot "subject to any reasonable dispute." Id., at 490.2 Corinthereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuadethe prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange forNixon's guilty pleas to all charges. Id., at 336-338, 507.Negotiations broke down when the prosecutors indicatedtheir unwillingness to recommend a sentence other thandeath. See id., at 339, 508.Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capitalcharge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, be-lieving that the only way to save Nixon's life would be topresent extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon'smental instability.Id., at 261, 473; see also id., at 102. Ex-perienced in capital defense, see id., at 248-250, Corin fearedthat denying Nixon's commission of the kidnaping and mur-der during the guilt phase would compromise Corin's abilityto persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixon'sconduct was the product of his mental illness. See id., at473, 490, 505. Corin concluded that the best strategy wouldbe to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase. Id., at 458, 505.Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at leastthree times. Id., at 254-255. Although Corin had repre-sented Nixon previously on unrelated charges and the twohad a good relationship in Corin's estimation, see id., at 466-467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions, id., at 478-480. He never verbally approved or pro-tested Corin's proposed strategy.Id., at 234-238, 255, 501.Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance ordirection in preparing the case, id., at 478, and refused toattend pretrial dispositions of various motions, Nixon I, 572So. 2d, at 1341; App. 478. Corin eventually exercised his2 Every court to consider this case, including the judge who presidedover Nixon's trial, agreed with Corin's assessment of the evidence. See,e. g., Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So. 2d 618, 625 (Fla. 2000) (per curiam)(evidence of guilt was "overwhelming"); State v. Nixon, Case No. 84-2324(Fla. Cir.

Onthe second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be es-corted into the courtroom, and threatened to force theguards to shoot him. Nixon I, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record1934-1935. An extended on-the-record colloquy followedNixon's bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trialjudge to explain Nixon's rights to him and ascertain whetherNixon understood the significance of absenting himself fromthe trial. Corin also argued that restraining Nixon andcompelling him to be present would prejudice him in theeyes of the jury.Id., at 1918-1920. When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated hehad no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave ifforced to attend. Id., at 1926-1931. The judge ruled thatNixon had intelligently and voluntarily waived his right tobe present at trial. Id., at 1938; 11 id., at 2020.The guilt phase of the trial thus began in Nixon's absence.3In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixon's guiltand urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase:"In this case, there won't be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused JeannieBickner's death. . . . [T]hat fact will be proved to yoursatisfaction beyond any doubt."This case is about the death of Joe Elton Nixon andwhether it should occur within the next few years by3 Except for a brief period during the second day of the trial, Nixonremained absent throughout the proceedings.

But, I'm suggesting to you that when you haveseen all the testimony, heard all the testimony and theevidence that has been shown, there are going to be rea-sons why you should recommend that his life be spared."App. 71-72.During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape ofNixon's confession, expert testimony on the manner in whichBickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon's con-fessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner's carand personal effects. Corin cross-examined these witnessesonly when he felt their statements needed clarification, see,e. g., 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case,20id., at 3741. Corin did object to the introduction of crimescene photographs as unduly prejudicial, 13 id., at 2470, andactively contested several aspects of the jury instructionsduring the charge conference, 11id., at 2050-2058. In hisclosing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon's guilt, App.73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penaltyphase: "I will hope to . . . argue to you and give you reasonsnot that Mr. Nixon's life be spared one final and terminalconfinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die,"id., at 74. The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.At the start of the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jurythat "Joe Elton Nixon is not normal organically, intellectu-ally, emotionally or educationally or in any other way." Id.,at 102. Corin presented the testimony of eight witnesses.543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN184 FLORIDA v. NIXONOpinion of the CourtRelatives and friends described Nixon's childhood emotionaltroubles and his erratic behavior in the days preceding themurder. See, e. g., id., at 108-120. A psychiatrist and apsychologist addressed Nixon's antisocial personality, his history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, his low IQ,and the possibility that at some point he suffered brain damage. Id., at 143-147, 162-166. The State presented littleevidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating itsguilt-phase evidence by reference, and introducing testimony, over Corin's objection, that Nixon had removed Bick-ner's underwear in order to terrorize her.Id., at 105-106.In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixon's youth,the psychiatric evidence, and the jury's discretion to considerany mitigating circumstances, id., at 194-199; Corin urgedthat, if not sentenced to death, "Joe Elton Nixon would[n]ever be released from confinement," id., at 207. Thedeath penalty, Corin maintained, was appropriate only for"intact human being[s]," and "Joe Elton Nixon is not one ofthose. He's never been one of those. He never will be oneof those." Id., at 209. Corin concluded: "You know, we'renot around here all that long. And it's rare when we havethe opportunity to give or take life. And you have that opportunity to give life. And I'm going to ask you to do that.Thank you." Ibid. After deliberating for approximatelythree hours, the jury recommended that Nixon be sentencedto death.

S. 175 (2004)Opinion of the CourtOn direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, Nixon,represented by new counsel, argued that Corin had renderedineffective assistance by conceding Nixon's guilt without ob-taining Nixon's express consent. Nixon I, 572 So. 2d, at1338-1339. Relying on United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.648 (1984), new counsel urged that Corin's concession shouldbe presumed prejudicial because it left the prosecution's caseunexposed to "meaningful adversarial testing,"id., at 658-659. The Florida Supreme Court remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether Nixon consented to the strategy,see App. 216-217, but ultimately declined to rule on the matter, finding the evidence of Corin's interactions with Nixoninconclusive, Nixon I, 572 So. 2d, at 1340.In a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to FloridaRule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 (1999), Nixon renewedhis Cronic-based "presumption of prejudice" ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.4 After the trial court rejectedthe claim, State v. Nixon, Case No. 84-2324 (Cir. Ct., Oct. 22,1997), App. 389-390, the Florida Supreme Court remandedfor a further hearing on Nixon's consent to defense counsel'sstrategy.Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So. 2d 618, 625 (2000)(Nixon II). Corin's concession, according to the Florida Supreme Court, was the "functional equivalent of a guilty plea"in that it allowed the prosecution's guilt-phase case toproceed essentially without opposition. Id., at 622-624.Under Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242-243 (1969), aguilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; it must be basedon express affirmations made intelligently and voluntarily.Similarly, the Florida Supreme Court stated, a concessionof guilt at trial requires a defendant's "affirmative, explicitacceptance," without which counsel's performance is pre4 Nixon contended in the alternative that Corin's decision to concedeguilt was unreasonable and prejudicial under the generally applicablestandard set out in Strickland v.

Thecourt acknowledged that Nixon was "very disruptive and uncooperative at trial," and that "counsel's strategy may havebeen in Nixon's best interest."Id., at 625. Nevertheless,the court firmly declared that "[s]ilent acquiescence is notenough,"id., at 624; counsel who concedes a defendant's guiltis inevitably ineffective, the court ruled, if the defendantdoes not expressly approve counsel's course, id., at 625.On remand, Corin testified that he explained his view ofthe case to Nixon several times, App. 479-480, and that ateach consultation, Nixon "did nothing affirmative or negative," id., at 481-482; see also id., at 486-487. Failing toelicit a definitive response from Nixon, Corin stated, hechose to pursue the concession strategy because, in his professional judgment, it appeared to be "the only way tosave [Nixon's] life." Id., at 472. Nixon did not testify atthe hearing. The trial court found that Nixon's "naturalpattern of communication" with Corin involved passivelyreceiving information, and that Nixon consented to thestrategy "through his behavior." State v. Nixon, CaseNo. R84-2324AF (Fla. Cir. Ct., Sept. 20, 2001), p. 13; 2Record 378.Observing that "no competent, substantial evidence . . .establish[ed] that Nixon affirmatively and explicitly agreedto counsel's strategy," the Florida Supreme Court reversedand remanded for a new trial. Nixon v. State, 857 So. 2d172, 176 (2003) (Nixon III) (emphasis in original). Threejustices disagreed with the majority's determination thatCorin's concession rendered his representation inadequate.Id., at 183 (Lewis, J., concurring in result); id., at 189 (Wells,J., joined by Shaw, S. J., dissenting).We granted certiorari, 540 U. S. 1217 (2004), to resolve animportant question of constitutional law, i. e., whether counsel's failure to obtain the defendant's express consent to astrategy of conceding guilt in a capital trial automaticallyrenders counsel's performance deficient, and whether coun543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN187Cite as: 543 U. S. 175 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsel's effectiveness should be evaluated under Cronic orStrickland. We now reverse the judgment of the FloridaSupreme Court.IIAn attorney undoubtedly has a duty to consult with theclient regarding "important decisions," including questionsof overarching defense strategy. Strickland, 466 U. S., at688. That obligation, however, does not require counsel toobtain the defendant's consent to "every tactical decision."Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417-418 (1988) (an attorneyhas authority to manage most aspects of the defense withoutobtaining his client's approval). But certain decisions regarding the exercise or waiver of basic trial rights are ofsuch moment that they cannot be made for the defendantby a surrogate. A defendant, this Court affirmed, has "theultimate authority" to determine "whether to plead guilty,waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take anappeal." Jones v. Barnes, 463 U. S. 745, 751 (1983); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 93, n. 1 (1977) (Burger, C. J.,concurring). Concerning those decisions, an attorney mustboth consult with the defendant and obtain consent to therecommended course of action.A guilty plea, we recognized in Boykin v. Alabama, 395U. S. 238 (1969), is an event of signal significance in a criminal proceeding. By entering a guilty plea, a defendantwaives constitutional rights that inhere in a criminal trial,including the right to trial by jury, the protection againstself-incrimination, and the right to confront one's accusers.Id., at 243. While a guilty plea may be tactically advantageous for the defendant, id., at 240, the plea is not simply astrategic choice; it is "itself a conviction," id., at 242, and thehigh stakes for the defendant require "the utmost solicitude," id., at 243. Accordingly, counsel lacks authority toconsent to a guilty plea on a client's behalf, Brookhart v.Janis, 384 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1966); moreover, a defendant's tacit543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN188 FLORIDA v. NIXONOpinion of the Courtacquiescence in the decision to plead is insufficient to renderthe plea valid, Boykin, 395 U. S., at 242.The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see supra,at 185-186, required Nixon's "affirmative, explicit acceptance" of Corin's strategy because it deemed Corin's statements to the jury "the functional equivalent of a guilty plea."Nixon II, 758 So. 2d, at 624. We disagree with thatassessment.Despite Corin's concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial. Cf. Boykin, 395 U. S.,at 242-243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is "more than a confessionwhich admits that the accused did various acts," it is a "stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced"(internal quotation marks omitted)). The State was obligedto present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes withwhich Nixon was charged. That aggressive evidence wouldthus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigatingfactors. See supra, at 181, 183-184. Further, the defensereserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence. See supra, at 183. In addition, in the eventof errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guiltwould not hinder the defendant's right to appeal.Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on Brookhart v. Janis,that this Court has already extended the requirement of "affirmative, explicit acceptance" to proceedings "surrender[ing] the right to contest the prosecution's factual case onthe issue of guilt or innocence." Brief for Respondent 32.Defense counsel in Brookhart had agreed to a "prima facie"bench trial at which the State would be relieved of its obligation to put on "complete proof " of guilt or persuade a juryof the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 384U. S., at 5-6. In contrast to Brookhart, there was in Nixon's543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN189Cite as: 543 U. S. 175 (2004)Opinion of the Courtcase no "truncated" proceeding, id., at 6, shorn of the needto persuade the trier "beyond a reasonable doubt," and of thedefendant's right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.While the "prima facie" trial inBrookhart was fairly characterized as "the equivalent of a guilty plea," id., at 7, the fullpresentation to the jury in Nixon's case does not resemblethat severely abbreviated proceeding. Brookhart, in short,does not carry the weight Nixon would place on it.Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explainhis proposed trial strategy to Nixon. See supra, at 181, 186.Given Nixon's constant resistance to answering inquiries putto him by counsel and court, see Nixon III, 857 So. 2d, at187-188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixon'sguilt. The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilledhis duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel's proposed strategy and its potential benefits. Nixon's characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, insum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin's decisionto concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or deathpenalty issue.The Florida Supreme Court's erroneous equation of Corin's concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply thewrong standard in determining whether counsel's performance ranked as ineffective assistance. The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumptionof prejudice that United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648(1984), reserved for situations in which counsel has entirelyfailed to function as the client's advocate. The Florida courttherefore did not hold Nixon to the standard prescribed inStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), which wouldhave required Nixon to show that counsel's concession strategy was unreasonable. As Florida Supreme Court JusticeLewis observed, that court's majority misunderstood Cronicand failed to attend to the realities of defending against a543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN190 FLORIDA v. NIXONOpinion of the Courtcapital charge. Nixon III, 857 So. 2d, at 180-183 (opinionconcurring in result).Cronic recognized a narrow exception to Strickland'sholding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistanceof counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorney's per-formance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense. Cronic instructed that a presumption ofprejudice would be in order in "circumstances that are solikely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating theireffect in a particular case is unjustified." 466 U. S., at 658.The Court elaborated: "[I]f counsel entirely fails to subjectthe prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing,then there has been a denial of Sixth Amendment rights thatmakes the adversary process itself presumptively unrelia-ble."Id., at 659; see Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 696-697(2002) (for Cronic's presumed prejudice standard to apply,counsel's "failure must be complete"). We illustrated justhow infrequently the "surrounding circumstances [will] justify a presumption of ineffectiveness" in Cronic itself. Inthat case, we reversed a Court of Appeals ruling that rankedas prejudicially inadequate the performance of an inexperienced, underprepared attorney in a complex mail fraud trial.466 U. S., at 662, 666.On the record thus far developed, Corin's concession ofNixon's guilt does not rank as a "fail[ure] to function in anymeaningful sense as the Government's adversary." Id., at666.5 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trialmight present a closer question, the gravity of the potentialsentence in a capital trial and the proceeding's two-phase5 In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in theState's evidence at the guilt phase of the trial. See Brief for Respondent13-22. Corin's failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured againstthe Strickland standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constitutedineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter inthe first instance.543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN191Cite as: 543 U. S. 175 (2004)Opinion of the Courtstructure vitally affect counsel's strategic calculus. Attor-neys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because thedefendant's guilt is often clear. Prosecutors are more likelyto seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to alife sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and thecrime heinous. See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).6 In such cases, "avoidingexecution [may be] the best and only realistic result possi-ble." ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases $ 10.9.1,Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev.913, 1040 (2003).Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on thetrial's penalty phase, at which time counsel's mission is topersuade the trier that his client's life should be spared.Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoida counterproductive course.

See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases $ 10.9.2, Commentary(rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) ("If nowritten guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participatein a waiver of the client's trial rights."). Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduceaggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors' minds as they deliberateon the sentence.

NIXONOpinion of the Courtclient and, in essence, the attorney."); Sundby, The CapitalJury and Absolution: The Intersection of Trial Strategy, Remorse, and the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1557, 1589-1591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate thatjuries approach the sentencing phase "cynically" where counsel's sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistentwith the guilt-phase defense); id., at 1597 (in capital cases, a"run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecution'scase for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"can have dire implications for the sentencing phase). In thislight, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting toimpress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness toengage in "a useless charade." See Cronic, 466 U. S., at656-657, n. 19. Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, wenote, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel forthe youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard Loeb and NathanLeopold. Imploring the judge to spare the boys' lives, Darrow declared: "I do not know how much salvage there is inthese two boys. . . . I will be honest with this court as I havetried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys arenot fit to be at large." Attorney for the Damned: ClarenceDarrow in the Courtroom 84 (A. Weinberg ed. 1989); seeTr. of Oral Arg. 40-41 (Darrow's clients "did not expresslyconsent to what he did. But he saved their lives."); cf.Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 9-10 (2003) (per curiam).To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider inconjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determininghow best to proceed. When counsel informs the defendantof the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant's bestinterest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel's strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding thedefendant's explicit consent. Instead, if counsel's strategy,given the evidence bearing on the defendant's guilt, satisfiesthe Strickland standard, that is the end of the matter; notenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.543US1 Unit: $U11 [03-06-07 13:35:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN193Cite as: 543 U.
