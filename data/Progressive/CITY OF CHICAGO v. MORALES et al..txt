Parts I, II, and V, concluding that the ordinance's broad sweep violatesthe requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 358. Theordinance encompasses a great deal of harmless behavior: In any publicplace in Chicago, persons in the company of a gang member "shall" beordered to disperse if their purpose is not apparent to an officer. Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court interprets the ordinance's loiteringdefinition--"to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose"--asgiving officers absolute discretion to determine what activities constitute loitering. See id., at 359. This Court has no authority to construethe language of a state statute more narrowly than the State's highestcourt. See Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S. 447, 455. The three featuresof the ordinance that, the city argues, limit the officer's discretion--(1)it does not permit issuance of a dispersal order to anyone who is movingalong or who has an apparent purpose; (2) it does not permit an arrestif individuals obey a dispersal order; and (3) no order can issue unlessthe officer reasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a gang mem527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN42 CHICAGO v. MORALESSyllabusber--are insufficient. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court is correctthat General Order 92-4 is not a sufficient limitation on police discretion.See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 575. Pp. 60-64.Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Parts III, IV, and VI:1. It was not improper for the state courts to conclude that the ordinance, which covers a significant amount of activity in addition to theintimidating conduct that is its factual predicate, is invalid on its face.An enactment may be attacked on its face as impermissibly vague if,inter alia, it fails to establish standards for the police and public thatare sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 358. The freedom to loiter for innocentpurposes is part of such "liberty." See, e. g., Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S.116, 126. The ordinance's vagueness makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is not an enactment that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499. It is a criminal law thatcontains no mens rea requirement, see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S.379, 395, and infringes on constitutionally protected rights, see id., at391. Pp. 51-56.2. Because the ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequatenotice of what is forbidden and what is permitted, it is impermissiblyvague. See, e. g., Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614. The term"loiter" may have a common and accepted meaning, but the ordinance'sdefinition of that term--"to remain in any one place with no apparentpurpose"--does not. It is difficult to imagine how any Chicagoanstanding in a public place with a group of people would know if he orshe had an "apparent purpose." This vagueness about what loiteringis covered and what is not dooms the ordinance. The city's principalresponse to the adequate notice concern--that loiterers are not subjectto criminal sanction until after they have disobeyed a dispersal order--is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, the fair notice requirement's purpose is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or herconduct to the law. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453. Adispersal order, which is issued only after prohibited conduct hasoccurred, cannot retroactively provide adequate notice of the boundarybetween the permissible and the impermissible applications of the ordinance. Second, the dispersal order's terms compound the inadequacyof the notice afforded by the ordinance, which vaguely requires that theofficer "order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves fromthe area," and thereby raises a host of questions as to the duration anddistinguishing features of the loiterers' separation. Pp. 56-60.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN43Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)SyllabusJustice O'Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that, asconstrued by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards toguide law enforcement officers; in particular, it fails to provide anystandard by which police can judge whether an individual has an "apparent purpose." This vagueness alone provides a sufficient ground foraffirming the judgment below, and there is no need to consider the otherissues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality. It is important to courts and legislatures alike to characterize more clearly thenarrow scope of the Court's holding. Chicago still has reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation andviolence, including, e. g., adoption of laws that directly prohibit the congregation of gang members to intimidate residents, or the enforcementof existing laws with that effect. Moreover, the ordinance could havebeen construed more narrowly to avoid the vagueness problem, by, e. g.,adopting limitations that restrict the ordinance's criminal penalties togang members or interpreting the term "apparent purpose" narrowlyand in light of the Chicago City Council's findings. This Court, however, cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme courthas declined to adopt. See, e. g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,355-356, n. 4. The Illinois Supreme Court misapplied this Court's precedents, particularly Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, to theextent it read them as requiring it to hold the ordinance vague in all ofits applications. Pp. 64-69.Justice Kennedy concluded that, as interpreted by the Illinois Supreme Court, the Chicago ordinance unconstitutionally reaches a broadrange of innocent conduct, and, therefore, is not necessarily saved bythe requirement that the citizen disobey a dispersal order before thereis a violation. Although it can be assumed that disobeying some policecommands will subject a citizen to prosecution whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given, it does not follow that any unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice of its lawfulness.The predicate of a dispersal order is not sufficient to eliminate doubtsregarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance. A citizen, whileengaging in a wide array of innocent conduct, is not likely to know whenhe may be subject to such an order based on the officer's own knowledgeof the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen iscongregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer mightconceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose. Pp. 69-70.Justice Breyer concluded that the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to the police, and it is notsaved by its limitations requiring that the police reasonably believe thatthe person ordered to disperse (or someone accompanying him) is a gang527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN44 CHICAGO v. MORALESSyllabusmember, and that he remain in the public place "with no apparent purpose." Nor does it violate this Court's usual rules governing facialchallenges to forbid the city to apply the unconstitutional ordinance inthis case. There is no way to distinguish in the ordinance's terms between one application of unlimited police discretion and another. It isunconstitutional, not because a policeman applied his discretion wiselyor poorly in a particular case, but rather because the policeman enjoystoo much discretion in every case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinanceis invalid in all its applications. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S.451, 453. Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, the ordinance doesnot escape facial invalidation simply because it may provide fair warningto some individual defendants that it prohibits the conduct in whichthey are engaged. This ordinance is unconstitutional, not because itprovides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide sufficientminimal standards to guide the police. See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402U.

MORALESOpinion of the Courtmembers" from "loitering" with one another or with otherpersons in any public place. The question presented iswhether the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly held that theordinance violates the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment to the Federal Constitution.IBefore the ordinance was adopted, the city council's Committee on Police and Fire conducted hearings to explore theproblems created by the city's street gangs, and more particularly, the consequences of public loitering by gang members. Witnesses included residents of the neighborhoodswhere gang members are most active, as well as some of thealdermen who represent those areas. Based on that evi-dence, the council made a series of findings that are includedin the text of the ordinance and explain the reasons for itsenactment.1The council found that a continuing increase in criminalstreet gang activity was largely responsible for the city's rising murder rate, as well as an escalation of violent and drugrelated crimes. It noted that in many neighborhoodsthroughout the city, " `the burgeoning presence of streetgang members in public places has intimidated many lawabiding citizens.' " 177 Ill. 2d 440, 445, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 58(1997). Furthermore, the council stated that gang members " `establish control over identifiable areas . . . by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from enteringthose areas; and . . .

" Moreover, the council concludedthat the city " `has an interest in discouraging all personsfrom loitering in public places with criminal gang mem-bers.' "Ibid.The ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by afine of up to $500, imprisonment for not more than sixmonths, and a requirement to perform up to 120 hours ofcommunity service. Commission of the offense involves fourpredicates. First, the police officer must reasonably believethat at least one of the two or more persons present in a" `public place' " is a " `criminal street gang membe[r].' "Second, the persons must be " `loitering,' " which the ordi-nance defines as " `remain[ing] in any one place with noapparent purpose.' " Third, the officer must then order" `all' " of the persons to disperse and remove themselves" `from the area.' " Fourth, a person must disobey the offi-cer's order. If any person, whether a gang member or not,disobeys the officer's order, that person is guilty of violatingthe ordinance. Ibid.22 The ordinance states in pertinent part:"(a) Whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonablybelieves to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public placewith one or more other persons, he shall order all such persons to disperseand remove themselves from the area. Any person who does notpromptly obey such an order is in violation of this section."(b) It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of thissection that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a memberof a criminal street gang."(c) As used in this Section:"(1) `Loiter' means to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose."(2) `Criminal street gang' means any ongoing organization, associationin fact or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal,having as one of its substantial activities the commission of one or moreof the criminal acts enumerated in paragraph (3), and whose members527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN48 CHICAGO v.

The limitations confine theauthority to arrest gang members who violate the ordinanceto sworn "members of the Gang Crime Section" and certainother designated officers,4 and establish detailed criteria fordefining street gangs and membership in such gangs.Id.,at 66a-67a. In addition, the order directs district commanders to "designate areas in which the presence of gang mem-bers has a demonstrable effect on the activities of law abiding persons in the surrounding community," and providesthat the ordinance "will be enforced only within the desigindividually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.. . . . ."(5) `Public place' means the public way and any other location open tothe public, whether publicly or privately owned."(e) Any person who violates this Section is subject to a fine of not lessthan $100 and not more than $500 for each offense, or imprisonment fornot more than six months, or both."In addition to or instead of the above penalties, any person who violatesthis section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of communityservice pursuant to section 1-4-120 of this Code."

Id., at 451-452, 687N. E. 2d, at 60-61. Furthermore, it concluded that the ordinance was "not reasonably susceptible to a limiting construc-tion which would affirm its validity."15We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1071 (1998), and now af-firm. Like the Illinois Supreme Court, we conclude that theordinance enacted by the city of Chicago is unconstitution-ally vague.IIIThe basic factual predicate for the city's ordinance is notin dispute. As the city argues in its brief, "the very presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, andlawless gang members and hangers-on on the public waysintimidates residents, who become afraid even to leave theirhomes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperilscommunity residents' sense of safety and security, detractsfrom property values, and can ultimately destabilize entireneighborhoods." 16 The findings in the ordinance explainthat it was motivated by these concerns. We have no doubt14 "The ordinance defines `loiter' to mean `to remain in any one placewith no apparent purpose.' Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015(c)(1)(added June 17, 1992). People with entirely legitimate and lawful purposes will not always be able to make their purposes apparent to an observing police officer. For example, a person waiting to hail a taxi, resting on a corner during a jog, or stepping into a doorway to evade a rainshower has a perfectly legitimate purpose in all these scenarios; however,that purpose will rarely be apparent to an observer." 177 Ill. 2d, at 451-452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 60-61.15 It stated: "Although the proscriptions of the ordinance are vague, thecity council's intent in its enactment is clear and unambiguous. The cityhas declared gang members a public menace and determined that gangmembers are too adept at avoiding arrest for all the other crimes theycommit. Accordingly, the city council crafted an exceptionally broad ordinance which could be used to sweep these intolerable and objectionablegang members from the city streets." Id., at 458, 687 N. E. 2d, at 64.16 Brief for Petitioner 14.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN52 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of Stevens, J.that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating conductwould be constitutional,17 but this ordinance broadly coversa significant amount of additional activity. Uncertaintyabout the scope of that additional coverage provides thebasis for respondents' claim that the ordinance is too vague.We are confronted at the outset with the city's claim thatit was improper for the state courts to conclude that theordinance is invalid on its face. The city correctly points outthat imprecise laws can be attacked on their face under twodifferent doctrines.18 First, the overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exerciseof First Amendment rights if the impermissible applicationsof the law are substantial when "judged in relation to thestatute's plainly legitimate sweep."Broadrick v. Okla-homa, 413 U. S. 601, 612-615 (1973). Second, even if anenactment does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, it may be impermissibly vaguebecause it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary depriva-tion of liberty interests.Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352,358 (1983).While we, like the Illinois courts, conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face, we do not rely on the overbreadthdoctrine. We agree with the city's submission that the lawdoes not have a sufficiently substantial impact on conduct17 In fact the city already has several laws that serve this purpose. See,e. g., Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720 $$ 5/12-6 (1998) (intimidation); 570/405.2(streetgang criminal drug conspiracy); 147/1 et seq. (Illinois StreetgangTerrorism Omnibus Prevention Act); 5/25-1 (mob action). Deputy Superintendent Cooper, the only representative of the police department at theCommittee on Police and Fire hearing on the ordinance, testified that, ofthe kinds of behavior people had discussed at the hearing, "90 percent ofthose instances are actually criminal offenses where people, in fact, can bearrested." Record, Appendix II to plaintiff's Memorandum in Oppositionto Motion to Dismiss 182 (Tr. of Proceedings, Chicago City Council Committee on Police and Fire, May 18, 1992).18 Brief for Petitioner 17.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN53Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.protected by the First Amendment to render it unconstitu-tional. The ordinance does not prohibit speech. Becausethe term "loiter" is defined as remaining in one place "withno apparent purpose," it is also clear that it does not prohibitany form of conduct that is apparently intended to conveya message. By its terms, the ordinance is inapplicable toassemblies that are designed to demonstrate a group's sup-port of, or opposition to, a particular point of view. Cf.Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.288 (1984);Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U. S. 111 (1969). Its im-pact on the social contact between gang members and othersdoes not impair the First Amendment "right of association"that our cases have recognized. SeeDallas v. Stanglin, 490U. S. 19, 23-25 (1989).On the other hand, as the United States recognizes, thefreedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment.19 We have expressly identified this "right toremove from one place to another according to inclination"as "an attribute of personal liberty" protected by the Constitution. Williams v. Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274 (1900); see alsoPapachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 164 (1972).2019 See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23: "We do not doubtthat, under the Due Process Clause, individuals in this country have significant liberty interests in standing on sidewalks and in other publicplaces, and in traveling, moving, and associating with others." The cityappears to agree, at least to the extent that such activities include "socialgatherings." Brief for Petitioner 21, n. 13. Both Justice Scalia, post,at 83-86 (dissenting opinion), and Justice Thomas, post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion), not only disagree with this proposition, but also incorrectlyassume (as the city does not, see Brief for Petitioner 44) that identificationof an obvious liberty interest that is impacted by a statute is equivalentto finding a violation of substantive due process.

These laws went virtually unchallenged in this country untilattorneys became widely available to the indigent following our decisionin Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See Recent Developments,Constitutional Attacks on Vagrancy Laws, 20 Stan. L. Rev. 782, 783 (1968).In addition, vagrancy laws were used after the Civil War to keep formerslaves in a state of quasi slavery. In 1865, for example, Alabama broadened its vagrancy statute to include " `any runaway, stubborn servant orchild' " and " `a laborer or servant who loiters away his time, or refusesto comply with any contract for a term of service without just cause.' "T. Wilson, Black Codes of the South 76 (1965). The Reconstruction-eravagrancy laws had especially harsh consequences on African-Americanwomen and children. L. Kerber, No Constitutional Right to be Ladies:Women and the Obligations of Citizenship 50-69 (1998). Neither this history nor the scholarly compendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, post, at102-106, persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirelyharmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protectedby the Due Process Clause.21 The freewheeling and hypothetical character of Justice Scalia's discussion of liberty is epitomized by his assumption that citizens of Chicago,who were once "free to drive about the city" at whatever speed theywished, were the ones who decided to limit that freedom by adopting aspeed limit. Post, at 73. History tells quite a different story.In 1903, the Illinois Legislature passed "An Act to regulate the speedof automobiles and other horseless conveyances upon the public streets,roads, and highways of the state of Illinois." That statute, with someexceptions, set a speed limit of 15 miles per hour. See Christy v. Elliott,216 Ill. 31, 74 N. E. 1035 (1905). In 1900, there were 1,698,575 citizens ofChicago, 1 Twelfth Census of the United States 430 (1900) (Table 6), but527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN55Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.There is no need, however, to decide whether the impactof the Chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge underthe overbreadth doctrine. Cf. Aptheker v. Secretary ofState, 378 U. S. 500, 515-517 (1964) (right to travel); PlannedParenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 82-83(1976) (abortion); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355, n. 3,358-360, and n. 9. For it is clear that the vagueness of thisenactment makes a facial challenge appropriate. This is notan ordinance that "simply regulates business behavior andcontains a scienter requirement." See Hoffman Estates v.Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982).It is a criminal law that contains nomens rea requirement,see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 395 (1979), and infringes on constitutionally protected rights, see id., at 391.When vagueness permeates the text of such a law, it issubject to facial attack.22only 8,000 cars (both private and commercial) registered in the entireUnited States. See Ward's Automotive Yearbook 230 (1990). Eventhough the number of cars in the country had increased to 77,400 by 1905,ibid., it seems quite clear that it was pedestrians, rather than drivers, whowere primarily responsible for Illinois' decision to impose a speed limit.22 The burden of the first portion of Justice Scalia's dissent is virtuallya facial challenge to the facial challenge doctrine. See post, at 74-83. Hefirst lauds the "clarity of our general jurisprudence" in the method forassessing facial challenges and then states that the clear import of ourcases is that, in order to mount a successful facial challenge, a plaintiffmust "establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Actwould be valid." See post, at 78-79 (emphasis deleted); United States v.Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). To the extent we have consistentlyarticulated a clear standard for facial challenges, it is not the Salernoformulation, which has never been the decisive factor in any decision ofthis Court, including Salerno itself (even though the defendants in thatcase did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them,see id., at 745, n. 3, the Court nevertheless entertained their facial challenge). Since we, like the Illinois Supreme Court, conclude that vagueness permeates the ordinance, a facial challenge is appropriate.We need not, however, resolve the viability of Salerno's dictum, becausethis case comes to us from a state--not a federal--court. When asserting527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN56 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of Stevens, J.Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of twoindependent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kindof notice that will enable ordinary people to understand whatconduct it prohibits; second, it may authorize and evenencourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. SeeKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 357. Accordingly, wefirst consider whether the ordinance provides fair notice tothe citizen and then discuss its potential for arbitraryenforcement.IV"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirementsof the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardlessthat it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohib-its . . . ."Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S. 399, 402-403(1966). The Illinois Supreme Court recognized that theterm "loiter" may have a common and accepted meaning, 177Ill. 2d, at 451, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61, but the definition of thatterm in this ordinance--"to remain in any one place with noapparent purpose"--does not. It is difficult to imagine howa facial challenge, a party seeks to vindicate not only his own rights, butthose of others who may also be adversely impacted by the statute inquestion. In this sense, the threshold for facial challenges is a species ofthird party (jus tertii) standing, which we have recognized as a prudentialdoctrine and not one mandated by Article III of the Constitution. SeeSecretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 955(1984). When a state court has reached the merits of a constitutionalclaim, "invoking prudential limitations on [the respondent's] assertion ofjus tertii would serve no functional purpose." City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 243 (1983) (internal quotationmarks omitted).Whether or not it would be appropriate for federal courts to apply theSalerno standard in some cases--a proposition which is doubtful--statecourts need not apply prudential notions of standing created by this Court.See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 618 (1989). Justice Scalia'sassumption that state courts must apply the restrictive Salerno test isincorrect as a matter of law; moreover it contradicts "essential principlesof federalism." See Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 284 (1994).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public placewith a group of people would know if he or she had an "apparent purpose." If she were talking to another person,would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly downthe street, would she have an apparent purpose? 23Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of "loitering,"but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinanceand what is not. The Illinois Supreme Court emphasizedthe law's failure to distinguish between innocent conduct andconduct threatening harm.24 Its decision followed the precedent set by a number of state courts that have upheld ordinances that criminalize loitering combined with some otherovert act or evidence of criminal intent.25 However, state23 The Solicitor General, while supporting the city's argument that theordinance is constitutional, appears to recognize that the ordinance cannotbe read literally without invoking intractable vagueness concerns. "[T]hepurpose simply to stand on a corner cannot be an `apparent purpose' underthe ordinance; if it were, the ordinance would prohibit nothing at all."Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-13.24 177 Ill. 2d, at 452, 687 N. E. 2d, at 61. One of the trial courts thatinvalidated the ordinance gave the following illustration: "Suppose a groupof gang members were playing basketball in the park, while waiting for adrug delivery. Their apparent purpose is that they are in the park toplay ball. The actual purpose is that they are waiting for drugs. Underthis definition of loitering, a group of people innocently sitting in a parkdiscussing their futures would be arrested, while the `basketball players'awaiting a drug delivery would be left alone." Chicago v. Youkhana, Nos.93 MCI 293363 et al. (Ill. Cir. Ct., Cook Cty., Sept. 29, 1993), App. to Pet.for Cert. 48a-49a.25 See, e. g., Tacoma v. Luvene, 118 Wash. 2d 826, 827 P. 2d 1374 (1992)(upholding ordinance criminalizing loitering with purpose to engage indrug-related activities); People v. Superior Court, 46 Cal. 3d 381, 394-395,758 P. 2d 1046, 1052 (1988) (upholding ordinance criminalizing loitering forthe purpose of engaging in or soliciting lewd act).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN58 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of Stevens, J.courts have uniformly invalidated laws that do not join theterm "loitering" with a second specific element of thecrime.26The city's principal response to this concern about adequate notice is that loiterers are not subject to sanction untilafter they have failed to comply with an officer's order todisperse. "[W]hatever problem is created by a law thatcriminalizes conduct people normally believe to be innocentis solved when persons receive actual notice from a policeorder of what they are expected to do."27 We find this response unpersuasive for at least two reasons.First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to thelaw. "No one may be required at peril of life, liberty orproperty to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes."Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). Althoughit is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctionsunless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering isthe conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit.28 Ifthe loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersalorder itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If thepolice are able to decide arbitrarily which members of thepublic they will order to disperse, then the Chicago ordi-nance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87, 9026 See, e. g., State v. Richard, 108 Nev. 626, 627, n. 2, 836 P. 2d 622, 623,n. 2 (1992) (striking down statute that made it unlawful "for any person toloiter or prowl upon the property of another without lawful business withthe owner or occupant thereof").27 Brief for Petitioner 31.28 In this way, the ordinance differs from the statute upheld in Colten v.Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972). There, we found that the illegalityof the underlying conduct was clear. "Any person who stands in a groupof persons along a highway where the police are investigating a trafficviolation and seeks to engage the attention of an officer issuing a summonsshould understand that he could be convicted under . . . Kentucky's statuteif he fails to obey an order to move on." Ibid.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.(1965).29 Because an officer may issue an order only afterprohibited conduct has already occurred, it cannot providethe kind of advance notice that will protect the putative loi-terer from being ordered to disperse. Such an order cannotretroactively give adequate warning of the boundary be-tween the permissible and the impermissible applications ofthe law.30Second, the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance. It pro-vides that the officer "shall order all such persons to disperseand remove themselves from the area." App. to Pet. forCert. 61a. This vague phrasing raises a host of questions.After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers re-main apart? How far must they move? If each loitererwalks around the block and they meet again at the samelocation, are they subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again? As we do here, we have foundvagueness in a criminal statute exacerbated by the use ofthe standards of "neighborhood" and "locality." Connally v.General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385 (1926). We remarked inConnally that "[b]oth terms are elastic and, dependent uponcircumstances, may be equally satisfied by areas measuredby rods or by miles." Id., at 395.Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer's duty toobey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance uncon29 "Literally read . . . this ordinance says that a person may stand on apublic sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer ofthat city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration." 382 U. S., at 90.30 As we have noted in a similar context: "If petitioners were held guiltyof violating the Georgia statute because they disobeyed the officers, thiscase falls within the rule that a generally worded statute which is construed to punish conduct which cannot constitutionally be punished is unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it fails to give adequate warningof the boundary between the constitutionally permissible and constitutionally impermissible applications of the statute." Wright v. Georgia, 373U. S. 284, 292 (1963).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of the Courtstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conductwere clear, but it does buttress our conclusion that the entireordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate noticeof what is forbidden and what is permitted. The Constitution does not permit a legislature to "set a net large enoughto catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts tostep inside and say who could be rightfully detained, andwho should be set at large."United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.214, 221 (1876). This ordinance is therefore vague "not inthe sense that it requires a person to conform his conductto an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, butrather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specifiedat all."Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971).VThe broad sweep of the ordinance also violates " `the re-quirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines togovern law enforcement.' " Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S.,at 358. There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. Inany public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand orsit in the company of a gang member may be ordered todisperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatorylanguage in the enactment directs the police to issue an orderwithout first making any inquiry about their possible pur-poses. It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near WrigleyField is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpseof Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if theirpurpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may--indeed, she "shall"--order them to disperse.Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantialamount of innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its languageto determine if it "necessarily entrusts lawmaking to themoment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat."Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 360 (internal quotationmarks omitted). As we discussed in the context of fair no527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN61Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of the Courttice, see supra, at 56-60, the principal source of the vastdiscretion conferred on the police in this case is the definitionof loitering as "to remain in any one place with no apparentpurpose."As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it"provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide whatactivities constitute loitering." 177 Ill. 2d, at 457, 687 N. E.2d, at 63. We have no authority to construe the languageof a state statute more narrowly than the construction givenby that State's highest court.31 "The power to determinethe meaning of a statute carries with it the power to prescribe its extent and limitations as well as the method bywhich they shall be determined."Smiley v. Kansas, 196U. S. 447, 455 (1905).Nevertheless, the city disputes the Illinois SupremeCourt's interpretation, arguing that the text of the ordinancelimits the officer's discretion in three ways. First, it doesnot permit the officer to issue a dispersal order to anyonewho is moving along or who has an apparent purpose. Sec-ond, it does not permit an arrest if individuals obey a dispersal order. Third, no order can issue unless the officerreasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a member ofa criminal street gang.Even putting to one side our duty to defer to a state court'sconstruction of the scope of a local enactment, we find eachof these limitations insufficient. That the ordinance doesnot apply to people who are moving--that is, to activity thatwould not constitute loitering under any possible definition ofthe term--does not even address the question of how muchdiscretion the police enjoy in deciding which stationary per31 This critical fact distinguishes this case from Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S.312, 329-330 (1988). There, we noted that the text of the relevant statute,read literally, may have been void for vagueness both on notice and ondiscretionary enforcement grounds. We then found, however, that theCourt of Appeals had "provided a narrowing construction that alleviatesboth of these difficulties." Ibid.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN62 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of the Courtsons to disperse under the ordinance.32 Similarly, that theordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersalorder has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance tothe officer deciding whether such an order should issue.The "no apparent purpose" standard for making that deci-sion is inherently subjective because its application dependson whether some purpose is "apparent" to the officer on thescene.Presumably an officer would have discretion to treat somepurposes--perhaps a purpose to engage in idle conversationor simply to enjoy a cool breeze on a warm evening--as toofrivolous to be apparent if he suspected a different ulteriormotive. Moreover, an officer conscious of the city council'sreasons for enacting the ordinance might well ignore its textand issue a dispersal order, even though an illicit purpose isactually apparent.It is true, as the city argues, that the requirement that theofficer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains agang member does place a limit on the authority to orderdispersal. That limitation would no doubt be sufficient ifthe ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparentlyharmful purpose or effect,33 or possibly if it only applied toloitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gangmembers. But this ordinance, for reasons that are not explained in the findings of the city council, requires no harmfulpurpose and applies to nongang members as well as suspected gang members.34 It applies to everyone in the city32 It is possible to read the mandatory language of the ordinance andconclude that it affords the police no discretion, since it speaks with themandatory "shall." However, not even the city makes this argument,which flies in the face of common sense that all police officers must usesome discretion in deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances.33 Justice Thomas' dissent overlooks the important distinction betweenthis ordinance and those that authorize the police "to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse." See post, at 107.34 Not all of the respondents in this case, for example, are gang members.The city admits that it was unable to prove that Morales is a gang memberbut justifies his arrest and conviction by the fact that Morales admitted527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN63Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwho may remain in one place with one suspected gang member as long as their purpose is not apparent to an officerobserving them. Friends, relatives, teachers, counselors, oreven total strangers might unwittingly engage in forbiddenloitering if they happen to engage in idle conversation witha gang member.Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance not only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also has the perverse consequence of excludingfrom its coverage much of the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment. As the city council's findings demonstrate, the most harmful gang loitering is motivated eitherby an apparent purpose to publicize the gang 's dominance ofcertain territory, thereby intimidating nonmembers, or by anequally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce inillegal drugs. As the Illinois Supreme Court has not placedany limiting construction on the language in the ordinance,we must assume that the ordinance means what it says andthat it has no application to loiterers whose purpose is apparent. The relative importance of its application to harmlessloitering is magnified by its inapplicability to loitering thathas an obviously threatening or illicit purpose.Finally, in its opinion striking down the ordinance, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to accept the general order issued by the police department as a sufficient limitation onthe "vast amount of discretion" granted to the police in itsenforcement. We agree. See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.566, 575 (1974). That the police have adopted internal ruleslimiting their enforcement to certain designated areas in thecity would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might bearrested elsewhere. Nor could a person who knowingly loitered with a well-known gang member anywhere in the city"that he knew he was with criminal street gang members." Reply Brieffor Petitioner 23, n. 14.

E. 2d, at 64. We recognize theserious and difficult problems testified to by the citizens ofChicago that led to the enactment of this ordinance. "Weare mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in parton the maintenance of social order." Houston v. Hill, 482U. S. 451, 471-472 (1987). However, in this instance the cityhas enacted an ordinance that affords too much discretion tothe police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use thepublic streets.Accordingly, the judg ment of the Supreme Court ofIllinois is Affirmed.Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.I agree with the Court that Chicago's Gang CongregationOrdinance, Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015 (1992) (gangloitering ordinance or ordinance) is unconstitutionally vague.A penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to "define thecriminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinarypeople can understand what conduct is prohibited" or fails to35 This conclusion makes it unnecessary to reach the question whetherthe Illinois Supreme Court correctly decided that the ordinance is invalidas a deprivation of substantive due process. For this reason, JusticeThomas, see post, at 102-106, and Justice Scalia, see post, at 85-86, aremistaken when they assert that our decision must be analyzed under theframework for substantive due process set out in Washington v.

Of these, "the more important aspect of thevagueness doctrine `is . . . the requirement that a legislatureestablish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.' "Id., at 358 (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574-575(1974)). I shareJustice Thomas' concern about the consequences of gang violence, and I agree that some degreeof police discretion is necessary to allow the police "toperform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily."Post, at 109 (dissenting opinion). A criminal law, however,must not permit policemen, prosecutors, and juries to con-duct " `a standardless sweep . . . to pursue their personalpredilections.' " Kolender v. Lawson, supra, at 358 (quotingSmith v. Goguen, supra, at 575).The ordinance at issue provides:"Whenever a police officer observes a person whom hereasonably believes to be a criminal street gang memberloitering in any public place with one or more other per-sons, he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area. Any person who doesnot promptly obey such an order is in violation of thissection."

E. 2d 53, 63 (1997) (emphasis added). ThisCourt is bound by the Illinois Supreme Court's constructionof the ordinance. See Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1,4 (1949).As it has been construed by the Illinois court, Chicago'sgang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague becauseit lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforce527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of O'Connor, J.ment officers. In particular, it fails to provide police withany standard by which they can judge whether an individualhas an "apparent purpose." Indeed, because any personstanding on the street has a general "purpose"--even if it issimply to stand--the ordinance permits police officers tochoose which purposes are permissible. Under this con-struction the police do not have to decide that an individualis "threaten[ing] the public peace" to issue a dispersal order.Seepost, at 107 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Any police officerin Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Court's con-struction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any personstanding in a public place with a suspected gang member todisperse. Further, as construed by the Illinois court, theordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons whoare not gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in anypark, coffee shop, bar, or "other location open to the public,whether publicly or privately owned." Chicago MunicipalCode $ 8-4-015(c)(5) (1992).To be sure, there is no violation of the ordinance unless aperson fails to obey promptly the order to disperse. But, apolice officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decidesthat a person is remaining in one place "with no apparentpurpose," and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision. Moreover,the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only whenthey "reasonably believ[e]" that a group of loiterers includesa gang member fails to cure the ordinance's vague aspects.If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believedto be gang members, this requirement might have cured theordinance's vagueness because it would have directed themanner in which the order was issued by specifying to whomthe order could be issued. Cf. ante, at 62. But, the IllinoisSupreme Court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 453-454, 687 N.

That limitationwould no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied toloitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, orpossibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonablybelieved to be criminal gang members"). Accordingly, thereis no need to consider the other issues briefed by the partiesand addressed by the plurality. I express no opinion aboutthem.It is important to courts and legislatures alike that wecharacterize more clearly the narrow scope of today's holding. As the ordinance comes to this Court, it is unconstitutionally vague. Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicagoreasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posedby gang intimidation and violence. For example, the Courtproperly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance fromlaws that require loiterers to have a "harmful purpose," seeibid., from laws that target only gang members, see ibid.,and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and mannerin which the laws may be enforced, see ante, at 62-63. Inaddition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that "directlyprohibit[s]" the " `presence of a large collection of obviouslybrazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-onon the public ways,' " that " `intimidates residents.' " Ante,at 51, 52 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 14). Indeed, as theplurality notes, the city of Chicago has several laws that doexactly this. See ante, at 52, n. 17. Chicago has evenenacted a provision that "enables police officers to fulfill . . .their traditional functions," including "preserving the publicpeace." See post, at 106 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Specifi527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of O'Connor, J.cally, Chicago's general disorderly conduct provision allowsthe police to arrest those who knowingly "provoke, make oraid in making a breach of peace." See Chicago MunicipalCode $ 8-4-010 (1992).In my view, the gang loitering ordinance could have beenconstrued more narrowly. The term "loiter" might possiblybe construed in a more limited fashion to mean "to remainin any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate othersfrom entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities."Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago CityCouncil's findings and would avoid the vagueness problemsof the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court.See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a. As noted above, sowould limitations that restricted the ordinance's criminalpenalties to gang members or that more carefully delineatedthe circumstances in which those penalties would apply tonongang members.The Illinois Supreme Court did not choose to give a limiting construction to Chicago's ordinance. To the extent itrelied on our precedents, particularly Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156 (1972), as requiring it to hold theordinance vague in all of its applications because it was intentionally drafted in a vague manner, the Illinois courtmisapplied our precedents. See 177 Ill. 2d, at 458-459, 687N. E. 2d, at 64. This Court has never held that the intentof the drafters determines whether a law is vague. Nevertheless, we cannot impose a limiting construction that a statesupreme court has declined to adopt. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S., at 355-356, n. 4 (noting that the Court hasheld that " `[f]or the purpose of determining whether astate statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute validlegislation we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it' "(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); New York527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 527 U.

Accordingly, I joinParts I, II, and V of the Court's opinion and concur in thejudgment.Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.I join Parts I, II, and V of the Court's opinion and concurin the judgment.I also share many of the concerns Justice Stevensexpresses in Part IV with respect to the sufficiency of notice under the ordinance. As interpreted by the IllinoisSupreme Court, the Chicago ordinance would reach a broadrange of innocent conduct. For this reason it is not necessarily saved by the requirement that the citizen must dis-obey a police order to disperse before there is a violation.We have not often examined these types of orders. Cf.Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87 (1965). It can beassumed, however, that some police commands will subject acitizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given. Illustrative examplesinclude when the police tell a pedestrian not to enter a building and the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team, or toprotect a crime scene, or to secure an area for the protectionof a public official. It does not follow, however, that anyunexplained police order must be obeyed without notice ofthe lawfulness of the order. The predicate of an order todisperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubtsregarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance. Acitizen, while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct,is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersalorder based on the officer's own knowledge of the identityor affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is con527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN70 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of Breyer, J.gregating; nor may the citizen be able to assess what an offi-cer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparentpurpose.Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.The ordinance before us creates more than a "minor limi-tation upon the free state of nature." Post, at 74 (Scalia,J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The law authorizes a policeofficer to order any person to remove himself from any "loca-tion open to the public, whether publicly or privatelyowned," Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015(c)(5) (1992), i. e.,any sidewalk, front stoop, public park, public square, lakesidepromenade, hotel, restaurant, bowling alley, bar, barbershop,sports arena, shopping mall, etc., but with two, and only two,limitations: First, that person must be accompanied by (ormust himself be) someone police reasonably believe is a gangmember. Second, that person must have remained in thatpublic place "with no apparent purpose." $ 8-4-015(c)(1).The first limitation cannot save the ordinance. Though itlimits the number of persons subject to the law, it leavesmany individuals, gang members and nongang membersalike, subject to its strictures. Nor does it limit in any waythe range of conduct that police may prohibit. The secondlimitation is, as the Court, ante, at 62, andJustice O'Connor, ante, at 65-66 (opinion concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment), point out, not a limitation at all. Sinceone always has some apparent purpose, the so-called limita-tion invites, in fact requires, the policeman to interpret thewords "no apparent purpose" as meaning "no apparent purpose except for . . . ." And it is in the ordinance's delegationto the policeman of open-ended discretion to fill in that blankthat the problem lies. To grant to a policeman virtuallystandardless discretion to close off major portions of the cityto an innocent person is, in my view, to create a major, nota "minor," "limitation upon the free state of nature."527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Opinion of Breyer, J.Nor does it violate "our rules governing facial challenges,"post, at 74 (Scalia, J., dissenting), to forbid the city to applythe unconstitutional ordinance in this case. The reason whythe ordinance is invalid explains how that is so. As I havesaid, I believe the ordinance violates the Constitution because it delegates too much discretion to a police officer todecide whom to order to move on, and in what circumstances.And I see no way to distinguish in the ordinance's termsbetween one application of that discretion and another. Theordinance is unconstitutional, not because a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case, butrather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion inevery case. And if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion, then the ordinanceis invalid in all its applications. The city of Chicago may beable validly to apply some other law to the defendants inlight of their conduct. But the city of Chicago may no moreapply this law to the defendants, no matter how they behaved, than it could apply an (imaginary) statute that said,"It is a crime to do wrong," even to the worst of murderers.See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939) ("If onits face the challenged provision is repugnant to the dueprocess clause, specification of details of the offense intendedto be charged would not serve to validate it").Justice Scalia's examples, post, at 81-83, reach a different conclusion because they assume a different basis for thelaw's constitutional invalidity. A statute, for example, mightnot provide fair warning to many, but an individual defendant might still have been aware that it prohibited the conduct in which he engaged. Cf., e. g., Parker v. Levy, 417U. S. 733, 756 (1974) ("[O]ne who has received fair warningof the criminality of his own conduct from the statute inquestion is [not] entitled to attack it because the languagewould not give similar fair warning with respect to otherconduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 CHICAGO v. MORALESOpinion of Breyer, J.One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness"). But I believe thisordinance is unconstitutional, not because it provides insufficient notice, but because it does not provide "sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers." See ante,at 65-66 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurringin judgment).I concede that this case is unlike those First Amendment"overbreadth" cases in which this Court has permitted a facial challenge. In an overbreadth case, a defendant whoseconduct clearly falls within the law and may be constitutionally prohibited can nonetheless have the law declared faciallyinvalid to protect the rights of others (whose protectedspeech might otherwise be chilled). In the present case, theright that the defendants assert, the right to be free fromthe officer's exercise of unchecked discretion, is more clearlytheir own.This case resembles Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611(1971), where this Court declared facially unconstitutionalon, among other grounds, the due process standard of vagueness an ordinance that prohibited persons assembled on asidewalk from "conduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by." The Court explained:"It is said that the ordinance is broad enough to encompass many types of conduct clearly within the city'sconstitutional power to prohibit. And so, indeed, it is.The city is free to prevent people from blocking sidewalks, obstructing traffic, littering streets, committingassaults, or engaging in countless other forms of antisocial conduct. It can do so through the enactment andenforcement of ordinances directed with reasonablespecificity toward the conduct to be prohibited. . . . Itcannot constitutionally do so through the enactment andenforcement of an ordinance whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed." Id., at 614 (citation omitted).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN73Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingThe ordinance in Coates could not constitutionally be appliedwhether or not the conduct of the particular defendants wasindisputably "annoying" or of a sort that a different, morespecific ordinance could constitutionally prohibit. Similarly,here the city might have enacted a different ordinance, orthe Illinois Supreme Court might have interpreted this ordinance differently. And the Constitution might well havepermitted the city to apply that different ordinance (or thisordinance as interpreted differently) to circumstances likethose present here. Seeante, at 67-68 (O'Connor, J., con-curring in part and concurring in judgment). But this ordinance, as I have said, cannot be constitutionally applied toanyone.Justice Scalia, dissenting.The citizens of Chicago were once free to drive about thecity at whatever speed they wished. At some point Chicagoans (or perhaps Illinoisans) decided this would not do, andimposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safeoperation by the average (or perhaps even subaverage)driver with the average (or perhaps even subaverage) vehicle. This infringed upon the "freedom" of all citizens, butwas not unconstitutional.Similarly, the citizens of Chicago were once free to standaround and gawk at the scene of an accident. At some pointChicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and causedmore accidents. They did not make the practice unlawful,but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd todisperse, and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such anorder. Again, this prophylactic measure infringed upon the"freedom" of all citizens, but was not unconstitutional.Until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted,the citizens of Chicago were free to stand about in publicplaces with no apparent purpose--to engage, that is, in conduct that appeared to be loitering. In recent years, how-ever, the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs.As reflected in the record before us, these gangs congregated527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingin public places to deal in drugs, and to terrorize the neigh-borhoods by demonstrating control over their "turf." Manyresidents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners intheir own homes. Once again, Chicagoans decided that toeliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of thefreedom that they once enjoyed. The means they took wassimilar to the second, and more mild, example given aboverather than the first: Loitering was not made unlawful, butwhen a group of people occupied a public place without anapparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member, police officers were authorized to order them to disperse,and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful.See Chicago Municipal Code $ 8-4-015 (1992). The minorlimitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylacticarrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them(and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation oftheir streets.The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonablemeasure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges,by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right,and by discerning vagueness where, according to our usualstandards, none exists.IRespondents' consolidated appeal presents a facial chal-lenge to the Chicago ordinance on vagueness grounds.When a facial challenge is successful, the law in question isdeclared to be unenforceable in all its applications, and notjust in its particular application to the party in suit. To tellthe truth, it is highly questionable whether federal courtshave any business making such a declaration. The rationalefor our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality, expressed in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803),was that wehad to do so in order to decide the case beforeus. But that rationale only extends so far as to require usto determine that the statute is unconstitutional as appliedto this party, in the circumstances of this case.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN75Cite as: 527 U.

If a judge, in deciding a particular point, destroys a general principle by passing a judgment whichtends to reject all the inferences from that principle, andconsequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinarylimits of his functions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view,he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed toconfine his authority; he assumes a more important, andperhaps a more useful influence, than that of the magistrate; but he ceases to represent the judicial power.. . . . ."Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the United States,he may refuse to admit it as a rule . . . .

MORALESScalia, J., dissentingbe accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judi-cial functionaries." Democracy in America 73, 75-76(R. Heffner ed. 1956).As Justice Sutherland described our system in his opinionfor a unanimous Court inMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S.447, 488 (1923):"We have no power per se to review and annul acts ofCongress on the ground that they are unconstitutional.That question may be considered only when the justifi-cation for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such anact.

Itamounts to little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment, which otherwisewould stand in the way of the enforcement of a legalright. . . . If a case for preventive relief be presented thecourt enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the statute,but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding."And as Justice Brennan described our system in his opinionfor a unanimous Court inUnited States v. Raines, 362 U.

In the exer-cise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, towhich it has rigidly adhered, one, never to anticipate aquestion of constitutional law in advance of the necessityof deciding it; the other never to formulate a rule of527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN77Cite as: 527 U.

Kindred tothese rules is the rule that one to whom application of astatute is constitutional will not be heard to attack thestatute on the ground that impliedly it might also betaken as applying to other persons or other situations inwhich its application might be unconstitutional. . . . Thedelicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypo-thetical cases thus imagined."It seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this sys-tem for the Court not to be content to find that a statute isunconstitutional as applied to the person before it, but to gofurther and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional inall applications. Its reasoning may well suggest as much,but to pronounce aholding on that point seems to me nomore than an advisory opinion--which a federal court shouldnever issue at all, see Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), andespecially should not issue with regard to a constitutionalquestion, as to which we seek to avoid even nonadvisoryopinions, see, e. g., Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). I think it quite improper,in short, to ask the constitutional claimant before us: Do youjust want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionallybe applied to you in this case, or do you want to go for brokeand try to get the statute pronounced void in all itsapplications?I must acknowledge, however, that for some of the presentcentury we have done just this. But until recently, at least,we have--except in free-speech cases subject to the doctrineof overbreadth, see, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,769-773 (1982)--required the facial challenge to be a go-forbroke proposition. That is to say, before declaring a statuteto be void in all its applications (something we should not bedoing in the first place), we have at least imposed upon thelitigant the eminently reasonable requirement that he estab527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN78 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentinglish that the statute was unconstitutional in all its applica-tions. (I say that is an eminently reasonable requirement,not only because we should not be holding a statute voidin all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all itsapplications, but also because unless it is unconstitutional inall its applications we do not even know, without conductingan as-applied analysis, whether it is void with regard to thevery litigantbefore us--whose case, after all, was the occa-sion for undertaking this inquiry in the first place.1)As we said in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745(1987):"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, sincethe challenger must establish that no set of circum1 In other words, a facial attack, since it requires unconstitutionality inall circumstances, necessarily presumes that the litigant presently beforethe court would be able to sustain an as-applied challenge. See HoffmanEstates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 495 (1982) ("Aplaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannotcomplain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.A court should therefore examine the complainant's conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law"); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S.733, 756 (1974) ("One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may notsuccessfully challenge it for vagueness").The plurality asserts that in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739(1987), which I discuss in text immediately following this footnote, theCourt "entertained" a facial challenge even though "the defendants . . .did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them."Ante, at 55, n. 22. That is not so. The Court made it absolutely clearin Salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that "no set ofcircumstances exists under which the Act would be valid," 481 U. S., at745 (emphasis added). The footnoted statement upon which the pluralityrelies ("Nor have respondents claimed that the Act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case," id.,at 745, n. 3) was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendantswere not making, in addition to their facial challenge, an alternativeas-applied challenge--i. e., asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in itsparticular application to them.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN79Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingstances exists under which the Act would be valid.The fact that [a legislative Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstancesis insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we havenot recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside thelimited context of the First Amendment." (Emphasisadded.) 2This proposition did not originate with Salerno, but hadbeen expressed in a line of prior opinions. See,e. g., Mem-bers of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 796 (1984) (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (statute not implicating First Amendment rights isinvalid on its face if "it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application"); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 269, n. 18(1984); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,455 U. S. 489, 494-495, 497 (1982); United States v. NationalDairy Products Corp., 372 U. S. 29, 31-32 (1963); Raines,362 U. S., at 21. And the proposition has been reaffirmedin many cases and opinions since. See,e. g., Anderson v.Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155-156, n. 6 (1995) (unanimousCourt); Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities forGreat Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 699 (1995) (opinion for the Courtby Stevens, J.) (facial challenge asserts that a challengedstatute or regulation is invalid "in every circumstance");Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 301 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan,2 Salerno, a criminal case, repudiated the Court's statement in Kolenderv. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 359, n. 8 (1983), to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed "even when [the statute] couldconceivably have had some valid application." Kolender seems to haveconfused the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges withthe standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds. See ibid.(citing the Court's articulation of the standard for First Amendment overbreadth challenges from Hoffman Estates, supra, at 494). As Salernonoted, supra, at 745, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exceptionto the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk thatan overbroad statute will chill free expression. See, e. g., Broadrick v.Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN80 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissenting500 U. S. 173, 183 (1991); Ohio v.

S. 1, 11-12 (1988).3 Unsurprisingly,given the clarity of our general jurisprudence on this point,the Federal Courts of Appeals all apply the Salerno stand-ard in adjudicating facial challenges.43 The plurality asserts that the Salerno standard for facial challenge"has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this Court." Ante,at 55, n. 22. It means by that only this: in rejecting a facial challenge,the Court has never contented itself with identifying only one situationin which the challenged statute would be constitutional, but has mentionedseveral. But that is not at all remarkable, and casts no doubt upon thevalidity of the principle that Salerno and these many other cases enunciated. It is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutionalin only a single application--and hard to resist mentioning more than one.The plurality contends that it does not matter whether the Salernostandard is federal law, since facial challenge is a species of third-partystanding, and federal limitations upon third-party standing do not applyin an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view, as theIllinois Supreme Court's opinion did here. Ante, at 55-56, n. 22. This isquite wrong. Disagreement over the Salerno rule is not a disagreementover the "standing" question whether the person challenging the statutecan raise the rights of third parties: under both Salerno and the plurality'srule he can. The disagreement relates to how many third-party rightshe must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win: Salernosays "all" (in addition to his own rights), the plurality says "many." Thatis not a question of standing but of substantive law. The notion that, ifSalerno is the federal rule (a federal statute is not totally invalid unlessit is invalid in all its applications), it can be altered by a state court (afederal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications),and that that alteration must be accepted by the Supreme Court of theUnited States is, to put it as gently as possible, remarkable.4 See, e. g., Abdullah v. Commissioner of Ins. of Commonwealth ofMass., 84 F. 3d 18, 20 (CA1 1996); Deshawn E. v. Safir, 156 F. 3d 340, 347(CA2 1998); Artway v. Attorney Gen. of State of N.

But the presentcase does not even lend itself to such a "political correctness"exception--which, though illogical, is at least predictable.It is not a` la mode to favor gang members and associatedloiterers over the beleaguered law-abiding residents of theinner city.When our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied,it is clear that the Justices in the majority have transposedthe burden of proof. Instead of requiring respondents, whoare challenging the ordinance, to show that it is invalid in allits applications, they have required petitioner to show thatit is valid in all its applications. Both the plurality opinionand the concurrences display a lively imagination, creatinghypothetical situations in which the law's application would(in their view) be ambiguous. But that creative role hasbeen usurped from petitioner, who can defeat respondents'facial challenge by conjuring up a single valid applicationof the law.

MORALESScalia, J., dissentingalongside and chatting with fellow gang members while stak-ing out their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side ofChicago; the group is flashing gang signs and displaying theirdistinctive tattoos to passersby. Officer Krupke, applyingthe ordinance at issue here, orders the group to disperse.After some speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here)over whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off furtherconversation with the statement--not entirely coherent, butevidently intended to be rude--"Gee, Officer Krupke, krupyou." A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arreststhe group for failing to obey his dispersal order. Even assuming (as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) thata law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order, beforeits issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard tobelieve that the Jets would not have known they had it coming. That should settle the matter of respondents' facialchallenge to the ordinance's vagueness.Of course respondents would still be able to claim that theordinance was vague as applied to them. But the ultimatedemonstration of the inappropriateness of the Court's holding of facial invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whethersome of these respondents could even sustain an as-appliedchallenge on the basis of the majority's own criteria. Forinstance, respondent Jose Renteria--who admitted that hewas a member of the Satan Disciples gang--was observedby the arresting officer loitering on a street corner withother gang members. The officer issued a dispersal order,but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minuteslater, Renteria was still there with his friends, whereuponhe was arrested. In another example, respondent DanielWashington and several others--who admitted they weremembers of the Vice Lords gang--were observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street, yelling at passing vehicles, stopping traffic, and preventing pedestrians from using527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN83Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingthe sidewalks. The arresting officer issued a dispersalorder, issued another dispersal order later when the groupdid not move, and finally arrested the group when they werefound loitering in the same place still later. Finally, respondent Gregorio Gutierrez--who had previously admittedto the arresting officer his membership in the Latin Kingsgang--was observed loitering with two other men. The of-ficer issued a dispersal order, drove around the block, andarrested the men after finding them in the same place uponhis return. See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 5; Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 11. Even on the majority'sassumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to theobject of the dispersal order ex ante that his conduct is cov-ered by the ordinance, it seems most improbable that any ofthese as-applied challenges would be sustained. Much lessis it possible to say that the ordinance is invalid in all itsapplications. IIThe plurality's explanation for its departure from the usualrule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained inthe following statement: "[This] is a criminal law that con-tains no mens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights . . . . When vagueness permeatesthe text ofsuch a law, it is subject to facial attack." Ante,at 55 (emphasis added). The proposition is set forth withsuch assurance that one might suppose that it repeats somewell-accepted formula in our jurisprudence: (Criminal lawwithout mens rea requirement) ` (infringement of consti-tutionally protected right)` (vagueness) 4 (entitlement tofacial invalidation). There is no such formula; the pluralityhas made it up for this case, as the absence of any citationdemonstrates.But no matter. None of the three factors that the plural-ity relies upon exists anyway. I turn first to the support forthe proposition that there is a constitutionally protectedright to loiter--or, as the plurality more favorably describes527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN84 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingit, for a person to "remain in a public place of his choice."Ante, at 54. The plurality thinks much of this FundamentalFreedom to Loiter, which it contrasts with such lesser, con-stitutionallyunprotected, activities as doing (ugh!) business:"This is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement. . . . It is a crimi-nal law that contains nomens rea requirement . . . and infringes on constitutionally protected rights." Ante, at 55(internal quotation marks omitted). (Poor Alexander Hamilton, who has seen his "commercial republic" devolve, in theeyes of the plurality, at least, into an "indolent republic," seeThe Federalist No. 6, p. 56; No. 11, pp. 84-91 (C. Rossitered. 1961).)Of course every activity, even scratching one's head, canbe called a "constitutional right" if one means by that termnothing more than the fact that the activity is covered (asall are) by the Equal Protection Clause, so that those whoengage in it cannot be singled out without "rational basis."See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313(1993). But using the term in that sense utterly impoverishes our constitutional discourse. We would then needa new term for those activities--such as political speechor religious worship--that cannot be forbidden even withrational basis.The plurality tosses around the term "constitutional right"in this renegade sense, because there is not the slightest evidence for the existence of a genuine constitutional right toloiter. Justice Thomas recounts the vast historical tradition of criminalizing the activity. Post, at 102-106 (dissenting opinion). It is simply not maintainable that the right toloiter would have been regarded as an essential attribute ofliberty at the time of the framing or at the time of adoptionof the Fourteenth Amendment. For the plurality, however,the historical practices of our people are nothing more thana speed bump on the road to the "right" result. Its opinionblithely proclaims: "Neither this history nor the scholarly527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN85Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingcompendia in Justice Thomas' dissent, [ibid.,] persuades usthat the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmlessin both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty pro-tected by the Due Process Clause."Ante, at 54, n. 20. Theentire practice of using the Due Process Clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy setforth in the Bill of Rights (usually under the rubric of socalled "substantive due process") is in my view judicial usur-pation. But we have, recently at least, sought to limit thedamage by tethering the courts' "right-making" power to anobjective criterion. InWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.702, 720-721 (1997), we explained our "established method"of substantive due process analysis: carefully and narrowlydescribing the asserted right, and then examining whetherthat right is manifested in "[o]ur Nation's history, legal tradi-tions, and practices." See alsoCollins v. Harker Heights,503 U. S. 115, 125-126 (1992); Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491U. S. 110, 122-123 (1989); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.494, 502-503 (1977). The plurality opinion not only ignoresthis necessary limitation, but it leaps far beyond anysubstantive-due-process atrocity we have ever committed, byactually placing the burden of proof upon the defendant toestablish that loitering is not a "fundamental liberty." Itnever does marshal any support for the proposition that loitering is a constitutional right, contenting itself with a(transparently inadequate) explanation of why the historicalrecord of laws banning loitering does not positively contradict that proposition,6 and the (transparently erroneous) assertion that the city of Chicago appears to have conceded the6 The plurality's explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of themcarried severe penalties and, during the Reconstruction era, they had"harsh consequences on African-American women and children." Ante,at 54, n. 20. Those severe penalties and those harsh consequences arecertainly regrettable, but they in no way lessen (indeed, the harshness ofpenalty tends to increase) the capacity of these laws to prove that loiteringwas never regarded as a fundamental liberty.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN86 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingpoint.7 It is enough for the Members of the plurality that"history . . . [fails to] persuad[e] us that the right to engagein loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose andeffect is not a part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause," ante, at 54, n. 20 (emphasis added); they appar-ently think it quite unnecessary for anything to persuadethem that it is.8It would be unfair, however, to criticize the plurality'sfailed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally7 Ante, at 53, n. 19. The plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in Part I of petitioner's brief which reads: "Of course,laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest, and thus aresubject to review under the rubric of substantive due process . . . . Weaddress that doctrine in Part II below." Brief for Petitioner 21-22, n. 13.If a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term "social gatherings"in this passage with "loitering," his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to Part II of the brief, which says, in its introductoryparagraph: "[A]s we explain below, substantive due process does not support the court's novel holding that the Constitution secures the right tostand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech,assembly, or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection." Id., at 39.8 The plurality says, ante, at 64, n. 35, that since it decides the case onthe basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process,I am mistaken in analyzing its opinion "under the framework for substantive due process set out in Washington v. Glucksberg." Ibid. But I amnot analyzing it under that framework. I am simply assuming that whenthe plurality says (as an essential part of its reasoning) that "the right toloiter for innocent purposes is . . . a part of the liberty protected by theDue Process Clause" it does not believe that the same word ("liberty")means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and somethingelse for purposes of procedural due process. There is no authority forthat startling proposition. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v.Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572-575 (1972) (rejecting procedural-due-process claimfor lack of "liberty" interest, and citing substantive-due-process cases).The plurality's opinion seeks to have it both ways, invoking the Fourteenth Amendment's august protection of "liberty" in defining the standard of certainty that it sets, but then, in identifying the conduct protectedby that high standard, ignoring our extensive case law defining "liberty,"and substituting, instead, all "harmless and innocent" conduct, ante, at 58.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN87Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingprotected right while saying nothing of the concurrences.The plurality at least makes an attempt. The concurrences,on the other hand, make no pretense at attaching their broad"vagueness invalidates" rule to a liberty interest. As far asappears from Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer'sopinions, no police officer may issue any order, affecting anyinsignificant sort of citizen conduct (except, perhaps, an orderaddressed to the unprotected class of "gang members") un-less the standards for the issuance of that order are precise.No modern urban society--and probably none since Londongot big enough to have sewers--could function under such arule. There are innumerable reasons why it may be important for a constable to tell a pedestrian to "move on"--andeven if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known, many are simply unpredictable. Hencethe (entirely reasonable) Rule of the city of New York whichreads: "No person shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply withthe lawful direction or command of any Police Officer, UrbanPark Ranger, Parks Enforcement Patrol Officer or other[Parks and Recreation] Department employee, indicatedverbally, by gesture or otherwise." 56 RCNY $ 1-03(c)(1)(1996). It is one thing to uphold an "as-applied" challengewhen a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonable--or even when a pedestrian asserting some true "liberty" interest (holding a political rally, for instance) disobeyssuch an order that is reasonable but unexplained. But tosay that such a general ordinance permitting "lawful orders"is void in all its applications demands more than a safe andorderly society can reasonably deliver.Justice Kennedy apparently recognizes this, since he acknowledges that "some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizenknows why the order is given," including, for example, anorder "tell[ing] a pedestrian not to enter a building" whenthe reason is "to avoid impeding a rescue team." Ante, at69 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN88 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingBut his only explanation of why the present interferencewith the "right to loiter" does not fall within that permittedscope of action is as follows: "The predicate of an order todisperse is not, in my view, sufficient to eliminate doubtsregarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance."Ibid. I have not the slightest idea what this means. ButI do understand that the followup explanatory sentence,showing how this principle invalidates the present ordinance,applies equally to the rescue-team example thatJusticeKennedy thinks is constitutional--as is demonstrated bysubstituting for references to the facts of the present case(shown in italics) references to his rescue-team hypothetical(shown in brackets): "A citizen, while engaging in a widearray of innocent conduct, is not likely to know when he maybe subject to adispersal order [order not to enter a building]based on the officer's own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregat-ing [what is going on in the building]; nor may the citizen beable to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizen's lack of an apparent purpose [the impeding of a rescueteam]." Ante, at 69-70.IIII turn next to that element of the plurality's facial-challenge formula which consists of the proposition that thiscriminal ordinance contains no mens rea requirement. Thefirst step in analyzing this proposition is to determine whatthe actus reus, to which that mens rea is supposed to beattached, consists of. The majority believes that loiteringforms part of (indeed, the essence of) the offense, and mustbe proved if conviction is to be obtained. Seeante, at 47,50-51, 53-55, 57-59, 60-61, 62-63 (plurality and majorityopinions); ante, at 65, 66, 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment);ante, at 69-70 (Kennedy, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at72-73 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment). That is not what the ordinance provides. The527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN89Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingonly part of the ordinance that refers to loitering is the por-tion that addresses, not the punishable conduct of the defendant, but what the police officer must observe before he canissue an order to disperse; and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant appears to bedoing, not in terms of what the defendant isactually doing.The ordinance does not require that the defendant have beenloitering (i. e., have been remaining in one place with no pur-pose), but rather that the police officer have observed himremaining in one place without any apparent purpose.Someone who in fact has a genuine purpose for remainingwhere he is (waiting for a friend, for example, or waiting tohold up a bank)can be ordered to move on (assuming theother conditions of the ordinance are met), so long as hisremaining has no apparent purpose. It is likely, to be sure,that the ordinance will come down most heavily upon thosewho are actually loitering (those who really have no purposein remaining where they are); but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order.Theonly act of a defendant that is made punishable by theordinance--or, indeed, that is even mentioned by the ordinance--is his failure to "promptly obey" an order to disperse.The question, then, is whether that actus reus must be accompanied by any wrongful intent--and of course it must.As the Court itself describes the requirement, "a personmust disobey the officer's order." Ante, at 47 (emphasisadded). No one thinks a defendant could be successfullyprosecuted under the ordinance if he did not hear the orderto disperse, or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered hiscompliance impossible. The willful failure to obey a policeorder is wrongful intent enough.IVFinally, I address the last of the three factors in the plural-ity's facial-challenge formula: the proposition that the ordinance is vague. It is not. Even under the ersatz over527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN90 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingbreadth standard applied in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S.352, 358, n. 8 (1983), which allows facial challenges if a lawreaches "a substantial amount of constitutionally protectedconduct," respondents' claim fails because the ordinancewould not be vague in most or even a substantial number ofapplications. A law is unconstitutionally vague if its lackof definitive standards either (1) fails to apprise persons ofordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct, or (2) encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See, e. g.,Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108 (1972).The plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects. Since, it reasons, "the loitering is the conduct thatthe ordinance is designed to prohibit," and "an officer mayissue an order only after prohibited conduct has already oc-curred,"ante, at 58, 59, the order to disperse cannot itselfserve "to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct." What counts for purposes of vaguenessanalysis, however, is not what the ordinance is "designed toprohibit," but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty.As discussed earlier, that consists of nothing but the refusalto obey a dispersal order, as to which there is no doubt ofadequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The plurality'ssuggestion that even the dispersal order itself is unconstitu-tionally vague, because it does not specifyhow far to dis-perse(!), see ante, at 59, scarcely requires a response.9 Ifit were true, it would render unconstitutional for vaguenessmany of the Presidential proclamations issued under thatprovision of the United States Code which requires the Pres9 I call it a "suggestion" because the plurality says only that the termsof the dispersal order "compound the inadequacy of the notice," and acknowledges that they "might not render the ordinance unconstitutionallyvague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear." Ante, at 59,59-60. This notion that a prescription ("Disperse!") which is itself notunconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutionalvagueness of the entire scheme is full of mystery--suspending, as it does,the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess(nemo dat qui non habet).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN91Cite as: 527 U.

S. 536, 551 (1965) (rejectingvagueness challenge to the dispersal-order prong of abreach-of-the-peace statute and describing that prong as"narrow and specific").For its determination of unconstitutional vagueness, theCourt relies secondarily--and Justice O'Connor's and Justice Breyer's concurrences exclusively--upon the secondaspect of that doctrine, which requires sufficient specificityto prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.See ante, at 60 (majority opinion); ante, at 65-66 (O'Connor,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); ante, at72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In discussing whether Chicago's ordinance meetsthat requirement, the Justices in the majority hide behindan artificial construct of judicial restraint. They point to theSupreme Court of Illinois' statement that the "apparentpurpose" standard "provides absolute discretion to policeofficers to decide what activities constitute loitering," 177Ill. 2d 440, 457, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 63 (1997), and protest that itwould be wrong to construe the language of the ordinancemore narrowly than did the State's highest court. Ante, at527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN92 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissenting61, 63 (majority opinion); ante, at 68 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The "absolutediscretion" statement, however, is nothing more than the Illinois Supreme Court's characterization of what the languageachieved--after that court refused (as I do) to read in anylimitations that the words do not fairly contain. It is not aconstruction of the language (to which we are bound) but alegal conclusion (to which we most assuredly are not bound).The criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under theChicago ordinance could hardly be clearer. First, the lawrequires police officers to "reasonably believ[e]" that one ofthe group to which the order is issued is a "criminal streetgang member." This resembles a probable-cause standard,and the Chicago Police Department's General Order 92-4(1992)--promulgated to govern enforcement of the ordinance--makes the probable-cause requirement explicit.10Under the Order, officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang,to be substantiated by the officer's "experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders" and by "specific, documentedand reliable information" such as reliable witness testimonyor an individual's admission of gang membership or displayof distinctive colors, tattoos, signs, or other markings wornby members of particular criminal street gangs. App. toPet. for Cert. 67a-69a, 71a-72a.Second, the ordinance requires that the group be "remain[ing] in any one place with no apparent purpose." JusticeO'Connor's assertion that this applies to "any person stand10 "Administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulationare . . . highly relevant to our [vagueness] analysis, for `[i]n evaluating afacial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.'

See also id., at504 (administrative regulations "will often suffice to clarify a standardwith an otherwise uncertain scope").527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN93Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentinging in a public place," ante, at 66, is a distortion. The ordi-nance does not apply to "standing," but to "remain[ing]"--a term which in this context obviously means "[to] endureor persist," see American Heritage Dictionary 1525 (1992).There may be some ambiguity at the margin, but "remain-[ing] in one place" requires more than a temporary stop, andis clear in most of its applications, including all of those rep-resented by the facts surrounding respondents' arrests described supra, at 82-83.As for the phrase "with no apparent purpose":JusticeO'Connor again distorts this adjectival phrase, by separat-ing it from the word that it modifies. "[A]ny person standing on the street," her concurrence says, "has a general `pur-pose'--even if it is simply to stand," and thus "the ordinancepermits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible." Ante, at 66. But Chicago police officers enforcingthe ordinance are not looking for people with no apparentpurpose (who are regrettably in oversupply); they are looking for people who "remain in any one place with no apparent purpose"--that is, who remain there without any ap-parent reasonfor remaining there. That is not difficult toperceive.11The Court's attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of theordinance produces the following peculiar statement: "The`no apparent purpose' standard for making [the decision to11 Justice Breyer asserts that "one always has some apparent purpose," so that the policeman must "interpret the words `no apparent purpose' as meaning `no apparent purpose except for . . . .' " Ante, at 70. Itis simply not true that "one always has some apparent purpose"--andespecially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest, for the simple reason that one often (indeed, perhaps usually)has no actual purpose in remaining at rest. Remaining at rest will be aperson's normal state, unless he has a purpose which causes him to move.That is why one frequently reads of a person's "wandering aimlessly"(which is worthy of note) but not of a person's "sitting aimlessly" (whichis not remarkable at all). And that is why a synonym for "purpose" is"motive": that which causes one to move.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN94 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingissue an order to disperse] is inherently subjective becauseits application depends on whether some purpose is `apparent' to the officer on the scene." Ante, at 62. In theCourt's view, a person's lack of any purpose in staying inone location is presumably an objective factor, and what theordinance requires as a condition of an order to disperse--the absence of any apparent purpose--is a subjective factor.This side of the looking glass, just the opposite is true.Elsewhere, of course, the Court acknowledges the clear,objective commands of the ordinance, and indeed relies uponthem to paint it as unfair:"In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons whostand or sit in the company of a gang member may beordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent.The mandatory language in the enactment directs thepolice to issue an order without first making any inquiryabout their possible purposes. It matters not whetherthe reason that a gang member and his father, for exam-ple, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leav-ing the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is notapparent to a nearby police officer, she may--indeed, she`shall'--order them to disperse." Ante, at 60.Quite so. And the fact that this clear instruction to the of-ficers "reach[es] a substantial amount of innocent conduct,"ibid., would be invalidating if that conduct were constitution-ally protected against abridgment, such as speech or thepractice of religion. Remaining in one place is not so pro-tected, and so (as already discussed) it is up to the citizensof Chicago--not us--to decide whether the tradeoff isworth it.1212 The Court speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretionto enforce the ordinance and direct dispersal when (in the Court's view)the ordinance is inapplicable--viz., where there is an apparent purpose,but it is an unlawful one.

But the vagueness that causes notice to be inad-equate is the very same vagueness that causes "too muchdiscretion" to be lodged in the enforcing officer. Put an-other way: A law that gives the policeman clear guidance inall cases gives the public clear guidance in all cases as well.Thus, whatJustice Breyer gives with one hand, he takesaway with the other. In his view, vague statutes that nonetheless give adequate notice to some violators are not un-enforceable against those violators because of inadequatenotice, but are unenforceable against them "because thepoliceman enjoys too much discretion inevery case," ibid.This is simply contrary to our case law, including Parker v.Levy, supra.13would read the phrase "without any apparent purpose" to mean anythingother than "without any apparent lawful purpose." The implication thatacts referred to approvingly in statutory language are "lawful" acts isroutine. The Court asserts that the Illinois Supreme Court has forced itinto this interpretive inanity because, since it "has not placed any limitingconstruction on the language in the ordinance, we must assume that theordinance means what it says . . . ." Ante, at 63. But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention this particular interpretive issue, which hasnothing to do with giving the ordinance a "limiting" interpretation, andeverything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning.13 The opinion that Justice Breyer relies on, Coates v. Cincinnati, 402U. S. 611 (1971), discussed ante, at 72-73, did not say that the ordinancethere at issue gave adequate notice but did not provide adequate standards for the police. It invalidated that ordinance on both inadequatenotice and inadequate-enforcement-standard grounds, because FirstAmendment rights were implicated. It is common ground, however, that527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN96 CHICAGO v. MORALESScalia, J., dissentingVThe plurality points out that Chicago already has severallaws that reach the intimidating and unlawful gang-relatedconduct the ordinance was directed at. See ante, at 52,n. 17. The problem, of course, well recognized by Chicago'scity council, is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of policeofficers, but return to it as soon as the police drive away.The only solution, the council concluded, was to clear thestreets of congregations of gangs, their drug customers, andtheir associates.Justice O'Connor's concurrence proffers the same emptysolace of existing laws useless for the purpose at hand, seeante, at 67, 67-68, but seeks to be helpful by suggesting somemeasures similar to this ordinance that would be constitutional. It says that Chicago could, for example, enact a lawthat "directly prohibit[s] the presence of a large collection ofobviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members andhangers-on on the public ways, that intimidates residents."Ante, at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted). (If the majority considers the present ordinance too vague, it would befun to see what it makes of "a large collection of obviouslybrazen, insistent, and lawless gang members.") This prescription of the concurrence is largely a quotation from theplurality--which itself answers the concurrence's suggestionthat such a law would be helpful by pointing out that the cityalready "has several laws that serve this purpose." Ante,at 52, n. 17 (plurality opinion) (citing extant laws against "intimidation," "streetgang criminal drug conspiracy," and"mob action"). The problem, again, is that the intimidationand lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight.the present case does not implicate the First Amendment, see ante, at52-53 (plurality opinion); ante, at 72 (Breyer, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN97Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Scalia, J., dissentingJustice O'Connor's concurrence also proffers anothercure: "If the ordinance applied only to persons reasonablybelieved to be gang members, this requirement might havecured the ordinance's vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specify-ing to whom the order could be issued."Ante, at 66 (theCourt agrees that this might be a cure, see ante, at 62). Butthe ordinance already specifies to whom the order can beissued: persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member. And if "remain[ing]in one place with no apparent purpose" is so vague as to givethe police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct ofnongang members, it surpasses understanding how it ceasesto be so vague when applied to gang members alone.Surely gang members cannot be decreed to be outlaws, subject to the merest whim of the police as the rest of us are not.* * *The fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear inits application, cannot be violated except with full knowledgeand intent, and vests no more discretion in the police thaninnumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety. As suggested by theirtortured analyses, and by their suggested solutions that bearno relation to the identified constitutional problem, the ma-jority's real quarrel with the Chicago ordinance is simplythat it permits (or indeed requires) too much harmless con-duct by innocent citizens to be proscribed. AsJusticeO'Connor's concurrence says with disapprobation, "the ordi-nance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who arenot gang members, standing on any sidewalk or in any park,coffee shop, bar, or other location open to the public." Ante,at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).But in our democratic system, how much harmless conductto proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts. Solong as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected,527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN98 CHICAGO v. MORALESThomas, J., dissentingand so long as the proscription has a rational basis, all sortsof perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbidden--riding a motorcycle without asafety helmet, for example, starting a campfire in a nationalforest, or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approvedby the Food and Drug Administration. All of these acts areentirely innocent and harmless in themselves, but because oftherisk of harm that they entail, the freedom to engage inthem has been abridged. The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to "hang out"with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasivegang crime and intimidation--and that the elimination of theone is worth the deprivation of the other. This Court hasno business second-guessing either the degree of necessityor the fairness of the trade.I dissent from the judgment of the Court.Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice andJustice Scalia join, dissenting.The duly elected members of the Chicago City Councilenacted the ordinance at issue as part of a larger effort toprevent gangs from establishing dominion over the publicstreets. By invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that theCourt has unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens tolives of terror and misery. The ordinance is not vague."[A]ny fool would know that a particular category of conductwould be within [its] reach." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S.352, 370 (1983) (White, J., dissenting).

Last year, in an effort to curbplummeting attendance, the Chicago Public Schools hireddozens of adults to escort children to school. The youngsters had become too terrified of gang violence to leave theirhomes alone. Martinez, Parents Paid to Walk Line BetweenGangs and School, Chicago Tribune, Jan. 21, 1998, p. 1. Thechildren's fears were not unfounded. In 1996, the ChicagoPolice Department estimated that there were 132 criminalstreet gangs in the city. Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, Research Bulletin: Street Gangs and Crime4 (Sept. 1996). Between 1987 and 1994, these gangs wereinvolved in 63,141 criminal incidents, including 21,689 non-lethal violent crimes and 894 homicides.

Ordinary citizens like Ms.D'Ivory Gordon explained that she struggled just to walkto work:"When I walk out my door, these guys are out there . . . .. . . . ."They watch you. . . .

I am scared to go out in thedaytime. . . . [Y]ou can't pass because they are standing. Iam afraid to go to the store. I don't go to the store becauseI am afraid.

Another long-time resi-dent testified:"I have never had the terror that I feel everyday whenI walk down the streets of Chicago. . . .. . . . ."I have had my windows broken out. I have hadguns pulled on me. I have been threatened. I get intimidated on a daily basis, and it's come to the pointwhere I say, well, do I go out today. Do I put my ax inmy briefcase. Do I walk around dressed like a bum soI am not looking rich or got any money or anything likethat." Id., at 124-125.Following these hearings, the council found that "criminalstreet gangs establish control over identifiable areas . . . byloitering in those areas and intimidating others from enter-ing those areas." App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. It furtherfound that the mere presence of gang members "intimidate[s]many law abiding citizens" and "creates a justifiable fear forthe safety of persons and property in the area." Ibid. Itis the product of this democratic process--the council's attempt to address these social ills--that we are asked to passjudgment upon today.IIAs part of its ongoing effort to curb the deleterious effectsof criminal street gangs, the citizens of Chicago sensibly decided to return to basics. The ordinance does nothing morethan confirm the well-established principle that the police527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN102 CHICAGO v. MORALESThomas, J., dissentinghave the duty and the power to maintain the public peace,and, when necessary, to disperse groups of individuals whothreaten it. The plurality, however, concludes that the city'scommonsense effort to combat gang loitering fails constitutional scrutiny for two separate reasons--because it in-fringes upon gang members' constitutional right to "loiterfor innocent purposes," ante, at 53, and because it is vagueon its face,ante, at 55. A majority of the Court endorsesthe latter conclusion. I respectfully disagree.AWe recently reconfirmed that "[o]ur Nation's history, legaltraditions, and practices . . . provide the crucial `guidepostsfor responsible decisionmaking' . . . that direct and restrainour exposition of the Due Process Clause." Glucksberg,521 U. S., at 721 (quoting Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)). Only laws that infringe"those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objec-tively, `deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' " offend the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, supra,at 720-721.The plurality asserts that "the freedom to loiter for inno-cent purposes is part of the `liberty' protected by the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." Ante, at53. Yet it acknowledges--as it must--that "antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country." Ante, at 53,n. 20; see also 177 Ill. 2d 440, 450, 687 N. E. 2d 53, 60 (1997)(case below) ("Loitering and vagrancy statutes have beenutilized throughout American history in an attempt to prevent crime by removing `undesirable persons' from publicbefore they have the opportunity to engage in criminal activity"). In derogation of the framework we articulated onlytwo Terms ago inGlucksberg, the plurality asserts that thishistory fails to "persuad[e] us that the right to engage inloitering that is entirely harmless . . . is not a part of theliberty protected by the Due Process Clause." Ante, at 54,527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN103Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Thomas, J., dissentingn. 20. Apparently, the plurality believes it sufficient to reston the proposition that antiloitering laws represent an anachronistic throwback to an earlier, less sophisticated, era. Forexample, it expresses concern that some antivagrancy lawscarried the penalty of slavery. Ibid. But this fact is irrele-vant to our analysis of whether there is a constitutional rightto loiter for innocent purposes. This case does not involvean antiloitering law carrying the penalty of slavery. Thelaw at issue in this case criminalizes the failure to obey apolice officer's order to disperse and imposes modest penalties, such as a fine of up to $500 and a prison sentence of upto six months.The plurality's sweeping conclusion that this ordinance in-fringes upon a liberty interest protected by the FourteenthAmendment's Due Process Clause withers when exposed tothe relevant history: Laws prohibiting loitering and vagrancy have been a fixture of Anglo-American law at leastsince the time of the Norman Conquest. See generallyC. Ribton-Turner, A History of Vagrants and Vagrancy andBeggars and Begging (reprint 1972) (discussing history ofEnglish vagrancy laws); see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 161-162 (1972) (recounting history of va-grancy laws). The American colonists enacted laws modeledupon the English vagrancy laws, and at the time of thefounding, state and local governments customarily criminalized loitering and other forms of vagrancy.2 Vagrancy laws2 See, e. g., Act for the Restraint of idle and disorderly Persons (1784)(reprinted in 2 First Laws of the State of North Carolina 508-509(J.

Of those, only one--decided more than 100years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment--actually addressed the validity of a vagrancy ordinance.That case, Papachristou, supra, contains some dicta that canbe read to support the fundamental right that the pluralityasserts.5 However, the Court in Papachristou did not undertake the now-accepted analysis applied in substantive dueprocess cases--it did not look to tradition to define the rightsprotected by the Due Process Clause. In any event, a careful reading of the opinion reveals that the Court never saidanything about a constitutional right. The Court's holdingwas that the antiquarian language employed in the vagrancyordinance at issue was unconstitutionally vague. See id., at162-163.

See Williams v.Fears, 179 U. S. 270, 274-275 (1900); Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116 (1958).The plurality claims that dicta in those cases articulating a right of freemovement, see Williams, supra, at 274; Kent, supra, at 125, also supportsan individual's right to "remain in a public place of his choice." Ironically,Williams rejected the argument that a tax on persons engaged in thebusiness of importing out-of-state labor impeded the freedom of transit,so the precise holding in that case does not support, but undermines, theplurality's view. Similarly, the precise holding in Kent did not bear on aconstitutional right to travel; instead, the Court held only that Congresshad not authorized the Secretary of State to deny certain passports. Furthermore, the plurality's approach distorts the principle articulated inthose cases, stretching it to a level of generality that permits the Court todisregard the relevant historical evidence that should guide the analysis.Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989) (plurality opinion).527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN106 CHICAGO v. MORALESThomas, J., dissentingtion--it does not compel the conclusion that the Constitutionprotects the right to loiter for innocent purposes. The plurality's contrary assertion calls to mind the warning that"[t]he Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals withjudge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the design of theConstitution. . . . [We] should be extremely reluctant tobreathe still further substantive content into the Due Process Clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a Stateor city to promote its welfare." Moore, 431 U. S., at 544(White, J., dissenting). When "the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the governanceof the country without express constitutional authority."Ibid.BThe Court concludes that the ordinance is also unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide adequate standardsto guide police discretion and because, in the plurality's view,it does not give residents adequate notice of how to conformtheir conduct to the confines of the law. I disagree on bothcounts.1At the outset, it is important to note that the ordinancedoes not criminalize loitering per se. Rather, it penalizesloiterers' failure to obey a police officer's order to movealong. A majority of the Court believes that this schemevests too much discretion in police officers. Nothing couldbe further from the truth. Far from according officers toomuch discretion, the ordinance merely enables police officersto fulfill one of their traditional functions. Police officers arenot, and have never been, simply enforcers of the criminallaw. They wear other hats--importantly, they have longbeen vested with the responsibility for preserving the publicpeace. See, e. g., O. Allen, Duties and Liabilities of Sheriffs527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN107Cite as: 527 U.

The activityof the police for the prevention of crime is partly such asneeds no special legal authority"). Nor is the idea that thepolice are also peace officers simply a quaint anachronism.In most American jurisdictions, police officers continue to beobligated, by law, to maintain the public peace.6In their role as peace officers, the police long have had theauthority and the duty to order groups of individuals whothreaten the public peace to disperse.

SeeOrnelas v.United States, 517 U. S. 690, 695, 700 (1996) ("Articulatingprecisely what `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause'mean is not possible. They are commonsense, nontechnicalconceptions that deal with the factual and practical consider-ations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,not legal technicians, act. . . .

In sum, theCourt's conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vaguebecause it " `necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the momentto-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat,' " ante,at 60, cannot be reconciled with common sense, longstanding police practice, or this Court's Fourth Amendmentjurisprudence.The illogic of the Court's position becomes apparent whenit opines that the ordinance's dispersal provision "would nodoubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loiteringthat had an apparently harmful purpose or effect, or possiblyif it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believedto be criminal gang members." Ante, at 62 (footnote omitted). See also ante, at 67 (O'Connor, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment) (endorsing Court's proposal).With respect, if the Court believes that the ordinance isvague as written, this suggestion would not cure the vagueness problem. First, although the Court has suggested thata scienter requirement may mitigate a vagueness problem"with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainantthat his conduct is proscribed," Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499 (1982) (footnoteomitted), the alternative proposal does not incorporate a scienter requirement. If the ordinance's prohibition were lim527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN111Cite as: 527 U. S. 41 (1999)Thomas, J., dissentingited to loitering with "an apparently harmful purpose," thecriminality of the conduct would continue to depend on itsexternal appearance, rather than the loiterer's state of mind.See Black's Law Dictionary 1345 (6th ed. 1990) (scienter "isfrequently used to signify the defendant's guilty knowledge"). For this reason, the proposed alternative would neither satisfy the standard suggested in Hoffman Estates norserve to channel police discretion. Indeed, an ordinancethat required officers to ascertain whether a group of loiterers have "an apparently harmful purpose" would requirethem to exercise more discretion, not less. Furthermore,the ordinance in its current form--requiring the dispersal ofgroups that contain at least one gang member--actuallyvests less discretion in the police than would a law requiringthat the police disperse groups that contain only gang members. Currently, an officer must reasonably suspect that oneindividual is a member of a gang. Under the plurality's proposed law, an officer would be required to make such a determination multiple times.In concluding that the ordinance adequately channels police discretion, I do not suggest that a police officer enforcingthe Gang Congregation Ordinance will never make a mistake. Nor do I overlook the possibility that a police officer,acting in bad faith, might enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. But our decisions should notturn on the proposition that such an event will be anythingbut rare. Instances of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance, like any other law, are best addressedwhen (and if) they arise, rather than prophylacticallythrough the disfavored mechanism of a facial challenge onvagueness grounds. See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.739, 745 (1987) ("A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, ofcourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid").527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN112 CHICAGO v. MORALESThomas, J., dissenting2The plurality's conclusion that the ordinance "fails to givethe ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden andwhat is permitted," ante, at 60, is similarly untenable.There is nothing "vague" about an order to disperse.9While "we can never expect mathematical certainty from ourlanguage," Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110(1972), it is safe to assume that the vast majority of peoplewho are ordered by the police to "disperse and remove themselves from the area" will have little difficulty understandinghow to comply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.Assuming that we are also obligated to consider whetherthe ordinance places individuals on notice of what conductmight subject them to such an order, respondents in this facial challenge bear the weighty burden of establishing thatthe statute is vague in all its applications, "in the sense thatno standard of conduct is specified at all." Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614 (1971). I subscribe to the view ofretired Justice White--"If any fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within the reach of thestatute, if there is an unmistakable core that a reasonableperson would know is forbidden by the law, the enactmentis not unconstitutional on its face." Kolender, 461 U. S., at370-371 (dissenting opinion). This is certainly such a case.As the Illinois Supreme Court recognized, "persons of ordinary intelligence may maintain a common and accepted9 The plurality suggests, ante, at 59, that dispersal orders are, by theirnature, vague. The plurality purports to distinguish its sweeping condemnation of dispersal orders from Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104(1972), but I see no principled ground for doing so. The logical implicationof the plurality's assertion is that the police can never issue dispersal orders. For example, in the plurality's view, it is apparently unconstitutional for a police officer to ask a group of gawkers to move along in orderto secure a crime scene.527US1 Unit: $U70 [05-09-01 12:56:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN113Cite as: 527 U.

E. 2d, at 61.Justice Stevens' contrary conclusion is predicated primarily on the erroneous assumption that the ordinance proscribes large amounts of constitutionally protected and/orinnocent conduct. See ante, at 55, 56-57, 60. As alreadyexplained, supra, at 102-106, the ordinance does not proscribe constitutionally protected conduct--there is no fundamental right to loiter. It is also anomalous to characterizeloitering as "innocent" conduct when it has been disfavoredthroughout American history. When a category of conducthas been consistently criminalized, it can hardly be considered "innocent." Similarly, when a term has long been usedto describe criminal conduct, the need to subject it to the"more stringent vagueness test" suggested in Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 499, dissipates, for there is no risk of atrap for the unwary. The term "loiter" is no different fromterms such as "fraud," "bribery," and "perjury." We expectpeople of ordinary intelligence to grasp the meaning of suchlegal terms despite the fact that they are arguably imprecise.10The plurality also concludes that the definition of the termloiter--"to remain in any one place with no apparent pur10 For example, a 1764 Georgia law declared that "all able bodiedpersons . . . who shall be found loitering . . . , all other idle vagrants, ordisorderly persons wandering abroad without betaking themselves tosome lawful employment or honest labor, shall be deemed and adjudgedvagabonds," and required the apprehension of "any such vagabond . . .found within any county in this State, wandering, strolling, loiteringabout" (reprinted in First Laws of the State of Georgia, Part 1, 376-377(J.

" Ante, at 56-57. The plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens of Chicago. Persons of ordinary intelligence are perfectly capableof evaluating how outsiders perceive their conduct, and here"[i]t is self-evident that there is a whole range of conductthat anyone with at least a semblance of common sensewould know is [loitering] and that would be covered by thestatute." See Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 584 (1974)(White, J., concurring in judgment). Members of a groupstanding on the corner staring blankly into space, for example, are likely well aware that passersby would conclude thatthey have "no apparent purpose." In any event, becausethis is a facial challenge, the plurality's ability to hypothesizethat some individuals, in some circumstances, may be unableto ascertain how their actions appear to outsiders is irrelevant to our analysis. Here, we are asked to determinewhether the ordinance is "vague in all of its applications."Hoffman Estates, supra, at 497.

While we are bound bya state court's construction of a statute, the Illinois court "did not, strictlyspeaking, construe the [ordinance] in the sense of defining the meaning ofa particular statutory word or phase.

VIRGINIAcertiorari to the supreme court of virginiaNo. 98-5881. Argued March 29, 1999--Decided June 10, 1999Petitioner, his brother Mark, and Gary Barker were arrested at the endof a 2-day crime spree, during which they, inter alia, stole liquor andguns and abducted Alex DeFilippis, who was later shot and killed.Under police questioning, Mark admitted stealing alcoholic beverages,but claimed that petitioner and Barker stole the guns and that petitionershot DeFilippis. When Virginia called Mark as a witness at petitioner'ssubsequent criminal trial, Mark invoked his Fifth Amendment privilegeagainst self-incrimination. The trial court then admitted his statements to the police as declarations of an unavailable witness againstpenal interest, overruling petitioner's objections that the statementswere not against Mark's penal interest because they shifted responsibility for the crimes to Barker and petitioner, and that their admissionwould violate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Petitionerwas convicted of the DeFilippis murder and other crimes. In affirming,the Virginia Supreme Court found that the Confrontation Clause wassatisfied because Mark's statements fell within a firmly rooted exceptionto the hearsay rule. The court also held that the statements were reliable because Mark knew that he was implicating himself as a participantin numerous crimes and because the statements were independentlycorroborated by other evidence at trial.Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.255 Va. 558, 499 S. E. 2d 522, reversed and remanded.Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect toParts I, II, and VI, concluding:1. This Court has jurisdiction over petitioner's Confrontation Clauseclaim. He expressly argued the claim in his opening brief to the Virginia Supreme Court; and his arguments based on Williamson v. UnitedStates, 512 U. S. 594, and the Confrontation Clause opinion of Lee v.Illinois, 476 U. S. 530, in responding to the Commonwealth's position,sufficed to raise the issue in that court. P. 123.2. The admission of Mark's untested confession violated petitioner'sConfrontation Clause rights. Adhering to this Court's general customof allowing state courts initially to assess the effect of erroneously admitted evidence in light of substantive state criminal law, the Virginiacourts are to consider in the first instance whether this Sixth Amend527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Syllabusment violation was "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." Chapmanv. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24. Pp. 139-140.Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg,and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts III, IV, and V that Mark'shearsay statements do not meet the requirements for admission setforth in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66. Pp. 123-139.(a) The Confrontation Clause ensures the reliability of evidenceagainst a defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in an adversary proceeding, Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845, as by crossexamination of a declarant, see California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 158.Hearsay statements are sufficiently dependable to allow their untestedadmission against an accused only when (1) the statements fall "withina firmly rooted hearsay exception" or (2) they contain "particularizedguarantees of trustworthiness" such that adversarial testing would beexpected to add little, if anything, to their reliability. Roberts, 448U. S., at 66. Pp. 123-125.(b) Statements are admissible under a "firmly rooted" hearsay exception when they fall within a hearsay category whose conditions haveproved over time "to remove all temptation to falsehood, and to enforceas strict an adherence to the truth as would the obligation of an oath"and cross-examination at a trial. Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S.237, 244. The simple categorization of a statement as "against penalinterest" defines too large a class for meaningful Confrontation Clausereview. Such statements are offered into evidence (1) as voluntary admissions against the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered by adefendant who claims that the declarant committed, or was involved in,the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by the prosecution to establishthe guilt of an alleged accomplice of the declarant. The third category,which includes statements such as Mark's, encompasses statements thatare presumptively unreliable, Lee, 476 U. S., at 541, even when the accomplice incriminates himself together with the defendant. Accomplicestatements that shift or spread blame to a criminal defendant, therefore,fall outside the realm of those "hearsay exception[s] [that are] so trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to [thestatements'] reliability." White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 357. Suchstatements are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsayrule. Pp. 125-134.(c) The Commonwealth contends that this Court should defer to theVirginia Supreme Court's additional determination that Mark's statements were reliable and that the indicia of reliability the court found,coupled with the actions of police during Mark's interrogation, demonstrate that the circumstances surrounding his statements bore "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness," Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66, suffi527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN118 LILLY v. VIRGINIASyllabuscient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause's residual admissibility test.Nothing in this Court's prior opinions, however, suggests that appellatecourts should defer to lower court determinations regarding mixedquestions of constitutional law such as whether a hearsay statement hassufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. See Ornelas v. United States,517 U. S. 690, 697. Thus, courts should independently review whetherthe government's proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy theClause. Here, the Commonwealth's asserted trustworthiness guarantees are unconvincing. Mark was in custody for his involvement in, andknowledge of, serious crimes. He made his statements under governmental authorities' supervision, and was primarily responding to theofficers' leading questions. He also had a natural motive to attemptto exculpate himself and was under the influence of alcohol during theinterrogation. Each of these factors militates against finding that hisstatements were so inherently reliable that cross-examination wouldhave been superfluous. Pp. 135-139.Justice Scalia concluded that introducing Mark Lilly's taperecorded statements to police at trial without making him available forcross-examination is a paradigmatic Confrontation Clause violation.Since the violation is clear, the case need be remanded only for aharmless-error determination. P. 143.Justice Thomas, while adhering to his view that the ConfrontationClause extends to any witness who actually testifies at trial and is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained informalized testimonial material, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions, White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 365, agrees withThe Chief Justice that the Clause does not impose a blanket ban onthe use of accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant and that,since the lower courts did not analyze the confession under the secondprong of the Roberts inquiry, the plurality should not address that issuehere. Pp. 143-144.The Chief Justice, joined by Justice O'Connor and JusticeKennedy, concluded:1. Mark Lilly's confession incriminating petitioner does not satisfy afirmly rooted hearsay exception because the statements in his 50-pageconfession which are against his penal interest are quite separate fromthe statements exculpating him and inculpating petitioner, which arenot in the least against his penal interest. This case, therefore, doesnot raise the question whether the Confrontation Clause permits theadmission of a genuinely self-inculpatory statement that also inculpatesa codefendant. Not only were the confession's incriminating portionsnot a declaration against penal interest, but these statements were partof a custodial confession of the sort that this Court has viewed with527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN119Cite as: 527 U.

VIRGINIAOpinion of the CourtJustice Stevens announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to PartsI, II, and VI, and an opinion with respect to Parts III, IV,and V, in whichJustice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, andJustice Breyer join.The question presented in this case is whether the ac-cused's Sixth Amendment right "to be confronted with thewitnesses against him" was violated by admitting into evi-dence at his trial a nontestifying accomplice's entire confession that contained some statements against the accomplice'spenal interest and others that inculpated the accused.IOn December 4, 1995, three men--Benjamin Lee Lilly(petitioner), his brother Mark, and Mark's roommate, GaryWayne Barker--broke into a home and stole nine bottles ofliquor, three loaded guns, and a safe. The next day, the mendrank the stolen liquor, robbed a small country store, andshot at geese with their stolen weapons. After their carbroke down, they abducted Alex DeFilippis and used his vehicle to drive to a deserted location. One of them shot andkilled DeFilippis. The three men then committed two morerobberies before they were apprehended by the police latein the evening of December 5.After taking them into custody, the police questioned eachof the three men separately. Petitioner did not mention themurder to the police and stated that the other two men hadforced him to participate in the robberies. Petitioner'sbrother Mark and Barker told the police somewhat differentaccounts of the crimes, but both maintained that petitionerHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Betty D.

Summersof Tennessee; and for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation by Kent S.Scheidegger and Charles L. Hobson.527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN121Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of the Courtmasterminded the robberies and was the one who hadkilled DeFilippis.A tape recording of Mark's initial oral statement indicatesthat he was questioned from 1:35 a.m. until 2:12 a.m. on December 6. The police interrogated him again from 2:30 a.m.until 2:53 a.m. During both interviews, Mark continuallyemphasized how drunk he had been during the entire spree.When asked about his participation in the string of crimes,Mark admitted that he stole liquor during the initial burglaryand that he stole a 12-pack of beer during the robbery of theliquor store. Mark also conceded that he had handled a gunearlier that day and that he was present during the moreserious thefts and the homicide.The police told Mark that he would be charged with armedrobbery and that, unless he broke "family ties," petitioner"may be dragging you right in to a life sentence," App. 257.Mark acknowledged that he would be sent away to the penitentiary. He claimed, however, that while he had primarilybeen drinking, petitioner and Barker had "got some guns orsomething" during the initial burglary. Id., at 250. Marksaid that Barker had pulled a gun in one of the robberies.He further insisted that petitioner had instigated the carjacking and that he (Mark) "didn't have nothing to do withthe shooting" of DeFilippis. Id., at 256. In a brief portionof one of his statements, Mark stated that petitioner was theone who shot DeFilippis.The Commonwealth of Virginia charged petitioner withseveral offenses, including the murder of DeFilippis, andtried him separately. At trial, the Commonwealth calledMark as a witness, but he invoked his Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination. The Commonwealththerefore offered to introduce into evidence the statementsMark made to the police after his arrest, arguing that theywere admissible as declarations of an unavailable witnessagainst penal interest. Petitioner objected on the groundthat the statements were not actually against Mark's penal527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN122 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtinterest because they shifted responsibility for the crimesto Barker and to petitioner, and that their admission wouldviolate the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Thetrial judge overruled the objection and admitted the taperecordings and written transcripts of the statements in theirentirety. The jury found petitioner guilty of robbery, abduction, carjacking, possession of a firearm by a felon, and fourcharges of illegal use of a firearm, for which offenses hereceived consecutive prison sentences of two life terms plus27 years. The jury also convicted petitioner of capital murder and recommended a sentence of death, which the courtimposed.The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed petitioner's convictions and sentences. As is relevant here, the court firstconcluded that Mark's statements were declarations of an unavailable witness against penal interest; that the statements'reliability was established by other evidence; and, therefore,that they fell within an exception to the Virginia hearsayrule. The court then turned to petitioner's ConfrontationClause challenge. It began by relying on our opinion inWhite v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), for the propositionthat " `[w]here proffered hearsay has sufficient guarantees ofreliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to thehearsay rule, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.' " 255Va. 558, 574, 499 S. E. 2d 522, 534 (1998) (quoting White, 502U. S., at 356). The Virginia court also remarked:"[A]dmissiblity into evidence of the statement againstpenal interest of an unavailable witness is a `firmlyrooted' exception to the hearsay rule in Virginia. Thus,we hold that the trial court did not err in admittingMark Lilly's statements into evidence." 255 Va., at 575,499 S. E. 2d, at 534."That Mark Lilly's statements were self-serving, in thatthey tended to shift principal responsibility to others orto offer claims of mitigating circumstances, goes to the527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.weight the jury could assign to them and not to theiradmissibility." Id., at 574, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534.Our concern that this decision represented a significantdeparture from our Confrontation Clause jurisprudenceprompted us to grant certiorari. 525 U. S. 981 (1998).IIAs an initial matter, the Commonwealth asserts that weshould decline to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner's claimbecause he did not fairly present his Confrontation Clausechallenge to the Supreme Court of Virginia. We disagree.Although petitioner focused on state hearsay law in his chal-lenge to the admission of Mark's statements, petitioner expressly argued in his opening brief to that court that theadmission of the statements violated his Sixth Amendmentright to confrontation. He expanded his Sixth Amendmentargument in his reply brief and cited Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S.530 (1986), and Williamson v. United States, 512 U. S. 594(1994), in response to the Commonwealth's contention thatthe admission of the statements was constitutional. Thesearguments, particularly the reliance on our ConfrontationClause opinion in Lee, sufficed to raise in the Supreme Courtof Virginia the constitutionality of admitting Mark's statements. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 406, n. 9 (1988).Indeed, the court addressed petitioner's ConfrontationClause claim without mentioning any waiver problems.IIIIn all criminal prosecutions, state as well as federal, theaccused has a right, guaranteed by the Sixth and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution, "to beconfronted with the witnesses against him." U. S. Const.,Amdt. 6; Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965) (applyingSixth Amendment to the States). "The central concern ofthe Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of theevidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rig527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN124 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.orous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding be-fore the trier of fact." Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845(1990). When the government seeks to offer a declarant'sout-of-court statements against the accused, and, as in thiscase, the declarant is unavailable,1 courts must decidewhether the Clause permits the government to deny the accused his usual right to force the declarant "to submit tocross-examination, the `greatest legal engine ever inventedfor the discovery of truth.' " California v. Green, 399 U. S.149, 158 (1970) (footnote and citation omitted).In our most recent case interpreting the ConfrontationClause, White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346 (1992), we rejectedthe suggestion that the Clause should be narrowly construedto apply only to practices comparable to "a particular abusecommon in 16th- and 17th-century England: prosecuting adefendant through the presentation ofex parte affidavits,without the affiants ever being produced at trial." Id.,at 352. This abuse included using out-of-court depositionsand " `confessions of accomplices.' " Green, 399 U. S., at 157.Accord,White, 502 U. S., at 361, 363 (Thomas, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment) (noting that this ruleapplies even if the confession is "found to be reliable"). Because that restrictive reading of the Clause's term "witnesses" would have virtually eliminated the Clause's role inrestricting the admission of hearsay testimony, we considered it foreclosed by our prior cases. Instead, we adheredto our general framework, summarized inOhio v. Roberts,448 U. S. 56 (1980), that the veracity of hearsay statementsis sufficiently dependable to allow the untested admission ofsuch statements against an accused when (1) "the evidence1 Petitioner suggests in his merits brief that Mark was not truly "unavailable" because the Commonwealth could have tried and sentenced himbefore petitioner's trial, thereby extinguishing Mark's Fifth Amendmentprivilege. We assume, however, as petitioner did in framing his petitionfor certiorari, that to the extent it is relevant, Mark was an unavailablewitness for Confrontation Clause purposes.527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN125Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception" or (2) it con-tains "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness" suchthat adversarial testing would be expected to add little, ifanything, to the statements' reliability. Id., at 66.Before turning to the dual Roberts inquiries, however, wenote that the statements taken from petitioner's brother inthe early morning of December 6 were obviously obtainedfor the purpose of creating evidence that would be useful ata future trial. The analogy to the presentation of ex parteaffidavits in the early English proceedings thus brings theConfrontation Clause into play no matter how narrowly itsgateway might be read.IVThe Supreme Court of Virginia held that the admission ofMark Lilly's confession was constitutional primarily because,in its view, it was against Mark's penal interest and because"the statement against penal interest of an unavailablewitness is a `firmly rooted' exception to the hearsay rule inVirginia." 255 Va., at 575, 449 S. E. 2d, at 534. We assume,as we must, that Mark's statements were against his penalinterest as a matter of state law, but the question whetherthe statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exceptionfor Confrontation Clause purposes is a question of federallaw. Accordingly, it is appropriate to begin our analysis byexamining the "firmly rooted" doctrine and the roots of the"against penal interest" exception.We have allowed the admission of statements fallingwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception since the Court'srecognition in Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237 (1895),that the Framers of the Sixth Amendment "obviously in-tended to . . . respec[t]" certain unquestionable rules of evidence in drafting the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 243.Justice Brown, writing for the Court in that case, did notquestion the wisdom of excluding deposition testimony, exparte affidavits and their equivalents. But he reasoned thatan unduly strict and "technical" reading of the Clause would527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN126 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.have the effect of excluding other hearsay evidence, such asdying declarations, whose admissibility neither the Framersnor anyone else 100 years later "would have [had] thehardihood . . . to question."Ibid.We now describe a hearsay exception as "firmly rooted" if,in light of "longstanding judicial and legislative experience,"Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 817 (1990), it "rest[s] [on] such[a] solid foundatio[n] that admission of virtually any evidencewithin [it] comports with the `substance of the constitutionalprotection.' " Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66 (quoting Mattox, 156U. S., at 244). This standard is designed to allow the introduction of statements falling within a category of hearsaywhose conditions have proved over time "to remove alltemptation to falsehood, and to enforce as strict an adherence to the truth as would the obligation of an oath" andcross-examination at a trial. Ibid. In White, for instance,we held that the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations is firmly rooted because it "is at least two centuriesold," currently "widely accepted among the States," and carries "substantial guarantees of . . . trustworthiness . . . [that]cannot be recaptured even by later in-court testimony." 502U. S., at 355-356, and n. 8. Established practice, in short,must confirm that statements falling within a category ofhearsay inherently "carr[y] special guarantees of credibility"essentially equivalent to, or greater than, those produced bythe Constitution's preference for cross-examined trial testimony. Id., at 356.The "against penal interest" exception to the hearsayrule--unlike other previously recognized firmly rooted exceptions--is not generally based on the maxim that statements made without a motive to reflect on the legal consequences of one's statement, and in situations that areexceptionally conducive to veracity, lack the dangers of inaccuracy that typically accompany hearsay. The exception,rather, is founded on the broad assumption "that a person isunlikely to fabricate a statement against his own interest at527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.the time it is made." Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S.284, 299 (1973).We have previously noted that, due to the sweeping scopeof the label, the simple categorization of a statement as a" `declaration against penal interest' . . . defines too large aclass for meaningful Confrontation Clause analysis." Lee v.Illinois, 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5. In criminal trials, statements against penal interest are offered into evidence inthree principal situations: (1) as voluntary admissionsagainst the declarant; (2) as exculpatory evidence offered bya defendant who claims that the declarant committed, or wasinvolved in, the offense; and (3) as evidence offered by theprosecution to establish the guilt of an alleged accomplice ofthe declarant. It is useful to consider the three categoriesand their roots separately.Statements in the first category--voluntary admissions ofthe declarant--are routinely offered into evidence againstthe maker of the statement and carry a distinguished heritage confirming their admissibility when so used. SeeG. Gilbert, Evidence 139-140 (1756); Lambe's Case, 2 Leach552, 168 Eng. Rep. 379 (1791); State v. Kirby, 1 Strob. 155,156 (1846); State v. Cowan, 29 N. C. 239, 246 (1847). Thus,assuming that Mark Lilly's statements were taken in conformance with constitutional prerequisites, they would unquestionably be admissible against him if he were on trialfor stealing alcoholic beverages.If Mark were a codefendant in a joint trial, however, eventhe use of his confession to prove his guilt might have anadverse impact on the rights of his accomplices. When dealing with admissions against penal interest, we have takengreat care to separate using admissions against the declarant(the first category above) from using them against othercriminal defendants (the third category).In Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), two codefendants, Evans and Bruton, were tried jointly and convicted of armed postal robbery. A postal inspector testified527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.that Evans had orally confessed that he and Bruton had com-mitted the crime. The jury was instructed that Evans' confession was admissible against him, but could not be consid-ered in assessing Bruton's guilt. Despite that instruction,this Court concluded that the introduction of Evans' confession posed such a serious threat to Bruton's right to confrontand cross-examine the witnesses against him that he wasentitled to a new trial. The case is relevant to the issuebefore us today, not because of its principal holding concerning the ability or inability of the jury to follow the judge'sinstruction, but rather because it was common ground amongall of the Justices that the fact that the confession was astatement against the penal interest of Evans did not justifyits use against Bruton. As Justice White noted at the outset of his dissent, "nothing in that confession which was relevant and material to Bruton's case was admissible againstBruton." Id., at 138.In the years since Bruton was decided, we have revieweda number of cases in which one defendant's confession hasbeen introduced into evidence in a joint trial pursuant toinstructions that it could be used against him but not againsthis codefendant. Despite frequent disagreement over matters such as the adequacy of the trial judge's instructions, orthe sufficiency of the redaction of ambiguous references tothe declarant's accomplice, we have consistently either statedor assumed that the mere fact that one accomplice's confession qualified as a statement against his penal interest didnot justify its use as evidence against another person. SeeGray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185, 194-195 (1998) (stating thatbecause the use of an accomplice's confession "creates a special, and vital, need for cross-examination," a prosecutor desiring to offer such evidence must comply with Bruton, holdseparate trials, use separate juries, or abandon the use of theconfession); 523 U. S., at 200 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (statingthat codefendant's confessions "may not be considered for thepurpose of determining [the defendant's] guilt"); Richardson527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987) ("[W]here two defendantsare tried jointly, the pretrial confession of one cannot be admitted against the other unless the confessing defendanttakes the stand"); Cruz v. New York, 481 U. S. 186, 189-190,193 (1987) (same).The second category of statements against penal interestencompasses those offered as exculpatory evidence by a de-fendant who claims that it was the maker of the statement,rather than he, who committed (or was involved in) the crimein question. In this context, our Court, over the dissent ofJustice Holmes, originally followed the 19th-century Englishrule that categorically refused to recognize any "againstpenal interest" exception to the hearsay rule, holding insteadthat under federal law only hearsay statements against pecuniary (and perhaps proprietary) interest were sufficiently re-liable to warrant their admission at the trial of someoneother than the declarant. See Donnelly v. United States,228 U. S. 243, 272-277 (1913). Indeed, most States adheredto this approach well into the latter half of the 20th century.SeeChambers, 410 U. S., at 299 (collecting citations).As time passed, however, the precise Donnelly rule, whichbarred the admission of other persons' confessions that ex-culpated the accused, became the subject of increasing criticism. Professor Wigmore, for example, remarked yearsafter Donnelly:"The only practical consequences of this unreasoninglimitation are shocking to the sense of justice; for, in itscommonest application, it requires, in a criminal trial,the rejection of a confession, however well authenticated, of a person deceased or insane or fled from thejurisdiction (and therefore quite unavailable) who hasavowed himself to be the true culprit. . . . It is thereforenot too late to retrace our steps, and to discard this barbarous doctrine, which would refuse to let an innocentaccused vindicate himself even by producing to the tribunal a perfectly authenticated written confession, made527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.on the very gallows, by the true culprit now beyondthe reach of justice." 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1477,pp. 289-290 (3d ed. 1940).See also Scolari v. United States, 406 F. 2d 563, 564 (CA91969) (criticizingDonnelly); United States v. Annunziato,293 F. 2d 373, 378 (CA2 1961) (Friendly, J.) (same); Hinesv. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 728, 117 S. E. 843 (1923) (criticiz-ing Donnelly and refusing to incorporate it into state law);Wright, Uniform Rules and Hearsay, 26 U. Cin. L. Rev. 575(1957).Finally, in 1973, this Court endorsed the more enlightenedview inChambers, holding that the Due Process Clauseaffords criminal defendants the right to introduce intoevidence third parties' declarations against penal interest--their confessions--when the circumstances surrounding thestatements "provid[e] considerable assurance of their relia-bility." 410 U. S., at 300. Not surprisingly, most Stateshave now amended their hearsay rules to allow the admis-sion of such statements under against-penal-interest exceptions. See 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1476, p. 352, and n. 9(J. Chadbourn rev. 1974);id., $ 1477, at 360, and n. 7;J. Wigmore, Evidence $$ 1476 and 1477, pp. 618-626 (A. Bested. Supp. 1998). But because hearsay statements of thissort are, by definition, offered by the accused, the admissionof such statements does not implicate Confrontation Clauseconcerns. Thus, there is no need to decide whether the reliability of such statements is so inherently dependable thatthey would constitute a firmly rooted hearsay exception.The third category includes cases, like the one before ustoday, in which the government seeks to introduce "a confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defend-ant." Lee, 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5. The practice of admittingstatements in this category under an exception to the hear-say rule--to the extent that such a practice exists in certainjurisdictions--is, unlike the first category or even the sec-ond, of quite recent vintage. This category also typically527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.includes statements that, when offered in the absence ofthe declarant, function similarly to those used in the ancientex parte affidavit system.Most important, this third category of hearsay encompasses statements that are inherently unreliable. Typical ofthe ground swell of scholarly and judicial criticism that culminated in the Chambers decision, Wigmore's treatise stillexpressly distinguishes accomplices' confessions that inculpate themselves and the accused as beyond a proper understanding of the against-penal-interest exception becausean accomplice often has a considerable interest in "confessing and betraying his cocriminals." 5 Wigmore, Evidence$ 1477, at 358, n. 1 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974). Consistent withthis scholarship and the assumption that underlies the analysis in our Bruton line of cases, we have over the years "spoken with one voice in declaring presumptively unreliable accomplices' confessions that incriminate defendants." Lee,476 U. S., at 541. See also Cruz, 481 U. S., at 195 (White, J.,dissenting) (such statements "have traditionally been viewedwith special suspicion"); Bruton, 391 U. S., at 136 (such statements are "inevitably suspect").In Crawford v. United States, 212 U. S. 183 (1909), thisCourt stated that even when an alleged accomplice testifies,his confession that "incriminate[s] himself together withdefendant . . . ought to be received with suspicion, and withthe very greatest care and caution, and ought not to bepassed upon by the jury under the same rules governingother and apparently credible witnesses." Id., at 204.Over 30 years ago, we applied this principle to the SixthAmendment. We held in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S.415 (1965), that the admission of a nontestifying accomplice'sconfession, which shifted responsibility and implicated thedefendant as the triggerman, "plainly denied [the defendant]the right of cross-examination secured by the ConfrontationClause." Id., at 419.527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.In Lee, we reaffirmed Douglas and explained that its hold-ing "was premised on the basic understanding that when oneperson accuses another of a crime under circumstances inwhich the declarant stands to gain by inculpating another,the accusation is presumptively suspect and must be sub-jected to the scrutiny of cross-examination." 476 U. S., at541. This is so because"th[e] truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clauseis uniquely threatened when an accomplice's confessionis sought to be introduced against a criminal defendantwithout the benefit of cross-examination. . . . `Due tohis strong motivation to implicate the defendant and toexonerate himself, a codefendant's statements aboutwhat the defendant said or did are less credible thanordinary hearsay evidence.' "Ibid. (quoting Bruton,391 U. S., at 141 (White, J., dissenting)).Indeed, even the dissenting Justices in Lee agreed that "ac-complice confessions ordinarily are untrustworthy preciselybecause they are not unambiguously adverse to the penalinterest of the declarant," but instead are likely to be attempts to minimize the declarant's culpability. 476 U. S., at552-553 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).2We have adhered to this approach in construing the Fed-eral Rules of Evidence. Thus, inWilliamson v. United2 The only arguable exception to this unbroken line of cases arose in ourplurality opinion in Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74 (1970), in which we heldthat the admission of an accomplice's spontaneous comment that indirectlyinculpated the defendant did not violate the Confrontation Clause. WhileJustice Stewart's plurality opinion observed that the declarant's statementwas "against his penal interest," id., at 89, the Court's judgment did notrest on that point, and in no way purported to hold that statements withsuch an attribute were presumptively admissible. Rather, the five Justices in the majority emphasized the unique aspects of the case and emphasized that the co-conspirator spontaneously made the statement and "hadno apparent reason to lie." Id., at 86-89. See also id., at 98 (Harlan, J.,concurring in result).527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.States, 512 U. S. 594 (1994), without reaching the Confronta-tion Clause issue, we held that an accomplice's statementagainst his own penal interest was not admissible against thedefendant.3 We once again noted the presumptive unreliability of the "non-self-inculpatory" portions of the statement:"One of the most effective ways to lie is to mix falsehoodwith truth, especially truth that seems particularly persua-sive because of its self-inculpatory nature."Id., at 599-601.It is clear that our cases consistently have viewed an accomplice's statements that shift or spread the blame to acriminal defendant as falling outside the realm of those"hearsay exception[s] [that are] so trustworthy that adver-sarial testing can be expected to add little to [the statements'] reliability." White, 502 U. S., at 357. This view isalso reflected in several States' hearsay law.4 Indeed, prior3 Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for the admission of "[a] statement which was at the time of itsmaking so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability . . .that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have madethe statement unless believing it to be true."4 Several States provide statutorily that their against-penal-interesthearsay exceptions do not allow the admission of "[a] statement or confession offered against the accused in a criminal case, made by a codefendantor other person implicating both himself and the accused."

VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.to 1995, it appears that even Virginia rarely allowed state-ments against the penal interest of the declarant to be usedat criminal trials. See, e. g., Ellison v. Commonwealth, 219Va. 404, 247 S. E. 2d 685 (1978). That Virginia relaxed thatportion of its hearsay law when it decided Chandler v. Commonwealth, 249 Va. 270, 455 S. E. 2d 219 (1995), and that itlater apparently concluded that all statements against penalinterest fall within "a `firmly rooted' exception to the hearsayrule in Virginia," 255 Va., at 575, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534, is ofno consequence. The decisive fact, which we make explicittoday, is that accomplices' confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to thehearsay rule as that concept has been defined in our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.5918 S. W. 2d 511, 515 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); In re Anthony Ray, Mc., 200W. Va. 312, 321, 489 S. E. 2d 289, 298 (1997). Still other States havevirtually no against-penal-interest exception at all. See Ala. Rule Evid.804(b)(3) (1998) (no such exception); Ga. Code Ann. $ 24-3-8 (1995) (exception only if declarant is deceased and statement was not made with viewtoward litigation); State v. Skillicorn, 944 S. W. 2d 877, 884-885 (Mo.) (noexception), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 999 (1997).5 Our holdings in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), Cruz v.New York, 481 U. S. 186 (1987), Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185 (1998),and Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530 (1986), were all premised, explicitly orimplicitly, on the principle that accomplice confessions that inculpate acriminal defendant are not per se admissible (and thus necessarily falloutside a firmly rooted hearsay exception), no matter how much thosestatements also incriminate the accomplice. If "genuinely" or "equally"inculpatory confessions of accomplices were--as The Chief Justice'sconcurrence suggests is possible, post, at 146--per se admissible againstcriminal defendants, then the confessions in each of those cases wouldhave been admissible, for each confession inculpated the accompliceequally in the crimes at issue. But the Court in Lee rejected the dissent'sposition that a nontestifying accomplice's confessions that are "unambiguously" against the accomplice's penal interest are per se admissible, see476 U. S., at 552 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) and we ruled in Bruton, Cruz,and Gray that such equally self-inculpatory statements are inadmissibleagainst criminal defendants. Today we merely reaffirm these holdings527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.VAside from its conclusion that Mark's statements were ad-missible under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, the Supreme Court of Virginia also affirmed the trial court's hold-ing that the statements were "reliabl[e] . . . in the context ofthe facts and circumstances under which [they were] given"because (i) "Mark Lilly was cognizant of the import of hisstatements and that he was implicating himself as a partici-pant in numerous crimes" and (ii) "[e]lements of [his] statements were independently corroborated" by other evidenceoffered at trial. Id., at 574, 499 S. E. 2d, at 534. See alsoApp. 18 (trial court's decision). The Commonwealth con-tends that we should defer to this "fact-intensive" determination. It further argues that these two indicia of reli-ability, coupled with the facts that the police read Markhis Miranda rights and did not promise him leniency inexchange for his statements, demonstrate that the circumstances surrounding his statements bore "particularizedguarantees of trustworthiness,"Roberts, 448 U. S., at 66,sufficient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause's residual admissibility test.6and make explicit what was heretofore implicit: A statement (like Mark's)that falls into the category summarized in Lee--"a confession by an accomplice which incriminates a criminal defendant," 476 U. S., at 544, n. 5--does not come within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.This, of course, does not mean, as The Chief Justice, post, at 147-148(opinion concurring in judgment), and Justice Thomas, post, at 143 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), erroneously suggest,that the Confrontation Clause imposes a "blanket ban on the government'suse of [nontestifying] accomplice statements that incriminate a defendant." Rather, it simply means that the government must satisfy the second prong of the Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), test in order tointroduce such statements. See Part V, infra.6 Although The Chief Justice contends that we should remand thisissue to the Supreme Court of Virginia, see post, at 148-149, it would beinappropriate to do so because we granted certiorari on this issue, see Pet.for Cert. i, and the parties have fully briefed and argued the issue. The527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.The residual "trustworthiness" test credits the axiom thata rigid application of the Clause's standard for admissibilitymight in an exceptional case exclude a statement of an unavailable witness that is incontestably probative, competent,and reliable, yet nonetheless outside of any firmly rootedhearsay exception. Cf. id., at 63; Mattox, 156 U. S., at 243-244. When a court can be confident--as in the context ofhearsay falling within a firmly rooted exception--that "thedeclarant's truthfulness is so clear from the surrounding circumstances that the test of cross-examination would be ofmarginal utility," the Sixth Amendment's residual "trustworthiness" test allows the admission of the declarant'sstatements. Wright, 497 U. S., at 820.Nothing in our prior opinions, however, suggests thatappellate courts should defer to lower courts' determinationsregarding whether a hearsay statement has particularizedguarantees of trustworthiness. To the contrary, thoseopinions indicate that we have assumed, as with otherfact-intensive, mixed questions of constitutional law, that"[i]ndependent review is . . . necessary . . . to maintain control of, and to clarify, the legal principles" governing the factual circumstances necessary to satisfy the protections of theBill of Rights. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 697(1996) (holding that appellate courts should review reasonable suspicion and probable-cause determinations de novo).We, of course, accept the Virginia courts' determination thatMark's statements were reliable for purposes of state hearsay law, and, as should any appellate court, we review the"facts and circumstances" formula, recited above, that the Virginia courtsalready employed in reaching their reliability holdings is virtually identical to the Roberts "particularized guarantees" test, which turns as well onthe "surrounding circumstances" of the statements. Idaho v. Wright, 497U. S. 805, 820 (1990). Furthermore, as will become clear, the Commonwealth fails to point to any fact regarding this issue that the SupremeCourt of Virginia did not explicitly consider and that requires seriousanalysis.527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN137Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of Stevens, J.presence or absence of historical facts for clear error. Butthe surrounding circumstances relevant to a Sixth Amendment admissibility determination do not include the declar-ant's in-court demeanor (otherwise the declarant wouldbe testifying) or any other factor uniquely suited to theprovince of trial courts. For these reasons, when decidingwhether the admission of a declarant's out-of-court statements violates the Confrontation Clause, courts should inde-pendently review whether the government's proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the Clause.The Commonwealth correctly notes that "the presumptionof unreliability that attaches to codefendants' confessions. . . may be rebutted." Lee, 476 U. S., at 543. We haveheld, in fact, that any inherent unreliability that accompaniesco-conspirator statements made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is per se rebutted by the circumstances giving rise to the long history of admitting suchstatements. See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171,182-184 (1987). Nonetheless, the historical underpinningsof the Confrontation Clause and the sweep of our priorconfrontation cases offer one cogent reminder: It is highlyunlikely that the presumptive unreliability that attaches toaccomplices' confessions that shift or spread blame can beeffectively rebutted when the statements are given underconditions that implicate the core concerns of the old ex parteaffidavit practice--that is, when the government is involvedin the statements' production, and when the statements describe past events and have not been subjected to adversarial testing.Applying these principles, the Commonwealth's assertedguarantees of trustworthiness fail to convince us that Mark'sconfession was sufficiently reliable as to be admissible without allowing petitioner to cross-examine him. That otherevidence at trial corroborated portions of Mark's statementsis irrelevant. We have squarely rejected the notion that"evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN138 LILLY v. VIRGINIAOpinion of Stevens, J.may properly support a finding that the statement bears`particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.' "Wright,497 U. S., at 822. In Wright, we concluded that the admis-sion of hearsay statements by a child declarant violated theConfrontation Clause even though the statements were admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule recognizedin Idaho, and even though they were corroborated by otherevidence. We recognized that it was theoretically possiblefor such statements to possess " `particularized guaranteesof trustworthiness' " that would justify their admissibility,but we refused to allow the State to "bootstrap on" the trustworthiness of other evidence. "To be admissible under theConfrontation Clause," we held, "hearsay evidence used toconvict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to otherevidence at trial." Ibid.Nor did the police's informing Mark of his Miranda rightsrender the circumstances surrounding his statements significantly more trustworthy. We noted in rejecting a similar argument in Lee that a finding that a confession was "voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes . . . does not bear onthe question of whether the confession was also free fromany desire, motive, or impulse [the declarant] may have hadeither to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability byspreading the blame or to overstate [the defendant's] involvement" in the crimes at issue. 476 U. S., at 544. By thesame token, we believe that a suspect's consciousness of hisMiranda rights has little, if any, bearing on the likelihood oftruthfulness of his statements. When a suspect is in custody for his obvious involvement in serious crimes, hisknowledge that anything he says may be used against himmilitates against depending on his veracity.The Commonwealth's next proffered basis for reliability--that Mark knew he was exposing himself to criminal liability--merely restates the fact that portions of his statementswere technically against penal interest. And as we have ex527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 527 U. S. 116 (1999)Opinion of the Courtplained, such statements are suspect insofar as they incul-pate other persons. "[T]hat a person is making a broadlyself-inculpatory confession does not make more credible theconfession's non-self-inculpatory parts." Williamson, 512U. S., at 599. Accord, Lee, 476 U. S., at 545. Similarly, theabsence of an express promise of leniency to Mark does notenhance his statements' reliability to the level necessary fortheir untested admission. The police need not tell a personwho is in custody that his statements may gain him leniencyin order for the suspect to surmise that speaking up, andparticularly placing blame on his cohorts, may inure to hisadvantage.It is abundantly clear that neither the words that Markspoke nor the setting in which he was questioned providesany basis for concluding that his comments regarding peti-tioner's guilt were so reliable that there was no need to subject them to adversarial testing in a trial setting. Mark wasin custody for his involvement in, and knowledge of, seriouscrimes and made his statements under the supervision ofgovernmental authorities. He was primarily respondingto the officers' leading questions, which were asked withoutany contemporaneous cross-examination by adverse parties.Thus, Mark had a natural motive to attempt to exculpatehimself as much as possible. Seeid., at 544-545; Dutton v.Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 98 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Mark also was obviously still under the influence ofalcohol. Each of these factors militates against finding thathis statements were so inherently reliable that cross-examination would have been superfluous.VIThe admission of the untested confession of Mark Lilly vio-lated petitioner's Confrontation Clause rights. Adhering toour general custom of allowing state courts initially to assessthe effect of erroneously admitted evidence in light of substantive state criminal law, we leave it to the Virginia courts527US1 Unit: $U71 [05-07-01 15:50:28] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 LILLY v.
