Whenthe Court of Appeals heard arguments in Guam, the ChiefJudge of the Ninth Circuit invited the Chief Judge of theDistrict Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to partici-pate. A judge of the District Court of Guam was similarlyinvited to participate in appeals heard while the Ninth Cir-cuit sat in the Northern Mariana Islands.The panel affirmed petitioners' convictions without dissent. 284 F. 3d 1086 (2002). Neither Nguyen nor Phan ob-jected to the composition of the panel before the cases weresubmitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearingafter the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challengethe panel's authority to decide their appeals. Each did,however, file a petition for certiorari raising the questionwhether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalidbecause of the participation of a non-Article III judge onthe panel. In accordance with this Court's Rule 10(a), wegranted the writ, 537 U. S. 999 (2002), to determine whether5 "The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands shall have thejurisdiction of a District Court of the United States, including, but notlimited to, the diversity jurisdiction provided for in section 1332 of title 28and that of a bankruptcy court of the United States."The district court shall have original jurisdiction in all causes in theNorthern Mariana Islands not described in subsection (a) of this sectionjurisdiction over which is not vested by the Constitution or laws of theNorthern Mariana Islands in a court or courts of the Northern MarianaIslands." 48 U.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe Court of Appeals had "so far departed from the acceptedand usual course of judicial proceedings as to call for an exercise of this Court's supervisory powers." Pet. for Cert. inNo. 01-10873, p. 6; Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-5034, p. 5. Forthe following reasons, we find these to be appropriate casesfor the exercise of that power.IIWe begin with the congressional grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of districtjudges to serve on the courts of appeals. In relevant part,the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuitto assign "one or more district judges within the circuit" tosit on the court of appeals "whenever the business of thatcourt so requires." 28 U. S. C. $ 292(a). Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the "district judges" who maybe assigned to the court of appeals. However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the DistrictCourt for the Northern Mariana Islands are not "districtjudges" within the meaning of $ 292(a).Outside of $ 292(a), Title 28 contains several particularlyinstructive provisions. The term "district court" as usedthroughout Title 28 is defined to mean a " `court of the UnitedStates' " that is "constituted by chapter 5 of this title."$ 451. Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a "United StatesDistrict Court" for each judicial district. $ 132(a) ("Thereshall be in each judicial district a district court which shallbe a court of record known as the United States DistrictCourt for the district"). And "district judge[s]" are established as the members of those courts. $ 132(b) ("Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges forthe district in regular active service"). The judicial districtsconstituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.$ 133(a) ("The President shall appoint, by and with the adviceand consent of the Senate, district judges for the several ju539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN75Cite as: 539 U. S. 69 (2003)Opinion of the Courtdicial districts, as follows [listing districts]"). Lastly, Chapter 5 describes "district judges" as holding office "duringgood behavior." $ 134(a).Taking these provisions together, $ 292(a) cannot be readto permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judgeof the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.Significantly, the District Court for the Northern MarianaIslands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 ofTitle 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5.7See $ 133(a). Because the judges of the District Court forthe Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term ofyears and may be removed by the President for cause, theyalso do not satisfy the command for district judges withinthe meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior.$ 134(a).The Government agrees these statutory provisions arebest read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of theNorthern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the NinthCircuit. The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term "district judge" separately from the term"district court." This contention requires an excessivelystrained interpretation of the statute. To be sure, a literalreading of the words "district judges" in isolation from therest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the ChiefJudge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islandsfor service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a "districtjudge" of a court "within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit." But a literal reading of that sort is so capacious that it would alsojustify the designation of "district judges" of any number of7 The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is instead established in Chapter 17 of Title 48 ("Territories and Insular Possessions").See $ 1821.539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN76 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstate courts "within" the Ninth Circuit.8 The statute cannotplausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases.Moreover, we do not read the designation statute withoutregard for the "historic significance" of the term "UnitedStates District Court" used in Title 28. Mookini v. UnitedStates, 303 U. S. 201, 205 (1938). "[W]ithout an addition ex-pressing a wider connotation," that term ordinarily excludesArticle IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdictionis similar to that of a United States District Court createdunder Article III. Ibid. See also Summers v. UnitedStates, 231 U. S. 92, 101-102 (1913) ("[T]he courts of the Ter-ritories may have such jurisdiction of cases arising under theConstitution and laws of the United States as is vested inthe circuit and district courts, but this does not make themcircuit and district courts of the United States"); Stephens v.Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 476-477 (1899) ("It must beadmitted that the words `United States District Court' werenot accurately used . . . [to refer to] the United States Courtin the Indian Territory"). Construing the relevant statu-tory provisions together with further aid from historicalusage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate thejudges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be "district judges" within the meaning of $ 292(a).It necessarily follows that the appointment of one memberof the panel deciding petitioners' appeals was unauthorized.98 Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington are allStates within the Ninth Circuit whose judiciaries include "district judges."See Alaska Stat. $$ 22.15.010, 22.15.020, 22.20.010 (2002); Haw.

S. 69 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIIIAlthough the Government concedes that the panel of theCourt of Appeals was improperly constituted, it advancesthree grounds on which the judgments below may rest undis-turbed. Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirmconcern petitioners' failure to object to the panel's composi-tion in the Court of Appeals. Relying on the so-called "defacto officer" doctrine, the Government contends petitioners'failure to challenge the panel's composition at the earliestpracticable moment completely forecloses relief in thisCourt. The Government also contends that petitioners donot meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review. The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualifiedjudges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the thirdground sufficient to support the decision below. We do notfind these contentions persuasive.The de facto officer doctrine, we have explained, "confersvalidity upon acts performed by a person acting under thecolor of official title even though it is later discovered thatthe legality of that person's appointment or election to officeis deficient." Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177, 180(1995). Whatever the force of thede facto officer doctrinein other circumstances, an examination of our precedentsconcerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judgesdoes not compel us to apply it in these cases.Typically, we have found a judge's actions to be validdefacto when there is a "merely technical" defect of statutoryauthority.Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 535 (1962)(plurality opinion of Harlan, J.). In McDowell v. UnitedStates, 159 U. S. 596, 601-602 (1895), for example, the Courtdeclined to notice alleged irregularities in a Circuit Judge'sdesignation of a District Judge for temporary service in another district. See also Ball v. United States, 140 U. S. 118,tion. We find it unnecessary to discuss the constitutional questions because the statutory violation is clear.539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN78 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court128-129 (1891) (assigned judge had de facto authority to replace a deceased judge even though he had been designatedto replace a disabled judge). We observed in McDowell,however, that the judge whose assignment had been questioned was otherwise qualified to serve, because he was"a judge of the United States District Court, having all thepowers attached to such office," and because the CircuitJudge was otherwise empowered to designate him. 159U. S., at 601.By contrast, we have agreed to correct, at least on directreview, violations of a statutory provision that "embodies astrong policy concerning the proper administration of judicialbusiness" even though the defect was not raised in a timelymanner. Glidden, 370 U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). InAmerican Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148U. S. 372 (1893), the case Justice Harlan cited for this proposition in Glidden, a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appealswas challenged because one member of that court had beenprohibited by statute from taking part in the hearing anddecision of the appeal.10 This Court succinctly observed: "Ifthe statute made him incompetent to sit at the hearing, thedecree in which he took part was unlawful, and perhaps absolutely void, and should certainly be set aside or quashed byany court having authority to review it by appeal, error orcertiorari." 148 U. S., at 387. The American Constr. Co.rule was again applied in William Cramp & Sons Ship &Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Tur10 The petitioners in American Constr. Co. challenged the participationof a Circuit Judge who, while sitting as a trial judge, had entered an orderclosely related to the matter under review in the Circuit Court of Appeals.At the time, the relevant statute governing the composition of the circuitcourts of appeals provided that "no justice or judge before whom a causeor question may have been tried or heard in a district court, or existingcircuit court, shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question inthe circuit court of appeals." Evarts Act, ch. 517, $ 3, 26 Stat. 827.539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN79Cite as: 539 U. S. 69 (2003)Opinion of the Courtbine Co., 228 U. S. 645 (1913), even though the parties hadconsented in the Circuit Court of Appeals to the participation of a District Judge who was not permitted by statute toconsider the appeal. Id., at 650. Rather than sift throughthe underlying merits, we remanded to the Circuit Court ofAppeals "so that the case may be heard by a competentcourt, [organized] conformably to the requirements of thestatute." Id., at 651. See also Moran v. Dillingham, 174U. S. 153, 158 (1899) ("[T]his court, without consideringwhether that decree was or was not erroneous in other respects, orders the Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals tobe set aside and quashed, and the case remanded to thatcourt to be there heard and determined according to law bya bench of competent judges" (emphasis deleted)).We are confronted in petitioners' cases with a question ofjudicial authority more fundamental than whether "some effort has been made to conform with the formal conditionson which [a judge's] particular powers depend." Johnson v.Manhattan R. Co., 61 F. 2d 934, 938 (CA2 1932) (L. Hand, J.).The difference between the irregular judicial designationsin McDowell and Ball and the impermissible panel designation in the instant cases is therefore the difference betweenan action which could have been taken, if properly pursued,and one which could never have been taken at all. Like thestatutes in William Cramp & Sons, Moran, and AmericanConstr. Co., $ 292(a) embodies weighty congressional policyconcerning the proper organization of the federal courts.1111 The Government seeks to distinguish William Cramp & Sons, Moran,and American Constr. Co. on the ground that the statutory provision atissue in each of those cases, unlike $ 292(a), "expressly prohibited" thechallenged judge's participation. Brief for United States 18. In light ofour conclusion that there is no plausible interpretation of $ 292(a) permitting the designation in the instant cases, see supra, at 74-76, we think thisis a distinction without a difference. In any event, there was no "express"prohibition at play in United States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363U. S. 685, 690-691 (1960), in which this Court vacated the judgment of a539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN80 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtSection 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service onthe courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoythe protections set forth in Article III. Congress' decisionto preserve the Article III character of the courts of appealsis more than a trivial concern, cf. Northern Pipeline Constr.Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 57-60 (1982)(plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect. The ChiefJudge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purportto have "all the powers attached to" the position of anArticle III judge, McDowell, 159 U. S., at 601, nor was theChief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by$ 292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals.For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriateto accept the Government's invitation to assess the merits ofpetitioners' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, orpublic reputation of the proceedings were impaired by thecomposition of the panel. It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily limitsan appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 U. S. C.$ 2111; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b). But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners'part could create authority Congress has quite carefullywithheld. Even if the parties had expressly stipulated tothe participation of a non-Article III judge in the considerCourt of Appeals, sitting en banc, because a Senior Circuit Judge who hadparticipated in the decision was not authorized by statute to do so. Seealso id., at 691 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The statute need hardly be read,as the Court now holds it should be, as saying that a case in an en banccourt shall be `heard and determined' by the active circuit judges").539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN81Cite as: 539 U. S. 69 (2003)Opinion of the Courtation of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and wellqualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would nothave cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel.12See William Cramp & Sons, 228 U. S., at 650.More fundamentally, our enforcement of $ 292(a)'s outerbounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity ofpetitioners' convictions at trial but for the validity of thecomposition of the Court of Appeals. As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicialeffect. See Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.250, 254-255 (1988). Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that "embodiesa strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business," however, our exercise of supervisory poweris not inconsistent with that general rule.13 Glidden, 370U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion). Thus, we invalidated thejudgment of a Court of Appeals without assessing prejudice,even though urged to do so, when the error alleged wasthe improper composition of that court. See United Statesv. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685, 690-691(1960) (vacating judgment of en banc Court of Appeals because participation by Senior Circuit Judge was not providedby statute).12 We agree with the Government's submission that the improper composition of the court below was "an isolated, one-time mistake." Brief forUnited States 5. Countervailing concerns for gamesmanship, which animate the requirement for contemporaneous objection, therefore dissipatein these cases in light of the rarity of the improper panel assignment atissue.13 "The authority which Congress has granted this Court to review judgments of the courts of appeals undoubtedly vests us not only with theauthority to correct errors of substantive law, but to prescribe the methodby which those courts go about deciding the cases before them." LehmanBrothers v. Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 393 (1974) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).539US1 Unit: $U67 [05-03-05 18:26:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN82 NGUYEN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIt is also true that two judges of a three-judge panel constitute a quorum legally able to transact business.14 Moreover, settled law permits a quorum to proceed to judgmentwhen one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F. 2d 925, 927(CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.). For two reasons, however, thepresence of a quorum on the Ninth Circuit panel does notsave the judgments below. First, the quorum statute hasbeen on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged)for over a century,15 yet this Court has never doubted itspower to vacate the judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum ofjudges competent to consider the appeal. See United Statesv. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685 (1960); William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., 228 U. S. 645 (1913);American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148U. S. 372 (1893).Second, the statutory authority for courts of appeals to sitin panels, 28 U. S. C. $ 46(b), requires the inclusion of at leastthree judges in the first instance.16 As the Second Circuit14 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 46(d) provides: "A majority of the number of judgesauthorized to constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute aquorum." As used in $ 46(d), "quorum . . . means such a number of themembers of the court as may legally transact judicial business." Tobin v.Ramey, 206 F. 2d 505, 507 (CA5 1953).15 See Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 6, $ 117, 36 Stat. 1131:"There shall be in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consistof three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum . . . ."The Evarts Act, which established the original circuit courts of appeals,contained essentially the same provision:"[T]here is hereby created in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, whichshall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum."Ch. 517, $ 2, 26 Stat. 826.16 Title 28 U.

S. 69 (2003)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentinghas noted, Congress apparently enacted $ 46(b) in part "tocurtail the prior practice under which some circuits wereroutinely assigning some cases to two-judge panels." Mur-ray v. National Broadcasting Co., 35 F. 3d 45, 47 (1994). Itis "clear that the statute was not intended to preclude dispo-sition by a panel of two judges in the event that one member of a three-judge panel to which the appeal is assignedbecomes unable to participate,"ibid., but it is less clearwhether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolutionfor the participation of a judge who was not otherwise com-petent to be part of the panel under $ 292(a). Thus, althoughthe two Article III judges who took part in the decision ofpetitioners' appeals would have constituted a quorum if theoriginal panel had been properly created, it is at least highlydoubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel. In light of that doubt, it is appropriate toreturn these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners' appeals by a properly constituted panelorganized "comformably to the requirements of the statute." 17 William Cramp & Sons, 228 U. S., at 651.Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases for further proceedings con-sistent with this opinion.
