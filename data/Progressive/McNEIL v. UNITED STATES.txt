The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that an "ac-tion shall not be instituted upon a claim against the UnitedStates for money damages" unless the claimant has first ex-hausted his administrative remedies.1 The question presented is whether such an action may be maintained whenthe claimant failed to exhaust his administrative remediesprior to filing suit, but did so before substantial progress wasmade in the litigation.IOn March 6, 1989, petitioner, proceeding without counsel,lodged a complaint in the United States District Court forthe Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the UnitedStates Public Health Service had caused him serious injurieswhile "conducting human research and experimentation onprisoners" in the custody of the Illinois Department of Cor*Joseph A.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrections. He invoked the federal court's jurisdiction underthe FTCA and prayed for a judgment of $20 million. App.3-7.Four months later, on July 7, 1989, petitioner submitted aclaim for damages to the Department of Health and HumanServices.2 The Department denied the claim on July 21,1989. On August 7, 1989, petitioner sent a letter to the Dis-trict Court enclosing a copy of the Department's denial of hisadministrative claim and an affidavit in support of an earliermotion for appointment of counsel. Petitioner asked thatthe court accept the letter "as a proper request, whereasplaintiff can properly commence his legal action accordingly."Id., at 10.For reasons that are not entirely clear, the United Stateswas not served with a copy of petitioner's complaint untilJuly 30, 1990.3 Id., at 2. On September 19, 1990, theUnited States moved to dismiss the complaint on the groundthat petitioner's action was barred by the 6-month statute oflimitation.4 The motion was based on the assumption that2 Petitioner sought damages of $500,000 in his administrative claim, notthe $20 million for which he prayed in his earlier federal court action.Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2675(b), a claimant is barred from seeking in federal court "any sum in excess of the amount of the claim presented to thefederal agency." That is, had petitioner properly filed an action in districtcourt after his administrative claim was denied, he would have been limited in his recovery to $500,000.3 Entries in the District Court docket indicate that plaintiff had previously filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, that laterin August he filed a motion for appointment of counsel, and that he ultimately paid a filing fee that caused the District Court to dismiss themotion for leave to file in forma pauperis as moot. In all events, inApril 1990, the District Court ordered service to be effected by a UnitedStates Marshal "because plaintiff is incarcerated and proceeding pro se."App. 1.4 Title 28 U. S.

S. 106 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthe complaint had been filed on April 15, 1990, when peti-tioner paid the court filing fees, and that that date was morethan six months after the denial of petitioner's administra-tive claim. In response to the motion, petitioner submittedthat the complaint was timely because his action had beencommenced on March 6, 1989, the date when he actuallylodged his complaint and the Clerk assigned it a docketnumber.The District Court accepted March 6, 1989, as the opera-tive date of filing, but nonetheless granted the Government'smotion to dismiss. Petitioner's suit was not out of time, theDistrict Court reasoned, but, rather, premature. The courtconcluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain an action"commenced before satisfaction of the administrative exhaustion requirement under $ 2675(a)." Id., at 21.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.The court explained:"According to 28 U. S. C. $ 2401(b), a tort claim againstthe United States must be `begun within six monthsafter the date of mailing . . . of notice of final denial ofthe claim by the agency to which it was presented.'The administrative denial was mailed on July 21, 1989,so McNeil had between then and January 21, 1990, tobegin his action. The complaint filed in March 1989 wastoo early. This left two options. Perhaps the document filed in March 1989 loitered on the docket, spring-ing into force when the agency acted. Or perhaps therequest for counsel in August 1989, during the six-monthperiod, marks the real `beginning' of the action. Thedistrict court rejected both options, and McNeil, withthe assistance of counsel appointed by this court, renewsthe arguments here.. . . . .the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denialof the claim by the agency to which it was presented."508us1$70z 02-13-97 14:03:49 PAGES OPINPGT110 McNEIL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"March 1989 was too early. The suit did not linger,awaiting administrative action. Unless McNeil began afresh suit within six months after July 21, 1989, heloses." 964 F. 2d 647, 648-649 (1992).The court reviewed the materials filed in August 1989 andconcluded that the District Court had not committed plainerror in refusing to construe them as having commenced anew action.5Because decisions in other Circuits permit a prematurelyfiled FTCA action to proceed if no substantial progress hastaken place in the litigation before the administrative reme-dies are exhausted, seeKubrick v. United States, 581 F. 2d1092, 1098 (CA3 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 444 U. S. 111(1979), and Celestine v.

S. 1074 (1993).IIAs the case comes to us, we assume that the Court of Ap-peals correctly held that nothing done by petitioner after thedenial of his administrative claim on July 21, 1989, consti-tuted the commencement of a new action. The narrow question before us is whether his action was timely either be5 In dissent, Judge Ripple expressed the opinion that petitioner hadproperly raised the issue in the District Court and on appeal, 964 F. 2d,at 649, n. 1, and that in any event it was "clear that the plaintiff, a prisonerproceeding pro se, attempted to refile the action after the denial of theadministrative claim." Id., at 649. Our grant of certiorari did not encompass the question whether a new action had been filed in August andwe therefore express no opinion as to the correctness of the Court ofAppeals' ruling on that issue.6 Decisions in the Fifth and Ninth Circuits agree with the position takenin the Seventh Circuit in this case. See Gregory v. Mitchell, 634 F. 2d199, 204 (CA5 1981); Reynolds v. United States, 748 F. 2d 291, 292 (CA51984); Jerves v. United States, 966 F. 2d 517, 521 (CA9 1992).508us1$70z 02-13-97 14:03:49 PAGES OPINPGT111Cite as: 508 U. S. 106 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcause it was commenced when he lodged his complaint withthe District Court on March 6, 1989, or because it shouldbe viewed as having been "instituted" on the date when hisadministrative claim was denied.The text of the statute requires rejection of the first possibility. The command that an "action shall not be instituted. . . unless the claimant shall have first presented the claimto the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall havebeen finally denied by the agency in writing and sent bycertified or registered mail" is unambiguous. We are notfree to rewrite the statutory text. As of March 6, 1989, petitioner had neither presented his claim to the Public HealthService, nor had his claim been "finally denied" by thatagency. As the Court of Appeals held, petitioner's complaint was filed too early.The statutory text does not speak with equal clarity tothe argument that petitioner's subsequent receipt of a formaldenial from the agency might be treated as the event that"instituted" his action. Petitioner argues the word "instituted" that is used in $ 2675(a), see n. 1, supra, is not synonymous with the word "begun" in $ 2401(b), see n. 4, supra, orwith the word "commence" as used in certain other statutesand rules. See, e. g., Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, 493U. S. 20 (1989). He suggests that an action is not "instituted" until the occurrence of the events that are necessarypredicates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction--namely, the filing of his complaint and the formal denial ofthe administrative claim. This construction, he argues, isconsistent with the underlying purpose of $ 2675(a): As longas no substantial progress has been made in the litigationby the time the claimant has exhausted his administrativeremedies, the federal agency will have had a fair opportunity to investigate and possibly settle the claim before the par508us1$70z 02-13-97 14:03:49 PAGES OPINPGT112 McNEIL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtties must assume the burden of costly and time-consuminglitigation.7We find this argument unpersuasive. In its statutory con-text, we think the normal interpretation of the word "institute" is synonymous with the words "begin" and "com-mence." The most natural reading of the statute indicatesthat Congress intended to require complete exhaustion ofExecutive remedies before invocation of the judicial process.Every premature filing of an action under the FTCA imposessome burden on the judicial system8 and on the Departmentof Justice which must assume the defense of such actions.Although the burden may be slight in an individual case, thestatute governs the processing of a vast multitude of claims.The interest in orderly administration of this body of litigation is best served by adherence to the straightforward stat-utory command.7 Prior to 1966, FTCA claimants had the option of filing suit in federalcourt without first presenting their claims to the appropriate federalagency. Moreover, federal agencies had only limited authority to settleclaims. See Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, ch. 753, $$ 403(a), 420, 60Stat. 843, 845. Because the vast majority of claims ultimately were settled before trial, the Department of Justice proposed that Congress amendthe FTCA to "requir[e] all claims to be presented to the appropriateagency for consideration and possible settlement before a court actioncould be instituted. This procedure would make it possible for the claimfirst to be considered by the agency whose employee's activity allegedlycaused the damage. That agency would have the best information concerning the activity which gave rise to the claim. Since it is the onedirectly concerned, it can be expected that claims which are found to bemeritorious can be settled more quickly without the need for filing suit andpossible expensive and time-consuming litigation." S. Rep. No. 1327, 89thCong., 2d Sess., 3 (1966).The Senate Judiciary Committee further noted that "the improvementscontemplated by [the 1966 amendments] would not only benefit privatelitigants, but would also be beneficial to the courts, the agencies, and theDepartment of Justice itself." Id., at 2.8 Even petitioner concedes that at least one objective of the 1966 amendments to the FTCA was to "reduce unnecessary congestion in the courts."Id., at 4.

S. 106 (1993)Opinion of the CourtMoreover, given the clarity of the statutory text, it is cer-tainly not a "trap for the unwary." It is no doubt true thatthere are cases in which a litigant proceeding without coun-sel may make a fatal procedural error, but the risk that alawyer will be unable to understand the exhaustion require-ment is virtually nonexistent. Our rules of procedure arebased on the assumption that litigation is normally con-ducted by lawyers. While we have insisted that the pleadings prepared by prisoners who do not have access to counselbe liberally construed, seeHaines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519(1972); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 106 (1976),9 and haveheld that some procedural rules must give way because ofthe unique circumstance of incarceration, see Houston v.Lack, 487 U. S. 266 (1988) (pro se prisoner's notice of appealdeemed filed at time of delivery to prison authorities), wehave never suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civillitigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes bythose who proceed without counsel.10 As we have noted be-fore, "in the long run, experience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legisla-ture is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration ofthe law." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807, 826 (1980).The FTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federalcourt until they have exhausted their administrative reme-dies. Because petitioner failed to heed that clear statutorycommand, the District Court properly dismissed his suit.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
