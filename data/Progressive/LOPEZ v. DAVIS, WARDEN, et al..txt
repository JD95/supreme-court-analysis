Congress has provided, in 18 U. S.

The validity of the Bureau's regulation is the question presented in this case. We hold, in accord with theCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, that the regulationis a permissible exercise of the Bureau's discretion under18 U. S. C. $ 3621(e)(2)(B).IATitle 18 U. S. C. $ 3621 governs the imprisonment ofpersons convicted of federal crimes. In 1990, Congressamended the statute to provide that "[t]he Bureau shall . . .make available appropriate substance abuse treatment foreach prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse." Pub. L. 101-647,$ 2903, 104 Stat. 4913. Four years later, Congress againamended $ 3621, this time to provide incentives for prisonerparticipation in BOP drug treatment programs. The incentive provision at issue reads: "The period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reducedby the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not bemore than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve." Pub. L. 103-322, $ 32001, 108 Stat. 1897 (codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(e)(2)(B)).In 1995, the Bureau published a rule to implement theearly release incentive. 60 Fed. Reg. 27692-27695; 28 CFR$ 550.58. Because the statute explicitly confined the incentive to prisoners convicted of "nonviolent offense[s]," 18U. S. C. $ 3621(e)(2)(B), the BOP ranked ineligible for earlyrelease all inmates currently incarcerated for "crime[s] of violence," 60 Fed. Reg. 27692. As explained in the Bureau'sprogram statement, the BOP defined "crimes of violence" toinclude a drug trafficking conviction under 21 U. S.

Reg. 27692 (codified at 28CFR $ 550.58 (1995)).The Courts of Appeals divided over the validity of the Bureau's definition of crimes of violence to include drug offensesthat involved possession of a firearm. A majority of Circuits, including the Eighth, held that $ 3621(e)(2)(B) requiredthe Bureau to look only to the offense of conviction (drugtrafficking), and not to sentencing factors (firearm possession), in determining whether an offender was convicted of a"nonviolent offense," and was therefore eligible under thestatute for the early release incentive. Martin v. Gerlinski,133 F. 3d 1076, 1079 (CA8 1998); see also Fristoe v. Thompson, 144 F. 3d 627, 631 (CA10 1998); Byrd v. Hasty, 142 F. 3d1395, 1398 (CA11 1998); Roussos v. Menifee, 122 F. 3d 159,164 (CA3 1997); Downey v. Crabtree, 100 F. 3d 662, 668 (CA91996). The Fourth and Fifth Circuits, however, upheld theBureau's classification of drug offenses attended by firearmpossession as violent crimes. Pelissero v. Thompson, 1701 Title 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)(1) and (2) make it unlawful "to manufacture,distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute,or dispense, a controlled substance," or "to create, distribute, or dispense,or possess with intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit substance."Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-levelsentence enhancement if a dangerous weapon was possessed in connectionwith the commission of a drug offense. See USSG $ 2D1.1(b)(1) and comment., n. 3 (Nov. 2000).531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN235Cite as: 531 U. S. 230 (2001)Opinion of the CourtF. 3d 442, 447 (CA4 1999); Venegas v. Henman, 126 F. 3d 760,763 (CA5 1997).This split among the Circuits prompted the Bureau in 1997to publish the regulation now before the Court. See 62 Fed.Reg. 53690-53691. Like the 1995 rule, the current regula-tion excludes from early release eligibility offenders whopossessed a firearm in connection with their offenses. Incontrast to the earlier rule, however, the 1997 regulationdoes not order this exclusion by defining the statutory term"prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense" or the cognateterm "crimes of violence." Instead, the current regulationrelies upon "the discretion allotted to the Director of theBureau of Prisons in granting a sentence reduction to exclude [enumerated categories of] inmates." Id., at 53690.The regulation, designed to achieve consistent administration of the incentive, now provides:"(a) Additional early release criteria. (1) As an exercise of the discretion vested in the Director of theFederal Bureau of Prisons, the following categories ofinmates are not eligible for early release:. . . . ."(iv) Inmates who have a prior felony or misdemeanorconviction for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child sexual abuse offenses;. . . . ."(vi) Inmates whose current offense is a felony:. . . . ."(B) That involved the carrying, possession, or use ofa firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . ." 28 CFR$ 550.58(a) (2000).In sum, the 1995 rule defined the statutory term "prisonerconvicted of a nonviolent offense" to exclude categorically aninmate who possessed a firearm in connection with his offense. The current regulation categorically excludes suchan inmate, not because $ 3621(e)(2)(B) so mandates, but pur531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN236 LOPEZ v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtsuant to the Bureau's asserted discretion to prescribe addi-tional early release criteria. Drug traffickers who possessfirearms when they engage in crimes are no longer charac-terized as "violent" offenders within the meaning of the statute. But they are bracketed, for sentence reduction pur-poses, with persons currently incarcerated for "nonviolentoffense[s]" who in the past committed crimes qualifying asviolent. The preconviction conduct of both armed offendersand certain redicivists, in the Bureau's view, "suggest[s] thatthey pose a particular risk to the public." Brief for Respondents 30. BIn 1997, petitioner Christopher A. Lopez was convictedof possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, inviolation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841. Upon finding that Lopez pos-sessed a firearm in connection with his offense, the DistrictCourt enhanced his sentence by two levels pursuant to USSG$ 2D1.1(b)(1). Lopez is currently scheduled to be releasedfrom prison in June 2002.While incarcerated, Lopez requested substance abusetreatment. The Bureau found him qualified for its residen-tial drug abuse program,2 but categorically ineligible, under28 CFR $ 550.58(a)(1)(vi), for early release. App. 3-7.When notified that he would not be a candidate for earlyrelease, Lopez challenged the BOP's determination by filinga petition for a writ of habeas corpus, under 28 U. S. C.$ 2241, in the United States District Court for the Districtof South Dakota. The District Court granted the petition.In that court's view, the Bureau's 1997 regulation did notcorrect the infirmity the Eighth Circuit saw in the 1995 rule.See App. 17-18, and n. 4 (citing Martin, 133 F. 3d, at 1079)."[I]t is true," the District Court recognized, "that the BOP2 To qualify for residential substance abuse treatment, an inmate mustbe "determined by the Bureau of Prisons to have a substance abuseproblem" and be "willing to participate in [the] program." 18 U.

S. 230 (2001)Opinion of the Courtmay exercise a great deal of discretion in determining whoamong the eligible nonviolent offenders may be released."App. 17. But, the District Court held, the BOP may notcategorically count out, "based upon sentencing factors orweapon possession," inmates whose underlying convictionwas for a nonviolent crime.Id., at 18. Accordingly, theDistrict Court ordered the BOP "to reconsider Lopez's eligibility for early release." Id., at 19.The Eighth Circuit reversed.Bellis v. Davis, 186 F. 3d1092 (1999). Section 3621(e)(2)(B), the Court of Appealsobserved, "states only that the prison term of an inmateconvicted of a nonviolent offense `may be reduced by theBureau of Prisons.' " Id., at 1094 (quoting 18 U. S. C.$ 3621(e)(2)(B)). This discretionary formulation, the EighthCircuit reasoned, allows the Bureau to devise a regime basedon criteria that can be uniformly applied. The statutegrants no entitlement to any inmate or class of inmates, theCourt of Appeals noted, and it does not instruct the Bureauto make "individual, rather than categorical, assessmentsof eligibility for inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses."186 F. 3d, at 1094. The court further reasoned that, to theextent Congress left a gap in $ 3621(e)(2)(B) for the Bureauto fill, deference is owed the BOP's interpretation underChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-845, 866 (1984), so long as the interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute. 186F. 3d, at 1095. The Bureau had elected to deny early releaseto certain categories of prisoners, notably recidivists andfirearms carriers, whose "conduct indicates that they pose aserious risk to public safety." Ibid. That decision, theCourt of Appeals concluded, "represents a manifestly permissible construction of the statute and an appropriate exercise of the BOP's discretion." Ibid.The Eighth Circuit next explained why its earlier decisionin Martin did not control this case, which trains on the BOP's1997 regulation: Martin addressed only the Bureau's 1995531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN238 LOPEZ v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtattempt to interpret the statutory term "nonviolent offense";the court in that case did not address "whether the BOPmay, as an exercise of its discretion, . . . look to sentencingfactors in deciding which individuals among statutorily eligible inmates are appropriate candidates for early release."186 F. 3d, at 1095. Facing that issue, the Court of Appealsheld such an exercise of discretion proper. Ibid.The Courts of Appeals have again divided, now over thepermissibility of the Bureau's current (1997) regulation.The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, in line with their priordecisions invalidating the 1995 rule, have concluded that$ 3621(e)(2)(B) permits no categorical exclusions of nonviolent offenders based on sentence enhancements. Ward v.Booker, 202 F. 3d 1249, 1256-1257 (CA10 2000); Kilpatrickv. Houston, 197 F. 3d 1134, 1135 (CA11 1999). The NinthCircuit, on the other hand, has agreed with the Eighth Cir-cuit that precedent invalidating the 1995 rule does notcontrol and that, in 1997, the BOP permissibly exercisedits discretion under $ 3621(e)(2)(B) when it categorically excluded from early release consideration inmates who pos-sessed a firearm in connection with their nonviolent offenses.Bowen v. Hood, 202 F. 3d 1211, 1218-1220 (2000).We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 529 U. S.1086 (2000), and now affirm the judgment of the EighthCircuit.IIThe statute provides: "The period a prisoner convictedof a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfullycompleting a treatment program may be reduced by theBureau of Prisons . . . ." 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(e)(2)(B). Themeasure thus categorically denies early release eligibilityto inmates convicted of violent offenses. The question weaddress is whether the Bureau has discretion to delineate,as an additional category of ineligible inmates, those whosecurrent offense is a felony involving a firearm. 28 CFR$ 550.58(a)(1)(vi)(B) (2000).531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN239Cite as: 531 U. S. 230 (2001)Opinion of the CourtLopez urges that the statute is unambiguous. He saysthat, by identifying a class of inmates ineligible for sentencereductions under $ 3621(e)(2)(B), i. e., those convicted of aviolent offense, Congress has barred the Bureau from identifying further categories of ineligible inmates. "If Congresswanted the BOP to reduce the categories of inmates eligiblefor the early release incentive (beyond the one identified byCongress), Congress would have specifically placed thisgrant of authority in the language of the statute." Brief forPetitioner 23. As to the statutory instruction that the Bu-reau "may" reduce sentences, Lopez initially suggests it ismerely a grant of authority to the BOP to reduce a sentencethat, prior to the enactment of $ 3621(e)(2)(B), could not bereduced for successful completion of drug treatment: "Thepower granted was to give reductions not the power to decide who was eligible to receive reductions." Id., at 21. Healternately contends that the Bureau may take into accountonly "post-conviction conduct," not "pre-conviction conduct."Reply Brief 4-5. Acting on a case-by-case basis, Lopez asserts, the Bureau may "deny early release to those inmates[who] are statutorily eligible, but who do not deserve earlyrelease based on their conduct while in prison." Id., at 5.Under this reading, the Bureau may exercise discretion indenying early release, but only on an individual basis, takingaccount solely of postconviction conduct.In the Bureau's view, $ 3621(e)(2)(B) establishes two prerequisites for sentence reduction: conviction of a nonviolentoffense and successful completion of drug treatment. Brieffor Respondents 18. If those prerequisites are met, the Bureau "may," but also may not, grant early release. The BOPopposes Lopez's argument that Congress barred the Bureaufrom imposing limitations categorically or on the basis ofpreconviction conduct. According to the Bureau, Congresssimply "did not address how the Bureau should exercise itsdiscretion within the class of inmates who satisfy the statutory prerequisites for early release." Id., at 23. Because531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN240 LOPEZ v. DAVISOpinion of the CourtCongress left the question unaddressed, the Bureau maintains, the agency may exclude inmates either categoricallyor on a case-by-case basis, subject of course to its obligationto interpret the statute reasonably, see Chevron, 467 U. S.,at 844, in a manner that is not arbitrary or capricious, see5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). In this instance, the Bureau urges,it has acted reasonably: Its denial of early release to all inmates who possessed a firearm in connection with their current offense rationally reflects the view that such inmatesdisplayed a readiness to endanger another's life; accordingly,in the interest of public safety, they should not be releasedmonths in advance of completing their sentences.3We agree with the Bureau's position. Preliminarily, wenote conspicuous anomalies in Lopez's construction. If$ 3621(e)(2)(B) functions not as a grant of discretion to determine early release eligibility, but both as an authorizationand a command to reduce sentences, then Congress' use ofthe word "may," rather than "shall," has no significance.And if the BOP does have discretion to deny early releaseto certain inmates, but only based on individualized assessments of postconviction conduct, then the agency cannotcategorically deny early release even to recidivists withprior (perhaps multiple) convictions for "homicide, forciblerape . . . , or child sexual abuse offenses." 28 CFR$ 550.58(a)(1)(iv) (2000). For that provision, as much as theexclusion of inmates imprisoned for offenses involving afirearm, see supra, at 235, entails no individualized determination based on postconviction conduct. Furthermore,3 The dissent straddles the fence, agreeing with Lopez that the statuteaddresses his case unambiguously, but disagreeing with him on preciselywhat the statute says. Lopez reads the statute to exclude Bureau consideration of preconviction conduct, Reply Brief 4-5; the dissent readsthe same words to permit BOP consideration of such conduct, post, at 248(opinion of Stevens, J.). These divergent readings hardly strengthen thedissent's assertion that Congress supplied a definitive answer to the "precise question" at issue. See post, at 245.531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN241Cite as: 531 U. S. 230 (2001)Opinion of the CourtLopez's position would confine the BOP's discretion under$ 3621(e)(2)(B) to consideration of factors of the kind theBureau already may consider in granting credit for "satis-factory behavior." See 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(b)(1) ("a prisoner[serving a term of more than one year and less than life]may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence . . . subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisonsthat, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplarycompliance with such institutional disciplinary regulations").We turn now to the Bureau's reading of the statutory text,which instructs that the agency "may" reduce the sentenceof a nonviolent offender who has successfully completed adrug treatment program. Congress' use of the permissive"may" in $ 3621(e)(2)(B) contrasts with the legislators' useof a mandatory "shall" in the very same section. Elsewherein $ 3621, Congress used "shall" to impose discretionless obligations, including the obligation to provide drug treatmentwhen funds are available. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3621(e)(1) ("Bureau of Prisons shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, provide residential substance abuse treatment(and make arrangements for appropriate aftercare)"); seealso, e. g., $ 3621(b) ("The Bureau shall designate the placeof the prisoner's imprisonment. . . . In designating the placeof imprisonment or making transfers under this subsection,there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high socialor economic status."). Sensibly read, the grant of discretionin $ 3621(e)(2)(B) to decide whether to reduce a sentenceparallels the grant of discretion in $ 3621(e)(2)(A) to retaina prisoner who successfully completes drug treatment"under such [custodial] conditions as the Bureau deems appropriate." $ 3621(e)(2)(A). When an eligible prisoner successfully completes drug treatment, the Bureau thus has theauthority, but not the duty, both to alter the prisoner's conditions of confinement and to reduce his term of imprisonment.The constraints Lopez urges--requiring the BOP to makeindividualized determinations based only on postconviction531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN242 LOPEZ v. DAVISOpinion of the Courtconduct--are nowhere to be found in $ 3621(e)(2)(B). Be-yond instructing that the Bureau has discretion to reducethe period of imprisonment for a nonviolent offender whosuccessfully completes drug treatment, Congress has notidentified any further circumstance in which the Bureaueither must grant the reduction, or is forbidden to do so. Inthis familiar situation, where Congress has enacted a lawthat does not answer "the precise question at issue," all wemust decide is whether the Bureau, the agency empoweredto administer the early release program, has filled the statu-tory gap "in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature's revealed design." NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v.Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251, 257 (1995)(citing Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842); see also Reno v. Koray,515 U. S. 50, 61 (1995) (deferring to BOP's interpretationof statute). We think the agency's interpretation is reasonable both in taking account of preconviction conduct and inmaking categorical exclusions.First, as the dissent but not Lopez recognizes, see post, at248, the Bureau need not blind itself to preconviction conductthat the agency reasonably views as jeopardizing life andlimb. By denying eligibility to violent offenders, the statutemanifests congressional concern for preconviction behavior--and for the very conduct leading to conviction. TheBureau may reasonably attend to these factors as well. Itsregulation in this regard is kin to the Attorney General'sorder upheld in INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U. S. 26 (1996).That case involved a statute authorizing the Attorney General to waive deportation of aliens deportable for entryfraud. The Attorney General had refused to waive deportation for one alien because of "acts of fraud . . . in connectionwith his entry." Id., at 27. The alien argued that becausethe statute made aliens who had committed entry fraud eligible for waiver, the Attorney General was precluded fromtaking such conduct into account "at all" in deciding whetherto grant relief. Id., at 30. We rejected this view, stating531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN243Cite as: 531 U. S. 230 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthat the statute "establishes only the alien's eligibility forthe waiver. Such eligibility in no way limits the considerations that may guide the Attorney General in exercising herdiscretion to determine who, among those eligible, will beaccorded grace." Id., at 31. Similarly in this case, the stat-ute's restriction of early release eligibility to nonviolent offenders does not cut short the considerations that may guidethe Bureau. Just as the Attorney General permissibly considered aspects of entry fraud, even though entry fraud wasa criterion of statutory eligibility, so the Bureau may consider aspects of the conduct of conviction, even though theconviction is a criterion of statutory eligibility.4We also reject Lopez's argument, echoed in part by thedissent,post, at 248-249, that the agency must not make cat-egorical exclusions, but may rely only on case-by-case assessments.5 "[E]ven if a statutory scheme requires individual4 Lopez contends that the Bureau's creation of additional hurdles to receipt of a sentence reduction defeats Congress' purpose of giving inmatesan incentive to undergo drug treatment. Brief for Petitioner 24-29. InINS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U. S. 26 (1996), we said that "[i]t could beargued that if the Attorney General determined that any entry fraud ormisrepresentation, no matter how minor and no matter what the attendantcircumstances, would cause her to withhold waiver, she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at all, but would be making a nullityof the statute." Id., at 31. In this case, it is plain that the Bureau hasnot rendered $ 3621(e)'s incentive a nullity. A total of 6,559 inmates havereceived sentence reductions under $ 3621(e)(2)(B), including 2,633 inmatesin Fiscal Year 1999 alone. Bureau of Prisons, Substance Abuse Treatment Programs in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Report to Congress 8(Jan. 2000). Moreover, inmates who do not qualify for early release, likeinmates who do, receive other incentives to participate in substance abusetreatment. See 28 CFR $$ 550.57(a)(1), (3) (2000) ("An inmate may receive incentives for his or her satisfactory involvement in the residential[drug treatment] program," including "[l]imited financial awards" and"[l]ocal institution incentives such as preferred living quarters or specialrecognition privileges.").5 The dissent appears to acknowledge that the Bureau may give "neardispositive weight to preconviction criteria." Post, at 249. To the extentthe dissent would permit the BOP to accord heavy weight to preconviction531US1 Unit: $U14 [04-13-02 15:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN244 LOPEZ v.

NLRB, 499 U. S. 606, 612 (1991);accord, Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 467 (1983). Theapproach pressed by Lopez--case-by-case decisionmaking inthousands of cases each year, seesupra, at 243, n. 4--couldinvite favoritism, disunity, and inconsistency. The Bureau isnot required continually to revisit "issues that may be estab-lished fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding." Heckler, 461 U. S., at 467.6Having decided that the Bureau may categorically excludeprisoners based on their preconviction conduct, we furtherhold that the regulation excluding Lopez is permissible.The Bureau reasonably concluded that an inmate's priorinvolvement with firearms, in connection with the commission of a felony, suggests his readiness to resort to life-endangering violence and therefore appropriately determines the early release decision.7conduct, the structured "[i]ndividualized [BOP] consideration" the dissentwould allow, post, at 249, seems but a shade different from the forthrightcategorical exclusion the Bureau has adopted.6 Amici urge reversal on the ground that the Bureau violated the noticeand comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act whenit published the 1997 regulation.

Because, as discussed above, the statute cannot be read to prohibit the Bureau from exercising its discretion categorically or on the basisof preconviction conduct, his reliance on the rule is unavailing. See Caronv. United States, 524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998) ("The rule of lenity is not invoked by a grammatical possibility.
