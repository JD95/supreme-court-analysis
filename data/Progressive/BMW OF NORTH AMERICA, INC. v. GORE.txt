S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtis whether a $2 million punitive damages award to the pur-chaser of one of these cars exceeds the constitutional limit.IIn January 1990, Dr. Ira Gore, Jr. (respondent), purchaseda black BMW sports sedan for $40,750.88 from an authorizedBMW dealer in Birmingham, Alabama. After driving thecar for approximately nine months, and without noticing anyflaws in its appearance, Dr. Gore took the car to "Slick Fin-ish," an independent detailer, to make it look " `snazzier thanit normally would appear.' " 646 So. 2d 619, 621 (Ala. 1994).Mr. Slick, the proprietor, detected evidence that the car hadbeen repainted.1 Convinced that he had been cheated, Dr.Gore brought suit against petitioner BMW of North America(BMW), the American distributor of BMW automobiles.2Dr. Gore alleged,inter alia, that the failure to disclose thatthe car had been repainted constituted suppression of a material fact.3 The complaint prayed for $500,000 in compensa-tory and punitive damages, and costs.At trial, BMW acknowledged that it had adopted a nation-wide policy in 1983 concerning cars that were damaged inthe course of manufacture or transportation. If the cost ofrepairing the damage exceeded 3 percent of the car's sug1 The top, hood, trunk, and quarter panels of Dr. Gore's car were repainted at BMW's vehicle preparation center in Brunswick, Georgia.The parties presumed that the damage was caused by exposure to acidrain during transit between the manufacturing plant in Germany and thepreparation center.2 Dr. Gore also named the German manufacturer and the Birminghamdealership as defendants.3 Alabama codified its common-law cause of action for fraud in a 1907statute that is still in effect. Hackmeyer v. Hackmeyer, 268 Ala. 329, 333,106 So. 2d 245, 249 (1958). The statute provides: "Suppression of a material fact which the party is under an obligation to communicate constitutesfraud. The obligation to communicate may arise from the confidential relations of the parties or from the particular circumstances of the case."Ala. Code $ 6-5-102 (1993); see Ala. Code $ 4299 (1907).517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT564 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courtgested retail price, the car was placed in company servicefor a period of time and then sold as used. If the repaircost did not exceed 3 percent of the suggested retail price,however, the car was sold as new without advising the dealerthat any repairs had been made. Because the $601.37 costof repainting Dr. Gore's car was only about 1.5 percent of itssuggested retail price, BMW did not disclose the damage orrepair to the Birmingham dealer.Dr. Gore asserted that his repainted car was worth lessthan a car that had not been refinished. To prove his actualdamages of $4,000, he relied on the testimony of a formerBMW dealer, who estimated that the value of a repaintedBMW was approximately 10 percent less than the value of anew car that had not been damaged and repaired.4 To support his claim for punitive damages, Dr. Gore introduced evidence that since 1983 BMW had sold 983 refinished cars asnew, including 14 in Alabama, without disclosing that thecars had been repainted before sale at a cost of more than$300 per vehicle.5 Using the actual damage estimate of$4,000 per vehicle, Dr. Gore argued that a punitive award of$4 million would provide an appropriate penalty for sellingapproximately 1,000 cars for more than they were worth.In defense of its disclosure policy, BMW argued that it wasunder no obligation to disclose repairs of minor damage tonew cars and that Dr. Gore's car was as good as a car withthe original factory finish. It disputed Dr. Gore's assertionthat the value of the car was impaired by the repainting andargued that this good-faith belief made a punitive awardinappropriate. BMW also maintained that transactions injurisdictions other than Alabama had no relevance to Dr.Gore's claim.4 The dealer who testified to the reduction in value is the former ownerof the Birmingham dealership sued in this action. He sold the dealershipapproximately one year before the trial.5 Dr. Gore did not explain the significance of the $300 cutoff.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT565Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThe jury returned a verdict finding BMW liable for com-pensatory damages of $4,000. In addition, the jury assessed$4 million in punitive damages, based on a determinationthat the nondisclosure policy constituted "gross, oppressiveor malicious" fraud.6 See Ala. Code $$ 6-11-20, 6-11-21(1993).BMW filed a post-trial motion to set aside the punitivedamages award. The company introduced evidence to es-tablish that its nondisclosure policy was consistent with thelaws of roughly 25 States defining the disclosure obligationsof automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealers. Themost stringent of these statutes required disclosure of re-pairs costing more than 3 percent of the suggested retailprice; none mandated disclosure of less costly repairs.7 Re-lying on these statutes, BMW contended that its conduct waslawful in these States and therefore could not provide thebasis for an award of punitive damages.BMW also drew the court's attention to the fact that itsnondisclosure policy had never been adjudged unlawful before this action was filed. Just months before Dr. Gore'scase went to trial, the jury in a similar lawsuit filed by another Alabama BMW purchaser found that BMW's failureto disclose paint repair constituted fraud. Yates v. BMW ofNorth America, Inc., 642 So. 2d 937 (Ala. 1993).8 Before the6 The jury also found the Birmingham dealership liable for Dr. Gore'scompensatory damages and the German manufacturer liable for both thecompensatory and punitive damages. The dealership did not appeal thejudgment against it. The Alabama Supreme Court held that the trialcourt did not have jurisdiction over the German manufacturer and therefore reversed the judgment against that defendant.7 BMW acknowledged that a Georgia statute enacted after Dr. Gore purchased his car would require disclosure of similar repairs to a car beforeit was sold in Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. $$ 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994).8 While awarding a comparable amount of compensatory damages, theYates jury awarded no punitive damages at all. In Yates, the plaintiff alsorelied on the 1983 nondisclosure policy, but instead of offering evidence of983 repairs costing more than $300 each, he introduced a bulk exhibit517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT566 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courtjudgment in this case, BMW changed its policy by takingsteps to avoid the sale of any refinished vehicles in Alabamaand two other States. When the $4 million verdict was re-turned in this case, BMW promptly instituted a nationwidepolicy of full disclosure of all repairs, no matter how minor.In response to BMW's arguments, Dr. Gore asserted thatthe policy change demonstrated the efficacy of the punitivedamages award. He noted that while no jury had held thepolicy unlawful, BMW had received a number of customercomplaints relating to undisclosed repairs and had settledsome lawsuits.9 Finally, he maintained that the disclosurestatutes of other States were irrelevant because BMW hadfailed to offer any evidence that the disclosure statutes supplanted, rather than supplemented, existing causes of actionfor common-law fraud.The trial judge denied BMW's post-trial motion, holding,inter alia, that the award was not excessive. On appeal,the Alabama Supreme Court also rejected BMW's claim thatthe award exceeded the constitutionally permissible amount.646 So. 2d 619 (1994). The court's excessiveness inquiry applied the factors articulated in Green Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539So. 2d 218, 223-224 (Ala. 1989), and approved in Pacific Mut.Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 21-22 (1991). 646 So. 2d,at 624-625. Based on its analysis, the court concluded thatBMW's conduct was "reprehensible"; the nondisclosure wasprofitable for the company; the judgment "would not havea substantial impact upon [BMW's] financial position"; thelitigation had been expensive; no criminal sanctions had beenimposed on BMW for the same conduct; the award of no pucontaining 5,856 repair bills to show that petitioner had sold over 5,800new BMW vehicles without disclosing that they had been repaired.9 Prior to the lawsuits filed by Dr. Yates and Dr. Gore, BMW and variousBMW dealers had been sued 14 times concerning presale paint or damagerepair. According to the testimony of BMW's in-house counsel at thepostjudgment hearing on damages, only one of the suits concerned a carrepainted by BMW.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT567Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtnitive damages in Yates reflected "the inherent uncertaintyof the trial process"; and the punitive award bore a "reasonable relationship" to "the harm that was likely to occur from[BMW's] conduct as well as . . . the harm that actually occurred." 646 So. 2d, at 625-627.The Alabama Supreme Court did, however, rule in BMW'sfavor on one critical point: The court found that the juryimproperly computed the amount of punitive damages bymultiplying Dr. Gore's compensatory damages by the num-ber of similar sales in other jurisdictions.Id., at 627. Hav-ing found the verdict tainted, the court held that "a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in this case is$2,000,000,"id., at 629, and therefore ordered a remittitur inthat amount.10 The court's discussion of the amount of itsremitted award expressly disclaimed any reliance on "actsthat occurred in other jurisdictions"; instead, the court explained that it had used a "comparative analysis" that consid-ered Alabama cases, "along with cases from other jurisdictions, involving the sale of an automobile where the sellermisrepresented the condition of the vehicle and the juryawarded punitive damages to the purchaser." 11 Id., at 628.10 The Alabama Supreme Court did not indicate whether the $2 millionfigure represented the court's independent assessment of the appropriatelevel of punitive damages, or its determination of the maximum amountthat the jury could have awarded consistent with the Due Process Clause.11 Other than Yates v. BMW of North America, Inc., 642 So. 2d 937(1993), in which no punitive damages were awarded, the Alabama SupremeCourt cited no such cases. In another portion of its opinion, 646 So. 2d,at 629, the court did cite five Alabama cases, none of which involved eithera dispute arising out of the purchase of an automobile or an awardof punitive damages. G. M. Mosley Contractors, Inc. v. Phillips, 487 So.2d 876, 879 (1986); Hollis v. Wyrosdick, 508 So. 2d 704 (1987); Campbellv. Burns, 512 So. 2d 1341, 1343 (1987); Ashbee v. Brock, 510 So. 2d 214(1987); and Jawad v. Granade, 497 So. 2d 471 (1986). All of these casessupport the proposition that appellate courts in Alabama presume thatjury verdicts are correct. In light of the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (1) the jury had computed its award by multiplying $4,000by the number of refinished vehicles sold in the United States and517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT568 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the CourtBecause we believed that a review of this case would helpto illuminate "the character of the standard that will identifyunconstitutionally excessive awards" of punitive damages,see Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415, 420 (1994), wegranted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1125 (1995).IIPunitive damages may properly be imposed to further aState's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conductand deterring its repetition. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974); Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453U. S. 247, 266-267 (1981); Haslip, 499 U. S., at 22. In ourfederal system, States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the level of punitive damages that theywill allow in different classes of cases and in any particularcase. Most States that authorize exemplary damages affordthe jury similar latitude, requiring only that the damagesawarded be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's le-gitimate interests in punishment and deterrence. SeeTXO,509 U. S., at 456; Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21, 22. Only whenan award can fairly be categorized as "grossly excessive" inrelation to these interests does it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. Cf.TXO, 509 U. S., at 456. For that reason,the federal excessiveness inquiry appropriately begins withan identification of the state interests that a punitive awardis designed to serve. We therefore focus our attention firston the scope of Alabama's legitimate interests in punishingBMW and deterring it from future misconduct.No one doubts that a State may protect its citizens byprohibiting deceptive trade practices and by requiring auto(2) that the award should have been based on Alabama conduct, respectfor the error-free portion of the jury verdict would seem to produce anaward of $56,000 ($4,000 multiplied by 14, the number of repainted vehiclessold in Alabama).517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT569Cite as: 517 U.

But the States need not, and in factdo not, provide such protection in a uniform manner.

GOREOpinion of the CourtThe result is a patchwork of rules representing the diversepolicy judgments of lawmakers in 50 States.That diversity demonstrates that reasonable people maydisagree about the value of a full disclosure requirement.Some legislatures may conclude that affirmative disclosurerequirements are unnecessary because the self-interest ofthose involved in the automobile trade in developing andmaintaining the goodwill of their customers will motivatethem to make voluntary disclosures or to refrain from sellingcars that do not comply with self-imposed standards. Thoselegislatures that do adopt affirmative disclosure obligationsmay take into account the cost of government regulation,choosing to draw a line exempting minor repairs from sucha requirement. In formulating a disclosure standard, Statesmay also consider other goals, such as providing a "safe har-bor" for automobile manufacturers, distributors, and dealersagainst lawsuits over minor repairs.14We may assume, arguendo, that it would be wise for everyState to adopt Dr. Gore's preferred rule, requiring full disclo-sure of every presale repair to a car, no matter how trivialand regardless of its actual impact on the value of the car.quires dealers to disclose paint repair costing more than $100 of whichthey have actual knowledge. Fla. Stat. $ 320.27(9)(n) (1992). Oregon requires manufacturers to disclose all "postmanufacturing" damage and repairs. It is unclear whether this mandate would apply to repairs such asthose at issue here. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 650.155 (1991).Many, but not all, of the statutes exclude from the computation of repaircost the value of certain components--typically items such as glass, tires,wheels and bumpers--when they are replaced with identical manufacturer's original equipment. E. g., Cal. Veh. Code Ann. $$ 9990-9991 (WestSupp. 1996); Ga. Code Ann. $$ 40-1-5(b)-(e) (1994); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815,$ 710/5 (1994); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 190.0491(5) (Baldwin 1988); Okla.

See Bonaparte v. TaxCourt, 104 U. S. 592, 594 (1881) ("No State can legislateexcept with reference to its own jurisdiction. . . .

S. 624, 643 (1982).We think it follows from these principles of state sovereignty and comity that a State may not impose economicsanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changingthe tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States.17 Before thisCourt Dr. Gore argued that the large punitive damagesaward was necessary to induce BMW to change the nationwide policy that it adopted in 1983.18 But by attempting toalter BMW's nationwide policy, Alabama would be infringingon the policy choices of other States. To avoid such en-croachment, the economic penalties that a State such as Alabama inflicts on those who transgress its laws, whether thepenalties take the form of legislatively authorized fines orjudicially imposed punitive damages, must be supported bythe State's interest in protecting its own consumers and itsown economy. Alabama may insist that BMW adhere to aparticular disclosure policy in that State. Alabama does not17 State power may be exercised as much by a jury's application of astate rule of law in a civil lawsuit as by a statute. See New York TimesCo. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 265 (1964) ("The test is not the form inwhich state power has been applied but, whatever the form, whether suchpower has in fact been exercised"); San Diego Building Trades Councilv.

Dr.Gore's interest in altering the nationwide policy stems from his concernthat BMW would not (or could not) discontinue the policy in Alabamaalone. Brief for Respondent 11. "If Alabama were limited to imposingpunitive damages based only on BMW's gain from fraudulent sales in Alabama, the resulting award would have no prospect of protecting Alabamaconsumers from fraud, as it would provide no incentive for BMW to alterthe unitary, national policy of nondisclosure which yielded BMW millionsof dollars in profits." Id., at 23. The record discloses no basis for Dr.Gore's contention that BMW could not comply with Alabama's law withoutchanging its nationwide policy.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT573Cite as: 517 U.

As the Alabama Supreme Court noted, neither thejury nor the trial court was presented with evidence thatany of BMW's out-of-state conduct was unlawful. "The onlytestimony touching the issue showed that approximately 60%of the vehicles that were refinished were sold in states wherefailure to disclose the repair was not an unfair trade practice." Id., at 627, n. 6.20 The Alabama Supreme Courttherefore properly eschewed reliance on BMW's out-of-stateconduct, id., at 628, and based its remitted award solely on19 See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357, 363 (1978) ("To punish aperson because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a dueprocess violation of the most basic sort"). Our cases concerning recidiviststatutes are not to the contrary. Habitual offender statutes permit thesentencing court to enhance a defendant's punishment for a crime in lightof prior convictions, including convictions in foreign jurisdictions. Seee. g., Ala. Code $ 13A-5-9 (1994); Cal. Penal Code Ann. $$ 667.5(f), 668(West Supp. 1996); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 5/33B-1 (1994); N. Y.

A sentencing judgemay even consider past criminal behavior which did not result in a conviction and lawful conduct that bears on the defendant's character and prospects for rehabilitation. Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949). Butwe have never held that a sentencing court could properly punish lawfulconduct. This distinction is precisely the one we draw here. See n. 21,infra.20 Given that the verdict was based in part on out-of-state conduct thatwas lawful where it occurred, we need not consider whether one Statemay properly attempt to change a tortfeasor's unlawful conduct in another State.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT574 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courtconduct that occurred within Alabama.21 The award mustbe analyzed in the light of the same conduct, with consideration given only to the interests of Alabama consumers,rather than those of the entire Nation. When the scope ofthe interest in punishment and deterrence that an Alabamacourt may appropriately consider is properly limited, it isapparent--for reasons that we shall now address--that thisaward is grossly excessive.IIIElementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitu-tional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair noticenot only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose.22 Three guideposts, each of which indicates that BMWdid not receive adequate notice of the magnitude of the sanction that Alabama might impose for adhering to the nondis-closure policy adopted in 1983, lead us to the conclusion that21 Of course, the fact that the Alabama Supreme Court correctly concluded that it was error for the jury to use the number of sales in otherStates as a multiplier in computing the amount of its punitive sanctiondoes not mean that evidence describing out-of-state transactions is irrelevant in a case of this kind. To the contrary, as we stated in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 462, n. 28 (1993),such evidence may be relevant to the determination of the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.22 See Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987) (Ex Post Facto Clauseviolated by retroactive imposition of revised sentencing guidelines thatprovided longer sentence for defendant's crime); Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.

S. 110 (1991) (due process violated because defendant andhis counsel did not have adequate notice that judge might impose deathsentence). The strict constitutional safeguards afforded to criminal defendants are not applicable to civil cases, but the basic protection against"judgments without notice" afforded by the Due Process Clause, Shafferv. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 217 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment),is implicated by civil penalties.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT575Cite as: 517 U.

We discuss these considerations in turn.Degree of ReprehensibilityPerhaps the most important indicium of the reasonable-ness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.23 As the Court statednearly 150 years ago, exemplary damages imposed on adefendant should reflect "the enormity of his offense." Dayv.Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852). See also St. Louis,I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Williams, 251 U. S. 63, 66-67 (1919)(punitive award may not be "wholly disproportioned to theoffense");Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. KelcoDisposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 301 (1989) (O'Connor, J., con-curring in part and dissenting in part) (reviewing court"should examine the gravity of the defendant's conduct andthe harshness of the award of punitive damages").24 Thisprinciple reflects the accepted view that some wrongs aremore blameworthy than others. Thus, we have said that23 "The flagrancy of the misconduct is thought to be the primary consideration in determining the amount of punitive damages." Owen, A Punitive Damages Overview: Functions, Problems and Reform, 39 Vill. L. Rev.363, 387 (1994).24 The principle that punishment should fit the crime "is deeply rootedand frequently repeated in common-law jurisprudence." Solem v. Helm,463 U. S. 277, 284 (1983). See Burkett v. Lanata, 15 La. Ann. 337, 339(1860) (punitive damages should be "commensurate to the nature of theoffence"); Blanchard v. Morris, 15 Ill. 35, 36 (1853) ("[W]e cannot say [theexemplary damages] are excessive under the circumstances; for the proofsshow that threats, violence, and imprisonment, were accompanied by mental fear, torture, and agony of mind"); Louisville & Northern R. Co. v.Brown, 127 Ky. 732, 749, 106 S. W. 795, 799 (1908) ("We are not aware ofany case in which the court has sustained a verdict as large as this oneunless the injuries were permanent").517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT576 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Court"nonviolent crimes are less serious than crimes marked byviolence or the threat of violence." Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S.277, 292-293 (1983). Similarly, "trickery and deceit," TXO,509 U. S., at 462, are more reprehensible than negligence.In TXO, both the West Virginia Supreme Court and the Jus-tices of this Court placed special emphasis on the principlethat punitive damages may not be "grossly out of proportionto the severity of the offense."25 Id., at 453, 462. Indeed,for Justice Kennedy, the defendant's intentional malicewas the decisive element in a "close and difficult" case.Id.,at 468.26In this case, none of the aggravating factors associatedwith particularly reprehensible conduct is present. Theharm BMW inflicted on Dr. Gore was purely economic innature. The presale refinishing of the car had no effect onits performance or safety features, or even its appearancefor at least nine months after his purchase. BMW's conductevinced no indifference to or reckless disregard for thehealth and safety of others. To be sure, infliction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through af-firmative acts of misconduct,id., at 453, or when the targetis financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty.But this observation does not convert all acts that causeeconomic harm into torts that are sufficiently reprehensibleto justify a significant sanction in addition to compensatorydamages.Dr. Gore contends that BMW's conduct was particularlyreprehensible because nondisclosure of the repairs to his carformed part of a nationwide pattern of tortious conduct.Certainly, evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engagedin prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that itwas unlawful would provide relevant support for an argu25 Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 22 (1991).26 The dissenters also recognized that "TXO's conduct was clearlywrongful, calculated, and improper . . . ." TXO, 509 U. S., at 482 (opinionof O'Connor, J.).517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT577Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtment that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant'sdisrespect for the law. See id., at 462, n. 28. Our holdingsthat a recidivist may be punished more severely than a firstoffender recognize that repeated misconduct is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance. SeeGryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948).In support of his thesis, Dr. Gore advances two arguments.First, he asserts that the state disclosure statutes supple-ment, rather than supplant, existing remedies for breach ofcontract and common-law fraud. Thus, according to Dr.Gore, the statutes may not properly be viewed as immunizing from liability the nondisclosure of repairs costing lessthan the applicable statutory threshold. Brief for Respondent 18-19. Second, Dr. Gore maintains that BMW shouldhave anticipated that its failure to disclose similar repairwork could expose it to liability for fraud. Id., at 4-5.We recognize, of course, that only state courts may authoritatively construe state statutes. As far as we are aware,at the time this action was commenced no state court hadexplicitly addressed whether its State's disclosure statuteprovides a safe harbor for nondisclosure of presumptivelyminor repairs or should be construed instead as supplement-ing common-law duties.27 A review of the text of the stat27 In Jeter v. M & M Dodge, Inc., 634 So. 2d 1383 (La. App. 1994), aLouisiana Court of Appeals suggested that the Louisiana disclosure statute functions as a safe harbor. Finding that the cost of repairing presaledamage to the plaintiff's car exceeded the statutory disclosure threshold,the court held that the disclosure statute did not provide a defense to theaction. Id., at 1384.During the pendency of this litigation, Alabama enacted a disclosurestatute which defines "material" damage to a new car as damage requiringrepairs costing in excess of 3 percent of suggested retail price or $500,whichever is greater. Ala. Code $ 8-19-5(22) (1993). After its decisionin this case, the Alabama Supreme Court stated in dicta that the remediesavailable under this section of its Deceptive Trade Practices Act did notdisplace or alter pre-existing remedies available under either the commonlaw or other statutes. Hines v. Riverside Chevrolet-Olds, Inc., 655 So.2d 909, 917, n. 2 (1994). It refused, however, to "recognize, or impose on517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT578 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courtutes, however, persuades us that in the absence of a state-court determination to the contrary, a corporate executivecould reasonably interpret the disclosure requirements as es-tablishing safe harbors. In California, for example, the disclosure statute defines "material" damage to a motor vehicleas damage requiring repairs costing in excess of 3 percentof the suggested retail price or $500, whichever is greater.Cal. Veh. Code Ann. $ 9990 (West Supp. 1996). The Illinoisstatute states that in cases in which disclosure is not re-quired, "nondisclosure does not constitute a misrepresentation or omission of fact." Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, $ 710/5(1994).28 Perhaps the statutes may also be interpreted inanother way. We simply emphasize that the record containsno evidence that BMW's decision to follow a disclosure policythat coincided with the strictest extant state statute wassufficiently reprehensible to justify a $2 million award ofpunitive damages.automobile manufacturers, a general duty to disclose every repair of damage, however slight, incurred during the manufacturing process." Id., at921. Instead, it held that whether a defendant has a duty to disclose is aquestion of fact "for the jury to determine." Id., at 918. In reachingthat conclusion it overruled two earlier decisions that seemed to indicatethat as a matter of law there was no disclosure obligation in cases comparable to this one. Id., at 920 (overruling Century 21-Reeves Realty, Inc.v. McConnell Cadillac, Inc., 626 So. 2d 1273 (1993), and Cobb v. SoutheastToyota Distributors, Inc., 569 So. 2d 395 (1990)).28 See also Ariz.

S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the CourtDr. Gore's second argument for treating BMW as a recidi-vist is that the company should have anticipated that its actions would be considered fraudulent in some, if not all, juris-dictions. This contention overlooks the fact that actionablefraud requires a material misrepresentation or omission.29This qualifier invites line-drawing of just the sort engagedin by States with disclosure statutes and by BMW. We donot think it can be disputed that there may exist minor im-perfections in the finish of a new car that can be repaired (orindeed, left unrepaired) without materially affecting thecar's value.30 There is no evidence that BMW acted in badfaith when it sought to establish the appropriate line be-tween presumptively minor damage and damage requiringdisclosure to purchasers. For this purpose, BMW could rea-sonably rely on state disclosure statutes for guidance. Inthis regard, it is also significant that there is no evidencethat BMW persisted in a course of conduct after it had beenadjudged unlawful on even one occasion, let alone repeatedoccasions.31Finally, the record in this case discloses no deliberate falsestatements, acts of affirmative misconduct, or concealment ofevidence of improper motive, such as were present in Haslipand TXO. Haslip, 499 U. S., at 5; TXO, 509 U. S., at 453.We accept, of course, the jury's finding that BMW suppressed29 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 538 (1977); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts $ 108 (5thed. 1984).30 The Alabama Supreme Court has held that a car may be considered"new" as a matter of law even if its finish contains minor cosmetic flaws.Wilburn v. Larry Savage Chevrolet, Inc., 477 So. 2d 384 (1985). We notealso that at trial respondent only introduced evidence of undisclosed paintdamage to new cars repaired at a cost of $300 or more. This decisionsuggests that respondent believed that the jury might consider somerepairs too de minimis to warrant disclosure.31 Before the verdict in this case, BMW had changed its policy with respect to Alabama and two other States. Five days after the jury award,BMW altered its nationwide policy to one of full disclosure.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT580 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courta material fact which Alabama law obligated it to communi-cate to prospective purchasers of repainted cars in thatState. But the omission of a material fact may be less rep-rehensible than a deliberate false statement, particularlywhen there is a good-faith basis for believing that no duty todisclose exists.That conduct is sufficiently reprehensible to give rise totort liability, and even a modest award of exemplary damages does not establish the high degree of culpability thatwarrants a substantial punitive damages award. Becausethis case exhibits none of the circumstances ordinarily asso-ciated with egregiously improper conduct, we are persuadedthat BMW's conduct was not sufficiently reprehensible towarrant imposition of a $2 million exemplary damagesaward.RatioThe second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium ofan unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is itsratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff. See TXO,509 U. S., at 459;Haslip, 499 U. S., at 23. The principle thatexemplary damages must bear a "reasonable relationship" tocompensatory damages has a long pedigree.32 Scholars haveidentified a number of early English statutes authorizing the32 See, e. g., Grant v. McDonogh, 7 La. Ann. 447, 448 (1852) ("[E]xemplary damages allowed should bear some proportion to the real damagesustained"); Saunders v. Mullen, 66 Iowa 728, 729, 24 N. W. 529 (1885)("When the actual damages are so small, the amount allowed as exemplarydamages should not be so large"); Flannery v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,15 D. C. 111, 125 (1885) (when punitive damages award "is out of all proportion to the injuries received, we feel it our duty to interfere"); Houston &Texas Central R. Co. v. Nichols, 9 Am. & Eng. R. R. Cas. 361, 365 (Tex.1882) ("Exemplary damages, when allowed, should bear proportion to theactual damages sustained"); McCarthy v. Niskern, 22 Minn. 90, 91-92(1875) (punitive damages "enormously in excess of what may justly beregarded as compensation" for the injury must be set aside "to preventinjustice").517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT581Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtaward of multiple damages for particular wrongs. Some 65different enactments during the period between 1275 and1753 provided for double, treble, or quadruple damages.33Our decisions in both Haslip and TXO endorsed the proposition that a comparison between the compensatory award andthe punitive award is significant.In Haslip we concluded that even though a punitive dam-ages award of "more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages" might be "close to the line," it did not "crossthe line into the area of constitutional impropriety." 499U. S., at 23-24. TXO, following dicta in Haslip, refined thisanalysis by confirming that the proper inquiry is " `whetherthere is a reasonable relationship between the punitivedamages award and the harm likely to result from thedefendant's conduct as well as the harm that actually hasoccurred.' " TXO, 509 U. S., at 460 (emphasis in original),quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 21. Thus, in upholding the $10million award in TXO, we relied on the difference betweenthat figure and the harm to the victim that would have en-sued if the tortious plan had succeeded. That differencesuggested that the relevant ratio was not more than 10 to 1.3433 Owen, supra n. 23, at 368, and n. 23. One English statute, for example, provides that officers arresting persons out of their jurisdiction shallpay double damages. 3 Edw., I., ch. 35. Another directs that in an actionfor forcible entry or detainer, the plaintiff shall recover treble damages.8 Hen. VI, ch. 9, $ 6.Present-day federal law allows or mandates imposition of multiple damages for a wide assortment of offenses, including violations of the antitrustlaws, see $ 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 15,and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, see 18U. S.

C. $ 284.34 "While petitioner stresses the shocking disparity between the punitiveaward and the compensatory award, that shock dissipates when one considers the potential loss to respondents, in terms of reduced or eliminatedroyalties payments, had petitioner succeeded in its illicit scheme.

GOREOpinion of the CourtThe $2 million in punitive damages awarded to Dr. Goreby the Alabama Supreme Court is 500 times the amount ofhis actual harm as determined by the jury.35 Moreover,there is no suggestion that Dr. Gore or any other BMW purchaser was threatened with any additional potential harm byBMW's nondisclosure policy. The disparity in this case isthus dramatically greater than those considered in HaslipandTXO.36Of course, we have consistently rejected the notion thatthe constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematicalformula, even one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award. TXO, 509 U. S., at 458.37 In-deed, low awards of compensatory damages may properlysupport a higher ratio than high compensatory awards, if,for example, a particularly egregious act has resulted in onlya small amount of economic damages. A higher ratio mayalso be justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detector the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have beendifficult to determine. It is appropriate, therefore, to reiterate our rejection of a categorical approach. Once again, "wereturn to what we said . . . inHaslip: `We need not, andtween $5 million and $8.3 million, but is closer to $4 million, or $2 million,or even $1 million, the disparity between the punitive award and the potential harm does not, in our view, `jar one's constitutional sensibilities.' "TXO, 509 U. S., at 462, quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18.35 Even assuming each repainted BMW suffers a diminution in value ofapproximately $4,000, the award is 35 times greater than the total damages of all 14 Alabama consumers who purchased repainted BMW's.36 The ratio here is also dramatically greater than any award that wouldbe permissible under the statutes and proposed statutes summarized in theappendix to Justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion. Post, at 615-616.37 Conceivably the Alabama Supreme Court's selection of a 500-to-1 ratiowas an application of Justice Scalia's identification of one possible reading of the plurality opinion in TXO: Any future due process challenge toa punitive damages award could be disposed of with the simple observation that "this is no worse than TXO." 509 U. S., at 472 (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment). As we explain in the text, this award issignificantly worse than the award in TXO.517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT583Cite as: 517 U. S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtindeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line betweenthe constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say, however,that [a] general concer[n] of reasonableness . . . properly enter[s] into the constitutional calculus.' " Id., at 458 (quotingHaslip, 499 U. S., at 18). In most cases, the ratio will bewithin a constitutionally acceptable range, and remittiturwill not be justified on this basis. When the ratio is abreathtaking 500 to 1, however, the award must surely "raisea suspicious judicial eyebrow." TXO, 509 U. S., at 481(O'Connor, J., dissenting).Sanctions for Comparable MisconductComparing the punitive damages award and the civil orcriminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct provides a third indicium of excessiveness. As Justice O'Connor has correctly observed, a reviewing courtengaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should "accord `substantial deference' tolegislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions forthe conduct at issue." Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S., at 301 (opinion concur-ring in part and dissenting in part). In Haslip, 499 U. S., at23, the Court noted that although the exemplary award was"much in excess of the fine that could be imposed," imprisonment was also authorized in the criminal context.38 In this38 Although the Court did not address the size of the punitive damagesaward in Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984), the dissenters commented on its excessive character, noting that the "$10 million[punitive damages award] that the jury imposed is 100 times greater thanthe maximum fine that may be imposed . . . for a single violation of federalstandards" and "more than 10 times greater than the largest single finethat the Commission has ever imposed." Id., at 263 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), theCourt observed that the punitive award for libel was "one thousand timesgreater than the maximum fine provided by the Alabama criminal statute," and concluded that the "fear of damage awards under a rule such as517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT584 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREOpinion of the Courtcase the $2 million economic sanction imposed on BMW issubstantially greater than the statutory fines available inAlabama and elsewhere for similar malfeasance.The maximum civil penalty authorized by the AlabamaLegislature for a violation of its Deceptive Trade PracticesAct is $2,000;39 other States authorize more severe sanctions,with the maxima ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.40 Signifi-cantly, some statutes draw a distinction between first offenders and recidivists; thus, in New York the penalty is $50 fora first offense and $250 for subsequent offenses. None ofthese statutes would provide an out-of-state distributor withfair notice that the first violation--or, indeed the first 14 violations--of its provisions might subject an offender to amultimillion dollar penalty. Moreover, at the time BMW'spolicy was first challenged, there does not appear to havebeen any judicial decision in Alabama or elsewhere indicating that application of that policy might give rise to suchsevere punishment.The sanction imposed in this case cannot be justified onthe ground that it was necessary to deter future misconductwithout considering whether less drastic remedies could beexpected to achieve that goal. The fact that a multimilliondollar penalty prompted a change in policy sheds no light onthe question whether a lesser deterrent would have ade-quately protected the interests of Alabama consumers. Inthat invoked by the Alabama courts here may be markedly more inhibitingthan the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute." Id., at 277.39 Ala. Code $ 8-19-11(b) (1993).40 See, e. g., Ark.

S. 559 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthe absence of a history of noncompliance with known statu-tory requirements, there is no basis for assuming that a moremodest sanction would not have been sufficient to motivatefull compliance with the disclosure requirement imposed bythe Alabama Supreme Court in this case.IVWe assume, as the juries in this case and in the Yates casefound, that the undisclosed damage to the new BMW's affected their actual value. Notwithstanding the evidence ad-duced by BMW in an effort to prove that the repainted carsconformed to the same quality standards as its other cars,we also assume that it knew, or should have known, that astime passed the repainted cars would lose their attractiveappearance more rapidly than other BMW's. Moreover, weof course accept the Alabama courts' view that the stateinterest in protecting its citizens from deceptive tradepractices justifies a sanction in addition to the recovery ofcompensatory damages. We cannot, however, accept theconclusion of the Alabama Supreme Court that BMW's con-duct was sufficiently egregious to justify a punitive sanctionthat is tantamount to a severe criminal penalty.The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than animpecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement tofair notice of the demands that the several States impose onthe conduct of its business. Indeed, its status as an activeparticipant in the national economy implicates the federalinterest in preventing individual States from imposing undueburdens on interstate commerce. While each State hasample power to protect its own consumers, none may usethe punitive damages deterrent as a means of imposing itsregulatory policies on the entire Nation.As inHaslip, we are not prepared to draw a bright linemarking the limits of a constitutionally acceptable punitivedamages award. Unlike that case, however, we are fullyconvinced that the grossly excessive award imposed in this517US2$52I 02-07-99 18:49:46 PAGES OPINPGT586 BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. GOREBreyer, J., concurringcase transcends the constitutional limit.41 Whether the ap-propriate remedy requires a new trial or merely an independent determination by the Alabama Supreme Court ofthe award necessary to vindicate the economic interests ofAlabama consumers is a matter that should be addressed bythe state court in the first instance.The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
