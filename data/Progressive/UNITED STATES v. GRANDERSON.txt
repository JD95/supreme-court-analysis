This case presents a question of statutory interpretationregarding revocation of a federal sentence of probation.The law at issue provides that if a person serving a sentenceof probation possesses illegal drugs, "the court shall revokethe sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to notless than one-third of the original sentence." 18 U. S. C.$ 3565(a). Congress did not further define the critical term"original sentence," nor are those words, unmodified, usedelsewhere in the Federal Criminal Code chapter on sen-tencing. Embedded in that context, the words "originalsentence" in $ 3565(a) are susceptible to at least threeinterpretations.Read in isolation, the provision could be taken to mean thereimposition of a sentence of probation, for a period not lessthan one-third of the original sentence of probation. Thisconstruction, however, is implausible, and has been urged byneither party, for it would generally demand no increasedsanction, plainly not what Congress intended.The Government, petitioner here, reads the provision todraw the time period from the initially imposed sentence ofprobation, but to require incarceration, not renewed proba-tion, for not less than one-third of that period. On the Government's reading, accepted by the District Court, respond-ent Granderson would face a 20-month mandatory minimumsentence of imprisonment.Granderson maintains that "original sentence" refers tothe sentence of incarceration he could have received initially,*Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the AmericanBar Association by R.

We therefore adopt Grand-erson's interpretation and affirm the judgment of the Courtof Appeals.IGranderson, a letter carrier, pleaded guilty to one countof destruction of mail, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1703(a).Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the potential imprisonment range, derived from the character of the offense andthe offender's criminal history category, was 0-6 months.The District Court imposed no prison time, but sentencedGranderson to five years' probation and a $2,000 fine.3 As astandard condition of probation, Granderson was required tosubmit periodically to urinary testing for illegal drug use.Several weeks after his original sentencing, Grandersontested positive for cocaine, and his probation officer petitioned for revocation of the sentence of probation. Findingthat Granderson had possessed cocaine, the District Courtrevoked Granderson's sentence of probation and undertookto resentence him, pursuant to $ 3565(a), to incarceration for"not less than one-third of the original sentence." The term"original sentence," the District Court concluded, referredto the term of probation actually imposed (60 months) ratherthan the imprisonment range authorized by the Guidelines(0-6 months). The court accordingly sentenced Grandersonto 20 months' imprisonment.The Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of the sentence of probation but vacated Granderson's new sentence.969 F. 2d 980 (CA11 1992). That court observed that theprobation revocation sentence of 20 months' imprisonmentimposed by the District Court was far longer than the sen3 The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, for the first time, classified probation as a sentence; before 1984, probation had been considered an alternative to a sentence.

In-voking the rule of lenity, 969 F. 2d, at 983, the court concluded that the phrase "original sentence" referred to "the[0-6 month] sentence of incarceration faced by Grandersonunder the Guidelines," not to the 60-month sentence ofprobation,id., at 984. Because Granderson had served 11months of his revocation sentence--more than the 6-monthmaximum--the Court of Appeals ordered him released fromcustody. Id., at 985.IIThe text of $ 3565(a) reads:"If the defendant violates a condition of probation at anytime prior to the expiration or termination of the termof probation, the court may . . ."(1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term or modifying [or] enlarging the condi-tions; or"(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose anyother sentence that was available . . . at the time of theinitial sentencing."Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, ifa defendant is found by the court to be in possession ofa controlled substance . . . the court shall revoke thesentence of probation and sentence the defendant to notless than one-third of the original sentence." (Empha-sis added.)The Government argues that the italicized proviso isunambiguous. The "original sentence" that establishes the511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:27 PAGES OPINPGT45Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)Opinion of the Courtbenchmark for the revocation sentence, the Government as-serts, can only be the very sentence actually imposed,i. e.,the sentence of probation. In this case, the sentence of pro-bation was 60 months; "one-third of the original sentence"is thus 20 months. But for two reasons, the Governmentcontinues, Granderson's 20-month revocation sentence mustbe one of imprisonment rather than probation. First, thecontrast in subsections (1) and (2) between "continu[ing]"and "revok[ing]" probation suggests that a revocation sentence must be a sentence of imprisonment, not a continuationof probation. Second, the Government urges, it would beabsurd to "punish" drug-possessing probationers by revok-ing their probation and imposing a new term of probation nolonger than the original. Congress could not be taken tohave selected drug possessors, from the universe of all pro-bation violators, for more favorable treatment, the Government reasons, particularly not under a provision enacted aspart of a statute called "The Anti-Drug Abuse Act."We agree, for the reasons stated by the Government, thata revocation sentence must be a term of imprisonment. Otherwise the proviso at issue would make little sense.4 We donot agree, however, that the term "original sentence" relatesto the duration of the sentence set for probation. The statute provides that if a probationer possesses drugs, "the court4 Justice Kennedy's novel interpretation would authorize revocationsentences under which drug possessors could profit from their violations.The present case is an example. The District Court determined, just over4 months into Granderson's 60-month sentence of probation, that Granderson had violated his conditions of probation by possessing drugs. If Justice Kennedy were correct that the proviso allows a revocation sentenceof probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation originally imposed, then the District Court could have "punished" Granderson for hiscocaine possession by reducing his period of probation from 60 months tojust over 24 months. Justice Kennedy's interpretation would presenta similar anomaly whenever the drug-possessing probationer has servedless than two-thirds of the sentence of probation initially imposed. Surelysuch an interpretation is implausible.511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:27 PAGES OPINPGT46 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSONOpinion of the Courtshall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the de-fendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence."This language appears to differentiate, not to equate or amal-gamate, "the sentence of probation" and "the original sentence." See United States v. Penn, 17 F. 3d 70, 73 (CA41994) ("a sentence of probation does not equate to a sentenceof incarceration"). If Congress wished to convey the meaning pressed by the Government, it could easily have in-structed that the defendantbe incarcerated for a term "notless than one-third of the original sentence of probation," or"not less than one-third of the revoked term of probation."The Government's interpretation has a further textual difficulty. The Government reads the word "sentence," whenused as a verb in the proviso's phrase "sentence the defendant," to mean "sentence to imprisonment" rather than "sentence to probation." Yet, when the word "sentence" nextappears, this time as a noun ("original sentence"), the Government reads the word to mean "sentence of probation."Again, had Congress designed the language to capture theGovernment's construction, the proviso might have read:"[T]he court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment whose lengthis not less than one-third the length of the original sentenceof probation." Cf. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170,177 (1993) ("it seems reasonable to give . . . a similar construction" to a word used as both a noun and a verb in asingle statutory sentence).As the Court of Appeals commented, "[p]robation and imprisonment are not fungible"; they are sentences fundamentally different in character. 969 F. 2d, at 984. One-third ofa 60-month term of probation or "conditional liberty" is asentence scarcely resembling a 20-month sentence of imprisonment. The Government insists and, as already noted, weagree, that the revocation sentence, measured as one-third ofthe "original sentence," must be a sentence of imprisonment.But that "must be" suggests that "original sentence" refers511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:27 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe resentencer back to an anterior sentence of imprison-ment, not a sentence of probation.IIIGranderson's reading of the $ 3565(a) proviso entails sucha reference back. The words "original sentence," he contends, refer back to $ 3565(a)(2), the prescription immediatelypreceding the drug-possession proviso: the "other sentencethat was available under subchapter A [the general sentenc-ing provisions] at the time of the initial sentencing." TheGuidelines sentence of imprisonment authorized by subchap-ter A was the "original sentence," Granderson argues, for itwas the presumptive sentence, the punishment that proba-tion, as a discretionary alternative, replaced. The Guidelines range of imprisonment available at Granderson's initialsentencing for destruction of mail was 0-6 months. Starting at the top of this range, Granderson arrives at twomonths as the minimum revocation sentence.AGranderson's interpretation avoids linguistic anomaliespresented by the Government's construction. First, Granderson's reading differentiates, as does the proviso, between"the sentence of probation" that the resentencer must revokeand "the original sentence" that determines the duration ofthe revocation sentence. See supra, at 46. Second, Granderson's construction keeps constant the meaning of "sen-tence" in the phrases "sentence the defendant" and "originalsentence." See ibid. While the Government cannot easilyexplain how multiplying a sentenceof probation by one-thirdcan yield a sentence of imprisonment, Granderson's construction encounters no such shoal. See Gordon, 961 F. 2d,at 433 ("one-third of three years probation is one year probation, not one year imprisonment").55 The dissent notes that the term "original sentence" has been used in anumber of this Court's opinions and in other statutes and rules, in eachinstance to refer to a sentence actually imposed. See post, at 72-73, and511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT48 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSONOpinion of the CourtGranderson's reading of the proviso also avoids the star-tling disparities in sentencing that would attend the Government's interpretation. A 20-month minimum sentencewould exceed not only the 6-month maximum punishmentunder the Guidelines for Granderson's original offense; itwould also exceed the 1-year statutory maximum, see 21U. S. C. $ 844(a), that Granderson could have received, hadthe Government prosecuted him for cocaine possession andafforded him the full constitutional protections of a criminaltrial, rather than the limited protections of a revocationhearing.6 Indeed, a 20-month sentence would exceed con-secutive sentences for destruction of mail and cocaine possession (18 months in all).Furthermore, 20 months is only theminimum revocationsentence, on the Government's reading of the proviso. TheGovernment's interpretation would have allowed the Dis-trict Court to sentence Granderson to a term of imprisonment equal in length to the revoked term of probation. Thisprison term--five years--would be 10 times the exposure toimprisonment Granderson faced under the Guidelines for hisnn. 4-5. None of those cases, statutes, or rules, however, involves aninterpretive problem such as the one presented here, where, if the "original sentence" is the sentence actually imposed, a "plain meaning" interpretation of the proviso leads to an absurd result. See supra, at 41, 45, andn. 4.The dissent observes, further, that other federal sentencing provisions"us[e] the word `sentence' to refer to the punishment actually imposed ona defendant." Post, at 71, n. 2. In each of the cited instances, however,this reference is made clear by context, either by specifying the type ofsentence (e. g., "sentence to pay a fine," "sentence to probation," 18 U. S. C.$ 3551(c)), or by using a variant of the phrase "impose sentence" (see$$ 3553(a), (b), (c), (e); 3554-3558).6 At a revocation hearing, in contrast to a full-scale criminal trial, thematter is tried to the court rather than a jury; also, the standard of proofhas been held to be less stringent than the reasonable-doubt standardapplicable to criminal prosecutions. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3565(a); Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 32.1; United States v. Gordon, 961 F. 2d 426, 429 (CA3 1992)(citing cases).511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 511 U.

It seems unlikely that Congress could have intended so to enlarge the District Court'sdiscretion. See Penn, 17 F. 3d, at 73.7BTwo of the Government's arguments against Granderson'sinterpretation are easily answered. First, the Governmentobserves that the purpose of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act wasto impose tough sanctions on drug abusers. See Brief forUnited States 22-26 (listing new penalties and quoting state-ments from Members of Congress that they intended to punish drug offenders severely). But we cannot divine from thelegislators' many "get tough on drug offenders" statementsany reliable guidance to particular provisions. None of thelegislators' expressions, as the Government admits, focuseson "the precise meaning of the provision at issue in thiscase."Id., at 24, and n. 4; cf. Busic v. United States, 446U. S. 398, 408 (1980) ("[W]hile Congress had a general desireto deter firearm abuses, that desire was not unbounded.Our task here is to locate one of the boundaries, and theinquiry is not advanced by the assertion that Congresswanted no boundaries."). Under Granderson's interpretation, moreover, drug possessors are hardly favored. In7 The dissent suggests that the statutory maximum for the original offense (five years in this case, see 18 U. S. C. $ 1703(a)) is the maximumrevocation sentence. See post, at 77, n. 8. The District Court, however,could not have imposed this sentence originally, without providing "thespecific reason" for departing from the Guidelines range, 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(c), and explaining in particular why "an aggravating . . . circumstance [exists,] of a kind, or to a degree, [that was] not adequately takeninto consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating theguidelines . . . ." $ 3553(b). Upward departures from the presumptiveGuidelines range to the statutory maximum are thus appropriate only inexceptional cases. See infra, at 56, n. 14. The dissent's interpretation,however, would allow district courts to impose the statutory maximum asa revocation sentence in the routine exercise of their ordinary discretion.511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT50 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSONOpinion of the Courtstead, they are singled out among probation violators forparticularly adverse treatment: They face mandatory, ratherthan optional, terms of imprisonment.Next, the Government argues that the drug-possessionproviso must be construed in pari materia with the parallelprovision, added at the same time, governing revocation ofsupervised release upon a finding of drug possession. In thelatter provision, the Government observes, Congress ordered a revocation sentence of "not less than one-third of theterm of supervised release," and it expressly provided thatthe revocation sentence should be "serve[d] in prison." 18U. S. C. $ 3583(g). Correspondingly, the Government maintains, the probation revocation proviso should be construedto require a minimum prison term of one-third the term ofprobation. The Government acknowledges that, while Con-gress spelled out "one-third of the term of supervised release," Congress did not similarly say "one-third of the termof probation." However, the Government attributes thisdifference to the fact that, unlike probation under the cur-rent sentencing regime, supervised release is not itself an"original sentence," it is only a component of a sentence thatcommences with imprisonment.We are not persuaded that the supervised release revocation prescription should control construction of the probationrevocation proviso. Supervised release, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in lieu of incarceration. Personsserving postincarceration terms of supervised release generally are more serious offenders than are probationers. Butterms of supervised release, because they follow up prisonterms, are often shorter than initial sentences of probation.88 A probation term of 1-5 years is available for Class C and D felonies;the corresponding term of supervised release is not more than 3 years.For Class E felonies, a 1-5 year probation term is available, but not morethan a 1-year term of supervised release. For misdemeanors, a probationterm of not more than 5 years is available; the corresponding term of511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThus, under the Government's in pari materia approach,drug possessors whose original offense warranted the moreserious sanction of prison plus supervised release wouldoften receive shorter revocation sentences than would drugpossessing probationers.The Government counters that Congress might have intended to punish probationers more severely because theywere "extended special leniency." Reply Brief for UnitedStates 13, n. 14. A sentence of probation, however, even if"lenient," ordinarily reflects the judgment that the offenseand offender's criminal history were not so serious as to war-rant imprisonment. In sum, probationsans imprisonmentand supervised release following imprisonment are sentencesof unlike character. This fact weighs heavily against the argument that the discrete, differently worded probation andsupervised release revocation provisions should be construedin pari materia. CThe history of the probation revocation proviso's enact-ment gives us additional cause to resist the Government'sinterpretation. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act, in which the pro-viso was included, was a large and complex measure, described by one Member of the House of Representatives as"more like a telephone book than a piece of legislation." 134Cong. Rec. 33290 (1988) (remarks of Rep. Conte). The proviso seems first to have appeared in roughly its present formas a Senate floor amendment offered after both the Houseand the Senate had passed the bill. See id., at 24924-24925(House passage, Sept. 22);id., at 30826 (Senate passage, Oct.14); id., at 30945 (proviso included in lengthy set of amend-ments proposed by Sen. Nunn, Oct. 14). No conference report addresses the provision, nor are we aware of any postsupervised release is not more than 1 year. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 3561(b),3583(b).511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT52 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSONOpinion of the Courtconference discussion of the issue.9 The proviso thus seemsto have been inserted into the Anti-Drug Abuse Act withoutclose inspection. Cf. United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,344 (1971) (applying rule of lenity, noting that statutory provision "was a last-minute Senate amendment" to a long andcomplex bill and "was hastily passed, with little discussion,no hearings, and no report").Another probation-related provision of the Anti-DrugAbuse Act, proposed shortly before the proviso, casts furtherdoubt on the Government's reading. That provision amendsthe prohibition against using or carrying an explosive in thecommission of a federal felony, to provide in part: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not placeon probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection . . . ." Pub. L. 100-690, $ 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4380, codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 844(h)(emphasis added). This provision, notwithstanding its 1988date of enactment, is intelligible only under pre-1984 law:The 1984 Sentencing Reform Act had abolished suspendedsentences, and the phrase "place on probation" had yieldedto the phrase "impose a sentence of probation."Granderson's counsel suggested at oral argument, see Tr.of Oral Arg. 22-23, 29-31, 36-41, that the proviso's draftersmight similarly have had in mind the pre-1984 sentencingregime, in particular, the pre-1984 practice of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, suspending its execution, and placingthe defendant on probation. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3651 (1982)(for any offense "not punishable by death or life imprison9 Debate over the conference bill took place in the middle of the night,see 134 Cong.

See id., at 32707 (Senate); id., at 33236 (House).511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)Opinion of the Courtment," the court may "suspend the imposition or executionof sentence and place the defendant on probation for suchperiod and upon such terms and conditions as the courtdeems best"). The proviso would fit the suspension-ofexecution scheme precisely: The "original sentence" wouldbe the sentence imposed but not executed, and one-third ofthat determinate sentence would be the revocation sentence.In that application, the proviso would avoid incongruitiespresented in Granderson's and the Government's interpretations of the words "original sentence": An imposed, albeitunexecuted, term of imprisonment would be an actual, ratherthan a merely available, sentence, and one-third of thatsentence would be a term of imprisonment, not probation.If Granderson could demonstrate that the proviso's drafters in fact drew the prescription to match the pre-1984suspension-of-execution scheme, Granderson's argumentwould be all the more potent: The closest post-1984 analogueto the suspended sentence is the Guidelines sentence of imprisonment that could have been implemented, but was heldback in favor of a probation sentence.10We cannot say with assurance that the proviso's drafterschose the term "original sentence" with a view toward pre1984 law.11 The unexacting process by which the provisowas enacted, however, and the evident anachronism in another probation-related section of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act,leave us doubtful that it was Congress' design to punishdrug-possessing probationers with the extraordinarily disproportionate severity the Government urges.10 See Cunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain Meaning and HardCases, 103 Yale L. J. 1561, 1579-1581 (1994).11 The chief difficulty with such an interpretation is that pre-1984 lawrecognized two kinds of suspended sentences, each of which could lead toprobation. While suspension of the execution of sentence, as mentioned,neatly fits Granderson's theory, suspension of the imposition of sentencefits the theory less well: In that situation, no determinate "original sentence" would be at hand for precise calculation of the revocation sentence.511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT54 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSONOpinion of the CourtIn these circumstances--where text, structure, and his-tory fail to establish that the Government's position is unambiguously correct--we apply the rule of lenity and resolvethe ambiguity in Granderson's favor. See, e. g., Bass, 404U. S., at 347-349. We decide that the "original sentence"that sets the duration of the revocation sentence is the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment, not the revokedterm of probation.12IVWe turn, finally, to the Government's argument thatGranderson's theory, and the Court of Appeals' analysis, arefatally flawed because the Guidelines specify not a term but arange--in this case, 0-6 months. Calculating the minimumrevocation sentence as one-third of that range, the manda-tory minimum term of imprisonment would be 0-2 months,the Government asserts, which would permit a perverse re-sult: A resentencing court could revoke a drug possessor'ssentence of probation, and then impose no sentence at all.Recognizing this curiosity, lower courts have used not 0-6months as their starting place, but the top of that range, as12 Justice Kennedy suggests that our interpretation of the proviso"read[s] a criminal statute against a criminal defendant," post, at 67, andthat to the extent the rule of lenity is applicable, it would "deman[d] theinterpretation" advanced in his opinion--that the proviso establishes amandatory minimum sentence of probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation initially imposed, post, at 69. We note that Granderson, the criminal defendant in this case, does not urge the interpretationJustice Kennedy presents. More to the point, both of Justice Kennedy's assertions presuppose that his interpretation of the proviso is apermissible one. For reasons set out above, we think it is not. Seesupra, at 45, and n. 4.Justice Scalia suggests that on our interpretation of the proviso, themandatory minimum revocation sentence should include a fine as well asa term of imprisonment. See post, at 58. The term of probation, however, was imposed in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment, not in lieu of afine. Revocation of the sentence of probation, we think, implies replacingthe sentence of probation with a sentence of imprisonment, but does notrequire changing an unrevoked sentence earlier imposed.511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT55Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe "original sentence," which yields 2 months as the mini-mum revocation sentence. The Government complains thatno court has explained why the top, rather than the middleor the bottom of the range, is the appropriate point ofreference.13The reason for starting at the top of the range, however,is evident: No other solution yields as sensible a response tothe "original sentence" conundrum. Four measures of theminimum revocation sentence could be hypothesized as pos-sibilities, if the applicable Guidelines range is the startingpoint: The sentence could be calculated as (1) one-third ofthe Guidelines maximum, (2) one-third of the Guidelines minimum, (3) one-third of some point between the minimum andmaximum, such as the midpoint, or (4) one-third of the rangeitself. The latter two possibilities can be quickly eliminated.Selecting a point between minimum and maximum, whetherthe midpoint or some other point, would be purely arbitrary.Calculating the minimum revocation sentence as one-third ofthe Guidelines range, in practical application, yields the sameresult as setting the minimum revocation sentence at onethird of the Guidelines minimum: To say, for example, that a2-4 month sentence is the minimum revocation sentence iseffectively to say that a 2-month sentence is the minimum.Using the Guidelines minimum in cases such as the pres-ent one (0-6 month range), as already noted, would yield a13 See United States v. Penn, 17 F. 3d 70 (CA4 1994) (expressly declaringthat the minimum revocation sentence is one-third of the top of the Guidelines range); United States v.

Diaz, 989 F. 2d 391 (CA10 1993) (vacating a revocation sentence that exceeded the top of the original Guidelines range).The Court of Appeals in the present case was not required to identify theminimum term, because Granderson had served five months more than thetop of the Guidelines range by the time the opinion was issued.

GRANDERSONOpinion of the Courtminimum revocation sentence of zero, a result incompatiblewith the apparent objective of the proviso--to assure thatthose whose probation is revoked for drug possession servea term of imprisonment. The maximum Guidelines sentenceas the benchmark for the revocation sentence, on the otherhand, is "a sensible construction" that avoids attributing tothe legislature either "an unjust or an absurd conclusion."In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 667 (1897).14VWe decide, in sum, that the drug-possession proviso of$ 3565(a) establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, but we reject the Government's contention thatthe proviso unambiguously calls for a sentence based on theterm of probation rather than the originally applicableGuidelines range of imprisonment. Granderson's interpretation, if not flawless, is a securely plausible reading of thestatutory language, and it avoids the textual difficulties andsentencing disparities we identified in the Government's position. In these circumstances, in common with the Courtof Appeals, we apply the rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in Granderson's favor. The minimum revocation sentence, we hold, is one-third the maximum of the originally14 The Government observes that "in appropriate circumstances" thesentencing court may depart upward from the presumptive Guidelinesrange, limited in principle only by the statutory maximum. See 18U. S. C. $ 3553(b). According to the Government, it follows that if the"original sentence" is the "maximum available sentence," then the statutory maximum rather than the top of the presumptive Guidelines range isthe appropriate basis for the revocation sentence. Brief for United States22. The short answer to the Government's argument is that for cases inwhich the sentencing judge considers an upward departure warranted, asentence of probation, rather than one of imprisonment, is a most unlikelyprospect. It makes scant sense, then, to assume that an "original sentence" for purposes of probation revocation is a sentence beyond the presumptively applicable Guidelines range.511us1$31P 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT57Cite as: 511 U.

Because Granderson had served 11 months imprisonment by the time the Court of Appeals issued its decision,that court correctly ordered his release. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is therefore
