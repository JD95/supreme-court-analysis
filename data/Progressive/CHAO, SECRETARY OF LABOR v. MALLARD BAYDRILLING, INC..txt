Respondent operates a fleet of barges used for oil and gasexploration. On April 9, 1997, one of those barges, "Rig 52,"was towed to a location in the territorial waters of Louisiana,where it drilled a well over two miles deep. On June 16,1997, when the crew had nearly completed drilling, an explo-sion occurred, killing four members of the crew and injuringtwo others. Under United States Coast Guard regulations,the incident qualified as a "marine casualty" because it involved a commercial vessel operating "upon the navigablewaters of the United States." 46 CFR $ 4.03-1 (2000).Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Coast Guard con-ducted an investigation of the casualty. See 46 U. S. C.$$ 6101-6104, 6301-6308 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).1 The re-sulting report was limited in scope to what the Coast Guarddescribed as "purely vessel issues," and noted that the CoastGuard "does not regulate mineral drilling operations in statewaters, and does not have the expertise to adequately ana-lyze all issues relating to the failure of an oil/natural gaswell." App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. The Coast Guard deter-mined that natural gas had leaked from the well, spreadthroughout the barge, and was likely ignited by sparks in thepump room. The report made factual findings concerningthe crew's actions, but did not accuse respondent of violatingany Coast Guard regulations. Indeed, the report noted the*Jeffrey Robert White and Frederick M.

MALLARD BAY DRILLING, INC.Opinion of the Courtlimits of the Coast Guard's regulation of vessels such as Rig52: The report explained that, although Rig 52 held a CoastGuard Certificate of Documentation, it had "never beeninspected by the Coast Guard and is not required to holda Certificate of Inspection or be inspected by the CoastGuard." Id., at 27a. In Coast Guard terminology, Rig 52was an "uninspected vessel," see 46 U. S. C. $ 2101(43), asopposed to one of the 14 varieties of "inspected vessels" subject to comprehensive Coast Guard regulation, see 46 U. S. C.$ 3301 (1994 ed. and Supp. V).Based largely on information obtained from the CoastGuard concerning this incident, the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) cited respondent for three violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970(OSH Act or Act), 84 Stat. 1590, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 651et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and the Act's implementingregulations. The citations alleged that respondent failedpromptly to evacuate employees on board the drilling rig;failed to develop and implement an emergency response planto handle anticipated emergencies; and failed to train employees in emergency response. No. 97-1973, 1998 WL917067, *1 (OSHRC, Dec. 28, 1998). Respondent did notdeny the charges, but challenged OSHA's jurisdiction toissue the citations on two grounds: that Rig 52 was not a"workplace" within the meaning of $ 4(a) of the Act; 2 andthat $ 4(b)(1) of the Act pre-empted OSHA jurisdiction because the Coast Guard had exclusive authority to prescribe2 Section 4(a) of the Act, as codified in 29 U. S. C. $ 653(a), provides inpart: "This chapter shall apply with respect to employment performed ina workplace in a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth ofPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Wake Island, Outer Continental Shelf landsdefined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Johnston Island, andthe Canal Zone" (citation omitted).534US1 Unit: $U13 [04-10-03 16:05:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN239Cite as: 534 U.

Finding that respondent's "employeeswere not performing navigational-related activities" and thatRig 52 "was stationary and within the territorial boundariesof the State of Louisiana," he concluded that Rig 52 was a"workplace" within the meaning of the Act. Id., at *3. TheALJ then held that the Coast Guard had not pre-emptedOSHA's jurisdiction under $ 4(b)(1), explaining that respondent had identified no basis for an "industry-wide exemptionfrom OSHA regulations" for uninspected vessels, and hadfailed to identify any Coast Guard regulation "specificallyregulat[ing]" the subject matter of the citations. Id., at *4.In the ALJ's view, another federal agency cannot pre-emptOSHA's jurisdiction under $ 4(b)(1) unless that agency exercises its statutory authority to regulate a particular workingcondition: Mere possession of the power to regulate is notenough.4 The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission declined review of the ALJ's decision and issued afinal order assessing a penalty against respondent of $4,410per citation. Id., at *1.3 Section 4(b)(1) of the Act, as codified in 29 U. S.

OSHA jurisdiction will be preempted only as tothose working conditions actually covered by the agency regulations. . . .The OSHA citation alleges that [respondent] failed to evacuate employeesand failed to have an emergency response plan. [Respondent] does notargue or identify any similar requirement enforced by the U. S. CoastGuard."

MALLARD BAY DRILLING, INC.Opinion of the CourtWithout reaching the question whether Rig 52 was a"workplace" under $ 4(a) of the OSH Act, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. It heldthat the Coast Guard "has exclusive jurisdiction over theregulation of working conditions of seamen aboard vesselssuch as [Rig 52], thus precluding OSHA's regulation underSection 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act." 212 F. 3d 898, 900 (2000).The Court of Appeals determined that this pre-emption encompassed uninspected vessels such as Rig 52, as well asinspected ones, explaining that the Coast Guard "has in factexercised" its "authority to issue safety regulations for unin-spected vessels"--as $ 4(b)(1) requires for pre-emption.Id.,at 901 (stating, with respect to uninspected vessels, that theCoast Guard has issued regulations concerning "life preserv-ers and other lifesaving equipment; emergency alerting andlocating equipment; fire extinguishing equipment; backfireflame control; ventilation of tanks and engine spaces; cooking, heating, and lighting systems; safety orientation andemergency instructions; action required after an accident;and signaling lights"). However, the court conceded that"[b]ecause a drilling barge is not self-propelled, some of theseregulations, by their nature, do not apply to [Rig 52]." Id.,at 901, n. 6.Because other Courts of Appeals have construed the pre-emptive force of $ 4(b)(1) more narrowly than did the FifthCircuit, akin to the interpretation adopted by the ALJ inthis case,5 we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 531U. S. 1143 (2001). We reverse, as the statute requires usto do.The OSH Act imposes on covered employers a duty to pro-vide working conditions that "are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious5 See Herman v.

C. $$ 654(a)(1), (2).6 The coverage of theAct does not, however, extend to working conditions that areregulated by other federal agencies. To avoid overlappingregulation, $ 4(b)(1) of the Act, as codified in 29 U. S. C.$ 653(b)(1), provides:"Nothing in this [Act] shall apply to working condi-tions of employees with respect to which other Federalagencies . . . exercise statutory authority to prescribe orenforce standards or regulations affecting occupationalsafety and health." (Emphasis added.)Congress' use of the word "exercise" makes clear that, con-trary to respondent's position, see, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 39,mere possession by another federal agency of unexercisedauthority to regulate certain working conditions is insufficient to displace OSHA's jurisdiction. Furthermore, an-other federal agency's minimal exercise of some authorityover certain conditions on vessels such as Rig 52 does notresult in complete pre-emption of OSHA jurisdiction, because the statute also makes clear that OSHA is only pre-empted if the working conditions at issue are the particularones "with respect to which" another federal agency has reg-ulated, and if such regulations "affec[t] occupational safety orhealth." $ 653(b)(1).7 To determine whether Coast Guard6 The Secretary of Labor has delegated her authority under the Act tothe Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, who headsOSHA. See 65 Fed. Reg. 50017 (2000).7 The Circuits have recognized at least two approaches for defining"working conditions" under $ 4(b)(1). A "hazard-based" approach, whichthe Secretary of Labor endorses, focuses on "the particular physical andenvironmental hazards encountered by an employee" on the job. Brieffor Petitioner 24; see, e. g., Donovan v. Red Star Marine Services, Inc., 739F. 2d, at 779-780. In contrast, an "area-based" approach defines "workingconditions" as the "area in which an employee customarily goes about hisdaily tasks." Southern R. Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review534US1 Unit: $U13 [04-10-03 16:05:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN242 CHAO v. MALLARD BAY DRILLING, INC.Opinion of the Courtregulations have pre-empted OSHA's jurisdiction over theworking conditions on Rig 52, it is thus necessary to examinethe contours of the Coast Guard's exercise of its statutoryauthority, not merely the existence of such authority.Congress has assigned a broad and important mission tothe Coast Guard. Its governing statute provides, in part:"The Coast Guard . . . shall administer laws and promulgate and enforce regulations for the promotion of safetyof life and property on and under the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States covering all matters not specifically delegated by law tosome other executive department . . . ." 14 U. S. C. $ 2(2000 ed.).Under this provision, the Coast Guard possesses authorityto promulgate and enforce regulations promoting the safetyof vessels anchored in state navigable waters, such as Rig 52.As mentioned above, however, in defining the Coast Guard'sregulatory authority, Congress has divided the universe ofvessels into two broad classes: "inspected vessels" and "uninspected vessels." In 46 U. S. C. $ 3301 (1994 ed. and Supp.V), Congress has listed 14 types of vessels that are "subjectto inspection" by the Coast Guard pursuant to a substantial body of rules mandated by Congress.8 In contrast, 46Comm'n, 539 F. 2d 335, 339 (CA4), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 999 (1976). Weneed not choose between these interpretations, however, because theCoast Guard did not regulate the "working conditions" at issue in this caseunder either definition of the term.8 "The following categories of vessels are subject to inspection underthis part: (1) freight vessels. (2) nautical school vessels. (3) offshoresupply vessels. (4) passenger vessels. (5) sailing school vessels. (6)seagoing barges. (7) seagoing motor vessels. (8) small passenger vessels. (9) steam vessels. (10) tank vessels. (11) fish processing vessels.(12) fish tender vessels. (13) Great Lakes barges. (14) oil spill response vessels."534US1 Unit: $U13 [04-10-03 16:05:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN243Cite as: 534 U. S. 235 (2002)Opinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 2101(43) defines an "uninspected vessel" as "avessel not subject to inspection under section 3301 . . . thatis not a recreational vessel."The parties do not dispute that OSHA's regulations havebeen pre-empted with respect to inspected vessels, becausethe Coast Guard has broad statutory authority to regulatethe occupational health and safety of seamen aboard inspected vessels, 46 U. S. C. $ 3306 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), andit has exercised that authority. Indeed, the Coast Guardand OSHA signed a "Memorandum of Understanding"(MOU) on March 17, 1983, evidencing their agreement that,as a result of the Coast Guard's exercise of comprehensiveauthority over inspected vessels, OSHA "may not enforcethe OSH Act with respect to the working conditions of seamen aboard inspected vessels." 48 Fed. Reg. 11365. TheMOU recognizes that the exercise of the Coast Guard's authority--and hence the displacement of OSHA jurisdiction--extends not only to those working conditions on inspectedvessels specifically discussed by Coast Guard regulations,but to all working conditions on inspected vessels, includingthose "not addressed by the specific regulations." Ibid.Thus, as OSHA recognized in the MOU, another agency may"exercise" its authority within the meaning of $ 4(b)(1) of theOSH Act either by promulgating specific regulations or byasserting comprehensive regulatory authority over a certaincategory of vessels.Uninspected vessels such as Rig 52, however, present anentirely different regulatory situation. Nearly all of theCoast Guard regulations responsible for displacing OSHA'sjurisdiction over inspected vessels, as described in the MOU,do not apply to uninspected vessels like Rig 52. See 46U. S. C. $ 2101(43). Rather, in the context of uninspectedvessels, the Coast Guard's regulatory authority--and exercise thereof--is more limited. With respect to uninspectedvessels, the Coast Guard regulates matters related to marine534US1 Unit: $U13 [04-10-03 16:05:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN244 CHAO v. MALLARD BAY DRILLING, INC.Opinion of the Courtsafety, such as fire extinguishers, life preservers, engineflame arrestors, engine ventilation, and emergency locatingequipment. See 46 U. S. C. $ 4102 (1994 ed. and Supp. V);46 CFR pts. 24-26 (2000). Because these general marinesafety regulations do not address the occupational safety andhealth concerns faced by inland drilling operations on uninspected vessels, they do not pre-empt OSHA's authorityunder $ 4(b)(1) in this case. Indeed, as the Court of Appealsacknowledged, many of these general Coast Guard regulations for uninspected vessels do not even apply to stationarybarges like Rig 52. See 212 F. 3d, at 901, n. 6.In addition to issuing these general marine safety regulations, the Coast Guard has exercised its statutory authorityto regulate a number of specific working conditions on certain types of uninspected vessels. For example, the CoastGuard regulates drilling operations that take place on theouter continental shelf. See 43 U. S. C. $ 1333(a)(1); 33 CFRpt. 142 (2000). And it is true that some of these more specific regulations would, pursuant to $ 4(b)(1), pre-empt OSHAregulations covering those particular working conditions andvessels. But respondent has not identified any specificCoast Guard regulations that address the types of risk andvessel at issue in this case: namely, dangers from oil-drillingoperations on uninspected barges in inland waters. Simply because the Coast Guard has engaged in a limited exercise of its authority to address certain working conditionspertaining to certain classes of uninspected vessels doesnot mean that all OSHA regulation of all uninspected vessels has been pre-empted. See 29 U. S. C. $ 653(b)(1) (preemption only extends to working conditions "with respect towhich" other federal agencies have exercised their authority(emphasis added)). Because the Coast Guard has neither affirmatively regulated the working conditions at issue in thiscase, nor asserted comprehensive regulatory jurisdiction534US1 Unit: $U13 [04-10-03 16:05:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN245Cite as: 534 U. S. 235 (2002)Opinion of the Courtover working conditions on uninspected vessels, the CoastGuard has not "exercise[d]" its authority under $ 4(b)(1).9We think it equally clear that Rig 52 was a "workplace" asthat term is defined in $ 4(a) of the Act. The vessel waslocated within the geographic area described in the defini-tion: "a State," 29 U. S. C. $ 653(a), namely, Louisiana. Nothing in the text of $ 4(a) attaches any significance to the factthat the barge was anchored in navigable waters. Rather,the other geographic areas described in $ 4(a) support a read-ing of that provision that includes a State's navigable waters:for example, $ 4(a) covers the Outer Continental Shelf, andsensibly extends to drilling operations attached thereto.Cf. 43 U. S. C. $ 1333(a)(1).Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals isreversed.
