The Piscataqua River lies at the southeastern end ofNew Hampshire's boundary with Maine. The river beginsat the headwaters of Salmon Falls and runs seaward intoPortsmouth Harbor (also known as Piscataqua Harbor). OnMarch 6, 2000, New Hampshire brought this original actionagainst Maine, claiming that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire riverand all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire.Maine has filed a motion to dismiss on the ground thattwo prior proceedings--a 1740 boundary determination byKing George II and a 1977 consent judgment entered by thisCourt--definitively fixed the Piscataqua River boundary atthe middle of the river's main channel of navigation.The 1740 decree located the Piscataqua River boundaryat the "Middle of the River." Because New Hampshire, inthe 1977 proceeding, agreed without reservation that thewords "Middle of the River" mean the middle of the Pis-cataqua River's main channel of navigation, we concludethat New Hampshire is estopped from asserting now thatthe boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, wegrant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.INew Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs fromnorthwest to southeast. At the southeastern end of the532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN746 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINEOpinion of the Courtborder, the easternmost point of New Hampshire meets thesouthernmost point of Maine. The boundary in this regionfollows the Piscataqua River eastward into PortsmouthHarbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly directioninto the sea. Twenty-five years ago, in a dispute betweenthe two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entereda consent judgment fixing the precise location of the "lateralmarine boundary," i. e., the boundary in the marine watersoff the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, from the closingline of Portsmouth Harbor five miles seaward to GosportHarbor in the Isles of Shoals.New Hampshire v. Maine,426 U. S. 363 (1976); New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S. 1, 2(1977). This case concerns the location of the Maine-NewHampshire boundary along the inland stretch of the Pis-cataqua River, from the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor westward to the river's headwaters at Salmon Falls. (A map ofthe region appears as an appendix to this opinion.)In the 1970's contest over the lateral marine boundary,we summarized the history of the interstate boundary in thePiscataqua River region. See New Hampshire v. Maine,426 U. S., at 366-367. The boundary, we said, "was in factfixed in 1740 by decree of King George II of England" asfollows:" `That the Dividing Line shall pass up thro the Mouthof Piscataqua Harbour and up the Middle of theRiver . . . . And that the Dividing Line shall partthe Isles of Shoals and run thro the Middle of the Har-bour between the Islands to the Sea on the SoutherlySide. . . .' " Id., at 366 (quoting the 1740 decree).In 1976, New Hampshire and Maine "expressly agree[d]. . . that the decree of 1740 fixed the boundary in the Piscataqua Harbor area." Id., at 367 (internal quotation marksomitted). "Their quarrel was over the location . . . of the`Mouth of Piscataqua River,' `Middle of the River,' and `Middle of the Harbour' within the contemplation of the decree."532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN747Cite as: 532 U.

T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 32-49 (hereinafter Re-port). In particular, the northern end of the lateral marineboundary required a determination of the point where theline marking the "Middle of the [Piscataqua] River" crossesthe closing line of Piscataqua Harbor. Id., at 43.In the course of litigation, New Hampshire and Maineproposed a consent decree in which they agreed,inter alia,that the words "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree referto the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation. Motion for Entry of Judgment By Consent of Plaintiff and Defendant in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1973,No. 64 Orig., p. 2 (hereinafter Motion for Consent Judgment).The Special Master, upon reviewing pertinent history, rejected the States' interpretation and concluded that "thegeographic middle of the river and not its main or navigable channel was intended by the 1740 decree." Report 41.This Court determined, however, that the States' interpretation "reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms" with adefinition not "wholly contrary to relevant evidence." NewHampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S., at 369. On that basis, theCourt declined to adopt the Special Master's constructionof "Middle of the River" and directed entry of the consentdecree. Id., at 369-370. The final decree, entered in 1977,defined "Middle of the River" as "the middle of the mainchannel of navigation of the Piscataqua River." New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S., at 2.The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marineboundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary.See Report 42-43 ("For the purposes of the present dispute, . . . it is unnecessary to lay out fully the course of theboundary as it proceeds upriver . . . ."). In the instant action, New Hampshire contends that the inland river boundary "run[s] along the low water mark on the Maine shore,"Complaint 49, and asserts sovereignty over the entire river532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN748 NEW HAMPSHIRE v.

Those earlierproceedings, according to Maine, bar New Hampshire's com-plaint under principles of claim and issue preclusion as wellas judicial estoppel.We pretermit the States' competing historical claims alongwith their arguments on the application vel non of theres judicata doctrines commonly called claim and issue preclusion. Claim preclusion generally refers to the effect of aprior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of thevery same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claimraises the same issues as the earlier suit.

See Restatement (Second)of Judgments $$ 17, 27, pp. 148, 250 (1980); D. Shapiro, CivilProcedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 32, 46 (2001). In theunusual circumstances this case presents, we conclude that adiscrete doctrine, judicial estoppel, best fits the controversy.Under that doctrine, we hold, New Hampshire is equitablybarred from asserting--contrary to its position in the 1970'slitigation--that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runsalong the Maine shore. II"[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal pro-ceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he maynot thereafter, simply because his interests have changed,assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerlytaken by him."Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 680, 689 (1895).This rule, known as judicial estoppel, "generally prevents aparty from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argumentand then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail inanother phase." Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211, 227, n. 8(2000); see 18 Moore's Federal Practice $ 134.30, p. 134-62(3d ed. 2000) ("The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents aparty from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that isinconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previousproceeding"); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 4477, p. 782 (1981) (hereinafterWright) ("absent any good explanation, a party should notbe allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory,and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory").Although we have not had occasion to discuss the doctrineelaborately, other courts have uniformly recognized that itspurpose is "to protect the integrity of the judicial process,"Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F. 2d 595, 598 (CA6532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN750 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINEOpinion of the Court1982), by "prohibiting parties from deliberately changingpositions according to the exigencies of the moment,"UnitedStates v. McCaskey, 9 F. 3d 368, 378 (CA5 1993). See In reCassidy, 892 F. 2d 637, 641 (CA7 1990) ("Judicial estoppel isa doctrine intended to prevent the perversion of the judicialprocess.");Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F. 2d 1162, 1166 (CA41982) ( judicial estoppel "protect[s] the essential integrity ofthe judicial process"); Scarano v. Central R. Co., 203 F. 2d510, 513 (CA3 1953) ( judicial estoppel prevents parties from"playing `fast and loose with the courts' " (quoting Stretch v.Watson, 6 N. J. Super. 456, 469, 69 A. 2d 596, 603 (1949))).Because the rule is intended to prevent "improper use ofjudicial machinery," Konstantinidis v. Chen, 626 F. 2d 933,938 (CADC 1980), judicial estoppel "is an equitable doctrineinvoked by a court at its discretion," Russell v. Rolfs, 893F. 2d 1033, 1037 (CA9 1990) (internal quotation marks andcitation omitted).Courts have observed that "[t]he circumstances underwhich judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked areprobably not reducible to any general formulation of principle," Allen, 667 F. 2d, at 1166; accord, Lowery v. Stovall,92 F. 3d 219, 223 (CA4 1996); Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F. 2d 208, 212 (CA1 1987). Nevertheless, several factors typically inform the decision whetherto apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party'slater position must be "clearly inconsistent" with its earlierposition. United States v. Hook, 195 F. 3d 299, 306 (CA71999); In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F. 3d 197, 206 (CA51999); Hossaini v. Western Mo. Medical Center, 140 F. 3d1140, 1143 (CA8 1998); Maharaj v. Bankamerica Corp., 128F. 3d 94, 98 (CA2 1997). Second, courts regularly inquirewhether the party has succeeded in persuading a court toaccept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding wouldcreate "the perception that either the first or the secondcourt was misled," Edwards, 690 F. 2d, at 599. Absent suc532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN751Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)Opinion of the Courtcess in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no "risk of inconsistent court determinations," United States v. C. I. T. Constr. Inc., 944 F. 2d 253,259 (CA5 1991), and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. See Hook, 195 F. 3d, at 306; Maharaj, 128 F. 3d, at 98;Konstantinidis, 626 F. 2d, at 939. A third consideration iswhether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent positionwould derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. See Davis, 156U. S., at 689; Philadelphia, W., & B. R. Co. v. Howard, 13How. 307, 335-337 (1852); Scarano, 203 F. 2d, at 513 ( judicialestoppel forbids use of "intentional self-contradiction . . . asa means of obtaining unfair advantage"); see also 18 Wright$ 4477, p. 782.In enumerating these factors, we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determiningthe applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factualcontexts. In this case, we simply observe that the factorsabove firmly tip the balance of equities in favor of barringNew Hampshire's present complaint.New Hampshire's claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent withits interpretation of the words "Middle of the River" duringthe 1970's litigation. As mentioned above, supra, at 747, interpretation of those words was "necessary" to fixing thenorthern endpoint of the lateral marine boundary, Report 43.New Hampshire offered two interpretations in the earlierproceeding--first agreeing with Maine in the proposed consent decree that "Middle of the River" means the middle ofthe main channel of navigation, and later agreeing with theSpecial Master that the words mean the geographic middleof the river. Both constructions located the "Middle of theRiver" somewhere other than the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River.532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN752 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINEOpinion of the CourtMoreover, the record of the 1970's dispute makes clearthat this Court accepted New Hampshire's agreement withMaine that "Middle of the River" means middle of the mainnavigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited fromthat interpretation. New Hampshire, it is true, preferredthe interpretation of "Middle of the River" in the SpecialMaster's report. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff inNew Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., p. 3 (here-inafter Plaintiff 's Exceptions) ("the boundary now proposedby the Special Master is more favorable to [New Hampshire]than that recommended in the proposed consent decree").But the consent decree was sufficiently favorable to NewHampshire to garner its approval. Although New Hampshire now suggests that it "compromised in Maine's favor"on the definition of "Middle of the River" in the 1970's litigation, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 24, that"compromise" enabled New Hampshire to settle the case, seeid., at 24-25, on terms beneficial to both States. Notably,in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, NewHampshire and Maine represented to this Court that theproposed judgment was "in the best interest of each State."Motion for Consent Judgment 1. Relying on that representation, the Court accepted the boundary proposed by thetwo States. New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S. 1 (1977).At oral argument, New Hampshire urged that the consent decree simply fixed the "Middle of the River" at "anarbitrary location based on the administrative convenienceof the parties." Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. To the extent NewHampshire implies that the parties settled the lateral marineboundary dispute without judicial endorsement of their interpretation of "Middle of the River," that view is foreclosed by the Court's determination that "[t]he consent decree . . . proposes a wholly permissible final resolution ofthe controversy both as to facts and law," New Hampshirev. Maine, 426 U. S., at 368-369. Three dissenting Justicesagreed with New Hampshire that the consent decree in532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN753Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)Opinion of the Courtterpreted the middle-of-the-river language "by agreementsof convenience" and not "in accordance with legal principles."Id., at 371 (White, J., joined by Blackmun and Stevens,JJ., dissenting). But the Court concluded otherwise, noting that its acceptance of the consent decree involved"[n]othing remotely resembling `arbitral' rather than `judicial' functions," id., at 369. The consent decree "reasonablyinvest[ed] imprecise terms with definitions that give effectto [the 1740] decree,"ibid., and "[did] not fall into the category of agreements that we reject because acceptance wouldnot be consistent with our Art. III function and duty,"ibid.New Hampshire also contends that the 1977 consent decree was entered without "a searching historical inquiry intowhat that language [`Middle of the River'] meant." Tr. ofOral Arg. 39. According to New Hampshire, had it knownthen what it knows now about the relevant history, it wouldnot have entered into the decree. Ibid. We do not questionthat it may be appropriate to resist application of judicialestoppel "when a party's prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake." John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert &Frieden, P. C., 65 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA4 1995); see In re Corey,892 F. 2d 829, 836 (CA9 1989); Konstantinidis, 626 F. 2d, at939. We are unpersuaded, however, that New Hampshire'sposition in 1977 fairly may be regarded as a product of inadvertence or mistake.The pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case showthat New Hampshire did engage in "a searching historicalinquiry" into the meaning of "Middle of the River." SeeReply Brief for Plaintiff in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T.1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 3-9 (examining history of river boundaries under international law, proceedings leading up to the1740 order of the King in Council, and relevant precedentsof this Court). None of the historical evidence cited by NewHampshire remotely suggested that the Piscataqua Riverboundary runs along the Maine shore. In fact, in attempting to place the boundary at the geographic middle of the532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN754 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINEOpinion of the Courtriver, New Hampshire acknowledged that its agents in 1740understood the King's order to "adjudg[e] half of the riverto" the portion of Massachusetts that is now Maine. Id., at6 (emphasis in original) (quoting N. H. State Papers, XIX,pp. 591, 596-597); see Reply Brief in No. 64 Orig., supra, at4 ("The intention of those participating in the proceedingsleading to the [1740 decree] was to use `geographic middle'as the Piscataqua boundary." (emphasis in original)). Inaddition, this Court independently determined that "there isnothing to suggest that the location of the 1740 boundaryagreed upon by the States is wholly contrary to relevant evidence." New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S., at 369.Nor can it be said that New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river boundary at Maine'sshore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire relies onhistorical materials--primarily official documents and eventsfrom the colonial and postcolonial periods, see Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-19--that were no less available 25 years ago than they are today. And New Hampshirehad every reason to consult those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would have placed thenorthern terminus of the lateral marine boundary muchcloser to Maine, "result[ing] in hundreds if not thousandsof additional acres of territory being in New Hampshirerather than Maine," Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (rebuttal argumentof Maine). Tellingly, New Hampshire at the time understood the importance of placing the northern terminus asclose to Maine as possible. While agreeing with the SpecialMaster that "Middle of the River" means geographic middle,New Hampshire insisted that the geographic middle shouldbe determined by using the banks of the river, not low tideelevations (as the Special Master had proposed), as the keyreference points--a methodology that would have placedthe northern terminus 350 yards closer to the Maine shore.Plaintiff 's Exceptions 3.532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN755Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)Opinion of the CourtIn short, considerations of equity persuade us that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. Havingconvinced this Court to accept one interpretation of "Middleof the River," and having benefited from that interpretation,New Hampshire now urges an inconsistent interpretation togain an additional advantage at Maine's expense. Were weto accept New Hampshire's latest view, the "risk of inconsistent court determinations," C. I. T. Constr. Inc., 944 F. 2d, at259, would become a reality. We cannot interpret "Middleof the River" in the 1740 decree to mean two different thingsalong the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process.Finally, notwithstanding the balance of equities, NewHampshire points to this Court's recognition that "ordinarily the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is notapplied to states," Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329U. S. 362, 369 (1946). Of course, "broad interests of publicpolicy may make it important to allow a change of positionsthat might seem inappropriate as a matter of merely private interests." 18 Wright $ 4477, p. 784. But this is nota case where estoppel would compromise a governmentalinterest in enforcing the law. Cf. Heckler v. CommunityHealth Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U. S. 51, 60 (1984)("When the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has given rise to an estoppel,the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to therule of law is undermined. It is for this reason that it iswell settled that the Government may not be estopped onthe same terms as any other litigant."). Nor is this a casewhere the shift in the government's position is "the resultof a change in public policy," United States v. Owens, 54 F. 3d271, 275 (CA6 1995); cf. Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U. S.591, 601 (1948) (collateral estoppel does not apply to Commissioner where pertinent statutory provisions or Treasury532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN756 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINEOpinion of the Courtregulations have changed between the first and second pro-ceeding), or the result of a change in facts essential to theprior judgment, cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147,159 (1979) ("changes in facts essential to a judgment willrender collateral estoppel inapplicable in a subsequent ac-tion raising the same issues"). Instead, it is a case betweentwo States, in which each owes the other a full measure ofrespect.What has changed between 1976 and today is New Hamp-shire's interpretation of the historical evidence concerningthe King's 1740 decree. New Hampshire advances its newinterpretation not to enforce its own laws within its borders,but to adjust the border itself. Given Maine's countervailinginterest in the location of the boundary, we are unable todiscern any "broad interes[t] of public policy," 18 Wright$ 4477, p. 784, that gives New Hampshire the prerogative toconstrue "Middle of the River" differently today than it did25 years ago.* * *For the reasons stated, we conclude that judicial estoppelbars New Hampshire from asserting that the PiscataquaRiver boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly,we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.
