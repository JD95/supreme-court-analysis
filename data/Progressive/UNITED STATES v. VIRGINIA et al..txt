VIRGINIAOpinion of the CourtIFounded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex schoolamong Virginia's 15 public institutions of higher learning.VMI's distinctive mission is to produce "citizen-soldiers,"men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in militaryservice. VMI pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia. As-signing prime place to character development, VMI uses an"adversative method" modeled on English public schoolsand once characteristic of military instruction. VMI con-stantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline inits cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. Theschool's graduates leave VMI with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress, and alarge sense of accomplishment for completing the hazardouscourse.VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, Members ofCongress, and business executives. The school's alumnioverwhelmingly perceive that their VMI training helpedthem to realize their personal goals. VMI's endowmentreflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largestper-student endowment of all public undergraduate institu-tions in the Nation.Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers norVMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitableto women. And the school's impressive record in producingleaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nev-ertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively formen the advantages and opportunities a VMI educationaffords.IIAFrom its establishment in 1839 as one of the Nation's firststate military colleges, see 1839 Va.

Acts, ch. 24, $ 2 (requiring every cadet to teach inone of the Commonwealth's schools for a 2-year period).1Civil War strife threatened the school's vitality, but a resourceful superintendent regained legislative support byhighlighting "VMI's great potential[,] through its technicalknow-how," to advance Virginia's postwar recovery. TheVMI Story 47.VMI today enrolls about 1,300 men as cadets.2 Its aca-demic offerings in the liberal arts, sciences, and engineeringare also available at other public colleges and universities inVirginia. But VMI's mission is special. It is the mission ofthe school" `to produce educated and honorable men, prepared forthe varied work of civil life, imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leader-ship, possessing a high sense of public service, advocatesof the American democracy and free enterprise system,and ready as citizen-soldiers to defend their country in1 During the Civil War, school teaching became a field dominated bywomen. See A. Scott, The Southern Lady: From Pedestal to Politics,1830-1930, p. 82 (1970).2 Historically, most of Virginia's public colleges and universities weresingle sex; by the mid-1970's, however, all except VMI had become coeducational. 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1418-1419 (WD Va. 1991). For example,Virginia's legislature incorporated Farmville Female Seminary Association in 1839, the year VMI opened. 1839 Va. Acts, ch. 167. Originallyproviding instruction in "English, Latin, Greek, French, and piano" in a"home atmosphere," R. Sprague, Longwood College: A History 7-8, 15(1989) (Longwood College), Farmville Female Seminary became a publicinstitution in 1884 with a mission to train "white female teachers for publicschools," 1884 Va. Acts, ch. 311. The school became Longwood Collegein 1949, Longwood College 136, and introduced coeducation in 1976, id.,at 133.518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:19 PAGES OPINPGT522 UNITED STATES v.

Supp. 1407, 1425 (WDVa. 1991) (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMIBoard of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).In contrast to the federal service academies, institutionsmaintained "to prepare cadets for career service in thearmed forces," VMI's program "is directed at preparationfor both military and civilian life"; "[o]nly about 15% ofVMI cadets enter career military service." 766 F. Supp., at1432.VMI produces its "citizen-soldiers" through "an adversa-tive, or doubting, model of education" which features "[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality of treatment,absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values." Id., at 1421. As one Com-mandant of Cadets described it, the adversative method" `dissects the young student,' " and makes him aware ofhis " `limits and capabilities,' " so that he knows " `how farhe can go with his anger, . . . how much he can take understress, . . . exactly what he can do when he is physicallyexhausted.' " Id., at 1421-1422 (quoting Col. N. Bissell).VMI cadets live in spartan barracks where surveillance isconstant and privacy nonexistent; they wear uniforms, eattogether in the mess hall, and regularly participate in drills.Id., at 1424, 1432. Entering students are incessantly ex-posed to the rat line, "an extreme form of the adversativemodel," comparable in intensity to Marine Corps boot camp.Id., at 1422. Tormenting and punishing, the rat line bondsnew cadets to their fellow sufferers and, when they havecompleted the 7-month experience, to their former tormentors. Ibid.VMI's "adversative model" is further characterized by ahierarchical "class system" of privileges and responsibilities,a "dyke system" for assigning a senior class mentor to eachentering class "rat," and a stringently enforced "honor code,"which prescribes that a cadet " `does not lie, cheat, steal nortolerate those who do.' " Id., at 1422-1423.518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:19 PAGES OPINPGT523Cite as: 518 U.

Id., at1421. "[W]omen have no opportunity anywhere to gain thebenefits of [the system of education at VMI]." Ibid.BIn 1990, prompted by a complaint filed with the AttorneyGeneral by a female high-school student seeking admissionto VMI, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia and VMI, alleging that VMI's exclusively male admission policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment. Id., at 1408.3 Trial of the actionconsumed six days and involved an array of expert witnesseson each side. Ibid.In the two years preceding the lawsuit, the District Courtnoted, VMI had received inquiries from 347 women, but hadresponded to none of them. Id., at 1436. "[S]ome women,at least," the court said, "would want to attend the school ifthey had the opportunity." Id., at 1414. The court furtherrecognized that, with recruitment, VMI could "achieve atleast 10% female enrollment"--"a sufficient `critical mass' toprovide the female cadets with a positive educational experience." Id., at 1437-1438. And it was also establishedthat "some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets." Id., at 1412. In addition, ex-perts agreed that if VMI admitted women, "the VMI ROTCexperience would become a better training program from theperspective of the armed forces, because it would providetraining in dealing with a mixed-gender army." Id., at 1441.The District Court ruled in favor of VMI, however, andrejected the equal protection challenge pressed by theUnited States. That court correctly recognized thatMissis-sippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982), was3 The District Court allowed the VMI Foundation and the VMI AlumniAssociation to intervene as defendants. 766 F.

There, this Courtunderscored that a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an "exceedingly persuasivejustification" for the classification.Mississippi Univ. forWomen, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted).To succeed, the defender of the challenged action must show"at least that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employedare substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).The District Court reasoned that education in "a singlegender environment, be it male or female," yields substantialbenefits. 766 F. Supp., at 1415. VMI's school for menbrought diversity to an otherwise coeducational Virginiasystem, and that diversity was "enhanced by VMI's uniquemethod of instruction." Ibid. If single-gender educationfor males ranks as an important governmental objective, itbecomes obvious, the District Court concluded, that the onlymeans of achieving the objective "is to exclude women fromthe all-male institution--VMI." Ibid."Women are [indeed] denied a unique educational opportunity that is available only at VMI," the District Court acknowledged. Id., at 1432. But "[VMI's] single-sex statuswould be lost, and some aspects of the [school's] distinctivemethod would be altered," if women were admitted, id., at1413: "Allowance for personal privacy would have to bemade," id., at 1412; "[p]hysical education requirements wouldhave to be altered, at least for the women," id., at 1413; theadversative environment could not survive unmodified, id.,at 1412-1413. Thus, "sufficient constitutional justification"had been shown, the District Court held, "for continuing[VMI's] single-sex policy." Id., at 1413.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed andvacated the District Court's judgment. The appellate courtheld: "The Commonwealth of Virginia has not . . . advancedany state policy by which it can justify its determination,518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:19 PAGES OPINPGT525Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtunder an announced policy of diversity, to afford VMI'sunique type of program to men and not to women." 976F. 2d 890, 892 (1992).The appeals court greeted with skepticism Virginia's assertion that it offers single-sex education at VMI as a facetof the Commonwealth's overarching and undisputed policy toadvance "autonomy and diversity." The court underscoredVirginia's nondiscrimination commitment: " `[I]t is extremelyimportant that [colleges and universities] deal with faculty,staff, and students without regard to sex, race, or ethnicorigin.' " Id., at 899 (quoting 1990 Report of the VirginiaCommission on the University of the 21st Century). "Thatstatement," the Court of Appeals said, "is the only explicitone that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions." 976 F. 2d, at 899. Furthermore, the appeals courtobserved, in urging "diversity" to justify an all-male VMI,the Commonwealth had supplied "no explanation for themovement away from [single-sex education] in Virginia bypublic colleges and universities." Ibid. In short, the courtconcluded, "[a] policy of diversity which aims to provide anarray of educational opportunities, including single-genderinstitutions, must do more than favor one gender." Ibid.The parties agreed that "some women can meet the physical standards now imposed on men," id., at 896, and the courtwas satisfied that "neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women," id., at 899. The Court of Appeals, however, accepted the District Court's finding that "at leastthese three aspects of VMI's program--physical training, theabsence of privacy, and the adversative approach--would bematerially affected by coeducation." Id., at 896-897. Remanding the case, the appeals court assigned to Virginia,in the first instance, responsibility for selecting a remedialcourse. The court suggested these options for the Commonwealth: Admit women to VMI; establish parallel institutions518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:19 PAGES OPINPGT526 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtor programs; or abandon state support, leaving VMI free topursue its policies as a private institution. Id., at 900. InMay 1993, this Court denied certiorari. See 508 U. S. 946;see also ibid. (opinion ofScalia, J., noting the interlocutoryposture of the litigation).CIn response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, Virginia pro-posed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsoredundergraduate program would be located at Mary BaldwinCollege, a private liberal arts school for women, and wouldbe open, initially, to about 25 to 30 students. AlthoughVWIL would share VMI's mission--to produce "citizen-soldiers"--the VWIL program would differ, as does MaryBaldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methodsof education, and financial resources. See 852 F. Supp. 471,476-477 (WD Va. 1994).The average combined SAT score of entrants at MaryBaldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMIfreshmen. See id., at 501. Mary Baldwin's faculty holds"significantly fewer Ph. D.'s than the faculty at VMI," id.,at 502, and receives significantly lower salaries, see Tr. 158(testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College),reprinted in 2 App. in Nos. 94-1667 and 94-1717 (CA4) (hereinafter Tr.). While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, thesciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial,offered only bachelor of arts degrees. See 852 F. Supp., at503. A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one, without public support, by attendingWashington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two years,paying the required private tuition. See ibid.Experts in educating women at the college level composedthe Task Force charged with designing the VWIL program;Task Force members were drawn from Mary Baldwin's ownfaculty and staff. Id., at 476. Training its attention onmethods of instruction appropriate for "most women," the518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT527Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the CourtTask Force determined that a military model would be"wholly inappropriate" for VWIL. Ibid.; see 44 F. 3d 1229,1233 (CA4 1995).VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs anda newly established, "largely ceremonial" Virginia Corps ofCadets,id., at 1234, but the VWIL House would not have amilitary format, 852 F. Supp., at 477, and VWIL would notrequire its students to eat meals together or to wear uni-forms during the schoolday, id., at 495. In lieu of VMI's adversative method, the VWIL Task Force favored "a coopera-tive method which reinforces self-esteem." Id., at 476. Inaddition to the standard bachelor of arts program offered atMary Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete an off-campus leadership externship, partici-pate in community service projects, and assist in arranginga speaker series. See 44 F. 3d, at 1234.Virginia represented that it will provide equal financialsupport for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets, 852F. Supp., at 483, and the VMI Foundation agreed to supplya $5.4625 million endowment for the VWIL program, id., at499. Mary Baldwin's own endowment is about $19 million;VMI's is $131 million. Id., at 503. Mary Baldwin will add$35 million to its endowment based on future commitments;VMI will add $220 million. Ibid. The VMI Alumni Associ-ation has developed a network of employers interested inhiring VMI graduates. The Association has agreed to openits network to VWIL graduates,id., at 499, but those gradu-ates will not have the advantage afforded by a VMI degree.DVirginia returned to the District Court seeking approvalof its proposed remedial plan, and the court decided theplan met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.Id., at 473. The District Court again acknowledged evidentiary support for these determinations: "[T]he VMI method-ology could be used to educate women and, in fact, some518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT528 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtwomen . . . may prefer the VMI methodology to the VWILmethodology."Id., at 481. But the "controlling legal principles," the District Court decided, "do not require the Com-monwealth to provide a mirror image VMI for women."Ibid. The court anticipated that the two schools would"achieve substantially similar outcomes." Ibid. It con-cluded: "If VMI marches to the beat of a drum, then MaryBaldwin marches to the melody of a fife and when the marchis over, both will have arrived at the same destination."Id., at 484.A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court'sjudgment. 44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995). This time, the appellate court determined to give "greater scrutiny to the selection of means than to the [Commonwealth's] proffered objective." Id., at 1236. The official objective or purpose, thecourt said, should be reviewed deferentially. Ibid. Respect for the "legislative will," the court reasoned, meantthat the judiciary should take a "cautious approach," inquiring into the "legitima[cy]" of the governmental objective andrefusing approval for any purpose revealed to be "pernicious." Ibid."[P]roviding the option of a single-gender college education may be considered a legitimate and important aspectof a public system of higher education," the appeals courtobserved, id., at 1238; that objective, the court added, is "notpernicious," id., at 1239. Moreover, the court continued, theadversative method vital to a VMI education "has neverbeen tolerated in a sexually heterogeneous environment."Ibid. The method itself "was not designed to excludewomen," the court noted, but women could not be accommodated in the VMI program, the court believed, for femaleparticipation in VMI's adversative training "would destroy. . . any sense of decency that still permeates the relationshipbetween the sexes." Ibid.Having determined, deferentially, the legitimacy of Virginia's purpose, the court considered the question of means.518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT529Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the CourtExclusion of "men at Mary Baldwin College and womenat VMI," the court said, was essential to Virginia's purpose,for without such exclusion, the Commonwealth could not"accomplish [its] objective of providing single-gender education." Ibid.The court recognized that, as it analyzed the case, meansmerged into end, and the merger risked "bypass[ing] anyequal protection scrutiny." Id., at 1237. The court there-fore added another inquiry, a decisive test it called "substantive comparability." Ibid. The key question, the courtsaid, was whether men at VMI and women at VWIL wouldobtain "substantively comparable benefits at their institutionor through other means offered by the [S]tate." Ibid. Although the appeals court recognized that the VWIL degree"lacks the historical benefit and prestige" of a VMI degree, itnevertheless found the educational opportunities at the twoschools "sufficiently comparable." Id., at 1241.Senior Circuit Judge Phillips dissented. The court, in hisjudgment, had not held Virginia to the burden of showingan " `exceedingly persuasive [ justification]' " for the Commonwealth's action. Id., at 1247 (quoting Mississippi Univ.for Women, 458 U. S., at 724). In Judge Phillips' view, thecourt had accepted "rationalizations compelled by the exigencies of this litigation," and had not confronted the Commonwealth's "actual overriding purpose." 44 F. 3d, at 1247.That purpose, Judge Phillips said, was clear from the historical record; it was "not to create a new type of educationalopportunity for women, . . . nor to further diversify theCommonwealth's higher education system[,] . . . but [was]simply . . . to allow VMI to continue to exclude women inorder to preserve its historic character and mission." Ibid.Judge Phillips suggested that the Commonwealth wouldsatisfy the Constitution's equal protection requirement ifit "simultaneously opened single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially comparable curricular andextra-curricular programs, funding, physical plant, adminis518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT530 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courttration and support services, and faculty and library re-sources." Id., at 1250. But he thought it evident that theproposed VWIL program, in comparison to VMI, fell "farshort . . . from providing substantially equal tangible andintangible educational benefits to men and women." Ibid.The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 52 F. 3d 90(1995). Circuit Judge Motz, joined by Circuit Judges Hall,Murnaghan, and Michael, filed a dissenting opinion.4 JudgeMotz agreed with Judge Phillips that Virginia had not shownan " `exceedingly persuasive justification' " for the disparate opportunities the Commonwealth supported. Id., at 92(quotingMississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724).She asked: "[H]ow can a degree from a yet to be implemented supplemental program at Mary Baldwin be held `sub-stantively comparable' to a degree from a venerable Virginiamilitary institution that was established more than 150 yearsago?" 52 F. 3d, at 93. "Women need not be guaranteedequal `results,' " Judge Motz said, "but the Equal ProtectionClause does require equal opportunity . . . [and] that opportunity is being denied here." Ibid.IIIThe cross-petitions in this suit present two ultimate is-sues. First, does Virginia's exclusion of women from theeducational opportunities provided by VMI--extraordinaryopportunities for military training and civilian leadershipdevelopment--deny to women "capable of all of the individ-ual activities required of VMI cadets," 766 F. Supp., at 1412,the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Four-teenth Amendment?

E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B.,511 U. S. 127, 136-137, and n. 6 (1994), and Mississippi Univ.for Women, 458 U.

And for a halfcentury thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine thatgovernment, both federal and state, could withhold fromwomen opportunities accorded men so long as any "basis inreason" could be conceived for the discrimination.

Reedv.Reed, 404 U.

Since Reed, the Court hasrepeatedly recognized that neither federal nor state govern-ment acts compatibly with the equal protection principlewhen a law or official policy denies to women, simply becausethey are women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunityto aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to societybased on their individual talents and capacities. See,e. g.,Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.

And it mustnot rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females. SeeWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643, 648 (1975);Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 223-224 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).The heightened review standard our precedent establishesdoes not make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed "inherent differences" are no longer accepted as a ground forrace or national origin classifications. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967). Physical differences between menand women, however, are enduring: "[T]he two sexes are notfungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] isdifferent from a community composed of both." Ballard v.United States, 329 U. S. 187, 193 (1946)."Inherent differences" between men and women, we havecome to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not fordenigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity. Sex classificationsmay be used to compensate women "for particular economicdisabilities [they have] suffered," Califano v. Webster, 430U. S. 313, 320 (1977) (per curiam), to "promot[e] equal employment opportunity," see California Fed. Sav. & LoanAssn. v. Guerra, 479 U.

VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtple.7 But such classifications may not be used, as they oncewere, see Goesaert, 335 U. S., at 467, to create or perpetuatethe legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.Measuring the record in this case against the reviewstandard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shownno "exceedingly persuasive justification" for excluding allwomen from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI.We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment,which held that Virginia had violated the FourteenthAmendment's Equal Protection Clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia--the Mary Baldwin VWIL pro-gram--does not cure the constitutional violation,i. e., it doesnot provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.VThe Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had ad-vanced no state policy by which it could justify, under equalprotection principles, its determination "to afford VMI'sunique type of program to men and not to women." 976F. 2d, at 892. Virginia challenges that "liability" ruling andasserts two justifications in defense of VMI's exclusion of7 Several amici have urged that diversity in educational opportunitiesis an altogether appropriate governmental pursuit and that single-sexschools can contribute importantly to such diversity. Indeed, it is themission of some single-sex schools "to dissipate, rather than perpetuate,traditional gender classifications." See Brief for Twenty-six PrivateWomen's Colleges as Amici Curiae 5. We do not question the Commonwealth's prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities. We address specifically and only an educational opportunityrecognized by the District Court and the Court of Appeals as "unique,"see 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1432; 976 F. 2d, at 892, an opportunity availableonly at Virginia's premier military institute, the Commonwealth's solesingle-sex public university or college. Cf.

First, the Commonwealth contends, "single-sex ed-ucation provides important educational benefits," Brief forCross-Petitioners 20, and the option of single-sex educationcontributes to "diversity in educational approaches," id., at25. Second, the Commonwealth argues, "the unique VMImethod of character development and leadership training,"the school's adversative approach, would have to be modifiedwere VMI to admit women.Id., at 33-36 (internal quota-tion marks omitted). We consider these two justificationsin turn. ASingle-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to atleast some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality isuncontested in this litigation.8 Similarly, it is not disputedthat diversity among public educational institutions canserve the public good. But Virginia has not shown thatVMI was established, or has been maintained, with a viewto diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, ed-ucational opportunities within the Commonwealth. In casesof this genre, our precedent instructs that "benign" justifi-cations proffered in defense of categorical exclusions willnot be accepted automatically; a tenable justification mustdescribe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for ac8 On this point, the dissent sees fire where there is no flame. See post,at 596-598, 598-600. "Both men and women can benefit from a single-sexeducation," the District Court recognized, although "the beneficial effects"of such education, the court added, apparently "are stronger among womenthan among men." 766 F. Supp., at 1414. The United States does notchallenge that recognition. Cf. C. Jencks & D. Riesman, The AcademicRevolution 297-298 (1968):"The pluralistic argument for preserving all-male colleges is uncomfortably similar to the pluralistic argument for preserving all-white colleges . . . . The all-male college would be relatively easy to defend ifit emerged from a world in which women were established as fully equalto men. But it does not. It is therefore likely to be a witting or unwitting device for preserving tacit assumptions of male superiority--assumptions for which women must eventually pay."518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT536 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courttions in fact differently grounded. See Wiesenfeld, 420U. S., at 648, and n. 16 ("mere recitation of a benign [or]compensatory purpose" does not block "inquiry into theactual purposes" of government-maintained gender-basedclassifications); Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 212-213 (rejectinggovernment-proffered purposes after "inquiry into the actual purposes" (internal quotation marks omitted)).Mississippi Univ. for Women is immediately in point.There the State asserted, in justification of its exclusion ofmen from a nursing school, that it was engaging in "ed-ucational affirmative action" by "compensat[ing] for discrimination against women." 458 U. S., at 727. Undertaking a"searching analysis,"id., at 728, the Court found no closeresemblance between "the alleged objective" and "the actualpurpose underlying the discriminatory classification," id., at730. Pursuing a similar inquiry here, we reach the sameconclusion.Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia'salleged pursuit of diversity through single-sex educationaloptions. In 1839, when the Commonwealth establishedVMI, a range of educational opportunities for men andwomen was scarcely contemplated. Higher education atthe time was considered dangerous for women; 9 reflecting9 Dr. Edward H. Clarke of Harvard Medical School, whose influentialbook, Sex in Education, went through 17 editions, was perhaps the mostwell-known speaker from the medical community opposing higher education for women. He maintained that the physiological effects of hardstudy and academic competition with boys would interfere with the development of girls' reproductive organs. See E. Clarke, Sex in Education38-39, 62-63 (1873); id., at 127 ("identical education of the two sexes is acrime before God and humanity, that physiology protests against, and thatexperience weeps over"); see also H. Maudsley, Sex in Mind and in Education 17 (1874) ("It is not that girls have not ambition, nor that they failgenerally to run the intellectual race [in coeducational settings], but it isasserted that they do it at a cost to their strength and health which entailslife-long suffering, and even incapacitates them for the adequate performance of the natural functions of their sex."); C. Meigs, Females and TheirDiseases 350 (1848) (after five or six weeks of "mental and educationaldiscipline," a healthy woman would "lose . . . the habit of menstruation"518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT537Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtwidely held views about women's proper place, the Nation'sfirst universities and colleges--for example, Harvard in Massachusetts, William and Mary in Virginia--admitted onlymen. See E. Farello, A History of the Education of Womenin the United States 163 (1970). VMI was not at all novelin this respect: In admitting no women, VMI followed thelead of the Commonwealth's flagship school, the Universityof Virginia, founded in 1819."[N]o struggle for the admission of women to a state university," a historian has recounted, "was longer drawn out,or developed more bitterness, than that at the University ofVirginia." 2 T. Woody, A History of Women's Education inthe United States 254 (1929) (History of Women's Education).In 1879, the State Senate resolved to look into the possibilityof higher education for women, recognizing that Virginia" `has never, at any period of her history,' " provided for thehigher education of her daughters, though she " `has liberallyprovided for the higher education of her sons.' "Ibid. (quoting 10 Educ. J. Va. 212 (1879)). Despite this recognition, nonew opportunities were instantly open to women.10Virginia eventually provided for several women's seminar-ies and colleges. Farmville Female Seminary became a public institution in 1884. See supra, at 521, n. 2. Two women'sschools, Mary Washington College and James Madison University, were founded in 1908; another, Radford University,was founded in 1910. 766 F. Supp., at 1418-1419. By themid-1970's, all four schools had become coeducational. Ibid.Debate concerning women's admission as undergraduatesat the main university continued well past the century'smidpoint. Familiar arguments were rehearsed. If womenand suffer numerous ills as a result of depriving her body for the sake ofher mind).10 Virginia's Superintendent of Public Instruction dismissed the coeducational idea as " `repugnant to the prejudices of the people' " and proposeda female college similar in quality to Girton, Smith, or Vassar. 2 Historyof Women's Education 254 (quoting Dept. of Interior, 1 Report of Commissioner of Education, H. R. Doc. No. 5, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., 438 (1904)).518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT538 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtwere admitted, it was feared, they "would encroach on therights of men; there would be new problems of government,perhaps scandals; the old honor system would have to bechanged; standards would be lowered to those of other coeducational schools; and the glorious reputation of the univer-sity, as a school for men, would be trailed in the dust." 2History of Women's Education 255.Ultimately, in 1970, "the most prestigious institution ofhigher education in Virginia," the University of Virginia,introduced coeducation and, in 1972, began to admit womenon an equal basis with men. See Kirstein v. Rector andVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 309 F. Supp. 184, 186 (ED Va.1970). A three-judge Federal District Court confirmed:"Virginia may not now deny to women, on the basis ofsex, educational opportunities at the Charlottesville campusthat are not afforded in other institutions operated by the[S]tate."Id., at 187.Virginia describes the current absence of public single-sexhigher education for women as "an historical anomaly."Brief for Cross-Petitioners 30. But the historical record indicates action more deliberate than anomalous: First, protec-tion of women against higher education; next, schools forwomen far from equal in resources and stature to schoolsfor men; finally, conversion of the separate schools to coeducation. The state legislature, prior to the advent of thiscontroversy, had repealed "[a]ll Virginia statutes requiringindividual institutions to admit only men or women." 766F. Supp., at 1419. And in 1990, an official commission, "legislatively established to chart the future goals of higher edu-cation in Virginia," reaffirmed the policy " `of affording broadaccess" while maintaining "autonomy and diversity.' " 976F. 2d, at 898-899 (quoting Report of the Virginia Commissionon the University of the 21st Century). Significantly, thecommission reported:" `Because colleges and universities provide opportuni-ties for students to develop values and learn from role518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT539Cite as: 518 U.

" Id., at 899 (emphasis supplied byCourt of Appeals deleted).This statement, the Court of Appeals observed, "is the onlyexplicit one that we have found in the record in which theCommonwealth has expressed itself with respect to genderdistinctions." Ibid.Our 1982 decision in Mississippi Univ. for Womenprompted VMI to reexamine its male-only admission policy.See 766 F. Supp., at 1427-1428. Virginia relies on thatreexamination as a legitimate basis for maintaining VMI'ssingle-sex character. See Reply Brief for Cross-Petitioners6. A Mission Study Committee, appointed by the VMIBoard of Visitors, studied the problem from October 1983until May 1986, and in that month counseled against "changeof VMI status as a single-sex college." See 766 F. Supp., at1429 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever internal purpose the Mission Study Committee served--and how-ever well meaning the framers of the report--we can hardlyextract from that effort any commonwealth policy even-handedly to advance diverse educational options. As theDistrict Court observed, the Committee's analysis "primarilyfocuse[d] on anticipated difficulties in attracting females toVMI," and the report, overall, supplied "very little indicationof how th[e] conclusion was reached."Ibid.In sum, we find no persuasive evidence in this record thatVMI's male-only admission policy "is in furtherance of astate policy of `diversity.' " See 976 F. 2d, at 899. No suchpolicy, the Fourth Circuit observed, can be discerned fromthe movement of all other public colleges and universities inVirginia away from single-sex education. See ibid. Thatcourt also questioned "how one institution with autonomy,but with no authority over any other state institution, cangive effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."Ibid. A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educa518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT540 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courttional options, as the Court of Appeals recognized, is notserved by VMI's historic and constant plan--a plan to "affor[d] a unique educational benefit only to males." Ibid.However "liberally" this plan serves the Commonwealth'ssons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters.That is notequal protection.BVirginia next argues that VMI's adversative method oftraining provides educational benefits that cannot be madeavailable, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommo-date women would necessarily be "radical," so "drastic," Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed "destroy," VMI's pro-gram. See Brief for Cross-Petitioners 34-36. Neither sexwould be favored by the transformation, Virginia maintains:Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currentlyavailable to them; women would not gain that opportunitybecause their participation would "eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from . . . otherinstitutions of higher education in Virginia." Id., at 34.The District Court forecast from expert witness testi-mony, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that coeducationwould materially affect "at least these three aspects of VMI'sprogram--physical training, the absence of privacy, and theadversative approach." 976 F. 2d, at 896-897. And it is un-contested that women's admission would require accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments and physi-cal training programs for female cadets. See Brief forCross-Respondent 11, 29-30. It is also undisputed, how-ever, that "the VMI methodology could be used to educatewomen." 852 F. Supp., at 481. The District Court even al-lowed that some women may prefer it to the methodology awomen's college might pursue. See ibid. "[S]ome women,at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity," the District Court recognized, 766 F. Supp., at 1414,and "some women," the expert testimony established, "are518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT541Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtcapable of all of the individual activities required of VMIcadets,"id., at 1412. The parties, furthermore, agree that"some women can meet the physical standards [VMI] nowimpose[s] on men." 976 F. 2d, at 896. In sum, as the Courtof Appeals stated, "neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers," VMI's raison d'e^tre, "nor VMI's implementing meth-odology is inherently unsuitable to women."Id., at 899.In support of its initial judgment for Virginia, a judg-ment rejecting all equal protection objections presented bythe United States, the District Court made "findings" on"gender-based developmental differences." 766 F. Supp.,at 1434-1435. These "findings" restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses, opinions about typically male ortypically female "tendencies." Id., at 1434. For example,"[m]ales tend to need an atmosphere of adversativeness,"while "[f]emales tend to thrive in a cooperative atmosphere."Ibid. "I'm not saying that some women don't do well under[the] adversative model," VMI's expert on educational institutions testified, "undoubtedly there are some [women] whodo"; but educational experiences must be designed "aroundthe rule," this expert maintained, and not "around the exception." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).The United States does not challenge any expert witnessestimation on average capacities or preferences of men andwomen. Instead, the United States emphasizes that timeand again since this Court's turning point decision in Reed v.Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), we have cautioned reviewing courtsto take a "hard look" at generalizations or "tendencies" ofthe kind pressed by Virginia, and relied upon by the DistrictCourt. See O'Connor, Portia's Progress, 66 N. Y. U. L. Rev.1546, 1551 (1991). State actors controlling gates to opportunity, we have instructed, may not exclude qualified individuals based on "fixed notions concerning the roles and abilitiesof males and females." Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458U. S., at 725; see J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 139, n. 11 (equal protection principles, as applied to gender classifications, mean518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT542 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtstate actors may not rely on "overbroad" generalizations tomake "judgments about people that are likely to . . . perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination").It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that mostwomen would not choose VMI's adversative method. AsFourth Circuit Judge Motz observed, however, in her dissentfrom the Court of Appeals' denial of rehearing en banc, it isalso probable that "many men would not want to be educatedin such an environment." 52 F. 3d, at 93. (On that point,even our dissenting colleague might agree.) Education, tobe sure, is not a "one size fits all" business. The issue, however, is not whether "women--or men--should be forced toattend VMI"; rather, the question is whether the Commonwealth can constitutionally deny to women who have the willand capacity, the training and attendant opportunities thatVMI uniquely affords.Ibid.The notion that admission of women would downgradeVMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it,even the school,11 is a judgment hardly proved,12 a prediction11 See post, at 566, 598-599, 603. Forecasts of the same kind were maderegarding admission of women to the federal military academies. See,e. g., Hearings on H. R. 9832 et al. before Subcommittee No. 2 of the HouseCommittee on Armed Services, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 137 (1975) (statement of Lt. Gen. A. P. Clark, Superintendent of U. S. Air Force Academy)("It is my considered judgment that the introduction of female cadets willinevitably erode this vital atmosphere."); id., at 165 (statement of Hon.H. H. Callaway, Secretary of the Army) ("Admitting women to West Pointwould irrevocably change the Academy. . . . The Spartan atmosphere--which is so important to producing the final product--would surely bediluted, and would in all probability disappear.").12 See 766 F. Supp., at 1413 (describing testimony of expert witnessDavid Riesman: "[I]f VMI were to admit women, it would eventually findit necessary to drop the adversative system altogether, and adopt a system that provides more nurturing and support for the students."). Suchjudgments have attended, and impeded, women's progress toward fullcitizenship stature throughout our Nation's history. Speaking in 1879in support of higher education for females, for example, Virginia StateSenator C. T. Smith of Nelson recounted that legislation proposed to pro518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT543Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courthardly different from other "self-fulfilling prophec[ies]," seeMississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 730, once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities. When womenfirst sought admission to the bar and access to legal education, concerns of the same order were expressed. For exam-ple, in 1876, the Court of Common Pleas of Hennepin County,Minnesota, explained why women were thought ineligible forthe practice of law. Women train and educate the young,the court said, which"forbids that they shall bestow that time (early and late)and labor, so essential in attaining to the eminence towhich the true lawyer should ever aspire. It cannottherefore be said that the opposition of courts to theadmission of females to practice . . . is to any extent theoutgrowth of . . . `old fogyism[.]' . . . [I]t arises ratherfrom a comprehension of the magnitude of the responsi-bilities connected with the successful practice of law, anda desire to grade up the profession." In re Applicationof Martha Angle Dorsett to Be Admitted to Practice asAttorney and Counselor at Law (Minn. C. P. HennepinCty., 1876), in The Syllabi, Oct. 21, 1876, pp. 5, 6 (emphasis added).A like fear, according to a 1925 report, accounted for Colum-bia Law School's resistance to women's admission, although"[t]he faculty . . . never maintained that women couldnot master legal learning . . . . No, its argument hasbeen . . . more practical. If women were admitted totect the property rights of women had encountered resistance. 10 Educ.J. Va. 213 (1879).

By this notably circular argument, the "straightforward" test Mississippi Univ. for Women described, see 458U. S., at 724-725, was bent and bowed.The Commonwealth's misunderstanding and, in turn, theDistrict Court's, is apparent from VMI's mission: to produce"citizen-soldiers," individuals" `imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high senseof public service, advocates of the American democracyand free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend theircountry in time of national peril.'

S., at 731, that must be the solid base forany gender-defined classification.VIIn the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presentedits remedial plan--maintain VMI as a male-only college andcreate VWIL as a separate program for women. The planmet District Court approval. The Fourth Circuit, in turn,deferentially reviewed the Commonwealth's proposal anddecided that the two single-sex programs directly servedVirginia's reasserted purposes: single-gender education, and"achieving the results of an adversative method in a military environment." See 44 F. 3d, at 1236, 1239. Inspectingthe VMI and VWIL educational programs to determinewhether they "afford[ed] to both genders benefits compara-ble in substance, [if] not in form and detail,"id., at 1240,the Court of Appeals concluded that Virginia had arrangedfor men and women opportunities "sufficiently comparable"to survive equal protection evaluation,id., at 1240-1241.The United States challenges this "remedial" ruling as pervasively misguided.16 VMI has successfully managed another notable change. The schooladmitted its first African-American cadets in 1968. See The VMI Story347-349 (students no longer sing "Dixie," salute the Confederate flag orthe tomb of General Robert E.

S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the CourtAA remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit theconstitutional violation; it must be shaped to place personsunconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in"the position they would have occupied in the absence of[discrimination]." See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267,280 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional violation in this suit is the categorical exclusion ofwomen from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional ex-clusion, we have explained, aims to "eliminate [so far as possible] the discriminatory effects of the past" and to "bar likediscrimination in the future." Louisiana v. United States,380 U. S. 145, 154 (1965).Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched,VMI's exclusionary policy. For women only, however, Vir-ginia proposed a separate program, different in kind fromVMI and unequal in tangible and intangible facilities.17Having violated the Constitution's equal protection requirement, Virginia was obliged to show that its remedial pro-posal "directly address[ed] and relate[d] to" the violation, seeMilliken, 433 U. S., at 282, i. e., the equal protection deniedto women ready, willing, and able to benefit from educational17 As earlier observed, see supra, at 529, Judge Phillips, in dissent, measured Virginia's plan against a paradigm arrangement, one that "could survive equal protection scrutiny": single-sex schools with "substantiallycomparable curricular and extra-curricular programs, funding, physicalplant, administration and support services, . . . faculty[,] and library resources." 44 F. 3d 1229, 1250 (CA4 1995). Cf. Bray v. Lee, 337 F. Supp.934 (Mass. 1972) (holding inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clauseadmission of males to Boston's Boys Latin School with a test score of 120or higher (up to a top score of 200) while requiring a score, on the sametest, of at least 133 for admission of females to Girls Latin School, butnot ordering coeducation). Measuring VMI/VWIL against the paradigm,Judge Phillips said, "reveals how far short the [Virginia] plan falls fromproviding substantially equal tangible and intangible educational benefitsto men and women." 44 F. 3d, at 1250.518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT548 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtopportunities of the kind VMI offers. Virginia describedVWIL as a "parallel program," and asserted that VWILshares VMI's mission of producing "citizen-soldiers" andVMI's goals of providing "education, military training, mental and physical discipline, character . . . and leadership development." Brief for Respondents 24 (internal quotationmarks omitted). If the VWIL program could not "eliminatethe discriminatory effects of the past," could it at least "barlike discrimination in the future"? See Louisiana, 380U. S., at 154. A comparison of the programs said to be "parallel" informs our answer. In exposing the character of, anddifferences in, the VMI and VWIL programs, we recapitulate facts earlier presented. See supra, at 520-523, 526-527.VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience therigorous military training for which VMI is famed. See 766F. Supp., at 1413-1414 ("No other school in Virginia or inthe United States, public or private, offers the same kind ofrigorous military training as is available at VMI."); id., at1421 (VMI "is known to be the most challenging militaryschool in the United States"). Instead, the VWIL program"deemphasize[s]" military education, 44 F. 3d, at 1234, anduses a "cooperative method" of education "which reinforcesself-esteem," 852 F. Supp., at 476.VWIL students participate in ROTC and a "largely ceremonial" Virginia Corps of Cadets, see 44 F. 3d, at 1234, butVirginia deliberately did not make VWIL a military institute. The VWIL House is not a military-style residence andVWIL students need not live together throughout the 4-yearprogram, eat meals together, or wear uniforms during theschoolday. See 852 F. Supp., at 477, 495. VWIL studentsthus do not experience the "barracks" life "crucial to theVMI experience," the spartan living arrangements designedto foster an "egalitarian ethic." See 766 F. Supp., at 1423-1424. "[T]he most important aspects of the VMI educational experience occur in the barracks," the District Court518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT549Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtfound, id., at 1423, yet Virginia deemed that core experiencenonessential, indeed inappropriate, for training its femalecitizen-soldiers.VWIL students receive their "leadership training" in seminars, externships, and speaker series, see 852 F. Supp., at477, episodes and encounters lacking the "[p]hysical rigor,mental stress, . . . minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values" made hallmarks of VMI'scitizen-soldier training, see 766 F. Supp., at 1421.18 Keptaway from the pressures, hazards, and psychological bondingcharacteristic of VMI's adversative training, see id., at 1422,VWIL students will not know the "feeling of tremendousaccomplishment" commonly experienced by VMI's successfulcadets, id., at 1426.Virginia maintains that these methodological differencesare "justified pedagogically," based on "important differences between men and women in learning and developmental needs," "psychological and sociological differences"Virginia describes as "real" and "not stereotypes." Brieffor Respondents 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).The Task Force charged with developing the leadership program for women, drawn from the staff and faculty at MaryBaldwin College, "determined that a military model and,especially VMI's adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training most women." 852F. Supp., at 476 (emphasis added). See also 44 F. 3d, at1233-1234 (noting Task Force conclusion that, while "somewomen would be suited to and interested in [a VMI-styleexperience]," VMI's adversative method "would not be effective for women as a group" (emphasis added)).

VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtmonwealth embraced the Task Force view, as did expertwitnesses who testified for Virginia. See 852 F. Supp.,at 480-481.As earlier stated, see supra, at 541-542, generalizationsabout "the way women are," estimates of what is appropriateformost women, no longer justify denying opportunity towomen whose talent and capacity place them outside theaverage description. Notably, Virginia never assertedthat VMI's method of education suits most men. It is alsorevealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make theVWIL experience "the entirely militaristic experience ofVMI" on the ground that VWIL "is planned for women whodo not necessarily expect to pursue military careers." 852F. Supp., at 478. By that reasoning, VMI's "entirely milita-ristic" program would be inappropriate for men in generalor as a group, for "[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets entercareer military service." See 766 F. Supp., at 1432.In contrast to the generalizations about women on whichVirginia rests, we note again these dispositive realities:VMI's "implementing methodology" is not "inherently un-suitable to women," 976 F. 2d, at 899; "some women . . . dowell under [the] adversative model," 766 F. Supp., at 1434(internal quotation marks omitted); "some women, at least,would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,"id., at 1414; "some women are capable of all of the individualactivities required of VMI cadets," id., at 1412, and "canmeet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men,"976 F. 2d, at 896. It is on behalf of these women that theUnited States has instituted this suit, and it is for them thata remedy must be crafted,19 a remedy that will end their19 Admitting women to VMI would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in livingarrangements, and to adjust aspects of the physical training programs.See Brief for Petitioner 27-29; cf. note following 10 U.

VWIL's student body, faculty, course offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI's.Nor can the VWIL graduate anticipate the benefits associated with VMI's 157-year history, the school's prestige, andits influential alumni network.Mary Baldwin College, whose degree VWIL students willgain, enrolls first-year women with an average combinedSAT score about 100 points lower than the average score forVMI freshmen. 852 F.

D.'s," id., at 502, andreceives substantially lower salaries, see Tr. 158 (testimonyof James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College), than thefaculty at VMI.Mary Baldwin does not offer a VWIL student the rangeof curricular choices available to a VMI cadet. VMI awardsbaccalaureate degrees in liberal arts, biology, chemistry, civilengineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. See 852 F. Supp., at 503; Virginia Military Institute: More than an Education 11 (Govt. exh. 75,and Air Force Academies "shall be the same as those required for maleindividuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in suchstandards required because of physiological differences between male andfemale individuals"). Experience shows such adjustments are manageable. See U. S. Military Academy, A. Vitters, N. Kinzer, & J. Adams, Report of Admission of Women (Project Athena I-IV) (1977-1980) (4-yearlongitudinal study of the admission of women to West Point); Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, Report on the Integrationand Performance of Women at West Point 17-18 (1992).518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT552 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtlodged with Clerk of this Court). VWIL students attend aschool that "does not have a math and science focus," 852F. Supp., at 503; they cannot take at Mary Baldwin anycourses in engineering or the advanced math and physicscourses VMI offers, see id., at 477.For physical training, Mary Baldwin has "two multipurpose fields" and "[o]ne gymnasium." Id., at 503. VMIhas "an NCAA competition level indoor track and field facility; a number of multi-purpose fields; baseball, soccer andlacrosse fields; an obstacle course; large boxing, wrestlingand martial arts facilities; an 11-laps-to-the-mile indoor running course; an indoor pool; indoor and outdoor rifle ranges;and a football stadium that also contains a practice field andoutdoor track." Ibid.Although Virginia has represented that it will provideequal financial support for in-state VWIL students and VMIcadets, id., at 483, and the VMI Foundation has agreed toendow VWIL with $5.4625 million, id., at 499, the differencebetween the two schools' financial reserves is pronounced.Mary Baldwin's endowment, currently about $19 million, willgain an additional $35 million based on future commitments;VMI's current endowment, $131 million--the largest publiccollege per-student endowment in the Nation--will gain $220million. Id., at 503.The VWIL student does not graduate with the advantageof a VMI degree. Her diploma does not unite her with thelegions of VMI "graduates [who] have distinguished themselves" in military and civilian life. See 976 F. 2d, at 892-893. "[VMI] alumni are exceptionally close to the school,"and that closeness accounts, in part, for VMI's success inattracting applicants. See 766 F. Supp., at 1421. A VWILgraduate cannot assume that the "network of business owners, corporations, VMI graduates and non-graduate employers . . . interested in hiring VMI graduates," 852 F. Supp., at499, will be equally responsive to her search for employment,518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT553Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtsee 44 F. 3d, at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting) ("the powerfulpolitical and economic ties of the VMI alumni network cannotbe expected to open" for graduates of the fledgling VWILprogram).Virginia, in sum, while maintaining VMI for men only, hasfailed to provide any "comparable single-gender women'sinstitution." Id., at 1241. Instead, the Commonwealth hascreated a VWIL program fairly appraised as a "pale shadow"of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and facultystature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence.See id., at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting).Virginia's VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedyTexas proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trialcourt's 1946 ruling that, given the equal protection guarantee, African-Americans could not be denied a legal educationat a state facility. See Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629(1950). Reluctant to admit African-Americans to its flagshipUniversity of Texas Law School, the State set up a separateschool for Heman Sweatt and other black law students. Id.,at 632. As originally opened, the new school had no independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation. Id.,at 633. Nevertheless, the state trial and appellate courtswere satisfied that the new school offered Sweatt opportunities for the study of law "substantially equivalent to thoseoffered by the State to white students at the University ofTexas." Id., at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted).Before this Court considered the case, the new school hadgained "a faculty of five full-time professors; a student bodyof 23; a library of some 16,500 volumes serviced by a full-timestaff; a practice court and legal aid association; and one alumnus who ha[d] become a member of the Texas Bar." Id., at633. This Court contrasted resources at the new schoolwith those at the school from which Sweatt had been excluded. The University of Texas Law School had a full-timefaculty of 16, a student body of 850, a library containing over518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT554 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIAOpinion of the Court65,000 volumes, scholarship funds, a law review, and mootcourt facilities. Id., at 632-633.More important than the tangible features, the Court em-phasized, are "those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness" in a school,including "reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing inthe community, traditions and prestige."Id., at 634. Fac-ing the marked differences reported in the Sweatt opinion,the Court unanimously ruled that Texas had not shown "sub-stantial equality in the [separate] educational opportunities"the State offered. Id., at 633. Accordingly, the Court held,the Equal Protection Clause required Texas to admit AfricanAmericans to the University of Texas Law School. Id., at636. In line withSweatt, we rule here that Virginia hasnot shown substantial equality in the separate educationalopportunities the Commonwealth supports at VWIL andVMI.CWhen Virginia tendered its VWIL plan, the Fourth Circuitdid not inquire whether the proposed remedy, approved bythe District Court, placed women denied the VMI advantagein "the position they would have occupied in the absence of[discrimination]." Milliken, 433 U. S., at 280 (internal quo-tation marks omitted). Instead, the Court of Appeals considered whether the Commonwealth could provide, with fi-delity to the equal protection principle, separate and unequaleducational programs for men and women.The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that "the VWIL degreefrom Mary Baldwin College lacks the historical benefit andprestige of a degree from VMI." 44 F. 3d, at 1241. TheCourt of Appeals further observed that VMI is "an ongoingand successful institution with a long history," and there remains no "comparable single-gender women's institution."Ibid. Nevertheless, the appeals court declared the substan-tially different and significantly unequal VWIL program sat518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT555Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Courtisfactory. The court reached that result by revising the ap-plicable standard of review. The Fourth Circuit displacedthe standard developed in our precedent, see supra, at 532-534, and substituted a standard of its own invention.We have earlier described the deferential review in whichthe Court of Appeals engaged, seesupra, at 528-529, a brandof review inconsistent with the more exacting standard ourprecedent requires, see supra, at 532-534. Quoting in partfrom Mississippi Univ. for Women, the Court of Appealscandidly described its own analysis as one capable of check-ing a legislative purpose ranked as "pernicious," but generally according "deference to [the] legislative will." 44 F. 3d,at 1235, 1236. Recognizing that it had extracted from ourdecisions a test yielding "little or no scrutiny of the effectof a classification directed at [single-gender education]," theCourt of Appeals devised another test, a "substantive com-parability" inquiry,id., at 1237, and proceeded to find thatnew test satisfied, id., at 1241.The Fourth Circuit plainly erred in exposing Virginia'sVWIL plan to a deferential analysis, for "all gender-basedclassifications today" warrant "heightened scrutiny." SeeJ. E. B., 511 U. S., at 136. Valuable as VWIL may prove forstudents who seek the program offered, Virginia's remedyaffords no cure at all for the opportunities and advantageswithheld from women who want a VMI education and canmake the grade. See supra, at 549-554.20 In sum, Virginia's20 Virginia's prime concern, it appears, is that "plac[ing] men and womeninto the adversative relationship inherent in the VMI program . . . woulddestroy, at least for that period of the adversative training, any sense ofdecency that still permeates the relationship between the sexes." 44 F.3d, at 1239; see supra, at 540-546. It is an ancient and familiar fear.Compare In re Lavinia Goodell, 39 Wis. 232, 246 (1875) (denying femaleapplicant's motion for admission to the bar of its court, Wisconsin SupremeCourt explained: "Discussions are habitually necessary in courts of justice,which are unfit for female ears.

VIRGINIAOpinion of the Courtremedy does not match the constitutional violation; the Com-monwealth has shown no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for withholding from women qualified for the experi-ence premier training of the kind VMI affords.VIIA generation ago, "the authorities controlling Virginiahigher education," despite long established tradition, agreed"to innovate and favorably entertain[ed] the [then] relativelynew idea that there must be no discrimination by sex in offering educational opportunity." Kirstein, 309 F. Supp., at186. Commencing in 1970, Virginia opened to women "educational opportunities at the Charlottesville campus that[were] not afforded in other [state-operated] institutions."Id., at 187; see supra, at 538. A federal court approved theCommonwealth's innovation, emphasizing that the University of Virginia "offer[ed] courses of instruction . . . not available elsewhere." 309 F. Supp., at 187. The court furthernoted: "[T]here exists at Charlottesville a `prestige' factorEighth Circuit Judicial Conference, Colorado Springs, Colo., July 17, 1987)(footnotes omitted):"Plato questioned whether women should be afforded equal opportunityto become guardians, those elite Rulers of Platonic society. Ironically, inthat most undemocratic system of government, the Republic, women's native ability to serve as guardians was not seriously questioned. The concern was over the wrestling and exercise class in which all candidates forguardianship had to participate, for rigorous physical and mental trainingwere prerequisites to attain the exalted status of guardian. And in accord with Greek custom, those exercise classes were conducted in thenude. Plato concluded that their virtue would clothe the women's nakedness and that Platonic society would not thereby be deprived of the talentof qualified citizens for reasons of mere gender."For Plato's full text on the equality of women, see 2 The Dialogues of Plato302-312 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953). Virginia, not bound to ancientGreek custom in its "rigorous physical and mental training" programs,could more readily make the accommodations necessary to draw on "thetalent of [all] qualified citizens."

S. 515 (1996)Opinion of the Court[not paralleled in] other Virginia educational institutions."Ibid.VMI, too, offers an educational opportunity no other Vir-ginia institution provides, and the school's "prestige"--associated with its success in developing "citizen-soldiers"--isunequaled. Virginia has closed this facility to its daughtersand, instead, has devised for them a "parallel program," witha faculty less impressively credentialed and less well paid,more limited course offerings, fewer opportunities for mili-tary training and for scientific specialization. Cf.Sweatt,339 U. S., at 633. VMI, beyond question, "possesses to a fargreater degree" than the VWIL program "those qualitieswhich are incapable of objective measurement but whichmake for greatness in a . . . school," including "positionand influence of the alumni, standing in the community, tra-ditions and prestige."Id., at 634. Women seeking and fitfor a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less,under the Commonwealth's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.A prime part of the history of our Constitution, historianRichard Morris recounted, is the story of the extension ofconstitutional rights and protections to people once ignoredor excluded.21 VMI's story continued as our comprehension of "We the People" expanded. See supra, at 532, n. 6.21 R. Morris, The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789, p. 193 (1987); see id.,at 191, setting out letter to a friend from Massachusetts patriot (latersecond President) John Adams, on the subject of qualifications for votingin his home State:"[I]t is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters;there will be no end of it. New claims will arise; women will demand avote; lads from twelve to twenty-one will think their rights not enoughattended to; and every man who has not a farthing, will demand an equalvoice with any other, in all acts of state.
