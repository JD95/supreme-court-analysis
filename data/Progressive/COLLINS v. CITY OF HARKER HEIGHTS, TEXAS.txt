The question presented is whether $ 1 of the Civil RightsAct of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, provides aremedy for a municipal employee who is fatally injured inthe course of his employment because the city customarilyfailed to train or warn its employees about known hazardsin the workplace. Even though the city's conduct may beactionable under state law, we hold that $ 1983 does notapply because such conduct does not violate the Due Process Clause.On October 21, 1988, Larry Michael Collins, an employeein the sanitation department of the city of Harker Heights,Texas, died of asphyxia after entering a manhole to unstop asewer line. Petitioner, his widow, brought this action alleg-ing that Collins "had a constitutional right to be free fromunreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotionsand a constitutional right to be protected from the City ofHarker Heights' custom and policy of deliberate indifferencetoward the safety of its employees." App. 7. Her complaint alleged that the city violated that right by following acustom and policy of not training its employees about thedangers of working in sewer lines and manholes, not provid-ing safety equipment at jobsites, and not providing safetywarnings. The complaint also alleged that a prior incident*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union et al. by Edward Tuddenham, J. Patrick Wiseman,Steven R.

Ibid. The District Court dismissed thecomplaint on the ground that a constitutional violation hadnot been alleged. No. W-89-CA-168 (WD Tex., Oct. 30,1988), App. 20. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuitaffirmed on a different theory. 916 F. 2d 284 (1990). It didnot reach the question whether the city had violated Collins'constitutional rights because it denied recovery on theground that there had been no "abuse of governmentalpower," which the Fifth Circuit had found to be a necessaryelement of a $ 1983 action.2 Id., at 287-288, and n. 3.1 In particular, the complaint alleged that "[p]rior to October, 1988, theCity of Harker Heights was on notice of the dangers to which the employees were exposed because Larry Michael Collins' supervisor had been rendered unconscious in a manhole several months prior to October, 1988, infact, several months before Larry Michael Collins began work at the Cityof Harker Heights." App. 7.2 The Court of Appeals explained:"The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff seeking recovery under $ 1983 for injury to a governmental employee must demonstrate, inter alia, that the conduct in issue was an abuse of governmentalpower. More particularly, does alleged wrongful conduct by government--in its capacity as employer rather than as a governing authority--that deprives its employee of an alleged constitutional right give rise to a$ 1983 action? We base our holding on the abuse of government powerstandard, separate from the constitutional deprivation element or standard. The district court appears to have merged those two standards,which are among those necessary for bringing $ 1983 into play here. Inreviewing this Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we will keep them separate.. . . . ."In this Circuit, there is a separate standard that must also be satisfied--an abuse of government power. While this element is in many ways similar to, and often blends with, other necessary elements for a $ 1983 action,such as deprivation of a constitutional right, and springs from the samesources as the deprivation element, it is separate nonetheless." 916 F. 2d,at 286-287.503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT119Cite as: 503 U. S. 115 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe contrary decision in Ruge v. Bellevue, 892 F. 2d 738(CA8 1989), together with our concern about the Court ofAppeals' interpretation of the statute, prompted our grantof certiorari, 499 U. S. 958 (1991).IOur cases do not support the Court of Appeals' reading of$ 1983 as requiring proof of an abuse of governmental powerseparate and apart from the proof of a constitutional viola-tion. Although the statute provides the citizen with an effective remedy against those abuses of state power that vio-late federal law, it does not provide a remedy for abuses thatdo not violate federal law, see, e. g., Martinez v. California,444 U. S. 277 (1980);DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept.of Social Services, 489 U. S. 189 (1989). More importantly,the statute does not draw any distinction between abusiveand nonabusive federal violations.The Court of Appeals' analysis rests largely on the factthat the city had, through allegedly tortious conduct, harmedone of its employees rather than an ordinary citizen overwhom it exercised governmental power. The employmentrelationship, however, is not of controlling significance. Onthe one hand, if the city had pursued a policy of equally deliberate indifference to the safety of pedestrians that re-sulted in a fatal injury to one who inadvertently stepped intoan open manhole, the Court of Appeals' holding would notspeak to this situation at all, although it would seem that aclaim by such a pedestrian should be analyzed in a similarmanner as the claim by this petitioner. On the other hand,a logical application of the holding might also bar potentiallymeritorious claims by employees if, for example, the city hadgiven an employee a particularly dangerous assignment inretaliation for a political speech, cf.St. Louis v. Praprotnik,485 U. S. 112 (1988), or because of his or her gender, cf. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658(1978). The First Amendment, the Equal Protection and503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT120 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the CourtDue Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, andother provisions of the Federal Constitution afford protection to employees who serve the government as well as tothose who are served by them, and $ 1983 provides a causeof action for all citizens injured by an abridgment of thoseprotections. Neither the fact that petitioner's decedent wasa government employee nor the characterization of the city'sdeliberate indifference to his safety as something other thanan "abuse of governmental power" is a sufficient reason forrefusing to entertain petitioner's federal claim under $ 1983.Nevertheless, proper analysis requires us to separate twodifferent issues when a $ 1983 claim is asserted against a municipality: (1) whether plaintiff 's harm was caused by a con-stitutional violation, and (2) if so, whether the city is responsible for that violation. See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,471 U. S. 808, 817 (1985) (opinion ofRehnquist, J.); id., at828-829 (opinion of Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Because most of our opinions discuss-ing municipal policy have involved the latter issue, it isappropriate to discuss it before considering the questionwhether petitioner's complaint has alleged a constitutionalviolation. IISection 1983 provides a remedy against "any person" who,under color of state law, deprives another of rights protectedby the Constitution.3 In Monell, the Court held that Con-gress intended municipalities and other local governmententities to be included among those persons to whom $ 1983applies. 436 U. S., at 690. At the same time, the Court3 The section states, in relevant part:"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, anycitizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to theparty injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceedingfor redress. . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT121Cite as: 503 U. S. 115 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmade it clear that municipalities may not be held liable "un-less action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort." Id., at 691.4 The Courtemphasized that"a municipality cannot be held liable solely because itemploys a tortfeasor--or, in other words, a municipalitycannot be held liable under $ 1983 on a respondeat supe-rior theory.. . . . ."[T]herefore, . . . a local government may not be suedunder $ 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a gov-ernment's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly besaid to represent official policy, inflicts the injury thatthe government as an entity is responsible under$ 1983."Id., at 691, 694 (emphasis in original).In a series of later cases, the Court has consideredwhether an alleged injury caused by municipal employeesacting under color of state law provided a proper basis forimposing liability on a city. In each of those cases the Courtassumed that a constitutional violation had been adequatelyalleged or proved and focused its attention on the separateissue of municipal liability. Thus, for example, in OklahomaCity v. Tuttle, supra, it was assumed that a police officer hadviolated the decedent's constitutional rights, but we held thatthe wrongful conduct of a single officer without any policy-making authority did not establish municipal policy. And inSt. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112 (1988), without reach4 Petitioners in Monell, a class of female employees of the New YorkCity Department of Social Services and Board of Education, alleged thatthe board and department violated their due process rights by implementing an official policy that compelled pregnant employees to take unpaidleaves of absences before such leaves were required for medical reasons.436 U. S., at 660-661.503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT122 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the Courting the question whether the adverse employment actiontaken against the plaintiff violated his First Amendmentrights, the Court concluded that decisions by subordinateemployees did not necessarily reflect official policy. On theother hand, in Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469 (1986),the Court held that a county was responsible for unconstitutional actions taken pursuant to decisions made by thecounty prosecutor and the county sheriff because they werethe "officials responsible for establishing final policy with re-spect to the subject matter in question,"id., at 483-484.Our purpose in citing these cases is to emphasize the separate character of the inquiry into the question of municipalresponsibility and the question whether a constitutional violation occurred. It was necessary to analyze whether execu-tion of a municipal policy inflicted the injury in these casesbecause, unlike ordinary tort litigation, the doctrine of respondeat superior was inapplicable. The city is not vicari-ously liable under $ 1983 for the constitutional torts of itsagents: It is only liable when it can be fairly said that thecity itself is the wrongdoer. Because petitioner in this caserelies so heavily on our reasoning in Canton v. Harris, 489U. S. 378 (1989)--and in doing so, seems to assume that thecase dealt with the constitutional issue--it is appropriate tocomment specifically on that case.In Canton we held that a municipality can, in some cir-cumstances, be held liable under $ 1983 "for constitutionalviolations resulting from its failure to train municipal em-ployees." Id., at 380. Among the claims advanced by theplaintiff in that case was a violation of the "right, under theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to receive necessary medical attention while in police custody."Id., at 381.5 Because we assumed, arguendo, that the plain5 "At the close of the evidence, the District Court submitted the case tothe jury, which rejected all of Mrs. Harris' claims except one: her $ 1983claim against the city resulting from its failure to provide her with medi503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT123Cite as: 503 U. S. 115 (1992)Opinion of the Courttiff 's constitutional right to receive medical care had beendenied, id., at 388-389, n. 8, our opinion addressed only thequestion whether the constitutional deprivation was attrib-utable to a municipal policy or custom.We began our analysis by plainly indicating that we werenot deciding the constitutional issue."In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services,436 U. S. 658 (1978), we decided that a municipality canbe found liable under $ 1983 only where the municipalityitself causes the constitutional violation at issue. Re-spondeat superior or vicarious liability will not attachunder $ 1983. Id., at 694-695. `It is only when the"execution of the government's policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury" that the municipality may be heldliable under $ 1983.'Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S. 257,267 (1987) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (quoting Monell,supra, at 694)."Thus, our first inquiry in any case alleging municipalliability under $ 1983 is the question whether there is adirect causal link between a municipal policy or customand the alleged constitutional deprivation." Id., at 385.We did not suggest that all harm-causing municipal policiesare actionable under $ 1983 or that all such policies are unconstitutional. Moreover, we rejected the city's argumentthat only unconstitutional policies can create municipal liability under the statute. Id., at 387. Instead, we concludedthat if a city employee violates another's constitutionalrights, the city may be liable if it had a policy or custom offailing to train its employees and that failure to train causedthe constitutional violation. In particular, we held that theinadequate training of police officers could be characterizedas the cause of the constitutional tort if--and only if--thecal treatment while in custody." Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S., at 382 (emphasis added).503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT124 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the Courtfailure to train amounted to "deliberate indifference" to therights of persons with whom the police come into contact.Id., at 388.6Although the term "deliberate indifference" has been usedin other contexts to define the threshold for finding a violation of the Eighth Amendment, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429U. S. 97, 104 (1976), as we have explained, that term wasused in the Canton case for the quite different purpose ofidentifying the threshold for holding a city responsible forthe constitutional torts committed by its inadequatelytrained agents.7 In this case, petitioner has used that termto characterize the city's failure to train the employees inits sanitation department. We assume for the purpose ofdecision that the allegations in the complaint are sufficientto provide a substitute for the doctrine of respondeat superior as a basis for imposing liability on the city for the tortious conduct of its agents, but that assumption does not confront the question whether the complaint has alleged aconstitutional violation. To that question we now turn.6 We added:"Only where a municipality's failure to train its employees in a relevantrespect evidences a `deliberate indifference' to the rights of its inhabitantscan such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city `policy or custom'that is actionable under $ 1983.. . . . ."Consequently, while claims such as respondent's--alleging that thecity's failure to provide training to municipal employees resulted in theconstitutional deprivation she suffered--are cognizable under $ 1983, theycan only yield liability against a municipality where that city's failure totrain reflects deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its inhabitants." Id., at 389, 392.7 Indeed, we expressly stated: "The `deliberate indifference' standard weadopt for $ 1983 `failure to train' claims does not turn upon the degree offault (if any) that a plaintiff must show to make out an underlying claimof a constitutional violation." Id., at 388, n. 8.503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT125Cite as: 503 U. S. 115 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIIIPetitioner's constitutional claim rests entirely on the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.8 The mostfamiliar office of that Clause is to provide a guarantee of fairprocedure in connection with any deprivation of life, liberty,or property by a State. Petitioner, however, does not advance a procedural due process claim in this case. Instead,she relies on the substantive component of the Clause thatprotects individual liberty against "certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used toimplement them."Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331(1986).As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctantto expand the concept of substantive due process becauseguideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. Regents of Univ. ofMich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225-226 (1985). The doctrineof judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmostcare whenever we are asked to break new ground in thisfield. It is important, therefore, to focus on the allegationsin the complaint to determine how petitioner describes theconstitutional right at stake and what the city allegedly didto deprive her husband of that right.A fair reading of petitioner's complaint does not chargethe city with a willful violation of Collins' rights. Petitionerdoes not claim that the city or any of its agents deliberatelyharmed her husband. In fact, she does not even allege thathis supervisor instructed him to go into the sewer when thesupervisor knew or should have known that there was a significant risk that he would be injured. Instead, she makesthe more general allegation that the city deprived him of8 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states: "norshall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without dueprocess of law."503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT126 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the Courtlife and liberty by failing to provide a reasonably safe workenvironment.9 Fairly analyzed, her claim advances two theories: that the Federal Constitution imposes a duty on thecity to provide its employees with minimal levels of safetyand security in the workplace, or that the city's "deliberateindifference" to Collins' safety was arbitrary governmentaction that must "shock the conscience" of federal judges.Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 172 (1952).Neither the text nor the history of the Due Process Clausesupports petitioner's claim that the governmental employer'sduty to provide its employees with a safe working environment is a substantive component of the Due Process Clause."[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendmentwas intended to prevent government `from abusing [its]power, or employing it as an instrument of oppression.' " DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489U. S., at 196 (quoting Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U. S. 344, 348(1986)). As we recognized in DeShaney:"The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State'spower to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security. It forbids the State itself todeprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without`due process of law,' but its language cannot fairly beextended to impose an affirmative obligation on theState to ensure that those interests do not come to harmthrough other means. Nor does history support such9 Petitioner alleges that her husband had "a constitutional right to befree from unreasonable risks of harm to his body, mind and emotions anda constitutional right to be protected from the City of Harker Heights'custom and policy of deliberate indifference toward the safety of its employees." App. 7. The city's policy and custom of not training its employees and not warning them of the danger allegedly caused Collins'death and thus deprived him of those rights.

S., at 195.10Petitioner's submission that the city violated a federal constitutional obligation to provide its employees with certainminimal levels of safety and security is unprecedented. Itis quite different from the constitutional claim advanced byplaintiffs in several of our prior cases who argued that theState owes a duty to take care of those who have alreadybeen deprived of their liberty. We have held, for example,that apart from the protection against cruel and unusual punishment provided by the Eighth Amendment, cf. Hutto v.Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978), the Due Process Clause of itsown force requires that conditions of confinement satisfy certain minimal standards for pretrial detainees, see Bell v.Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 535, n. 16, 545 (1979), for persons inmental institutions, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 315-316 (1982), for convicted felons,Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.78, 94-99 (1987), and for persons under arrest, see Revere v.Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U. S. 239, 244-245(1983). The "process" that the Constitution guarantees in10 "Historically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty,or property. E. g., Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97 (1878) (assessment of real estate); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (stomachpumping); Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535 (1971) (suspension of driver's license); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (paddling student); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984) (intentional destruction of inmate'sproperty). No decision of this Court before Parratt [v. Taylor, 451 U. S.527 (1981),] supported the view that negligent conduct by a state official,even though causing injury, constitutes a deprivation under the Due Process Clause. This history reflects the traditional and common-sense notionthat the Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta, seeCorwin, The Doctrine of Due Process of Law Before the Civil War, 24Harv. L. Rev. 366, 368 (1911), was `intended to secure the individual fromthe arbitrary exercise of the powers of government,' Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 527 (1884)." Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331(1986).503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT128 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the Courtconnection with any deprivation of liberty thus includes acontinuing obligation to satisfy certain minimal custodialstandards. See DeShaney, 489 U. S., at 200. Petitionercannot maintain, however, that the city deprived Collins ofhis liberty when it made, and he voluntarily accepted, anoffer of employment.We also are not persuaded that the city's alleged failure totrain its employees, or to warn them about known risks ofharm, was an omission that can properly be characterized asarbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.Petitioner's claim is analogous to a fairly typical state-lawtort claim: The city breached its duty of care to her husbandby failing to provide a safe work environment. Because theDue Process Clause "does not purport to supplant traditionaltort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liabilityfor injuries that attend living together in society," Danielsv. Williams, 474 U. S., at 332, we have previously rejectedclaims that the Due Process Clause should be interpreted toimpose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law, see, e. g., id., at 332-333;Baker v. McCollan, 443 U. S. 137, 146 (1979); Paul v. Davis,424 U. S. 693, 701 (1976). The reasoning in those cases applies with special force to claims asserted against public employers because state law, rather than the Federal Constitution, generally governs the substance of the employmentrelationship. See, e. g., Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 350(1976); Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S.564, 577-578 (1972).Our refusal to characterize the city's alleged omission inthis case as arbitrary in a constitutional sense rests on thepresumption that the administration of government programs is based on a rational decisionmaking process thattakes account of competing social, political, and economicforces. Cf. Walker v. Rowe, 791 F. 2d 507, 510 (CA7 1986).Decisions concerning the allocation of resources to individualprograms, such as sewer maintenance, and to particular as503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT129Cite as: 503 U. S. 115 (1992)Opinion of the Courtpects of those programs, such as the training and compensa-tion of employees, involve a host of policy choices that mustbe made by locally elected representatives, rather than byfederal judges interpreting the basic charter of Governmentfor the entire country. The Due Process Clause "is not aguarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions." Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S., at 350. Nor does it guar-antee municipal employees a workplace that is free of unreasonable risks of harm.Finally, we reject petitioner's suggestion that the TexasHazard Communication Act 11 supports her substantive dueprocess claim. We assume that the Act imposed a duty onthe city to warn its sanitation employees about the dangersof noxious gases in the sewers and to provide safety trainingand protective equipment to minimize those dangers.12 Wealso assume, as petitioner argues, that the Act created anentitlement that qualifies as a "liberty interest" protected bythe Due Process Clause. But even with these assumptions,petitioner's claim must fail for she has not alleged that thedeprivation of this liberty interest was arbitrary in the constitutional sense. Cf. Harrah Independent School Dist. v.11 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 5182b (Vernon 1987).12 Section 10(a) of the Act states, for example:"Every employer shall provide, at least annually, an education and training program for employees using or handling hazardous chemicals. . . .Additional instruction shall be provided when the potential for exposureto hazardous chemicals is altered or when new and significant informationis received by the employer concerning the hazards of a chemical. Newor newly assigned employees shall be provided training before workingwith or in a work area containing hazardous chemicals."And $ 15(a)states:"Employees who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals shall be informed of the exposure and shall have access to the workplace chemicallist and [material safety data sheets] for the hazardous chemicals. . . . Inaddition, employees shall receive training on the hazards of the chemicalsand on measures they can take to protect themselves from those hazardsand shall be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.These rights are guaranteed on the effective date of this Act."503us1$38I 11-13-95 21:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT130 COLLINS v. HARKER HEIGHTSOpinion of the CourtMartin, 440 U. S. 194, 198-199 (1979). The reasons why thecity's alleged failure to train and warn did not constitute aconstitutionally arbitrary deprivation of Collins' life, seesupra, at 128-129, apply a fortiori to the less significant liberty interest created by the Texas statute.In sum, we conclude that the Due Process Clause does notimpose an independent federal obligation upon municipalitiesto provide certain minimal levels of safety and security inthe workplace and the city's alleged failure to train or towarn its sanitation department employees was not arbitraryin a constitutional sense. The judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is therefore affirmed.
