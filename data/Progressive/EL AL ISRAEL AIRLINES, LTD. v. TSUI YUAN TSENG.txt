Plaintiff-respondent Tsui Yuan Tseng was subjected to anintrusive security search at John F. Kennedy InternationalAirport in New York before she boarded an El Al IsraelAirlines May 22, 1993 flight to Tel Aviv. Tseng seeks tortdamages from El Al for this occurrence. The episode-in-suit, both parties now submit, does not qualify as an "accident" within the meaning of the treaty popularly known asthe Warsaw Convention, which governs air carrier liabilityfor "all international transportation." 1 Tseng alleges psy-chic or psychosomatic injuries, but no "bodily injury," as thatterm is used in the Convention. Her case presents a ques-tion of the Convention's exclusivity: When the Conventionallows no recovery for the episode-in-suit, does it corre-spondingly preclude the passenger from maintaining an action for damages under another source of law, in this case,New York tort law?The exclusivity question before us has been settled pro-spectively in a Warsaw Convention protocol (Montreal Protocol No. 4) recently ratified by the Senate.2 In accord withthe protocol, Tseng concedes, a passenger whose injury isnot compensable under the Convention (because it entails no"bodily injury" or was not the result of an "accident") will*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Air TransportAssociation of America by Warren L.

We conclude thatthe protocol, to which the United States has now subscribed,clarifies, but does not change, the Convention's exclusivitydomain. We therefore hold that recovery for a personal injury suffered "on board [an] aircraft or in the course of anyof the operations of embarking or disembarking," Art. 17,49 Stat. 3018, if not allowed under the Convention, is notavailable at all.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled other-wise. In that court's view, a plaintiff who did not qualify forrelief under the Convention could seek relief under local lawfor an injury sustained in the course of international airtravel. 122 F. 3d 99 (1997). We granted certiorari, 523U. S. 1117 (1998),3 and now reverse the Second Circuit's judgment.

Id., at 408. In Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, 499U. S. 530 (1991), we held that mental or psychic injuries unaccompanied by physical injuries are not compensable underArticle 17 of the Convention, but declined to reach the question whether the Convention "provides the exclusive causeof action for injuries sustained during international airtransportation." Id., at 553. We resolve in this case thequestion on which we earlier reserved judgment.At the outset, we highlight key provisions of the treatywe are interpreting. Chapter I of the Warsaw Convention,entitled "Scope--Definitions," declares in Article 1(1) thatthe "[C]onvention shall apply to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft forhire." 49 Stat. 3014.4 Chapter III, entitled "Liability ofthe Carrier," defines in Articles 17, 18, and 19 the threekinds of liability for which the Convention provides. Article17 establishes the conditions of liability for personal injuryto passengers:"The carrier shall be liable for damage sustained inthe event of the death or wounding of a passenger orany other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if theaccident which caused the damage so sustained tookplace on board the aircraft or in the course of any of theoperations of embarking or disembarking." 49 Stat.3018.Article 18 establishes the conditions of liability for damageto baggage or goods.Id., at 3019.5 Article 19 establishes4 Citations in this opinion are to the official English translation of theConvention.

S. 392, 397 (1985).5 Article 18 provides, in relevant part:"(1) The carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of thedestruction or loss of, or of damage to, any checked baggage or any goods,if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place duringthe transportation by air." 49 Stat. 3019.525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN163Cite as: 525 U.

Id., at 3020.7IIWith the key treaty provisions as the backdrop, we nextdescribe the episode-in-suit. On May 22, 1993, Tsui YuanTseng arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport(hereinafter JFK) to board an El Al Israel Airlines flightto Tel Aviv. In conformity with standard El Al preboardingprocedures, a security guard questioned Tseng about herdestination and travel plans. The guard considered Tseng'sresponses "illogical," and ranked her as a "high risk" passenger. Tseng was taken to a private security room whereher baggage and person were searched for explosives anddetonating devices. She was told to remove her shoes,jacket, and sweater, and to lower her blue jeans to mid6 Article 19 provides:"The carrier shall be liable for damage occasioned by delay in the transportation by air of passengers, baggage, or goods." Ibid.7 Chapter III of the Convention sets forth a number of other rules governing air carrier liability. Among these, Article 20 relieves a carrier ofliability if it has "taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage."Ibid. Article 22 sets monetary limits on a carrier's liability for harm topassengers and baggage. See ibid. Article 23 invalidates "[a]ny [contract] provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lowerlimit than that which is laid down in th[e] [C]onvention." Id., at 3020.Article 25(1) renders the Convention's limits on liability inapplicable if thedamage is caused by a carrier's "wilful misconduct." Ibid.525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN164 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v. TSUI YUAN TSENGOpinion of the Courthip. A female security guard then searched Tseng's bodyoutside her clothes by hand and with an electronic securitywand.After the search, which lasted 15 minutes, El Al personneldecided that Tseng did not pose a security threat and allowedher to board the flight. Tseng later testified that she "wasreally sick and very upset" during the flight, that she was"emotionally traumatized and disturbed" during her monthlong trip in Israel, and that, upon her return, she underwentmedical and psychiatric treatment for the lingering effectsof the body search. 122 F. 3d 99, 101 (CA2 1997) (internalquotation marks omitted).Tseng filed suit against El Al in 1994 in a New York statecourt of first instance. Her complaint alleged a state-lawpersonal injury claim based on the May 22, 1993 episode atJFK. Tseng's pleading charged, inter alia, assault and falseimprisonment, but alleged no bodily injury. El Al removedthe case to federal court.The District Court, after a bench trial, dismissed Tseng'spersonal injury claim. See 919 F. Supp. 155 (SDNY 1996).That claim, the court concluded, was governed by Article 17of the Warsaw Convention, which creates a cause of actionfor personal injuries suffered as a result of an "accident . . .in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking," 49 Stat. 3018. See 919 F. Supp., at 157-158.Tseng's claim was not compensable under Article 17, the District Court stated, because Tseng "sustained no bodily injury" as a result of the search, id., at 158, and the Conventiondoes not permit "recovery for psychic or psychosomatic injury unaccompanied by bodily injury," ibid. (citing Floyd,499 U. S., at 552). The District Court further concluded thatTseng could not pursue her claim, alternately, under NewYork tort law; as that court read the Convention, Article24 shields the carrier from liability for personal injuries notcompensable under Article 17. See 919 F. Supp., at 158.525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN165Cite as: 525 U. S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 122F. 3d 99 (CA2 1997).8 The Second Circuit concluded firstthat no "accident" within Article 17's compass had occurred;in the Court of Appeals' view, the Convention drafters didnot "ai[m] to impose close to absolute liability" for an individ-ual's "personal reaction" to "routine operating procedures,"measures that, although "inconvenien[t] and embarass[ing],"are the "price passengers pay for . . . airline safety."Id., at103-104.9 In some tension with that reasoning, the Second8 The Court of Appeals affirmed, without discussion, the District Court'sjudgment in favor of Tseng on her claim, under the Warsaw Convention,for damage to her baggage. See 122 F. 3d, at 108. We denied El Al'spetition for certiorari regarding that issue. See 523 U. S. 1117 (1998).9 An "accident" under Article 17 is "an unexpected or unusual event orhappening that is external to the passenger." Saks, 470 U. S., at 405.That definition, we have cautioned, should "be flexibly applied after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger's injuries." Ibid.The District Court, "[u]sing the flexible application prescribed by theSupreme Court," concluded that El Al's search of Tseng was an "accident":"[A] routine search, applied erroneously to plaintiff in the course of embarking on the aircraft, is fairly accurately characterized as an accident."919 F. Supp. 155, 158 (SDNY 1996).The Court of Appeals disagreed. That court described securitysearches as "routine" in international air travel, part of a terrorismprevention effort that is "widely recognized and encouraged in the law,"and "the price passengers pay for the degree of airline safety so far afforded them." 122 F. 3d, at 103. The court observed that passengersreasonably should be aware of "routine operating procedures" of the kindEl Al conducts daily. Ibid. The risk of mistakes, i. e., that innocent persons will be erroneously searched, is "[i]nherent in any effort to detectmalefactors," the court explained. Ibid. Tseng thus encountered "ordinary events and procedures of air transportation," the court concluded,and not "an unexpected or unusual event." Id., at 104.It is questionable whether the Court of Appeals "flexibly applied" thedefinition of "accident" we set forth in Saks. Both parties, however, nowaccept the Court of Appeals' disposition of that issue. In any event, evenif El Al's search of Tseng was an "accident," the core question of theConvention's exclusivity would remain. The Convention provides forcompensation under Article 17 only when the passenger suffers "death,physical injury, or physical manifestation of injury," Eastern Airlines,525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v. TSUI YUAN TSENGOpinion of the CourtCircuit next concluded that the Convention does not shieldthe very same "routine operating procedures" from assessment under the diverse laws of signatory nations (and, in thecase of the United States, States within one Nation) governing assault and false imprisonment. See id., at 104.Article 24 of the Convention, the Court of Appeals said,"clearly states that resort to local law is precluded onlywhere the incident is `covered' by Article 17, meaning wherethere has been an accident, either on the plane or in thecourse of embarking or disembarking, which led to death,wounding or other bodily injury." Id., at 104-105. Thecourt found support in the drafting history of the Convention, which it construed to "indicate that national law wasintended to provide the passenger's remedy where the Convention did not expressly apply." Id., at 105. The SecondCircuit also rejected the argument that allowance of statelaw claims when the Convention does not permit recoverywould contravene the treaty's goal of uniformity. The courtread our decision in Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516U. S. 217 (1996), to "instruct specifically that the Conventionexpresses no compelling interest in uniformity that wouldwarrant . . . supplanting an otherwise applicable body oflaw." 122 F. 3d, at 107. IIIWe accept it as given that El Al's search of Tseng was notan "accident" within the meaning of Article 17, for the parties do not place that Court of Appeals conclusion at issue.Seesupra, at 165 and this page, n. 9. We also accept, againonly for purposes of this decision, that El Al's actions did notconstitute "wilful misconduct"; accordingly, we confront noissue under Article 25 of the Convention, seesupra, at 163,Inc. v. Floyd, 499 U. S. 530, 552 (1991), a condition that both the DistrictCourt and the Court of Appeals determined Tseng did not meet, see 919F. Supp., at 158; 122 F. 3d, at 104. The question whether the Conventionprecludes an action under local law when a passenger's claim fails to satisfy Article 17's conditions for liability does not turn on which of thoseconditions the claim fails to satisfy.525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN167Cite as: 525 U. S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the Courtn. 7.10 The parties do not dispute that the episode-in-suitoccurred in international transportation in the course ofembarking.Our inquiry begins with the text of Article 24, whichprescribes the exclusivity of the Convention's provisions forair carrier liability. "[I]t is our responsibility to give thespecific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with theshared expectations of the contracting parties."Saks,470 U. S., at 399. "Because a treaty ratified by the UnitedStates is not only the law of this land, see U. S. Const.,Art. II, $ 2, but also an agreement among sovereign powers,we have traditionally considered as aids to its interpretationthe negotiating and drafting history(travaux pre'paratoires)and the postratification understanding of the contractingparties." Zicherman, 516 U. S., at 226.Article 24 provides that "cases covered by article 17"--orin the governing French text, "les cas pre' vus a` l'article17"11--may "only be brought subject to the conditions and10 In the lower courts, Tseng urged that Article 25 took her case outsidethe Convention's limits on liability. Article 25, now altered by MontrealProtocol No. 4, concerned damage caused by "wilful misconduct." 49 Stat.3020. On that matter, the District Court found "no evidence and no basisfor inferring that [the selection of Tseng to be searched] was anythingmore than a mistake. Even if such a mistake can be characterized asmisconduct," the District Court added, "there is no basis for inferring thatit was wilful." 919 F. Supp., at 158. The Court of Appeals left the District Court's finding on the absence of "wilful misconduct" undisturbed.See 122 F. 3d, at 104. Tseng's brief in opposition to certiorari did not citeArticle 25. We agree with the United States, as amicus curiae, thatTseng has not preserved any argument putting Article 25 at issue in thisCourt. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 10.11 The french text of Article 24 reads:"(1) Dans les cas pre'vus aux articles 18 et 19 toute action en responsabilite', a` quelque titre que ce soit, ne peut e^tre exerce'e que dans les conditions et limites pre'vues par la pre'sente Convention."(2) Dans les cas pre'vus a` l'article 17, s'appliquent e'galement les dispositions de l'aline'a pre'ce'dent, sans pre'judice de la de'termination des personnes qui ont le droit d'agir et de leurs droits respectifs." 49 Stat. 3006.Literally translated, "les cas pre'vus a` l'article 17" means "the casesanticipated by Article 17," see The New Cassell's French Dictionary 132,525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN168 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v. TSUI YUAN TSENGOpinion of the Courtlimits set out in th[e] [C]onvention." 49 Stat. 3020. Thatprescription is not a model of the clear drafter's art. Werecognize that the words lend themselves to divergentinterpretation.In Tseng's view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals,"les cas pre' vus a` l'article 17" means those cases in which apassenger could actually maintain a claim for relief underArticle 17. So read, Article 24 would permit any passengerwhose personal injury suit did not satisfy the liability conditions of Article 17 to pursue the claim under local law.In El Al's view, on the other hand, and in the view of theUnited States as amicus curiae, "les cas pre' vus a` l'article17" refers generically to all personal injury cases stemmingfrom occurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking ordisembarking, and simply distinguishes that class of cases(Article 17 cases) from cases involving damaged luggage orgoods, or delay (which Articles 18 and 19 address). So read,Article 24 would preclude a passenger from asserting any airtransit personal injury claims under local law, includingclaims that failed to satisfy Article 17's liability conditions,notably, because the injury did not result from an "accident,"see Saks, 470 U. S., at 405, or because the "accident" did notresult in physical injury or physical manifestation of injury,see Floyd, 499 U. S., at 552.Respect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the Executive Branch concerning the meaning of an internationaltreaty. See Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano,457 U. S. 176, 184-185 (1982) ("Although not conclusive, themeaning attributed to treaty provisions by the Governmentagencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement isentitled to great weight."). We conclude that the Govern592 (D. Girard ed. 1973), or "the cases provided for by Article 17," seeThe Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary 645 (M. Corre'ard & V. Grundyeds. 1994).525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN169Cite as: 525 U. S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the Courtment's construction of Article 24 is most faithful to the Con-vention's text, purpose, and overall structure.AThe cardinal purpose of the Warsaw Convention, wehave observed, is to "achiev[e] uniformity of rules governing claims arising from international air transportation."Floyd, 499 U. S., at 552; see Zicherman, 516 U. S., at 230.The Convention signatories, in the treaty's preamble, spe-cifically "recognized the advantage of regulating in a uniformmanner the conditions of . . . the liability of the carrier." 49Stat. 3014. To provide the desired uniformity, Chapter IIIof the Convention sets out an array of liability rules which,the treaty declares, "apply to all international transportationof persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft." Ibid.In that Chapter, the Convention describes and defines thethree areas of air carrier liability (personal injuries in Article17, baggage or goods loss, destruction, or damage in Article18, and damage occasioned by delay in Article 19), the condi-tions exempting air carriers from liability (Article 20), themonetary limits of liability (Article 22), and the circum-stances in which air carriers may not limit liability (Articles23 and 25). See supra, at 162-163, and n. 7. Given theConvention's comprehensive scheme of liability rules andits textual emphasis on uniformity, we would be hard putto conclude that the delegates at Warsaw meant to subjectair carriers to the distinct, nonuniform liability rules of theindividual signatory nations.The Court of Appeals looked to our precedent for guidanceon this point, but it misperceived our meaning. It misreadour decision in Zicherman to say that the Warsaw Conven-tion expresses no compelling interest in uniformity thatwould warrant preempting an otherwise applicable body oflaw, here New York tort law. See 122 F. 3d, at 107;supra,at 166. Zicherman acknowledges that the Convention cen525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN170 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v. TSUI YUAN TSENGOpinion of the Courttrally endeavors "to foster uniformity in the law of interna-tional air travel." 516 U. S., at 230. It further recognizesthat the Convention addresses the question whether there isairline liabilityvel non. See id., at 231. The Zichermancase itself involved auxiliary issues: who may seek recoveryin lieu of passengers, and for what harms they may be com-pensated. Seeid., at 221, 227. Looking to the Convention'stext, negotiating and drafting history, contracting states'postratification understanding of the Convention, and scholarly commentary, the Court in Zicherman determined thatWarsaw drafters intended to resolvewhether there is liability, but to leave to domestic law (the local law identified bythe forum under its choice-of-law rules or approaches) determination of the compensatory damages available to thesuitor. See id., at 231.A complementary purpose of the Convention is to accommodate or balance the interests of passengers seeking recovery for personal injuries, and the interests of air carriersseeking to limit potential liability. Before the Warsaw accord, injured passengers could file suits for damages, subjectonly to the limitations of the forum's laws, including theforum's choice-of-law regime. This exposure inhibited thegrowth of the then-fledgling international airline industry.See Floyd, 499 U. S., at 546; Lowenfeld & Mendelsohn, TheUnited States and the Warsaw Convention, 80 Harv. L. Rev.497, 499-500 (1967). Many international air carriers at thattime endeavored to require passengers, as a condition of airtravel, to relieve or reduce the carrier's liability in case ofinjury. See Second International Conference on PrivateAeronautical Law, October 4-12, 1929, Warsaw, Minutes 47(R. Horner & D. Legrez transls. 1975) (hereinafter Minutes).The Convention drafters designed Articles 17, 22, and 24 ofthe Convention as a compromise between the interests of aircarriers and their customers worldwide. In Article 17 of theConvention, carriers are denied the contractual prerogativeto exclude or limit their liability for personal injury. In525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN171Cite as: 525 U. S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the CourtArticles 22 and 24, passengers are limited in the amount ofdamages they may recover, and are restricted in the claimsthey may pursue by the conditions and limits set out inthe Convention.Construing the Convention, as did the Court of Appeals,to allow passengers to pursue claims under local law whenthe Convention does not permit recovery could produce several anomalies. Carriers might be exposed to unlimited lia-bility under diverse legal regimes, but would be prevented,under the treaty, from contracting out of such liability. Pas-sengers injured physically in an emergency landing might besubject to the liability caps of the Convention, while thosemerely traumatized in the same mishap would be free to sueoutside of the Convention for potentially unlimited damages.The Court of Appeals' construction of the Convention wouldencourage artful pleading by plaintiffs seeking to opt out ofthe Convention's liability scheme when local law promisedrecovery in excess of that prescribed by the treaty. SeePotter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 98 F. 3d 881, 886 (CA5 1996).Such a reading would scarcely advance the predictabilitythat adherence to the treaty has achieved worldwide.12The Second Circuit feared that if Article 17 were read toexclude relief outside the Convention for Tseng, then a passenger injured by a malfunctioning escalator in the airline'sterminal would have no recourse against the airline, even ifthe airline recklessly disregarded its duty to keep the escalator in proper repair. See 122 F. 3d, at 107. As the UnitedStates pointed out in its amicus curiae submission, however,the Convention addresses and concerns, only and exclusively,12 The Court of Appeals recognized that the Convention aimed to "balance the interests of the passenger and the carrier," but concluded that,with the "increasing strength of the airline industry, the balance has properly shifted away from protecting the carrier and toward protecting thepassenger." 122 F. 3d, at 107. Postratification adjustments, however,are appropriately made by the treaty's signatories. See S. Exec. Rep.No. 105-20, at 5-6.525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN172 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v. TSUI YUAN TSENGOpinion of the Courtthe airline's liability for passenger injuries occurring "onboard the aircraft or in the course of any of the operationsof embarking or disembarking." Art. 17, 49 Stat. 3018; seeBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16. "[T]he Convention's preemptive effect on local law extends no furtherthan the Convention's own substantive scope."Ibid. Acarrier, therefore, "is indisputably subject to liability underlocal law for injuries arising outside of that scope: e. g., forpassenger injuries occurring before `any of the operations ofembarking' " or disembarking. Ibid. (quoting Article 17).Tseng raises a different concern. She argues that aircarriers will escape liability for their intentional torts if pas-sengers are not permitted to pursue personal injury claimsoutside of the terms of the Convention. See Brief forRespondent 15-16. But we have already cautioned that thedefinition of "accident" under Article 17 is an "unusual event. . .external to the passenger," and that "[t]his definitionshould be flexibly applied." Saks, 470 U. S., at 405 (emphasis added). In Saks, the Court concluded that no "accident"occurred because the injury there--a hearing loss--"indisputably result[ed] from the passenger's own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the air-craft." Id., at 406 (emphasis added). As we earlier noted,see supra, at 165-166, n. 9, Tseng and El Al chose not topursue in this Court the question whether an "accident"occurred, for an affirmative answer would still leave Tsengunable to recover under the treaty; she sustained no "bodilyinjury" and could not gain compensation under Article 17 forher solely psychic or psychosomatic injuries.BThe drafting history of Article 17 is consistent with ourunderstanding of the preemptive effect of the Convention.The preliminary draft of the Convention submitted to theconference at Warsaw made air carriers liable "in the case ofdeath, wounding, or any other bodily injury suffered by a525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN173Cite as: 525 U. S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the Courttraveler." Minutes 264; see Saks, 470 U. S., at 401. In thelater draft that prescribed what is now Article 17, airlineliability was narrowed to encompass only bodily injurycaused by an "accident." See Minutes 205. It is improbable that, at the same time the drafters narrowed the condi-tions of air carrier liability in Article 17, they intended, inArticle 24, to permit passengers to skirt those conditions bypursuing claims under local law.13Inspecting the drafting history, the Court of Appealsstressed a proposal made by the Czechoslovak delegation tostate in the treaty that, in the absence of a stipulation in theConvention itself, " `the provisions of laws and national rulesrelative to carriage in each [signatory] State shall apply.'

That proposal waswithdrawn upon amendment of the Convention's title to read:"Convention For The Unification Of Certain RulesRelating To International Transportation By Air."49 Stat. 3014 (emphasis added); see 122 F. 3d, at 105. TheSecond Circuit saw in this history an indication "that na-tional law was intended to provide the passenger's remedywhere the Convention did not expressly apply." 122 F. 3d,at 105.The British House of Lords, in Sidhu v. British Airwaysplc, [1997] 1 All E. R. 193, considered the same history, butfound it inconclusive. Inclusion of the word "certain" in theConvention's title, the Lords reasoned, accurately indicatedthat "the [C]onvention is concerned with certain rules only,not with all the rules relating to international carriage byair." Id., at 204. For example, the Convention does not say"anything . . . about the carrier's obligations of insurance,and in particular about compulsory insurance against thirdparty risks."Ibid. The Convention, in other words, is "a13 Sir Alfred Dennis of Great Britain stated at the Warsaw Conferencethat Article 24 is "a very important stipulation which touches the verysubstance of the Convention, because [it] excludes recourse to commonlaw."

As to those issues, the Lordsconcluded, "the aim of the [C]onvention is to unify." Ibid.Pointing to the overall understanding that the Convention'sobjective was to "ensure uniformity,"id., at 209, the Lordssuggested that the Czechoslovak delegation may have meantonly to underscore that national law controlled "chapters oflaw relating to international carriage by air with which the[C]onvention was not attempting to deal."

S. 155 (1999)Opinion of the CourtConvention's preemptive effect is clear: The treaty precludespassengers from bringing actions under local law when theycannot establish air carrier liability under the treaty. Revised Article 24, El Al urges and we agree, merely clarifies,it does not alter, the Convention's rule of exclusivity.Supporting the position that revised Article 24 providesfor preemption not earlier established, Tseng urges that federal preemption of state law is disfavored generally, and particularly when matters of health and safety are at stake.See Brief for Respondent 31-33. See also post, at 181 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("[A] treaty, like an Act of Congress,should not be construed to preempt state law unless its intent to do so is clear."). Tseng overlooks in this regard thatthe nation-state, not subdivisions within one nation, is thefocus of the Convention and the perspective of our treatypartners. Our home-centered preemption analysis, therefore, should not be applied, mechanically, in construing ourinternational obligations.Decisions of the courts of other Convention signatoriescorroborate our understanding of the Convention's preemptive effect. In Sidhu, the British House of Lords consideredand decided the very question we now face concerning theConvention's exclusivity when a passenger alleges psychological damages, but no physical injury, resulting from anoccurrence that is not an "accident" under Article 17. See1 All E. R., at 201, 207. Reviewing the text, structure, anddrafting history of the Convention, the Lords concluded thatthe Convention was designed to "ensure that, in all questionsrelating to the carrier's liability, it is the provisions of the[C]onvention which apply and that the passenger does nothave access to any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise, which may be available within theparticular country where he chooses to raise his action."Ibid. Courts of other nations bound by the Convention havealso recognized the treaty's encompassing preemptive ef525US1 Unit: $U12 [10-31-00 11:30:32] PAGES PGT: OPIN176 EL AL ISRAEL AIRLINES, LTD. v.

S., at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted). The text,drafting history, and underlying purpose of the Convention,in sum, counsel us to adhere to a view of the treaty's exclu-sivity shared by our treaty partners.* * *For the reasons stated, we hold that the Warsaw Conven-tion precludes a passenger from maintaining an action forpersonal injury damages under local law when her claim doesnot satisfy the conditions for liability under the Convention.Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.
