Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. TradesCouncil, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988).IOn February 23, 1998, petitioner Dewey Jones tossed aMolotov cocktail through a window into a home in FortWayne, Indiana, owned and occupied by his cousin. No onewas injured in the ensuing fire, but the blaze severely damaged the home. A federal grand jury returned a three-countindictment charging Jones with arson, 18 U. S. C. $ 844(i)(1994 ed., Supp. IV); using a destructive device during andin relation to a crime of violence (the arson), 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c); and making an illegal destructive device, 26 U. S. C.$ 5861(f). Jones was tried under that indictment in theNorthern District of Indiana and convicted by a jury on allthree counts.1 The District Court sentenced him, pursuantto the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, to a total prison termof 35 years, to be followed by five years of supervised release.The court also ordered Jones to pay $77,396.87 to the insurerof the damaged home as restitution for its loss. Jones appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitaffirmed the judgment of the District Court. 178 F. 3d 479(1999).Jones unsuccessfully urged, both before the District Courtand on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, that $ 844(i), when ap-plied to the arson of a private residence, exceeds the authority vested in Congress under the Commerce Clause of the1 The question on which we granted review refers solely to Jones's$ 844(i) conviction.

The word "fire," which did not appear in $ 844(i) asoriginally composed, was introduced by statutory amend-ment in 1982.4 As now worded, $ 844(i) (1994 ed., Supp. IV)reads in relevant part:"Whoever maliciously damages or destroys, or attemptsto damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,any building, vehicle, or other real or personal propertyused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activityaffecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be impris-oned for not less than 5 years and not more than 20years, fined under this title, or both . . . ."We previously construed $ 844(i) in Russell v.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe now confront a question that was not before the Courtin Russell: Does $ 844(i) cover property occupied and usedby its owner not for any commercial venture, but as a privateresidence. Is such a dwelling place, in the words of $ 844(i),"used in . . . any activity affecting . . . commerce"?In support of its argument that $ 844(i) reaches the arsonof an owner-occupied private residence, the Governmentrelies principally on the breadth of the statutory term"affecting . . . commerce," see Brief for United States 10,16-17, words that, when unqualified, signal Congress' intentto invoke its full authority under the Commerce Clause.But $ 844(i) contains the qualifying words "used in" acommerce-affecting activity. The key word is "used.""Congress did not define the crime described in $ 844(i) asthe explosion of a building whose damage or destructionmight affect interstate commerce . . . ."

Id., at 860-861. The HouseReport accompanying the final bill, we further noted in Russell, described$ 844(i) as " `a very broad provision covering substantially all businessproperty.' " Id., at 861, and n. 8 (citing H. R. Rep. No. 91-1549, pp. 69-70(1970)).6 The defendants in Mennuti destroyed two buildings. One was theresidence of the owner and her family, the other was a rental property.See 639 F. 2d, at 108-109, n. 1. The Second Circuit affirmed the DistrictCourt's dismissal of the entire indictment. Our decision in Russell v.United States, 471 U. S. 858 (1985), supersedes Mennuti with respect tothe building held for rental. Regarding the family residence, we findMennuti's reasoning persuasive.529US3 Unit: $U61 [11-02-00 07:34:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN855Cite as: 529 U. S. 848 (2000)Opinion of the CourtUnited States v. Ryan, 9 F. 3d 660, 675 (CA8 1993) (Arnold,C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).7The Government urges that the Fort Wayne, Indiana,residence into which Jones tossed a Molotov cocktail wasconstantly "used" in at least three "activit[ies] affectingcommerce." First, the homeowner "used" the dwelling ascollateral to obtain and secure a mortgage from an Oklahomalender; the lender, in turn, "used" the property as securityfor the home loan. Second, the homeowner "used" the resi-dence to obtain a casualty insurance policy from a Wisconsininsurer. That policy, the Government points out, safe-guarded the interests of the homeowner and the mortgagee.Third, the homeowner "used" the dwelling to receive naturalgas from sources outside Indiana. See Brief for UnitedStates 19-23.The Government correctly observes that $ 844(i) excludesno particular type of building (it covers "any building"); theprovision does, however, require that the building be "used"in an activity affecting commerce. That qualification is mostsensibly read to mean active employment for commercialpurposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connec-tion to commerce. Although "variously defined," the word"use," in legislation as in conversation, ordinarily signifies"active employment." Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S.137, 143, 145 (1995); see also Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer,513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995) ("When terms used in a statute areundefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.").7 In Ryan, Chief Judge Arnold dissented from a panel decision holdingthat the arson of a permanently closed fitness center fell within $ 844(i)'sprohibition. The panel majority considered adequate either of two interstate commerce connections: the building was owned and leased by out-ofstate parties, and received natural gas from across state borders. Thepanel added, however, that it would not extend the decision "to propertywhich is purely private in nature, such as a privately owned home, usedsolely for residential purposes." 9 F. 3d, at 666-667. Sitting en banc,the Eighth Circuit affirmed the panel's judgment. See United States v.Ryan, 41 F. 3d 361 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U. S. 1082 (1995).529US3 Unit: $U61 [11-02-00 07:34:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN856 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIt surely is not the common perception that a private,owner-occupied residence is "used" in the "activity" of receiving natural gas, a mortgage, or an insurance policy. Cf.Bailey, 516 U. S., at 145 (interpreting the word "use," as itappears in 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), to mean active employmentof a firearm and rejecting the Government's argument thata gun is "used" whenever its presence "protect[s] drugs" or"embolden[s]" a drug dealer). The Government does not allege that the Indiana residence involved in this case servedas a home office or the locus of any commercial undertaking.The home's only "active employment," so far as the recordreveals, was for the everyday living of Jones's cousin andhis family.Our decision in Russell does not warrant a less"use"-centered reading of $ 844(i). In that case, which involved the arson of property rented out by its owner, seesupra, at 853, the Court referred to the recognized distinction between legislation limited to activities "in commerce"and legislation invoking Congress' full power over activitysubstantially "affecting . . . commerce." 471 U. S., at 859-860, and n. 4. The Russell opinion went on to observe, however, that "[b]y its terms," $ 844(i) applies only to "propertythat is `used' in an `activity' that affects commerce." Id., at862. "The rental of real estate," the Court then stated, "isunquestionably such an activity." Ibid.8 Here, as earlieremphasized, the owner used the property as his home, thecenter of his family life. He did not use the residence in anytrade or business.8 Notably, the Court in Russell did not rest its holding on the expansiveinterpretation advanced by the Government both in Russell and in thiscase. Compare Brief for United States in Russell v. United States, O. T.1984, No. 435, p. 15 ("Petitioner used his building on South Union Streetin an activity affecting interstate commerce by heating it with gas thatmoved interstate."), with Russell, 471 U. S., at 862 (focusing instead onfact that "[t]he rental of real estate is unquestionably . . . an activity"affecting commerce).529US3 Unit: $U61 [11-02-00 07:34:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN857Cite as: 529 U. S. 848 (2000)Opinion of the CourtWere we to adopt the Government's expansive interpreta-tion of $ 844(i), hardly a building in the land would fall outside the federal statute's domain. Practically every buildingin our cities, towns, and rural areas is constructed with supplies that have moved in interstate commerce, served by util-ities that have an interstate connection, financed or insuredby enterprises that do business across state lines, or bearssome other trace of interstate commerce. See,e. g., FERCv. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) (observing that electric energy is consumed "in virtually every home" and that"[n]o State relies solely on its own resources" to meet itsinhabitants' demand for the product). If such connectionssufficed to trigger $ 844(i), the statute's limiting language,"used in" any commerce-affecting activity, would have no of-fice. See United States v. Monholland, 607 F. 2d 1311, 1316(CA10 1979) (finding in $ 844(i) no indication that Congressintended to include "everybody and everything"). "Judgesshould hesitate . . . to treat statutory terms in any set-ting [as surplusage], and resistance should be heightenedwhen the words describe an element of a criminal offense."Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 140-141 (1994); ac-cord, Bailey, 516 U. S., at 145.IIIOur reading of $ 844(i) is in harmony with the guiding prin-ciple that "where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutionalquestions arise and by the other of which such questions areavoided, our duty is to adopt the latter." United States exrel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S.366, 408 (1909), quoted in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.227, 239 (1999); see also DeBartolo, 485 U. S., at 575; Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur-ring). In Lopez, this Court invalidated the Gun-Free SchoolZones Act, former 18 U. S. C. $ 922(q) (1988 ed., Supp. V),which made it a federal crime to possess a firearm within529US3 Unit: $U61 [11-02-00 07:34:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN858 JONES v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court1,000 feet of a school. The defendant in that case, a 12thgrade student, had been convicted for knowingly possessinga concealed handgun and bullets at his San Antonio, Texas,high school, in violation of the federal Act. Holding thatthe Act exceeded Congress' power to regulate commerce, theCourt stressed that the area was one of traditional state concern, see 514 U. S., at 561, n. 3, 567; id., at 577 (Kennedy, J.,concurring), and that the legislation aimed at activity inwhich "neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercialcharacter," id., at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 560-562 (opinion of the Court).Given the concerns brought to the fore in Lopez, it is appropriate to avoid the constitutional question that wouldarise were we to read $ 844(i) to render the "traditionallylocal criminal conduct" in which petitioner Jones engaged "amatter for federal enforcement." United States v. Bass, 404U. S. 336, 350 (1971). Our comprehension of $ 844(i) is additionally reinforced by other interpretive guides. We haveinstructed that "ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminalstatutes should be resolved in favor of lenity," Rewis v.United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971), and that "whenchoice has to be made between two readings of what conductCongress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before wechoose the harsher alternative, to require that Congressshould have spoken in language that is clear and definite,"United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S.218, 221-222 (1952). We have cautioned, as well, that "unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not bedeemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance" in the prosecution of crimes. Bass, 404 U. S., at 349.To read $ 844(i) as encompassing the arson of an owneroccupied private home would effect such a change, for arsonis a paradigmatic common-law state crime. See generallyPoulos, The Metamorphosis of the Law of Arson, 51 Mo.L. Rev. 295 (1986).529US3 Unit: $U61 [11-02-00 07:34:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN859Cite as: 529 U. S. 848 (2000)Stevens, J., concurringIVWe conclude that $ 844(i) is not soundly read to make virtu-ally every arson in the country a federal offense. We holdthat the provision covers only property currently used incommerce or in an activity affecting commerce. The homeowned and occupied by petitioner Jones's cousin was not soused--it was a dwelling place used for everyday family living. As we read $ 844(i), Congress left cases of this genreto the law enforcement authorities of the States.Our holding that $ 844(i) does not cover the arson of anowner-occupied dwelling means that Jones's $ 844(i) conviction must be vacated. Accordingly, the judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.
