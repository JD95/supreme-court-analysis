Per Curiam 
In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Corcoran's claims  were  waived,  and  that  they  were  in  any  event  frivo-

lous,  so  that  a  remand  would  be  wasteful.  Brief  in  Opposi-tion  9-10.  Nothing  in  the  Seventh  Circuit's  opinion,  how-

On  February  18, 1985,  Van  Hook went  to a  Cincinnati bar that  catered  to  homosexual  men,  hoping  to  find  someone  to 

rob.  He approached David Self, and after the two spent sev-eral  hours  drinking  together  they  left  for  Self 's  apartment. 
There  Van  Hook  "lured  Self  into  a  vulnerable  position"  and attacked  him,  first  strangling  him until  he  was  unconscious, 
then killing him with a kitchen knife and mutilating his body. State

All  told,  Schick  put  nine  witnesses  on  the  stand  over  a span  of  two  days,  and  elicited  a  range  of  testimony  on  Bel-

montes'  behalf.  A  number  of  those  witnesses  highlighted Belmontes'  "terrible"  childhood.  They  testified  that  his  fa-
ther  was  an  alcoholic  and  extremely  abusive.  Belmontes' grandfather  described  the  one-bedroom  house  where  Bel-
montes  spent  much  of  his  childhood  as  a  "chicken  coop." 
Belmontes  did  not  do  well  in  school;  he  dropped  out  in  the ninth grade.  His younger sister died when she was only 10 

months old.  And his grandmother died tragically when she drowned  in  her  swimming  pool.  See  Record  2314-2319, 
2324-2325, 2344. 

Family  members  also  testified  that,  despite  these  difficul-
ties,  Belmontes  maintained  strong  relationships  with  his 
grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister.  Id.,

Amended  Pet.  for  Writ  of  Habeas  Corpus  in  No.  CIVS- 89-0736-EJG- JFM  (ED  Cal.),  p.  120.  But  the  cold,  calcu-
lated  nature  of  the  Howard  murder  and  Belmontes'  subse-quent  bragging  about  it  would  have  served  as  a  powerful 
counterpoint. 

The type of "more-evidence-is-better" approach advocated by Belmontes  and  the  Court of Appeals  might  seem appeal-

ing--after  all,  what  is  there  to  lose?  But  here  there  was  a lot  to  lose.  A  heavyhanded  case  to  portray  Belmontes  in  a 
positive  light,  with  or  without  experts,  would  have  invited 
the  strongest  possible  evidence  in  rebuttal--the  evidence 
that Belmontes was responsible for not one but two murders. 

Belmontes  counters  that  some  of  the  potential  mitigating 
evidence might not have opened the door to the prior murder 
evidence.  The  Court  of  Appeals  went  so  far  as  to  state, 
without citation, that "[t]here would be no basis for suggest-
ing that [expert testimony] would be any different if the ex-
pert were informed that Belmontes committed two murders 
rather  than  one."  529  F.  3d,  at  869,  n.  20.  But  it  is  surely 
pertinent  in  assessing  expert  testimony  "explain[ing]  .  .  . 
involvement  in  criminal  activity,"  id.,

We  agree  with  the  state  court's  characterization  of  the murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by the 

Court  of  Appeals  that  this  case  did  not  involve  "needless suffering."  The  jury  saw  autopsy  photographs  showing 
Steacy  McConnell's  mangled  head,  her  skull  crushed  by  15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found to have 
been wielded by Belmontes.  McConnell's corpse showed nu-
merous  "defensive  bruises  and  contusions  on  [her]  hands, arms,  and  feet,"

In  this  federal  postconviction  proceeding,  the  District Court held  that Porter's  lawyer's  failure to adduce  that evi-
dence  violated  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  counsel  and granted  his  application  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus.  The 
Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eleventh  Circuit  reversed,  on  the ground that the Florida Supreme Court's determination that 
Porter  was  not  prejudiced  by  any  deficient  performance  by his  counsel  was  a  reasonable  application  of

preme Court gave any consideration for the purpose of non-statutory mitigation to Dr. Dee's testimony regarding the ex-

istence of a brain abnormality and cognitive defects.7  While the  State's  experts  identified  perceived  problems  with  the 
tests  that  Dr.  Dee  used  and  the  conclusions  that  he  drew from  them,  it  was  not  reasonable  to  discount  entirely  the 
effect  that  his  testimony  might  have  had  on  the  jury  or  the sentencing judge. 

Furthermore,  the  Florida  Supreme  Court,  following  the state  postconviction  court,  unreasonably  discounted  the  evi-
dence  of  Porter's  childhood  abuse  and  military  service.  It is  unreasonable  to  discount  to  irrelevance  the  evidence  of 
Porter's abusive childhood, especially when that kind of his-tory may  have particular  salience for  a jury evaluating  Por-
ter's  behavior  in  his  relationship  with  Williams.  It  is  also unreasonable  to  conclude  that  Porter's  military  service 
would  be  reduced  to  "inconsequential  proportions,"  788 So.  2d,  at  925,  simply  because  the  jury  would  also  have 
learned that Porter went AWOL on more than one occasion. Our Nation has a long tradition of according leniency to vet-
erans in recognition of their service, especially for those who fought on the front lines as Porter did.

8  Moreover, the rele-

vance  of  Porter's  extensive  combat  experience  is  not  only that he served honorably under extreme hardship and grue-

some conditions, but also that the jury might find mitigating 

7 The  Florida  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  that  Porter  had  presented 
evidence of "statutory and nonstatutory mental mitigation," 788 So. 2d, at 
921, but it  did not consider Porter's  mental health evidence  in  its discus-
sion of nonstatutory mitigating evidence, id.,

A  contrary  holding  would  pose  an  unnecessary  dilemma 
for  the  States:  States  could  preserve  flexibility  by  granting 
courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at the 
cost  of  undermining  the  finality  of  state  court  judgments. 
Or  States  could  preserve  the  finality  of  their  judgments  by

sary  prerequisite to  NRAB arbitration?  Answering  this "single ques-
tion"  in  the  negative,  the  Seventh  Circuit  effectively  resolved  the 
Union's core complaint.  Because nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdic-
tional  status  the  obligation  to  conference  minor  disputes  or  to  prove 
conferencing, a negative answer to the "single question" leaves no doubt 
about the Union's entitlement, in accord with $ 153 First (q), to vacation 
of  the  Board's  orders.  Given  this  statutory  ground  for  relief,  there  is 
no  due  process  issue  alive  in  this  case,  and  no  warrant  to  answer  a 
question that may be consequential in another case.  Nevertheless, the 
grant of certiorari here enables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding 
court as well as Board decisions, over matters properly typed "jurisdic-
tional."  Pp. 79-81.

would  be  reasonable"  in  the  circumstances.  $ 570/505(b). When  an  officer  has  seized  property  without  a  warrant,  the 

relevant  law enforcement  agency must  notify the  State's at-torney  within  52  days  of  the  seizure;  the  State's  attorney 
must notify  the  property  owner of  any impending forfeiture within a further 45 days; and, if the owner wishes to contest 
forfeiture, the State's attorney must begin judicial forfeiture 
proceedings within yet a further 45 days.  See ch.  725, $$ 150/5-150/6.  Thus,  the  statute  gives  the  State  up  to  142 

days, nearly five months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceed-ings--during  which  time  the  statute  permits  the  State  to 
keep the car or cash within its possession. 

On  November  22,  2006,  six  individuals  (respondents  or 
plaintiffs) brought this federal civil rights action against de-

postseizure  probable-cause  hearing,  (3)  to  declare  that  the hearing  must  take  place  within  10  days  of  any  seizure,  and 
(4)  to  enjoin  the  defendants'  current  practice  of  keeping the  property  in  custody  for  a  longer  time  without  a  judi-
cial  determination  of  probable  cause.  See  Complaint  || 36, 
App. 36a. The  defendants  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  on  the 

ground that Seventh  Circuit precedent made clear  that "the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to the ac-
tual  forfeiture  proceeding."  Jones  v.  Takaki,  38  F.  3d  321, 
324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).  On Febru-
ary  22,  2007,  the  District  Court  granted  the  motion  to  dis-
miss.  It also denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certifica-
tion.  The plaintiffs appealed. 

On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal in 
the  plaintiffs'  favor.  Smith  v.  Chicago,  524  F.  3d  834.  It 
reconsidered  and  departed  from  its  earlier  precedent.  Id., 
at 836-839.  It held that "the procedures set out in" the Illi-
nois  statute  "show  insufficient  concern  for  the  due  process 
right  of  the  plaintiffs."  Id.,  at  838.  And  it  added  that, 
"given  the  length  of  time  which  can  result  between  the  sei-
zure of property and the opportunity for an owner to contest 
the  seizure  under"  Illinois  law,  "some  sort  of  mechanism  to 
test the validity of the retention of the property is required." 
Ibid.  The  Court  of  Appeals  reversed  the  judgment  of  the 
District  Court  and  remanded  the  case  for  further  proceed-
ings.  Id.,  at  839.  Its  mandate  issued  about  seven  weeks 
thereafter. 

On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review the 
Seventh  Circuit's  "due  process"  determination.  The  Court 
of  Appeals  had  already  recalled  its  mandate.  The  parties 
filed briefs in this Court.  We then recognized that the case 
might be moot, and we asked the parties to address the ques-
tion of mootness at the forthcoming oral argument. 

92  ALVAREZ  v.  SMITH 

Opinion of the Court 
At  oral  argument  counsel  for  both  sides  confirmed  that there was no longer  any dispute about ownership or posses-

sion of the relevant property.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (State's Attorney); id., at 56-57 (plaintiffs).  The State had returned 
the  cars  to  plaintiffs  Smith,  Perez,  and  Brunston.  See  id., at 5.  Two  of the  plaintiffs  had "defaulted,"  apparently  con-
ceding  that  the  State  could  keep  the  cash.  Ibid.  And  the final plaintiff and the State's Attorney agreed that the plain-
tiff  could  keep  some,  but  not  all,  of  the  cash  at  issue.  Id., at  5,  56-57.  As  counsel  for  the  State's  Attorney  told  us, 
"[T]hose cases are over."  Id., at 5. 

II 
The  Constitution  permits  this  Court  to  decide  legal  ques-tions  only  in  the  context  of  actual  "Cases"  or  "Controver-

sies."  Art.  III,  $ 2.  An  " `actual  controversy  must  be  ex-tant  at  all  stages  of  review,  not  merely  at  the  time  the 
complaint  is  filed.' "  Preiser  v.  Newkirk,  422  U. S.  395,  401 (1975) (quoting 

Steffel  v.  Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10 (1974)).  In  this  case  there  is  no  longer  any  actual  contro-

versy  between the  parties about  ownership or  possession  of the underlying property. 

The State's Attorney argues that there is a continuing con-troversy over damages.  We concede that the plaintiffs filed 
a  motion  in  the  District  Court  seeking  damages.  But  the plaintiffs  filed  their  motion  after  the  Seventh  Circuit  is-
sued its opinion.  And, before this Court granted certiorari, the  Court  of  Appeals  recalled  its  mandate,  taking  the  case 
away from the District Court before the District Court could respond  to  the  motion.  Thus,  we  have  before  us  a  com-
plaint  that  seeks  only  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  not damages. 

The  plaintiffs  point  out  that  they  sought  certification  of  a class.  And  a  class  might  well  contain  members  who  con-
tinue to dispute ownership of seized property.  But that fact is beside the point.  The District Court denied the plaintiffs' 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 87 (2009)  93 

Opinion of the Court 
class certification motion.  The plaintiffs did not appeal that denial.  Hence the only disputes relevant here are those be-

tween these six plaintiffs and the State's Attorney; those dis-putes  concerned  cars  and  cash;  and  those  disputes  are  now 
over.  United  States  Parole  Comm'n  v.  Geraghty,  445  U. S. 388, 404  (1980) ("A  named plaintiff whose  claim expires  may 
not  continue  to  press  the  appeal  on  the  merits  until  a  class 
has been properly certified"). The  parties,  of  course,  continue  to  dispute  the  lawfulness 

of  the  State's  hearing  procedures.  But  that  dispute  is  no longer  embedded  in  any  actual  controversy  about  the  plain-
tiffs'  particular  legal  rights.  Rather,  it  is  an  abstract  dis-
pute  about  the  law,  unlikely  to  affect  these  plaintiffs  any 
more  than  it  affects  other  Illinois  citizens.  And  a  dispute 
solely  about  the  meaning  of  a  law,  abstracted  from  any  con-
crete  actual  or  threatened  harm,  falls  outside  the  scope  of 
the constitutional words "Cases" and "Controversies."  See, 
e. g.,  Lewis  v.  Continental  Bank  Corp.,  494  U. S.  472,  477 
(1990); North Carolina v.  Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246 (1971) (per 
curiam);  Aetna  Life  Ins.  Co.  v.  Haworth,  300  U. S.  227,  241 
(1937); Mills v.  Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895). 

We  can  find  no  special  circumstance  here  that  might  war-
rant  our  continuing  to  hear  the  case.  We  have  sometimes 
heard  attacks  on  practices  that  no  longer  directly  affect  the 
attacking party, but are "capable of repetition" while "evad-
ing review."  See, e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v.  Wiscon-

sin  Right  to  Life,  Inc.,  551  U. S.  449,  462  (2007);  Southern 
Pacific  Terminal  Co.  v.  ICC,  219  U. S.  498,  515  (1911).  Yet 
here, unlike those cases, nothing suggests that the individual 
plaintiffs will likely again prove subject to the State's seizure 
procedures.  See  Los  Angeles  v.  Lyons,  461  U. S.  95,  109 
(1983)  ("[T]he  capable-of-repetition  doctrine  applies  only  in 
exceptional  situations,  and  generally  only  where  the  named 
plaintiff  can  make  a  reasonable  showing  that  he  will  again 
be subjected to the alleged illegality"); DeFunis v.  Odegaard, 
416  U. S.  312,  318-319  (1974)  (per  curiam).  And  in  any 

94  ALVAREZ  v.  SMITH 

Opinion of the Court 
event, since those who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices  might  bring  damages  actions,  the  practices  do  not 

"evade  review."  See  Memphis  Light,  Gas  &  Water  Div.  v. Craft,  436 U. S. 1, 8-9 (1978) (damages claim saves case from 
mootness).  Consequently, the case is moot.  See, e. g., 
Preiser, supra, at 403-404; Mills, supra, at 658. 

III 
It  is  less  easy  to  say  whether  we  should  order  the  judg-ment  below  vacated.  The  statute  that enables  us  to  vacate 

a lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is flexible, allowing  a  court  to  "direct  the  entry  of  such  appropriate 
judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceed-ings to be had as may be just under the circumstances."  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2106;  see  also  U.  S.  Bancorp  Mortgage  Co.  v. 
Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21 (1994).  Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the lower court judgment 

in  a  moot  case  because  doing  so  "clears  the  path  for  future relitigation  of  the  issues  between  the  parties,"  preserving 
"the rights of all parties," while prejudicing none "by a deci-sion which . . .  was  only  preliminary." 

Munsingwear,  340 U. S., at 40. 

In  Bancorp,  however,  we  described  circumstances  where we would not do so.  We said that, "[w]here mootness results 
from  settlement"  rather  than  " `happenstance,' "  the  "losing party  has  voluntarily  forfeited  his  legal  remedy  .  .  .  [and] 
thereby  surrender[ed]  his  claim  to  the  equitable  remedy of  vacatur."  513  U. S.,  at  25.  The  plaintiffs,  pointing  out 
that  the  State's  Attorney  agreed  to  return  all  three  cars and  some  of  the  cash,  claim  that,  with  respect  to  at  least 
four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp's "settle-ment" exception. 

In  our  view,  however,  this  case  more  closely  resembles mootness  through  "happenstance"  than  through  "settle-
ment"--at  least  the  kind  of  settlement  that  the  Court  con-sidered  in  Bancorp.  Bancorp  focused  upon  a  bankruptcy-

Cite as: 558 U. S. 87 (2009)  95 

Opinion of the Court 
related  dispute  that  involved  a  legal  question  whether  a bankruptcy  court  could  lawfully  confirm  a  debtor's  Chapter 

11 reorganization plan if the plan relied upon what the debtor said  was  a  special  exception  (called  the  "new  value  excep-
tion")  to  ordinary  creditor  priority  rules.  Id.,  at  19-20. The  parties  contested  that  legal  issue  in  the  Bankruptcy 
Court;  they  contested  it  in  an  appeal  of  the  Bankruptcy 
Court's  order  to  the  Federal  District  Court;  they  contested it in a further appeal to the Court of Appeals; and eventually 

they  contested  it  in  this  Court.  Id.,  at  20.  While  the  case was pending here, the parties settled their differences in the 
Bankruptcy  Court  (the  court  where  the  case  originated)-- 
including  their  differences  on  this  particular  contested  legal 
point.  Ibid.  They  agreed  upon  a  reorganization  plan, 
which  they  said  would  constitute  a  settlement  that  mooted 
the federal case.  Ibid. 

Recognizing  that  the  reorganization  plan  that  the  Bank-
ruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settlement 
that  mooted  the  case,  this  Court  did  not  vacate  the  lower 
court's judgment.  The Court's reason for leaving the lower 
court's judgment in place was that mootness was not a result 
of  "the  vagaries  of  circumstance."  Id.,  at  25.  Rather  the 
party seeking review had "caused the mootness by voluntary 
action."  Id.,  at  24 (emphasis added).  By  virtue  of  the  set-
tlement,  that  party  had  "voluntarily  forfeited  his  legal  rem-
edy by the  ordinary processes of appeal or certiorari."  Id., 
at  25.  Hence,  compared  to  mootness  caused  by  "happen-
stance,"  considerations  of  "equity"  and  "fairness"  tilted 
against vacatur.  Id., at 25-26. 

Applying  these  principles  to  the  case  before  us,  we  con-
clude  that  the  terminations  here  fall  on  the  "happenstance" 
side of the line.  The six individual cases proceeded through 
a  different  court  system  without  any  procedural  link  to  the 
federal case before us.  To our  knowledge (and we  have ex-
amined the  state-court  docket sheets), no  one in  those cases 
raised  the  procedural  question  at  issue  here.  Rather,  the 

96  ALVAREZ  v.  SMITH 

Opinion of the Court 
issues in those six  cases were issues  solely of state  substan-tive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeitable or not?  And 

court  docket  sheets  suggest  that  the  six  state  cases  termi-nated on substantive  grounds in the ordinary  course of such 
state proceedings.  In the three automobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the proceedings and returned the cars 
between 11 and 40  months after  the  seizures, a long  enough 
time  for  the  State  to  have  investigated  the  matters  and  to have determined (after the termination of any related crimi-

nal proceedings) for evidentiary reasons  that it did not wish to  claim  the  cars.  See  Dockets  in 

People  v.  2004  Chevrolet 
Impala,  No.  2006-COFO-000296  (Cir.  Ct.  Cook  Cty.,  Ill.) 
(Brunston's  car  returned  on  July  27,  2009);  People  v.  Smith, 
No. 2006-COFO-000036 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cty., Ill.) (Smith's car 
returned on May 5, 2008); and People v.  1999 Chevrolet Mal-
ibu, No. 2006-COFO-000288 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cty., Ill.) (Perez's 
car  returned  on  Jan.  29,  2007).  In  the  remaining  contested 
case, involving cash, the State voluntarily dismissed the pro-
ceedings  after  14  months,  again  a  long  enough  time  for  the 
State to have weighed the evidence and found a compromise 
settlement appropriate on the merits.  See Docket in People 
v.  $1,500 in U. S. Currency, No. 2006-COFO-000201 (Cir. Ct. 
Cook  Cty.,  Ill.)  (Waldo's  cash  returned  on  Mar.  19,  2007). 
The  disparate  dates  at  which  the  plaintiffs'  forfeiture  pro-
ceedings terminated--11, 14, 27, and 40 months after the sei-
zures--indicate that  the  State's Attorney  did  not  coordinate 
the resolution of the plaintiffs' state-court cases, either with 
each  other  or  with  the  plaintiffs'  federal  civil  rights  case. 
Cf. Munsingwear, supra, at 39-40 (stating that a lower court 
judgment would have been vacated even though an action of 
the  party  seeking  review  had  brought  about  the  mootness 
because that action--a commodity being decontrolled by Ex-
ecutive Order--was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v. 
Munsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947). 

For  these  reasons,  we  believe  that  the  presence  of  this 
federal  case  played  no  significant  role  in  the  termination  of

two trailers shortly after 1 a.m. The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and Jane 
was  unable  to  conclusively  identify  her  assailant.  When asked  whom  he  reminded  her  of,  she  mentioned  both  Troy 
and  his  brother  Trent.  Several  days  after  the  rape,  she 
identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent flowers attacked 

her.  It was Trent and Raquel who had sent her flowers, not Troy.  She  was  unable  to  identify  Troy  as  her  assailant  out 
of a photo lineup,  and she  could not  identify her  assailant at 
trial.  The night of the rape, however, she said her attacker 
was  wearing  dark  jeans,  a  black  jacket  with a  zipper,  boots, 
and  a  watch.  She  also  vividly  remembered  that  the  man 
"stunk  real,  real  bad"  of  "cologne,  or  some  beer  or  puke  or

clothing was similar to what Troy was wearing; she also said  that  her  assailant  smelled  like  beer  or  vomit  and 
testimony  indicated  that  Troy  had  been  drinking  beer and  had  vomited  several  times  that  night.  Further-
more, testimony indicated that Troy got home at approx-imately 1:30 a.m., which gave him enough time to assault 
Jane  Doe.  Additionally,  [witnesses]  testified  that  they saw  someone  resembling  Troy  in  a  black  jacket  and 
black  hat  stumbling  in  the  road  near  Jane  Doe's  house at 1:05 a.m.  Troy also washed his pants and shirt when 
he  got  home,  arguably  to  remove  the  blood  evidence from  his  clothes.  Finally,  the  DNA  evidence  indicated 
that  semen  collected  from  Jane  Doe's  underwear matched Troy's and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people 
had matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1  in  10,000  people  had  matching  DNA)."  Ibid.,

consist  of  aspects  of  the  "mental  defect"  factor  that  the  de-fense experts described. 

Finally,  in  light  of  counsel's  several  appeals  to  the  jurors' sense of humanity--he used the words "humane people" and 
"humane  society"  10  times  at  various  points  in  the  argu-
ment--we cannot find that a more explicit or more elaborate 
appeal for mercy could have changed the result, either alone 
or  together  with  the  other  circumstances  just  discussed. 
Thus, we  conclude that  there is  not a reasonable  probability 
that a more adequate closing argument would have changed 
the  result,  and  that  the  Ohio  Supreme  Court's  rejection  of 
Spisak's  claim  was  not  "contrary  to,  or . . .  an  unreasonable 
application of," Strickland.

(as  visited  Jan.  13,  2010,  and  available  in  Clerk  of  Court's case file). 

Chief Judge Kozinski's January 8 order  noted that the re-quest  to  broadcast  the  trial  on  the  Internet  was  "still  pend-
ing" before him.  In a later letter to Chief Judge Walker, he explained  that  the  request  was  not  yet  "ripe  for  approval" 
because  "the  technical  staff  encountered  some  unexpected difficulties preparing a satisfactory video suitable for on-line 
posting."  Letter  of  Jan.  9,  2010  (available  in  Clerk  of Court's case file).  A final decision whether to permit online 
publication  would  be  made  when  technical  difficulties  were resolved. 

On January 9, 2010, applicants filed in this Court an appli-cation for a stay of the District Court's order.  Their petition 
seeks  a  stay  pending  resolution  of  forthcoming  petitions  for the writs of certiorari and mandamus. 

II 
The  question  whether  courtroom  proceedings  should  be broadcast has prompted considerable national debate.  Rea-

sonable minds  differ on  the  proper  resolution  of  that debate and on the restrictions, circumstances, and procedures under 
which  such  broadcasts  should  occur.  We  do  not  here  ex-press  any  views on  the  propriety  of broadcasting  court  pro-
ceedings generally. Instead,  our  review  is  confined  to  a  narrow  legal  issue: 
whether the District Court's amendment of its local rules to broadcast this trial complied with federal law.  We conclude 
that  it  likely  did  not  and  that  applicants  have  demonstrated that  irreparable  harm  would  likely  result  from  the  District 
Court's  actions.  We  therefore  stay  the  court's  January  7, 2010,  order  to  the  extent  that  it  permits  the  live  streaming 
of  court  proceedings  to  other  federal  courthouses.  We  do not address other aspects of that order, such as those related 
to the broadcast of court proceedings on the Internet, as this may be premature.

To  be  sure,  the  possibility  that  some  aspects  of  the  trial might  be  broadcast  was  first  raised  to  the  parties  by  the 
District Court at an in-court hearing on September 25, some three months before the Rule was changed.  The broadcast-
ing,  however,  was  prohibited  under  both  Circuit  and  local 
rules  at  that  time.  The  first  public  indication  that  the  Dis-trict  Court  intended  to  adopt  a  rule  of  general  applicability 

came  in  its  Web  site  posting  on  December  23.  And  even  if Chief Judge Walker's in-court allusion to the possibility that 
the  Proposition  8  trial  might  be  broadcast  could  be  consid-
ered  as  providing  notice  to  the  parties  in  this  case--his 
statement  that  "[t]his  is  all  in  flux"  notwithstanding--the 
disclosure falls far short of the "appropriate public notice and 
an opportunity for comment" required by $ 2071(b).  Indeed, 
there was no proposed policy on which to comment. 

The  need  for  a  meaningful  comment  period  was  particu-
larly  acute  in  this  case.  Both  courts  and  legislatures  have 
proceeded with appropriate caution  in  addressing this  ques-
tion.  In  1996,  the  Judicial  Conference  of  the  United  States 
adopted a policy  opposing the  public  broadcast  of court pro-
ceedings.  This  policy  was  adopted  after  a  multiyear  study 
of  the  issue  by  the  Federal  Judicial  Center  which  drew  on 
data  from  six  district  and  two  appellate  courts,  as  well  as 
state-court  data.  In  light  of  the  study's  findings,  the  Judi-
cial  Conference  concluded  that  "the  intimidating  effect  of 
cameras on some witnesses and jurors [is] cause for concern." 
Administrative  Office  of  United  States  Courts,  Report  of 
Proceedings  of  Judicial  Conference  of  the  United  States  47 
(Sept. 20, 1994). 

In more than a decade since its adoption the Judicial Con-
ference has continued to adhere to its position on the broad-
cast  of  court  proceedings.  While  the  policy  conclusions  of 
the  Judicial  Conference  may  not  be  binding  on  the  lower 
courts, they are "at the very least entitled to respectful con-

local Rule.  Nor could it, as the Judicial Council only has the 
power  to  modify  or  abrogate  local  rules  that  conflict  with 
federal law.  See $ 332(d)(4) (permitting a circuit court coun-
cil  to  modify  a  local  rule  that  is  "found  inconsistent"  with 
rules  promulgated  by  the  Supreme  Court).  No  federal  law 
requires that the District Court broadcast some of its cases. 
The  District  Court's  local  Rule,  in  addition,  was  not  a  con-
forming amendment to Ninth Circuit policy, because that pol-
icy does not require district courts to broadcast proceedings. 

Applicants  also  have  shown  that  irreparable  harm  will 
likely result from the denial of the stay.  Without a stay, the 
District  Court  will  broadcast  the  trial.  It  would  be  diffi-
cult--if  not  impossible--to  reverse  the  harm  from  those 
broadcasts.  The trial will involve various witnesses, includ-
ing members of same-sex couples; academics, who apparently 
will  discuss  gender  issues  and  gender  equality,  as  well  as 
family  structures;  and  those  who  participated  in  the  cam-
paign  leading  to  the  adoption  of  Proposition  8.  This  Court 
has  recognized  that  witness  testimony  may  be  chilled  if 
broadcast.  See Estes

lack  of  a  regular  rule  with  proper  standards  to  determine the  guidelines  for  broadcasting  could  compromise  the  or-

derly,  decorous,  rational  traditions  that  courts  rely  upon  to ensure the integrity of their own judgments.  These consid-
erations,  too,  are  part  of  the  reasons  leading  to  the  decision to grant extraordinary relief. 

In  addressing  a  discrete  instance  authorizing  a  closedcircuit broadcast of a trial, Congress has illustrated the need for  careful  guidelines  and  standards.  The  trial  of  the  two 

defendants  in  the  Oklahoma  City  bombing  case  had  been transferred  to  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Dis-
trict of Colorado, so it was set to take place in Denver.  That 
meant the  families  of deceased and surviving  victims  in  and 
around  Oklahoma  City  would  not  have  the  opportunity  to 
observe  the  trial.  Congress  passed  a  statute  that  allowed 
victims'  families  to  watch  the  trial  on  closed-circuit  televi-
sion.  42 U. S. C. $ 10608.  The statute was drawn with care 
to  provide  precise  and  detailed  guidance  with  respect  to 
the  wide  range  of  issues  implicated  by  the  broadcast.  See 

$ 10608(a) (the statute only applies "in cases where the venue 
of  the  trial  is  changed"  to  a  city  that  is  "out  of  the  State" 
and  "more  than  350  miles  from  the  location  in  which  those 
proceedings originally would have taken place"); $$ 10608(a)- 
(b)  (standards  for  who  can  view  such  trials);  $ 10608(c)  (re-
strictions on  transmission).  And the  statute gave the 
Judicial Conference of the United States rulemaking author-
ity  "to  effectuate  the  policy  addressed  by  this  section." 

$ 10608(g).  In  the  present  case,  by  contrast,  over  a  span  of 
three  weeks  the  District  Court  and  Ninth  Circuit  Judicial 
Council  issued,  retracted,  and  reissued  a  series  of  Web  site 
postings  and  news  releases.  These  purport  to  amend  rules 
and  policies  at  the  heart  of  an  ongoing  consideration  of 
broadcasting federal trials.  And they have done so to make 
sure  that  one  particular  trial  may  be  broadcast.  Congress' 
requirement  of  a  notice-and-comment  procedure  prevents 
just  such  arbitrary  changes  of  court  rules.  Instead,  courts

the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford

(1)  The  CRWSP  should be  allowed  to intervene.  It  is an  unusual 
bistate entity that is jointly owned and regulated by, and supplies water 
from  the river to,  North Carolina's Union County and South Carolina's 
Lancaster County.  It has shown a compelling interest in protecting the 
viability of its operations, which are premised on a fine balance between 
the joint venture's two participating counties.  The stresses this litiga-
tion would place on the CRWSP threaten to upset that balance.  More-
over,  neither  State  has  sufficient  interest  in  maintaining  that  balance 
to  represent  the  full  scope  of  the  CRWSP's  interests.  The  complaint 
attributes a portion of the total water transfers alleged to have harmed 
South Carolina to the CRWSP, but North Carolina cannot represent the 
joint  venture's  interests,  since  it  will  likely  respond  to  the  complaint's 
demand  for  a  greater  share  of  the  river's  water  by  taking the  position 
that downstream users--such as Lancaster County--should receive less 
water.  See, e.

Opinion of the Court 
We acknowledge that the standard for intervention in orig-inal  actions  by  nonstate  entities  is  high--and  appropriately 

so.  Such  actions  tax  the  limited  resources  of  this  Court  by requiring  us  "awkwardly  to  play  the  role  of  factfinder"  and 
diverting  our  attention  from  our  "primary  responsibility  as an appellate tribunal."

ficiently  compelling  interest  that  is  unlike  the  interests  of other citizens of the States.  The CRWSP is an unusual mu-

nicipal entity, established as a joint venture with the encour-agement  of  regulatory  authorities  in  both  States  and  de-
signed to serve the increasing water needs of Union County, North  Carolina,  and  Lancaster  County,  South  Carolina.  It 
has  an  advisory  board  consisting  of  representatives  from 
both counties,  draws its  revenues from  its  bistate  sales,  and operates  infrastructure  and  assets  that  are  owned  by  both 

counties  as  tenants-in-common.  We  are  told  that  approxi-mately  100,000 individuals  in  each  State  receive their  water 
from  the  CRWSP  and  that  "roughly  half "  of  the  CRWSP's 
total  withdrawals  of  water  from  the  Catawba  River  go  to 
South Carolina consumers.  Reply of CRWSP to Exceptions 
of South Carolina to First Interim Report of Special Master 
22 (hereinafter CRWSP Reply).  It is difficult to conceive of 
a more purely bistate entity. 

In addition,  the  CRWSP relies upon authority  granted  by 
both  States  to  draw  water  from  the  Catawba  River  and 
transfer  that  water  from  the  Catawba  River  basin.  The 
CRWSP draws  all of its water  from an intake located below 
the  Lake  Wylie  dam  in  South  Carolina.  South  Carolina  li-
censed the CRWSP to withdraw a total of 100 mgd from the 
Catawba  River  and  issued  a  certificate  to  the  CRWSP  in 
1989  authorizing  up  to  20  mgd  to  be  transferred  out  of  the 
Catawba  River  basin.  Id.,

as  Lancaster  County 6--should  receive  less  water.  See  Tr. 
of  Oral  Arg.  52  ("From  North  Carolina's  perspective, 
South Carolina is receiving much more water under this ne-
gotiated  agreement  than  they  could  ever  hope  to  achieve  in 
an equitable apportionment action").  The stresses that this 
litigation  would  place  upon  the  CRWSP  threaten  to  upset 
the  fine balance on  which the  joint venture is  premised, and 
neither  State  has  sufficient  interest  in  maintaining  that  bal-
ance  to  represent  the  full  scope  of  the  CRWSP's  interests. 

Accordingly,  we  believe  that  the  CRWSP  should  be  al-
lowed  to  intervene  to  represent  its  own  compelling  inter-
ests  in  this  litigation.  We  thus  overrule  South  Carolina's 
exception.

We conclude, as well, that Duke Energy has demonstrated 
powerful interests that  likely will  shape the  outcome of this 
litigation.  To  place  these  interests  in  context,  it  is  instruc-
tive to consider the "flexible" process by which we arrive at a 
" `just and equitable' apportionment" of an interstate stream.

Cite as: 558 U. S. 290 (2010)  291 

Syllabus 
District Court concluded that the state court's finding that counsel made 
a  strategic  decision  was  an  unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts. 
The court further held that counsel's performance was deficient and had 
prejudiced  Wood,  and  that  the  state  court's  contrary  holdings  were  an 
unreasonable application of federal law under Strickland v. Washington, 
466  U. S.  668.  Reversing,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  held  that  the  state 
court's  rejection  of  Wood's  ineffective-assistance  claim  was  neither  an 
unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based on an un-
reasonable determination of the facts.  With respect to the facts, it con-
cluded  that  the  evidence  in  the  Rule  32  hearings  supported  the  state 
court's  strategic-decision  finding,  and  it  agreed  with  the  state  court's 
legal conclusion that counsel's strategic decision was reasonable and that 
Wood  had  failed  to  show  prejudice.  Wood's  certiorari  petition  raises 
the questions (1) whether, in order to obtain relief under $ 2254(d)(2), a 
petitioner must establish only that the state-court factual determination 
on  which  the  decision  was  based  was  "unreasonable,"  or  whether 

$ 2254(e)(1)  additionally  requires  a  petitioner  to  rebut  a  presumption 
that the determination was correct with clear and convincing evidence; 
and  (2)  whether  the  state  court's  strategic-decision  determination  was 
reasonable. 

Held: 

1.  Even  under  Wood's  reading  of  $ 2254(d)(2),  the  state  court's  con-
clusion  that  his  counsel  made  a  strategic  decision  not  to  pursue  or 

present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable de-
termination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the statecourt  proceedings.  This  Court  need  not  reach  the  question  whether 

$ 2254(e)(1)  applies  in  every  case  presenting  a  challenge  under 

$ 2254(d)(2),  see  Rice  v.  Collins,  546  U. S.  333,  339,  because  its  view  of 
the state court's factual determination here does not depend on an inter-
pretative  difference  regarding  the  relationship  between  those  provi-
sions.  While "[t]he term `unreasonable'  is .  . . difficult to  define," Wil-
liams v.  Taylor,  529  U. S.  362,  410,  it  suffices  to  say  that  a  state-court 
factual  determination  is  not  unreasonable  merely  because  the  federal 
habeas  court  would  have  reached  a  different  conclusion  in  the  first  in-
stance.  See  Rice,  546  U. S.,  at  341-342.  Here,  the  state-court  record 
shows that all of Wood's counsel read the Kirkland report.  Trotter tes-
tified  that  Dozier  told  him  that  nothing  in  the  report  merited  further 
investigation, a recollection supported by the attorneys' contemporane-
ous  letters;  and  Trotter  told  the  sentencing  judge  that  counsel  did  not 
intend to introduce the report to the jury.  This evidence can fairly be 
read to support the Rule 32 court's factual determination that counsel's 
failure to pursue or present evidence of Wood's mental deficiencies was

not mere oversight  or neglect but the result of a deliberate decision to 
focus  on  other  defenses.  Most  of  the  contrary  evidence  Wood  high-
lights--e. g.,  that  Dozier  and  Ralph  put  the  inexperienced  Trotter  in 
charge of the penalty phase proceedings--speaks not to whether counsel 
made  a  strategic  decision,  but  to  whether  counsel's  judgment  was  rea-
sonable,  a  question  not  before  this  Court.  Any  evidence  plausibly  in-
consistent  with  the  strategic-decision  finding  does  not  suffice  to  show 
that the finding was unreasonable.  Pp. 300-303. 

2.  Because  Wood's  argument  that  the  state  court  unreasonably  ap-
plied Strickland in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim on the mer-
its is not "fairly included" in the questions presented under this Court's 
Rule 14.1(a), it will not be addressed here.  Pp. 303-304.

294  WOOD  v.  ALLEN 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
In 1993, petitioner Holly Wood broke  into  the  home of his ex-girlfriend and  shot her  in the head  and face as  she lay  in 

her bed.  The victim was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.  Charged with capital murder during a first-degree 
burglary,  Wood  was  represented  at  trial  in  Alabama  state court  by  three  court-appointed  attorneys:  Cary  Dozier  and 
Frank  Ralph,  both  of whom  had significant  trial experience, and  Kenneth  Trotter,  who  had  been  admitted  to  the  bar  for 
five  months  at  the  time  he  was  appointed.  The  jury  con-victed  Wood  at  the  guilt  phase  of  trial  and  recommended  a 
death  sentence  at  the  penalty  phase  by  a  vote  of  10  to  2. After a separate sentencing hearing, the trial judge imposed 
the death penalty.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Wood's conviction and sentence, Ex parte Wood, 715 
So. 2d  812 (1996), as did the Alabama Supreme Court, Wood v. 

State, 715 So. 2d 819 (1998).  This Court denied certiorari. Wood  v.  Alabama, 525 U. S. 1042 (1998). 

Wood  petitioned  for  state postconviction  relief under  Ala-bama  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  32,  arguing,  among  other 
things,  that  he  was  mentally  retarded  and  not  eligible  for the death penalty, and that his trial counsel were ineffective 
under  Strickland  v.  Washington,  466  U. S.  668  (1984),  be-cause  they  failed  to  investigate  and  present  evidence  of 

his  mental  deficiencies  during  the  penalty  phase  of  trial. App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  198a-202a,  207a-210a,  213a-216a, 
220a-221a,  225a.  The  Rule  32  court  held  two  evidentiary hearings and denied Wood's claims.  On appeal, the Alabama 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  remanded  for  further  consider-ation  in  light  of 

Atkins  v.  Virginia,  536  U. S.  304  (2002), which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execu-

tion  of  the  mentally  retarded.  Wood  v.  State,  891  So.  2d 398 (2003). 

On  remand,  the  Rule  32  court  conducted  a  third  eviden-tiary  hearing  and  once  again  denied  relief.  As  to  Wood's 
claim  of  mental  retardation,  the  court  found  that,  while  the 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 290 (2010)  295 

Opinion of the Court 
evidence  suggested  that  he  "probably  does  exhibit  signifi-cantly  subaverage  general  intellectual  functioning,"  he  had 

failed  to  show  "that  he  has  significant  or  substantial  defi-cits  in  his  adaptive  functioning."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert. 
236a-237a. The  court  also  rejected  Wood's  factually  related  claim  of 
ineffective  assistance  of  counsel,  concluding  that  Wood  had 
failed  to  establish  that  his  counsel's  performance  was  defi-cient  or  that  any  deficiency  prejudiced  his  defense. 

Id.,  at 
257a-275a.  The  court  first  made  a  factual  finding  that Wood's  counsel  had  made  a  strategic  decision  not  to  pursue 

evidence  of  his  alleged  mental  retardation.  The  court  ob-
served  that  counsel  had  requested  that  a  Dr.  Karl  Kirkland 
conduct  a  mental  evaluation,  had  "thoroughly  reviewed 
Dr.  Kirkland's report," and had  "determined that nothing  in 
that  report  merited  further  investigation."  Id.,  at  264a, 
271a.  The court additionally found that counsel appeared to 
have  made  a  strategic  decision  not  to  present  to  the  jury 
the  limited  evidence  of  Wood's  mental  deficiencies  in  their 
possession,  because  "calling  Dr.  Kirkland  to  testify  was  not 
in Wood's best interest."  Id., at 271a-272a.  The court con-
cluded  that  these  strategic  decisions  were  reasonable  and 
thus that counsel had not performed deficiently.  Ibid.  The 
court further concluded that there was "no reasonable proba-
bility"  of  a  different  outcome  had  the  evidence  developed  in 
the  Rule  32  hearings  been  presented  to  the  jury  or  to  the 
sentencing  court.  Id.,  at  273a.  The  Alabama  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals affirmed, Wood v.  State, 891 So. 2d 398, 411 
(2004),  and  the  Alabama  Supreme  Court  denied  certiorari, 
App. 4. 

Wood  then  filed  a  petition  for  federal  habeas  relief  under 

$ 2254.  The  District  Court  rejected  all  of  Wood's  claims 
save  one:  that  counsel's  failure  to  investigate  and  present 
mitigation  evidence  of  his  mental  deficiencies  during  the 
penalty  phase  constituted  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel. 
465 F. Supp. 2d 1211, 1239-1245 (MD Ala. 2006).  According 

296  WOOD  v.  ALLEN 

Opinion of the Court 
to  the  court,  there  was  "nothing  in  the  record  to  even  re-
motely support a finding that counsel made a strategic deci-
sion  not  to  let  the  jury  at  the  penalty  stage  know  about 
Wood's  mental  condition."  Id.,  at  1242.  Ralph  and  Dozier, 
the  court  noted,  had  placed  the  inexperienced  Trotter  in 
charge of  the  penalty phase.  At  the  Rule  32  hearing,  Trot-
ter testified that he had seen the references to Wood's intel-
lectual  functioning  in  the  Kirkland  report  but  did  not  recall 
considering  whether  to  pursue  that  issue.  Trotter  further 
testified  that  he  had  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  subpoena 
Wood's  school  records  and  that  he  did  not  recall  speaking 
to  any  of  Wood's  teachers.  Trotter  had  also  written  to  an 
attorney  at  the  Southern  Poverty  Law  Center  explaining 
that  he  was  " `stressed  out  over  this  case  and  [didn't]  have 
anyone  with  whom  to  discuss  the  case,  including  the  other 
two  attorneys.' "  Id.,  at  1241.  Shortly  before  the  penalty 
phase  began,  Trotter  told  the  judge  that  he  would  request 
further  psychological  evaluation  before  the  judge's  sentenc-
ing hearing, even though the evaluation would come too late 
to  be  considered  by  the  jury.  Id.,  at  1241-1242.  Based  on 
this  evidence,  the  District  Court  concluded  that  the  state 
court's  finding  "that  a  strategic  decision  was  made  not  to 
investigate  or  introduce  to  the  sentencing  jury  evidence  of 
mental  retardation  [was]  an  unreasonable  determination  of 
the  facts  in  light  of  the  clear  and  convincing  evidence  pre-
sented in the record."  Ibid. 

Having  rejected  the  state  court's  factual  determinations, 
the  District Court held that counsel's performance was defi-
cient  and  that  counsel's  deficient  performance  prejudiced 
Wood,  concluding  that  the  state  court's  holdings  to  the  con-
trary constituted "an unreasonable application of federal law 
under  Strickland."  Id.,  at  1245.  The  court  granted  the 
petition  on  this  claim  and  ordered  the  State  either  to  resentence  Wood  to  life  without  parole  or  to  conduct  a  new 
sentencing hearing.

Opinion of the Court 
In  a  divided  opinion,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  reversed  the 
grant of habeas relief.  542 F. 3d 1281 (2008).  The majority 
began by explaining the standard of review: "Section 2254(d) 
permits  federal  habeas  relief  only  where  the  state  courts' 
decisions  were  (1)  `contrary  to,  or  involved  an  unreasonable 
application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined 
by the Supreme Court of the United States,' or (2) `based on 
an  unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts  in  light  of  the 
evidence  presented in  the  State  court  proceeding.' "  Id.,  at 
1285 (quoting $$ 2254(d)(1)-(2)).  A " `determination of a fac-
tual  issue  made  by  a  State  court  shall  be  presumed  to  be 
correct,' "  the  majority  explained,  and  the  petitioner  " `shall 
have  the  burden  of  rebutting  the  presumption  of  correct-
ness  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence.' "  Ibid.  (quoting 

$ 2254(e)(1)).  "Thus,"  the  majority  stated,  the  federal  ha-
beas court's " `review of findings of fact by the state court is 
even more deferential than under a clearly erroneous stand-
ard of review.' "  Ibid. 

The majority then held that the Alabama court's rejection 
of Wood's  ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was neither 
an  unreasonable  application  of  clearly  established  law  nor 
based  on  an  unreasonable  determination  of  the  facts.  With 
respect  to  the  facts,  the  court  concluded  that  the  evidence 
presented in the Rule 32 hearings supported the state court's 
findings that counsel made a strategic decision not to present 
mental  health  evidence  during  the  penalty  phase.  "At  a 
minimum,"  the  court  noted,  "Wood  has  not  presented  evi-
dence, much less clear and convincing evidence, that counsel 
did not make such decisions."  Id., at 1304, n. 23.  The court 
also agreed with the state court's legal conclusion that coun-
sel's  strategic  decision  was  reasonable.  According  to  the 
court,  the  silent  record  created  a  presumption  that  coun-
sel  exercised  sound  professional  judgment,  supported  by 
ample  reasons,  not  to  present  the  information  they  had  ob-
tained.  These  reasons  included  unfavorable  information  in 

298  WOOD  v.  ALLEN 

Opinion of the Court 
Dr. Kirkland's report, such as details about Wood's 19 earlier arrests  and  his  previous  attempt  to  murder  another  exgirlfriend, as well as Dr. Kirkland's conclusion that, notwith-standing  Wood's  mental  deficiencies,  Wood  had  a  high  level 
of adaptive functioning.  Id., at 1304-1306.  The court added that the investigation preceding counsel's decision was 
sufficient to permit them to make a reasoned decision, credit-
ing  the  Rule  32  court's  findings  that,  inter  alia,  counsel  not only  employed  an  investigator  who  sought  mitigation  evi-

dence  from  family  members  but  also  themselves  met  with family  members  and  sought  guidance  from  capital  defense 
organizations.  Id.,  at  1307-1308.  The  court  also  accepted 
as  not  "objectively  unreasonable"  the  state  court's  determi-
nation that Wood had failed to show prejudice from counsel's 
failure to present evidence of his mental deficiencies.  Id., at 
1309, 1314. 

The  dissent,  implicitly  considering  the  factual  question 
whether counsel made a strategic decision as part and parcel 
of the legal question whether any strategic decision was rea-
sonable,  concluded  that  "[n]o  such  strategic  decisions  could 
possibly  have  been  made  in  this  case  because  counsel  had 
failed to adequately investigate  the available  mitigating evi-
dence."  Id.,  at  1316  (opinion  of  Barkett,  J.).  According  to 
the dissent, "the weight of the evidence in the record demon-
strates  that  Trotter,  an  inexperienced  and  overwhelmed  at-
torney,"  unassisted  by  senior  counsel,  "realized  too  late"-- 
only  in  time  to  present  it  to  the  sentencing  judge,  not  to 
the  penalty  jury--"what  any  reasonably  prepared  attorney 
would  have  known:  that  evidence  of  Wood's  mental  impair-
ments  could  have  served  as  mitigating  evidence  and  de-
served  investigation  so  that  it  could  properly  be  presented 
before  sentencing."  Id.,  at  1320.  The  dissent  also  con-
cluded that there was a reasonable probability of a different 
outcome  at  the  penalty  phase  had  the  evidence  been  pre-
sented, because the jury could have concluded that Wood was 
less  culpable  as  a  result  of  his  diminished  abilities.  Id.,  at

Opinion of the Court 
1322-1325.  The  dissent  therefore  concluded  that  the  state court's application of Strickland to the facts of this case was 

unreasonable.  542 F. 3d, at 1326. We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  two  related  questions 
raised  by  Wood's  petition.  First,  we  granted  review  of  a question that has divided the Courts of Appeals: whether, in 
order to satisfy $ 2254(d)(2), a petitioner  must establish  only that the state-court factual determination on which the deci-
sion  was  based  was  "unreasonable,"  or  whether  $ 2254(e)(1) additionally  requires  a  petitioner  to  rebut  a  presumption 
that the determination was correct with clear and convincing evidence.

1  We also granted review of the question whether 

the  state  court  reasonably  determined  that  Wood's  counsel made a "strategic decision" not to pursue or present evidence 

of his mental deficiencies.  556 U. S. 1234 (2009).  Wood's pe-

be  arbitrary  and  therefore  objectively  unreasonable"  (internal  quotation

tition  raised  two  additional  questions  on  which  we  declined to  grant  certiorari.  Ibid.  Neither  of  these  asked  us  to 

review  whether  the  state  court's  resolution  of  Wood's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim  was  "contrary  to,  or 
involved  an  unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  established Federal law" under $ 2254(d)(1) and 

Strickland. 

II  

A  

Notwithstanding statements we have made about the rela-tionship between $$ 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1) in cases that did not 

squarely  present  the  issue,  see  Brief  for  Petitioner  37-38; Brief for Respondents 28-29, we have explicitly left open the 
question  whether  $ 2254(e)(1)  applies  in  every  case  present-ing  a  challenge  under  $ 2254(d)(2),  see  Rice  v.  Collins,  546 
U. S.  333,  339  (2006).  The  parties  and  their  amici  have  of-fered  a  variety  of  ways  to  read  the  relationship  between 
these  two  provisions.2  Although  we  granted  certiorari  to resolve  the  question  of  how  $$ 2254(d)(2)  and  (e)(1)  fit  to-
gether, we find once more that we need not reach this ques-tion,  because  our  view  of  the  reasonableness  of  the  state 
court's  factual  determination  in  this  case  does  not  turn  on any  interpretive  difference  regarding  the  relationship  be-
tween  these  provisions.  For  present  purposes,  we  assume 

2 In  Wood's  view,  when  a  petitioner  seeks  relief  based  entirely  on  the 
state-court  record,  a  federal  court  reviews  the  state  court's  findings  for 
reasonableness under $ 2254(d)(2).  Section 2254(e)(1) comes into play, ac-
cording to Wood, only when a petitioner challenges individual state-court 
factual  findings  based  in  part  on  evidence  that  is  extrinsic  to  the  statecourt  record.  Brief  for  Petitioner  38-39.  According  to  respondents, 

$ 2254(e)(1)  applies  to  any  challenge  to  a  state  court's  factual  findings 
under  $ 2254(d)(2),  including  a  challenge  based  solely  on  the  state-court 
record.  Brief for Respondents 35-37.  Respondents' amici offer still fur-
ther variations, although they all agree with respondents that $ 2254(e)(1) 
applies in some fashion in every habeas case reviewing state-court factual 
findings.  Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation 5, 10-14; Brief for 
State of Indiana et al. 2, 12-18.

Opinion of the Court 
for  the  sake  of  argument  that  the  factual  determination  at issue  should  be  reviewed,  as  Wood  urges,  only  under 

$ 2254(d)(2)  and  not  under  $ 2254(e)(1).  We  conclude  that, under $ 2254(d)(2), the state court's finding that Wood's coun-
sel  made  a  strategic  decision  not  to  pursue  or  present  evi-dence of Wood's mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable 
determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented 
in  the  state-court  proceedings.  We  therefore  do  not  need to  decide  whether  that  determination  should  be  reviewed 

under  the  arguably  more  deferential  standard  set  out  in $ 2254(e)(1). 

As  we  have  observed  in  related  contexts,  "[t]he  term  `un-
reasonable' is no doubt difficult to define."  Williams v.  Tay-
lor,  529  U. S.  362,  410  (2000).  It  suffices  to  say,  however, 
that  a  state-court  factual  determination  is  not  unreasonable 
merely because the federal habeas court would have reached 
a  different  conclusion  in  the  first  instance.  Cf.  id.,  at  411. 
In  Rice,  for  example,  in  which  we  assumed,  arguendo,  that 
only $ 2254(d)(2) and not $ 2254(e)(1) applied, 546 U. S., at 339, 
we rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that a state-court 
factual  determination  was  unreasonable.  We  noted  that 
even  if  "[r]easonable  minds  reviewing  the  record  might  dis-
agree" about the finding in question, "on habeas review that 
does not suffice to supersede the trial court's . . . determina-
tion."  Id., at 341-342. 

In this case, the evidence in the state-court record demon-
strated  that  all  of  Wood's  counsel  read  the  Kirkland  report. 
App. 12, 174, 210, 283.  Trotter testified that Dozier told him 
that  nothing  in  the  report  merited  further  investigation,  a 
recollection  that  is  supported  by  contemporaneous  letters 
Trotter wrote to Dozier and Ralph noting that no independ-
ent  psychological  evaluations  had  been  conducted  because 
Dozier had  said they  would  not be  needed.  Id., at 283,  343, 
345.  Trotter also told the sentencing judge that counsel did 
not intend to introduce the Kirkland report to the jury.  Id., 
at  12.  This  evidence  in  the  state-court  record  can  fairly  be 

302  WOOD  v.  ALLEN 

Opinion of the Court 
read  to  support  the  Rule  32  court's  factual  determination 
that counsel's failure to pursue or present evidence of Wood's 
mental  deficiencies  was  not  mere  oversight  or  neglect  but 
was  instead  the  result  of  a  deliberate  decision  to  focus  on 
other defenses. 

Arguing  that  the  state  court's  factual  determination  to 
this  effect  was  unreasonable,  Wood  calls  our  attention  to 
Dozier's testimony during the  Rule  32 proceedings that evi-
dence  of  Wood's  mental  health  problems  would  have  been 
presented  during  the  penalty  phase  if  counsel  had  been 
aware of it, id., at 169; that Dozier did not recall whether he 
had  decided  not  to  present  evidence  based  on  the  Kirkland 
report, id., at 168, 171; and that Dozier and Ralph had desig-
nated  the  inexperienced  Trotter  to  be  in  charge  of  the  pen-
alty  phase  proceedings,  id.,  at  270-271.  Trotter,  in  turn, 
testified that he did not recall considering Wood's mental de-
ficiencies.  Id.,  at  288.  Wood  also  observes  that  the  Kirk-
land report was prepared for the guilt phase, not the penalty 
phase, and a strategic decision not to use the Kirkland report 
in the former does not necessarily carry over into the latter. 
Id.,  at  324.  Wood  notes  that  his  counsel  sought  to  obtain 
additional evidence about his mental health to use in mitiga-
tion  after  reviewing  the  Kirkland  report,  but  they  failed  to 
pursue  it,  in  part  out  of  a  belief  that  the  sentencing  judge 
would not grant a continuance to permit them to investigate. 
Id.,  at  285,  343-346.  Finally,  Wood  emphasizes  that  his 
counsel  must  have  thought  that  evidence  of  his  mental  defi-
ciencies  was  important  because  they  presented  it  to  the 
judge at the final sentencing hearing.  Id., at 88. 

Most of the evidence Wood highlights, however, speaks not 
to  whether  counsel  made  a  strategic  decision,  but  rather  to 
whether  counsel's  judgment  was  reasonable--a  question 
we  do  not  reach.  See  Part  II-B,  infra.  As  for  any  evi-
dence  that  may  plausibly  be  read  as  inconsistent  with  the 
finding  that  counsel  made  a  strategic  decision,  we  conclude

Opinion of the Court 
that  it  does  not  suffice  to  demonstrate  that  the  finding  was unreasonable.

3 

Reviewing  all  of  the  evidence,  we  agree  with  the  State that even if it is debatable, it is not unreasonable to conclude 

that,  after  reviewing  the  Kirkland  report,  counsel  made  a strategic  decision  not  to  inquire  further  into  the  informa-
tion  contained  in  the  report  about  Wood's  mental  deficien-cies and not to present to the jury such information as coun-
sel  already  possessed  about  these  deficiencies.  Cf.  Rice, 546  U. S.,  at  341-342.  For  that  reason,  we  agree  with  the 
Court  of  Appeals  that  the  District  Court  erred  in  holding to the contrary.

Wood  also  argues  that  the  state-court  decision  involved an  unreasonable  application  of 

Strickland  under  $ 2254(d)(1) 

3 The dissent suggests that counsel could not have made a strategic deci-
sion  not  to  pursue  evidence  of  Wood's  mental  deficiencies  because  there 
could be no reasonable justification for doing so.  Post, at 307-309 (opinion

Opinion of the Court 
because  counsel  failed  to  make  a  reasonable  investigation  of Wood's  mental  deficiencies  before  deciding  not  to  pursue  or 

present  such  evidence.  Without  a  reasonable  investigation, Wood  contends,  these  decisions  were  an  unreasonable  ex-
ercise  of  professional  judgment  and  constituted  deficient performance  under 

Strickland.  We  agree  with  the  State, however,  that  this  argument  is  not  "fairly  included"  in 

the  questions  presented  under  this  Court's  Rule  14.1(a). Whether  the  state  court  reasonably  determined  that  there 
was a strategic decision under $ 2254(d)(2) is a different ques-tion from whether the strategic decision itself was a reason-
able  exercise  of  professional  judgment  under  Strickland  or whether the  application of 

Strickland was reasonable under $ 2254(d)(1).  Cf.  Rice, 546 U. S., at 342 ("The question 

whether  a  state  court  errs  in  determining  the  facts  is  a  dif-ferent  question  from  whether  it  errs  in  applying  the  law"). 
These  latter  two  questions  may  be  "related  to  the  one  peti-tione[r]  presented,  and  perhaps  complementary  to  the  one 
petitione[r]  presented,"  but  they  are  "not  fairly  included therein."  Yee  v.  Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 537 (1992) (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted). It is true that Wood's petition discussed the Eleventh Cir-
cuit's misapplication of $ 2254(d)(1) and Strickland.  Pet. for Cert.  22-27.  But  "the  fact  that  [petitioner]  discussed  this 
issue in the text of [his] petition for certiorari does not bring it  before  us.  Rule  14.1(a)  requires  that  a  subsidiary  ques-
tion  be  fairly  included  in  the  question  presented  for  our  re-view." 

Izumi  Seimitsu  Kogyo  Kabushiki  Kaisha  v.  U.  S. 
Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 31, n. 5 (1993) (per curiam).  We therefore  do  not  address  Wood's  argument  that  the  state 

court  unreasonably  applied  Strickland  in  rejecting  his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on the merits.

Held: 

1.  Because the question whether $ 441b applies to  Hillary cannot be 
resolved  on  other,  narrower  grounds  without  chilling  political  speech, 
this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppression 
upheld in Austin.  Pp. 322-336. 

(a)  Citizens  United's  narrower  arguments--that  Hillary  is  not  an 
"electioneering communication" covered by $ 441b because it is not "pub-
licly  distributed"  under  11  CFR  $ 100.29(a)(2);  that  $ 441b  may  not  be 
applied to Hillary under Federal Election Comm'n v.  Wisconsin Right 
to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (WRTL), which found $ 441b unconstitutional 
as  applied  to  speech  that  was  not  "express  advocacy  or  its  functional 
equivalent,"  id.,  at  481  (opinion  of  Roberts,

lating  political  speech  is  chilled.  The  regulatory  scheme  at  issue  may 
not be a prior restraint in the strict sense.  However, given its complex-
ity  and  the  deference  courts  show  to  administrative  determinations, 
a  speaker  wishing  to  avoid  criminal  liability  threats  and  the  heavy 
costs  of  defending  against  FEC enforcement  must  ask  a  governmental 
agency for prior permission to speak.  The restrictions thus function as 
the  equivalent  of  a  prior  restraint,  giving  the  FEC  power  analogous 
to  the  type  of  government  practices  that  the  First  Amendment  was 
drawn  to  prohibit.  The  ongoing  chill on speech  makes  it  necessary  to 
invoke  the  earlier  precedents  that  a  statute  that  chills  speech  can  and 
must  be  invalidated  where  its  facial  invalidity  has  been  demonstrated. 
Pp. 329-336. 

2.  Austin  is  overruled,  and  thus  provides  no  basis  for  allowing  the 
Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.  Hence, 

$ 441b's restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be ap-
plied  to  Hillary.  Given  this  conclusion,  the  part  of  McConnell  that 
upheld  BCRA  $ 203's  extension  of  $ 441b's  restrictions  on  independent 
corporate expenditures is also overruled.  Pp. 336-366. 

(a)  Although  the  First  Amendment  provides  that  "Congress  shall 
make no law . . . abridging  the  freedom of speech," $ 441b's prohibition 
on  corporate  independent  expenditures  is  an  outright  ban  on  speech, 
backed by criminal sanctions.  It is a ban notwithstanding the fact that 
a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a separate 
association from the corporation.  Because speech is an essential mech-
anism of democracy--it is the means to hold officials accountable to the 
people--political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress 
it by design or inadvertence.  Laws burdening such speech are subject 
to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the re-
striction  "furthers  a  compelling  interest  and  is  narrowly  tailored  to 
achieve that interest."  WRTL, supra, at 464.  This language provides 
a  sufficient  framework  for  protecting  the  interests  in  this  case.  Pre-
mised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands 
against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints or to distin-
guish  among  different  speakers,  which  may be  a  means  to  control  con-
tent.  The  Government  may  also  commit  a  constitutional  wrong  when 
by  law  it  identifies  certain  preferred  speakers.  There  is  no  basis  for 
the  proposition  that,  in  the  political  speech  context,  the  Government 
may  impose  restrictions  on  certain  disfavored  speakers.  Both  history 
and logic lead to this conclusion.  Pp. 336-341. 

(b)  The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to 
corporations,  e. g.,  First  Nat. Bank  of Boston  v.  Bellotti, 435  U. S.  765, 
778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political speech, 
see, e. g., NAACP  v.  Button, 371 U. S.  415, 428-429.  Addressing chal-
lenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the Court in Buck-

ley v.  Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam), upheld limits on direct contribu-
tions to  candidates, 18 U. S. C.  $ 608(b), recognizing a governmental in-
terest  in  preventing  quid  pro  quo  corruption.  424  U. S.,  at  25-26. 
However, the Court invalidated $ 608(e)'s expenditure ban, which applied 
to individuals, corporations, and unions, because it "fail[ed] to serve any 
substantial  governmental  interest  in  stemming  the  reality  or  appear-
ance of corruption in the electoral process," id., at 47-48.  While Buck-
ley did not consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent 
expenditures found in $ 610, had that provision been challenged in Buck-
ley's wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent's reason-
ing  and  analysis.  The  Buckley  Court  did  not  invoke  the  overbreadth 
doctrine to suggest that $ 608(e)'s expenditure ban would have been con-
stitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not individuals. 
Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified $ 610's corpo-
rate  and  union  expenditure  ban  at  2  U. S. C.  $ 441b,  the  provision  at 
issue.  Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaffirmed the First 
Amendment  principle  that the Government  lacks  the power  to restrict 
political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity.  435 U. S., at 
784-785.  Thus the law stood until Austin upheld a corporate independ-
ent  expenditure  restriction,  bypassing  Buckley  and  Bellotti  by  recog-
nizing  a  new  governmental  interest  in  preventing  "the  corrosive  and 
distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth . . . that 
have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's 
political ideas."  494 U. S., at 660.  Pp. 342-348. 

(c)  This  Court  is  confronted  with  conflicting  lines  of  precedent:  a 
pre-Austin  line  forbidding  speech  restrictions  based  on  the  speaker's 
corporate  identity  and  a  post-Austin  line  permitting  them.  Neither 
Austin's  antidistortion  rationale  nor  the  Government's  other  justifica-
tions support $ 441b's restrictions.  Pp. 348-362. 

(1)  The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or jail-
ing citizens, or associations of citizens,  for engaging in political  speech, 
but  Austin's  antidistortion  rationale  would  permit  the  Government  to 
ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corpo-
rate form.  Political speech is "indispensable to decisionmaking in a de-
mocracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corpo-
ration."  Bellotti,  supra,  at  777  (footnote  omitted).  This  protection  is 
inconsistent with Austin's rationale, which is meant to prevent corpora-
tions from obtaining " `an unfair advantage in the political marketplace' " 
by using " `resources amassed in the economic marketplace.' "  494 U. S., 
at  659.  First  Amendment  protections  do  not  depend  on  the  speaker's 
"financial ability to engage in public discussion."  Buckley, supra, at 49. 
These conclusions were reaffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA 
provision  that  increased  the  cap  on  contributions  to  one  candidate  if 
the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  Davis v. 

314  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Syllabus 
Federal  Election Comm'n,  554 U. S.  724,  742.  Distinguishing  wealthy 
individuals  from  corporations  based  on  the  latter's  special  advantages 
of, e. g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting speech. 
It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate funds may 
"have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's 
political  ideas."  Austin,  supra,  at  660.  All  speakers,  including  indi-
viduals  and  the media,  use  money  amassed  from the  economic  market-
place to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the result-
ing speech.  Under the antidistortion rationale, Congress could also ban 
political  speech  of  media  corporations.  Although  currently  exempt 
from  $ 441b,  they  accumulate  wealth  with  the  help  of  their  corporate 
form,  may  have  aggregations  of  wealth,  and  may  express  views  "hav-
[ing]  little  or  no  correlation  to  the  public's  support"  for  those  views. 
Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations can-
not be squared with the First Amendment, and there is no support for 
the  view  that  the  Amendment's  original  meaning  would  permit  sup-
pressing  media  corporations'  political  speech.  Austin  interferes  with 
the  "open  marketplace"  of  ideas  protected  by  the  First  Amendment. 
New  York  State  Bd.  of  Elections  v.  Lopez  Torres,  552  U. S.  196,  208. 
Its  censorship  is  vast  in  its  reach,  suppressing  the  speech  of  both  forprofit  and  nonprofit,  both  small  and  large,  corporations.  Pp.  349-356. 

(2)  This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Government's 
other  arguments.  It  reasons  that  corporate  political  speech  can  be 
banned  to  prevent  corruption  or  its  appearance.  The  Buckley  Court 
found this rationale "sufficiently important" to allow contribution limits 
but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U. S., at 
25, and the Court does not do so here.  While a single Bellotti footnote 
purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court 
now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by 
corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corrup-
tion.  That  speakers  may  have  influence  over  or  access  to  elected  offi-
cials  does  not  mean  that  those  officials  are  corrupt.  And  the  appear-
ance  of  influence  or  access  will  not  cause  the  electorate  to  lose  faith 
in  this  democracy.  Caperton  v.  A.  T.  Massey  Coal  Co.,  556  U. S.  868, 
distinguished.  Pp. 356-361. 

(3)  The  Government's  asserted  interest  in  protecting  sharehold-
ers from  being compelled  to fund  corporate  speech,  like  the  antidistor-
tion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political speech even 
of media corporations.  The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a 
dissenting  shareholder's  interests  in  certain  media  for  30  or  60  days 
before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media 
at any time.  It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, 
including those with one shareholder.  Pp. 361-362.

(4)  Because  $ 441b  is  not  limited  to  corporations  or  associations 
created in foreign countries or funded predominantly by foreign share-
holders,  it  would  be  overbroad  even  if  the  Court  were  to  recognize  a 
compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence over the 
Nation's political process.  P. 362. 

(d)  The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare deci-
sis, beyond workability--the precedent's antiquity, the reliance interests 
at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned--counsel in favor 
of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the precedents of Buck-
ley and Bellotti.  As already explained, Austin was not well reasoned. 
It  is also  undermined  by experience  since its  announcement.  Political 
speech is so ingrained in this country's culture that speakers find ways 
around  campaign  finance  laws.  Rapid  changes in  technology--and  the 
creative  dynamic  inherent  in  the  concept  of  free  expression--counsel 
against  upholding  a  law that  restricts  political  speech  in certain  media 
or  by  certain  speakers.  In  addition,  no  serious  reliance  issues  are  at 
stake.  Thus,  due  consideration  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  Austin 
should be overruled.  The Court returns to the principle established in 
Buckley  and  Bellotti  that  the  Government  may  not  suppress  political 
speech based on the speaker's corporate identity.  No sufficient govern-
mental  interest  justifies  limits  on  the  political  speech  of  nonprofit  or 
for-profit corporations.  Pp. 362-366. 

3.  BCRA  $$ 201  and  311  are  valid  as  applied  to  the  ads  for  Hillary 
and to the movie itself.  Pp. 366-372. 

(a)  Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability 
to  speak,  but  they  "impose  no  ceiling  on  campaign-related  activities," 
Buckley, supra, at 64, or " ` "prevent anyone from speaking," ' " McCon-
nell, 540 U. S., at 201.  The Buckley Court explained that disclosure can 
be justified by a governmental interest in providing "the electorate with 
information" about  election-related  spending sources.  424 U. S., at  66. 
The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges 
to $$ 201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  However, the Court acknowledged 
that  as-applied  challenges  would  be  available  if  a  group  could  show  a 
" `reasonable probability' " that disclosing its contributors' names would 
" `subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Govern-
ment officials or private parties.' "  Id., at 198.  Pp. 366-367. 

(b)  The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as applied 
to Citizens United's ads.  They fall within BCRA's "electioneering com-
munication" definition:  They  referred  to then-Senator  Clinton by  name

Opinion of the Court 
Clinton  by  name  and  depicts  interviews  with  political  com-mentators  and  other  persons,  most  of  them  quite  critical  of 

Senator  Clinton.  Hillary  was  released  in  theaters  and  on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by 
making it available through video-on-demand. Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select 
programming  from  various  menus,  including  movies,  televi-sion shows, sports, news, and music.  The viewer can watch 
the  program  at  any  time  and  can  elect  to  rewind  or  pause the  program.  In  December  2007,  a  cable  company  offered, 
for  a  payment  of  $1.2  million,  to  make  Hillary  available on  a  video-on-demand  channel  called  "Elections  '08."  App. 
255a-257a.  Some  video-on-demand  services  require  view-ers  to  pay  a  small  fee  to  view  a  selected  program,  but  here 
the  proposal  was  to  make  Hillary  available  to  viewers  free of charge. 

To implement the  proposal,  Citizens United was prepared to  pay  for  the  video-on-demand;  and  to  promote  the  film,  it 
produced  two  10-second  ads  and  one  30-second  ad  for  Hil-lary.  Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) 
statement  about  Senator  Clinton,  followed  by  the  name  of the movie and the movie's Web site address. 

Id., at 26a-27a. Citizens United desired to  promote the  video-on-demand of-

fering  by  running  advertisements  on  broadcast  and  cable television. 

B 
Before  the  Bipartisan  Campaign  Reform  Act  of  2002 (BCRA),  federal  law  prohibited--and  still  does  prohibit-- 

corporations  and  unions  from  using  general  treasury  funds to  make  direct  contributions  to  candidates  or  independent 
expenditures  that  expressly  advocate  the  election  or  defeat of  a  candidate,  through  any  form  of  media,  in  connection 
with  certain  qualified  federal  elections.  2  U. S. C.  $ 441b (2000  ed.);  see  McConnell,  supra,  at  204,  and  n.  87;  Federal

$ 441b  to  prohibit  any  "electioneering  communication"  as 
well.  2  U. S. C.  $ 441b(b)(2)  (2006  ed.).  An  electioneering 
communication  is  defined  as  "any  broadcast,  cable,  or  satel-
lite communication" that "refers to a clearly identified candi-
date for  Federal  office" and is  made within 30  days of a  pri-
mary  or  60  days  of  a  general  election.  $ 434(f)(3)(A).  The 
Federal  Election  Commission's  (FEC)  regulations  further 
define  an  electioneering  communication  as  a  communication 
that  is  "publicly  distributed."  11  CFR  $ 100.29(a)(2)  (2009). 
"In  the  case  of  a  candidate  for  nomination  for  President . . .  
publicly  distributed  means"  that  the  communication  "[c]an 
be  received  by  50,000  or  more  persons  in  a  State  where 
a  primary  election  .  .  .  is  being  held  within  30  days." 

$ 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A).  Corporations  and  unions  are  barred 
from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy 
or electioneering communications.  They may establish, how-
ever,  a  "separate  segregated  fund"  (known  as  a  political 
action  committee,  or  PAC)  for  these  purposes.  2  U. S. C. 

$ 441b(b)(2).  The  moneys  received  by  the  segregated  fund 
are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of 
the  corporation  or,  in  the  case  of  unions,  members  of  the 
union.  Ibid.

Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available through 
video-on-demand  within  30  days  of  the  2008  primary  elec-
tions.  It  feared,  however,  that  both  the  film  and  the  ads 
would  be  covered  by  $ 441b's  ban  on  corporate-funded  in-
dependent  expenditures,  thus  subjecting  the  corporation 
to  civil  and  criminal  penalties  under  $ 437g.  In  December 
2007,  Citizens  United  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive  re-
lief  against  the  FEC.  It  argued  that  (1)  $ 441b  is  uncon-
stitutional  as  applied  to  Hillary;  and  (2)  BCRA's  disclaimer 
and disclosure requirements, BCRA $$ 201 and 311, 116 Stat. 
88, 105, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the 
three ads for the movie. 

322  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
The  District  Court  denied  Citizens  United's  motion  for  a preliminary  injunction,  530  F.  Supp.  2d  274  (DC  2008)  (per 

curiam),  and  then  granted  the  FEC's  motion  for  summary judgment,  App.  261a-262a.  See  id.,  at  261a  ("Based  on  the 
reasoning  of  our  prior  opinion,  we  find  that  the  [FEC]  is entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law. 

See  Citizen[s] United  v.  FEC,  530  F.  Supp.  2d  274  (D.  D. C.  2008) (denying 

Citizens  United's  request  for  a  preliminary  injunction)"). The  court  held  that  $ 441b  was  facially  constitutional  under 
McConnell,  and  that  $ 441b  was  constitutional  as  applied  to Hillary  because  it  was  "susceptible  of  no  other  interpreta-
tion  than  to  inform  the  electorate  that  Senator  Clinton  is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous 
place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should  vote  against  her."  530  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  279.  The 
court  also  rejected  Citizens  United's  challenge  to  BCRA's disclaimer  and  disclosure  requirements.  It  noted  that  "the 
Supreme Court  has  written approvingly of disclosure provi-sions  triggered  by  political  speech  even  though  the  speech 
itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amend-ment." 

Id., at 281. We  noted  probable  jurisdiction.  555  U. S.  1028  (2008). 

The  case  was  reargued  in  this  Court  after  the  Court  asked the  parties  to  file  supplemental  briefs  addressing  whether 
we  should  overrule  either  or  both  Austin  and  the  part  of 
McConnell  which  addresses  the  facial  validity  of  2  U. S. C. $ 441b.  See 557 U. S. 932 (2009). 

II 
Before  considering  whether  Austin  should  be  overruled, we first  address whether Citizens United's  claim that  $ 441b 

cannot be applied  to Hillary  may be resolved on  other, nar-rower grounds. 

A 
Citizens  United  contends  that  $ 441b  does  not  cover  Hil-lary, as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the film 

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  323 

Opinion of the Court 
does not qualify as an "electioneering communication. " $ 441b(b)(2).  Citizens  United  raises  this  issue  for  the  first 

time  before  us,  but  we  consider  the  issue  because  "it  was addressed  by  the  court  below." 

Lebron  v.  National  Rail-
road  Passenger  Corporation,  513  U. S.  374,  379  (1995);  see 530  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  277,  n.  6.  Under  the  definition  of  elec-

tioneering  communication,  the  video-on-demand  showing  of 
Hillary  on  cable  television  would  have  been  a  "cable  .  .  . communication" that "refer[red] to a clearly identified candi-

date  for  Federal  office"  and  that  was  made  within  30  days of  a  primary  election.  2  U. S. C.  $ 434(f)(3)(A)(i).  Citizens 
United,  however,  argues  that  Hillary  was  not  "publicly 
distributed," because a single video-on-demand transmission 
is  sent  only  to  a  requesting  cable  converter  box  and  each 
separate  transmission,  in  most  instances,  will  be  seen  by 
just  one  household--not  50,000  or  more  persons.  11  CFR 

$ 100.29(a)(2); see $ 100.29(b)(3)(ii). 

This argument ignores the regulation's instruction on how 
to determine whether a cable transmission "[c]an be received 
by  50,000  or  more  persons."  $ 100.29(b)(3)(ii).  The  regu-
lation  provides  that  the  number  of  people  who  can  receive 
a  cable  transmission  is  determined  by  the  number  of  cable 
subscribers  in  the  relevant  area.  $$ 100.29(b)(7)(i)(G),  (ii). 
Here,  Citizens  United  wanted  to  use  a  cable  video-on-
demand system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide. 
App.  256a.  Thus,  Hillary  could  have  been  received  by 
50,000 persons or more. 

One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the con-
dition  that  the  communication  "[c]an  be  received  by  50,000 
or more persons," $ 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require "a plausible 
likelihood  that  the  communication  will  be  viewed  by  50,000 
or more potential voters"--as opposed to requiring only that 
the communication is "technologically capable" of being seen 
by that many people, Brief for Former Officials of the Ameri-
can  Civil  Liberties  Union  5.  Whether  the  population  and 
demographic  statistics  in  a  proposed  viewing  area  consisted 

324  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
of  50,000  registered  voters--but  not  "infants,  pre-teens,  or otherwise  electorally  ineligible  recipients"--would  be  a  re-

quired  determination,  subject  to  judicial  challenge  and  re-view, in any case where the issue was in doubt.  Id., at 6. 

In  our  view  the  statute  cannot  be  saved  by  limiting  the reach of  2 U. S. C. $ 441b  through this  suggested  interpreta-
tion.  In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this result would require a calculation as to the number of people 
a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccu-rate  estimate  potentially  subjecting  the  speaker  to  criminal 
sanctions.  The First Amendment does not permit laws that force  speakers  to  retain  a  campaign  finance  attorney,  con-
duct  demographic  marketing  research,  or  seek  declaratory rulings  before  discussing  the  most  salient  political  issues  of 
our  day.  Prolix  laws  chill  speech  for  the  same  reason  that vague laws chill speech: People "of common intelligence must 
necessarily  guess  at  [the  law's]  meaning  and  differ  as  to  its application."  Connally v.  General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 
391 (1926).  The Government may not render a ban on politi-cal speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption 
through an amorphous  regulatory interpretation.  We must reject  the  approach  suggested  by  the 

amici.  Section  441b covers Hillary. 

B 
Citizens United next argues that $ 441b may not be applied to 

Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.  McConnell decided  that  $ 441b(b)(2)'s  definition  of  an  "electioneering 

communication"  was  facially  constitutional  insofar  as  it  re-stricted  speech  that  was  "the  functional  equivalent  of  ex-
press  advocacy"  for  or  against  a  specific  candidate.  540 U. S., at 206.  WRTL then found an unconstitutional applica-
tion  of  $ 441b  where  the  speech  was  not  "express  advocacy or  its  functional  equivalent."  551  U. S.,  at  481  (opinion  of 
Roberts,

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  325 

Opinion of the Court 
the  functional  equivalent  of  express  advocacy  only  if  [it]  is 
susceptible  of  no  reasonable  interpretation  other  than  as  an 
appeal  to  vote  for  or  against  a  specific  candidate."  Id.,  at 
469-470. 

Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advocacy. 
The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertise-
ment that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for 
President.  In  light  of  historical  footage,  interviews  with 
persons  critical  of  her,  and  voiceover  narration,  the  film 
would  be  understood  by  most  viewers  as  an  extended  criti-
cism  of  Senator  Clinton's  character  and  her  fitness  for  the 
office  of  the  Presidency.  The  narrative  may  contain  more 
suggestions  and  arguments  than  facts,  but  there  is  little 
doubt  that  the  thesis  of  the  film  is  that  she  is  unfit  for  the 
Presidency.  The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing 
during  the  Clinton  administration,  Senator  Clinton's  qualifi-
cations  and  fitness  for  office,  and  policies  the  commentators 
predict she would pursue if elected President.  It calls Sena-
tor Clinton "Machiavellian," App. 64a, and asks whether she 
is  "the  most  qualified  to  hit  the  ground  running  if  elected 
President,"  id.,  at  88a.  The  narrator  reminds  viewers  that 
"Americans  have  never  been  keen  on  dynasties"  and  that 
"a  vote  for  Hillary  is  a  vote  to  continue  20  years  of  a  Bush 
or a Clinton in the White House," id., at 143a-144a. 

Citizens  United  argues  that  Hillary  is  just  "a  documen-
tary film that examines certain historical events."  Brief for 
Appellant 35.  We disagree.  The movie's consistent empha-
sis  is  on  the  relevance  of  these  events  to  Senator  Clinton's 
candidacy  for  President.  The  narrator  begins  by  asking 
"could  [Senator  Clinton]  become  the  first  female  President 
in  the  history  of  the  United  States?"  App.  35a.  And  the 
narrator  reiterates  the  movie's  message  in  his  closing  line: 
"Finally, before  America decides on our  next president, vot-
ers  should  need  no  reminders  of  .  .  .  what's  at  stake--the 
well being and prosperity of our nation."  Id., at 144a-145a. 

326  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
As  the  District  Court  found,  there  is  no  reasonable  inter-
pretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote against 
Senator  Clinton.  Under  the  standard  stated  in  McConnell 
and  further  elaborated  in  WRTL,  the  film  qualifies  as  the 
functional equivalent of express advocacy. 

C 
Citizens United further contends that $ 441b should be in-
validated  as  applied  to  movies  shown  through  video-on-
demand,  arguing  that  this  delivery  system  has  a  lower  risk 
of  distorting  the  political  process  than  do  television  ads. 
Cf.  McConnell,  supra,  at  207.  On  what  we  might  call  con-

ventional  television,  advertising  spots  reach  viewers  who 
have  chosen  a  channel  or  a  program  for  reasons  unrelated 
to the advertising.  With  video-on-demand, by contrast, the 
viewer selects a program after taking "a series of affirmative 
steps":  subscribing  to  cable;  navigating  through  various 
menus;  and  selecting  the  program.  See  Reno  v.  American 
Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867 (1997). 

While some means of communication may be less effective 
than  others  at  influencing  the  public  in  different  contexts, 
any  effort  by  the  Judiciary  to  decide  which  means  of  com-
munications  are  to  be  preferred  for  the  particular  type  of 
message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts' 
own  lawful  authority.  Substantial  questions  would  arise  if 
courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be 
preferred or disfavored.  And in all events, those differenti-
ations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by tech-
nologies  that  are  in  rapid  flux.  See  Turner  Broadcasting 
System, Inc. v.  FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 639 (1994). 

Courts,  too,  are  bound  by  the  First  Amendment.  We 
must  decline  to  draw,  and  then  redraw,  constitutional  lines 
based on the particular media or technology used to dissemi-
nate  political  speech  from  a  particular  speaker.  It  must  be 
noted,  moreover,  that  this  undertaking  would  require  sub-
stantial  litigation  over  an  extended  time,  all  to  interpret  a

Opinion of the Court 
law  that  beyond  doubt  discloses  serious  First  Amendment flaws.  The interpretive process itself would create an inevi-

table, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending  the  drawing  of  fine  distinctions  that,  in  the  end, 
would themselves be questionable.  First Amendment standards,  however,  "must  give  the  benefit  of  any  doubt  to 
protecting rather than stifling speech."  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 469  (opinion  of

merely suggesting  it.  This  is  especially  true in the  context of  the  First  Amendment.  As  the  Government  stated,  this 

case "would require a remand" to apply a de minimis stand-ard.  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  39  (Sept.  9,  2009).  Applying  this 
standard  would  thus  require  case-by-case  determinations. But  archetypical  political  speech  would  be  chilled  in  the 
meantime.  " `First  Amendment  freedoms  need  breathing space  to  survive.' "

First,  even  if  a  party  could  somehow  waive  a  facial  chal-lenge  while  preserving  an  as-applied  challenge,  that  would 

not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or address-ing  the  facial  validity  of  $ 441b  in  this  case.  "Our  practice

(quoting  United  States  v.  Williams,  504  U. S.  36,  41  (1992); 
first  alteration  in  original).  And  here,  the  District  Court addressed Citizens United's facial challenge.  See 530 

F.  Supp.  2d,  at  278  ("Citizens  wants  us  to  enjoin  the  opera-tion  of  BCRA  $ 203  as  a  facially  unconstitutional  burden  on 
the  First  Amendment  right  to  freedom  of  speech").  In  re-
jecting  the  claim,  it  noted  that  it  "would  have  to  overrule 
McConnell"  for  Citizens  United  to  prevail  on  its  facial  chal-
lenge  and  that  "[o]nly  the  Supreme  Court  may  overrule  its 
decisions."  Ibid.  (citing  Rodriguez  de  Quijas  v.  Shearson/ 
American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989)).  The Dis-
trict  Court  did  not  provide  much  analysis  regarding  the  fa-
cial challenge because it could not ignore the controlling Su-
preme  Court  decisions  in  Austin  and  McConnell.  Even  so, 
the  District  Court  did  " `pas[s]  upon' "  the  issue.  Lebron, 
supra,  at  379.  Furthermore,  the  District  Court's  later 
opinion,  which  granted  the  FEC  summary  judgment,  was 
"[b]ased  on  the  reasoning  of  [its]  prior  opinion,"  which  in-
cluded the discussion of the facial challenge.  App. 261a (cit-
ing  530  F.  Supp.  2d  274).  After  the  District  Court  ad-
dressed  the  facial  validity  of  the  statute,  Citizens  United 
raised  its  challenge  to  Austin  in  this  Court.  See  Brief  for 
Appellant  30  ("Austin  was  wrongly  decided  and  should  be 
overruled"); id., at 30-32.  In these circumstances, it is nec-
essary to consider Citizens United's challenge to Austin and 
the facial validity of $ 441b's expenditure ban. 

Second,  throughout  the  litigation,  Citizens  United  has  as-
serted  a  claim  that  the  FEC  has  violated  its  First  Amend-
ment  right  to  free  speech.  All  concede  that  this  claim  is 
properly before us.  And " `[o]nce a federal claim is properly

presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim;  parties  are  not  limited  to  the  precise  arguments  they 

made below.' "  Lebron, supra, at 379 (quoting Yee  v.  Escon-
dido,  503  U. S.  519,  534  (1992);  alteration  in  original).  Citi-
zens  United's  argument  that  Austin  should  be  overruled  is "not  a  new  claim." 

Lebron,  513  U. S.,  at  379.  Rather,  it 
is--at  most--"a new argument  to support  what has been  [a] 
consistent  claim:  that  [the  FEC]  did  not  accord  [Citizens United]  the  rights  it  was  obliged  to  provide  by  the  First 

Amendment."  Ibid. Third,  the  distinction  between  facial  and  as-applied  chal-
lenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect 
or  that  it  must  always  control  the  pleadings  and  disposition 
in  every  case  involving a  constitutional  challenge.  The  dis-
tinction  is  both  instructive  and  necessary,  for  it  goes  to  the 
breadth  of  the  remedy  employed  by  the  Court,  not  what 
must be pleaded in a complaint.  See United States v.  Treas-
ury  Employees,  513  U. S.  454,  477-478  (1995)  (contrasting 
"a facial challenge" with "a narrower remedy").  The parties 
cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from 
considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary 
to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Citizens United 
has  preserved  its  First  Amendment  challenge  to  $ 441b  as 
applied  to  the  facts  of  its  case;  and  given  all  the  circum-
stances,  we  cannot  easily  address  that  issue  without  as-
suming  a  premise--the  permissibility  of  restricting  corpo-
rate  political  speech--that  is  itself  in  doubt.  See  Fallon, 
As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 
113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) ("[O]nce a case is brought, 
no general categorical line bars a court from making broader 
pronouncements of invalidity in properly `as-applied' cases"); 
id., at 1327-1328.  As our  request  for supplemental  briefing 
implied,  Citizens  United's  claim  implicates  the  validity  of 
Austin, which in turn implicates the facial validity of $ 441b. 

When  the  statute  now  at  issue  came  before  the  Court  in 
McConnell,  both  the  majority  and  the  dissenting  opinions

considered  the  question  of  its  facial  validity.  The  holding and validity of 

Austin were essential to the reasoning of the 
McConnell  majority  opinion,  which  upheld  BCRA's  exten-sion  of  $ 441b.  See  540  U. S.,  at  205  (quoting 

Austin,  494 
U. S.,  at  660).  McConnell  permitted  federal  felony  punish-ment for speech by all corporations, including nonprofit ones, 

that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elec-
tions.  See 540 U. S., at 203-209.  Four Members of the Mc-
Connell Court would have overruled Austin, including Chief 
Justice  Rehnquist,  who  had  joined  the  Court's  opinion  in 
Austin  but  reconsidered  that  conclusion.  See  540  U. S.,  at

in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by some improper interpretation.  See  Part  II-C, 

supra.  It  is  well  known 
that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks  immediately  before  they  are  held.  There  are  short 

timeframes  in  which  speech  can  have  influence.  The  need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this 
stage in the campaign.  The decision to speak is made in the 
heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others.  A speaker's ability to engage in politi-

cal  speech  that  could  have  a  chance  of  persuading  voters  is stifled  if the  speaker  must  first commence  a  protracted  law-
suit.  By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be 
over  and  the  litigants  in  most  cases  will  have  neither  the 
incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they 
could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is 
"capable  of  repetition,  yet  evading  review."  WRTL,  supra,

subjecting the speaker to criminal penalties, Brandenburg v. 
Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 445 (1969) (per curiam). The  law  before  us  is  an  outright  ban,  backed  by  criminal 

sanctions.  Section  441b  makes  it  a  felony  for  all  corpora-tions--including  nonprofit  advocacy  corporations--either  to 
expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to 
broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a 
primary  election  and  60  days  of  a  general  election.  Thus, 
the  following  acts  would  all  be  felonies  under  $ 441b:  The 
Sierra  Club  runs  an  ad,  within  the  crucial  phase  of  60  days 
before the general election, that exhorts the public to disap-
prove  of  a  Congressman  who  favors  logging  in  national  for-
ests;  the  National  Rifle  Association  publishes  a  book  urging 
the  public  to  vote  for  the  challenger  because  the  incumbent 
U.  S.  Senator  supports  a  handgun  ban;  and  the  American 
Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to 
vote  for  a  Presidential  candidate  in  light  of  that  candidate's 
defense of free speech.  These prohibitions are classic exam-
ples of censorship. 

Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding 
the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak. 
See  McConnell,  540  U. S.,  at  330-333  (opinion  of  Kennedy,

information  within  10  days.  See  id.,  at  330-332  (quoting 
MCFL, 479 U. S., at 253-254 (opinion of Brennan, J.)). 

And  that  is  just  the  beginning.  PACs  must  file  detailed 
monthly  reports  with  the  FEC,  which  are  due  at  different times  depending  on  the  type  of  election  that  is  about  to 

occur: 

" `These reports must contain information regarding the 
amount  of  cash  on  hand;  the  total  amount  of  receipts, detailed  by  10  different  categories;  the  identification  of 

each  political  committee  and  candidate's  authorized  or affiliated  committee making  contributions,  and  any per-
sons  making  loans,  providing  rebates,  refunds,  divi-dends,  or  interest  or  any  other  offset  to  operating  ex-
penditures  in  an  aggregate  amount  over  $200;  the  total amount  of  all  disbursements,  detailed  by  12  different 
categories; the names of all authorized or affiliated com-
mittees  to  whom  expenditures  aggregating  over  $200 have  been  made;  persons  to  whom  loan  repayments  or 

refunds  have  been  made;  the  total  sum  of  all  contribu-tions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obliga-
tions, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any debt  or  obligation.' "  540  U. S.,  at  331-332  (quoting 
MCFL, supra, at 253-254). 
PACs  have  to  comply  with  these  regulations  just  to  speak. 
This  might  explain  why  fewer  than  2,000  of  the  millions 
of  corporations  in  this  country  have  PACs.  See  Brief  for

come Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinafter Statistics of Income) (5.8  million  for-profit  corporations  filed  2006  tax  returns). 

PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able 
to establish a PAC  in time to make  its views  known regard-ing candidates and issues in a current campaign. 

Section  441b's  prohibition  on  corporate  independent  ex-
penditures is thus a ban on speech.  As a "restriction on the amount  of  money  a  person  or  group  can  spend  on  political 

communication during a campaign," that statute "necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number 
of  issues  discussed,  the  depth  of  their  exploration,  and  the 
size  of  the  audience  reached."  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424  U. S. 
1,  19  (1976)  (per  curiam).  Were  the  Court  to  uphold  these 
restrictions,  the  Government  could  repress  speech  by  si-
lencing  certain  voices  at  any  of  the  various  points  in  the 
speech  process.  See  McConnell,  supra,  at  251  (opinion  of 
Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v.  Roy, 401

of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates 
are  integral  to  the  operation  of  the  system  of  government 
established by our Constitution"). 

For  these  reasons,  political  speech  must  prevail  against 
laws  that  would  suppress  it,  whether  by  design  or  inadver-
tence.  Laws  that  burden  political  speech  are  "subject  to 
strict  scrutiny,"  which  requires  the  Government  to  prove 
that  the  restriction  "furthers  a  compelling  interest  and  is 
narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  that  interest."  WRTL,  551

standing,  and  respect  for  the  speaker's  voice.  The  Govern-
ment may not by these means deprive the public of the right 
and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speak-
ers are worthy of consideration.  The First Amendment pro-
tects speech  and speaker, and the  ideas that flow from each. 

The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions 
that  operate  to  the  disadvantage  of  certain  persons,  but 
these rulings  were based  on  an interest in  allowing govern-
mental entities to perform their functions.  See, e. g., Bethel 
School Dist. No. 403 v.  Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 683 (1986) (pro-
tecting  the  "function  of  public  school  education");  Jones  v. 
North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119, 
129 (1977)  (furthering  "the  legitimate penological  objectives 
of  the  corrections  system"  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-
ted));  Parker  v.  Levy,  417  U. S.  733,  759  (1974)  (ensuring 
"the  capacity  of  the  Government  to  discharge  its  [military] 
responsibilities"  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted));  Civil 
Service Comm'n v.  Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 557 (1973) 
("[F]ederal  service  should  depend  upon  meritorious  per-
formance  rather  than  political  service").  The  corporate  in-
dependent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would 
not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are 
inapposite.  These precedents stand only for the proposition 
that  there  are  certain  governmental  functions  that  cannot 
operate  without  some  restrictions  on  particular  kinds  of 
speech.  By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the polit-
ical  process  that  voters  must  be  free  to  obtain  information 
from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their 
votes.  At  least  before  Austin,  the  Court  had  not  allowed 
the  exclusion  of  a  class  of  speakers  from  the  general  public 
dialogue. 

We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of 
political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on 
certain disfavored speakers.  Both history and logic lead us 
to this conclusion.

The  Court  has  recognized  that  First  Amendment  protec-

Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v.  FCC, 518 U. S. 727 
(1996);  Turner,  512  U. S.  622;  Simon  &  Schuster,  502  U. S. 
105;  Sable  Communications  of  Cal.,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  492  U. S. 
115 (1989); Florida Star v.  B.  J.  F.,  491 U. S. 524 (1989); Phil-
adelphia  Newspapers,  Inc.  v.  Hepps,  475  U. S.  767  (1986); 
Landmark  Communications,  Inc.  v.  Virginia,  435  U. S.  829 
(1978);  Young v.  American Mini Theatres,  Inc., 427  U. S.  50

Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v.  Bresler, 398 
U. S. 6 (1970). 

This  protection  has  been  extended  by  explicit  holdings  to 
the  context  of political speech.  See, e. g., Button, 371  U. S., 
at  428-429;  Grosjean  v.  American  Press  Co.,  297  U. S.  233, 
244  (1936).  Under  the  rationale  of  these  precedents,  politi-
cal speech does not lose First Amendment protection "simply 
because its source is a corporation."  Bellotti, supra, at 784; 
see  Pacific  Gas  &  Elec.  Co.  v.  Public  Util.  Comm'n  of  Cal., 
475  U. S.  1,  8  (1986)  (plurality  opinion)  ("The  identity  of  the

tected.  Corporations  and  other  associations,  like  individu-als, contribute to the  `discussion, debate, and the  dissemina-

tion  of  information  and  ideas'  that  the  First  Amendment seeks  to  foster"  (quoting 

Bellotti,  435  U. S.,  at  783)).  The 
Court  has  thus  rejected  the  argument  that  political  speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differ-

ently under the First Amendment simply because such asso-
ciations  are  not  "natural  persons."  Id.,  at  776;  see  id.,  at 780, n. 16.  Cf. 

id., at 828 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). 
At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws of  some  States  and  of  the  United  States  imposed  a  ban  on 

corporate  direct contributions to  candidates.  See B. Smith, 
Unfree  Speech:  The  Folly  of  Campaign  Finance  Reform  23 
(2001).  Yet  not  until  1947  did  Congress  first  prohibit  inde-
pendent  expenditures  by  corporations  and  labor  unions  in 

$ 304 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 
159 (codified at 2 U. S. C. $ 251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)).  In pass-
ing  this  Act  Congress  overrode  the  veto  of  President  Tru-
man, who warned that the expenditure ban was a "dangerous 
intrusion  on  free  speech."  Message  from  the  President  of 
the  United States, H.  R. Doc. No.  334, 80th Cong., 1st  Sess., 
9 (1947). 

For  almost  three  decades  thereafter,  the  Court  did  not 
reach  the  question  whether  restrictions  on  corporate  and 
union expenditures are constitutional.  See  WRTL, 551 
U. S.,  at  502  (opinion  of  Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
ture ban.  Id., at 155 (Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ., concurring in result).  The concurrence ex-

plained  that  any  " `undue  influence' "  generated  by  a  speak-er's  "large  expenditures"  was  outweighed  "by  the  loss  for 
democratic  processes  resulting  from  the  restrictions  upon free and full public discussion." 

Id., at 143. 
In  United  States  v.  Automobile  Workers,  352  U. S.  567 
(1957), the Court again encountered the independent expend-iture ban, which had been recodified at 18 U. S. C. $ 610 (1952 

ed.).  See 62 Stat. 723-724.  After holding only that a union television  broadcast  that  endorsed  candidates  was  covered 
by  the  statute,  the  Court  "[r]efus[ed]  to  anticipate  con-stitutional  questions"  and  remanded  for  the  trial  to  pro-
ceed.  352  U. S.,  at  591.  Three  Justices  dissented,  arguing that  the  Court  should  have  reached  the  constitutional  ques-
tion  and  that  the  ban  on  independent  expenditures  was 
unconstitutional: 

"Under our  Constitution it  is  We  The People who  are sovereign.  The  people  have  the  final  say.  The  legis-

lators are their spokesmen.  The people determine 
through  their  votes  the  destiny  of  the  nation.  It  is therefore  important--vitally  important--that  all  chan-

nels  of  communication  be  open  to  them  during  every election,  that  no  point  of  view  be  restrained  or  barred, 
and  that  the  people  have  access  to  the  views  of  every group  in  the  community." 

Id., at  593  (opinion  of Doug-
las, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Black, J.). 

The  dissent  concluded  that  deeming  a  particular  group  "too 
powerful"  was  not  a  "justificatio[n]  for  withholding  First 
Amendment  rights  from  any  group--labor  or  corporate." 
Id.,  at  597.  The  Court  did  not  get  another  opportunity  to 
consider  the  constitutional  question  in  that  case;  for  after  a 
remand,  a  jury  found  the  defendants  not  guilty.  See  Hay-
ward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421, 
463 (2008).

Opinion of the Court 
Later,  in  Pipefitters  v.  United  States,  407  U. S.  385,  400- 401  (1972),  the  Court  reversed  a  conviction  for  expenditure 

of  union  funds  for  political  speech--again  without  reaching the  constitutional  question.  The  Court  would  not  resolve 
that question for another four years.

In Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various chal-lenges  to  the  Federal  Election  Campaig n  Act  of  1971 

(FECA)  as  amended  in  1974.  These  amendments  created 18  U. S. C.  $ 608(e)  (1970  ed.,  Supp.  V),  see  88  Stat.  1265,  an 
independent  expenditure  ban  separate  from  $ 610  that  ap-plied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions, 
Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, and n. 45. Before  addressing  the  constitutionality  of  $ 608(e)'s  inde-
pendent  expenditure  ban,  Buckley  first  upheld  $ 608(b), FECA's  limits  on  direct  contributions  to  candidates.  The 
Buckley Court recognized a "sufficiently important" govern-mental interest in "the prevention of corruption and the ap-
pearance of corruption."  Id., at 25; see id., at 26.  This fol-lowed  from  the  Court's  concern  that  large  contributions 
could be given "to secure a political quid pro quo."  Ibid. The 

Buckley  Court  explained  that  the  potential  for  quid pro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to can-

didates from independent  expenditures.  The Court empha-sized  that  "the  independent  expenditure  ceiling . . . fails to  
serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process," 
id.,  at  47-48,  because  "[t]he  absence  of  prearrangement  and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will 
be  given  as  a  quid  pro  quo  for  improper  commitments  from the  candidate," 

id., at 47.  Buckley invalidated $ 608(e)'s re-strictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice 

dissenting.  See Federal Election Comm'n v.  National Con-
servative  Political  Action  Comm.,  470  U. S.  480,  491,  n.  3 (1985) (NCPAC).

Opinion of the Court 
Buckley did not consider $ 610's separate ban on corporate and  union  independent  expenditures,  the  prohibition  that 

had  also  been  in  the  background  in  CIO,  Automobile  Work-ers, and Pipefitters.  Had $ 610 been challenged in the wake 
of  Buckley,  however,  it  could  not  have  been  squared  with the  reasoning  and  analysis  of  that  precedent.  See

Opinion of the Court 
cause  its  source  is  a  corporation  that  cannot  prove,  to the  satisfaction  of  a  court,  a  material  effect  on  its  busi-

ness  or  property.  .  .  .  [That  proposition]  amounts  to  an impermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on 
the identity of the interests that spokesmen may repre-sent  in  public  debate  over  controversial  issues  and  a 
requirement  that  the  speaker  have  a  sufficiently  great interest in the subject to justify communication. 

. . . . . 
"In  the  realm  of  protected  speech,  the  legislature  is constitutionally  disqualified  from  dictating  the  subjects 

about  which  persons  may  speak  and  the  speakers  who may address a public issue." 

Id., at 784-785. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  reasoning  and  holding  of Bellotti  did  not  rest  on  the  existence  of  a  viewpointdiscriminatory  statute.  It  rested  on  the  principle  that  the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from 
speaking. 

Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the State's ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candi-

dates.  In  our  view,  however,  that  restriction  would  have been  unconstitutional  under  Bellotti's central  principle: that 
the First Amendment does not allow political speech restric-tions based on a speaker's corporate identity.  See ibid.

Thus  the  law  stood  until  Austin.  Austin  "uph[eld]  a  di-rect restriction on  the independent  expenditure  of funds for 

political  speech  for  the  first  time  in  [this  Court's]  history." 494 U. S., at 695 (

Opinion of the Court 
To  bypass  Buckley  and  Bellotti,  the  Austin  Court  identi-fied a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: 

an  antidistortion  interest.  Austin  found  a  compelling  gov-ernmental interest in preventing "the corrosive and distort-
ing effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accu-mulated  with  the  help  of  the  corporate  form  and  that  have 
little or no correlation to the public's support for the corpora-tion's political ideas."  494 U. S., at 660; see 

id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500-501). 

B 
The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of prec-edent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on political 

speech based on the speaker's corporate identity and a post-Austin  line  that  permits  them.  No  case  before  Austin  had 
held that  Congress could  prohibit independent expenditures for political speech based on the speaker's corporate identity. 
Before Austin, Congress had enacted legislation for this pur-pose, and the Government urged the same proposition before 
this  Court.  See  MCFL,  supra,  at  257  (FEC  posited  that Congress  intended  to  "curb  the  political  influence  of  `those 
who  exercise  control  over  large  aggregations  of  capital' " (quoting 

Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 585)); California Medical  Assn.  v.  Federal  Election  Comm'n,  453  U. S.  182, 

201  (1981)  (Congress  believed that  "differing  structures  and purposes" of corporations and unions "may require different 
forms  of  regulation  in  order  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the electoral process").  In  neither  of these cases  did  the  Court 
adopt the proposition. In  its  defense  of  the  corporate-speech  restrictions  in 

$ 441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on which 

Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but aban-dons reliance upon it.  It argues instead that two other com-

pelling interests support Austin's holding that corporate ex-penditure  restrictions  are  constitutional:  an  anticorruption 
interest,  see 494  U. S., at  678  (Stevens,

Opinion of the Court 
a  shareholder-protection  interest,  see  id.,  at  674-675  (Bren-nan, J., concurring).  We consider the three points in turn. 

1 
As  for  Austin's  antidistortion  rationale,  the  Government does little to defend it.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-48 (Sept. 9, 

2009).  And  with  good  reason,  for  the  rationale  cannot support $ 441b. 

If  the  First  Amendment  has  any  force,  it  prohibits  Con-gress  from  fining  or  jailing  citizens,  or  associations  of  citi-
zens, for simply engaging in political speech.  If the antidis-tortion  rationale  were  to  be  accepted,  however,  it  would 
permit  Government  to  ban  political  speech  simply  because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate 
form.  The  Government  contends  that  Austin  permits  it  to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communi-
cation stemming from a corporation.  See Part II-E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also id., at 26-31 (Mar. 
24,  2009).  If  Austin  were  correct,  the  Government  could prohibit  a  corporation  from  expressing  political  views  in 
media  beyond  those  presented  here,  such  as  by  printing books.  The Government responds "that the FEC has never 
applied this statute to a book," and if it did, "there would be quite  [a]  good  as-applied  challenge."  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  65 
(Sept. 9, 2009).  This troubling assertion of brooding govern-mental  power  cannot  be  reconciled  with  the  confidence  and 
stability  in  civic  discourse  that  the  First  Amendment  must secure. 

Political  speech  is  "indispensable  to  decisionmaking  in  a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes 
from a corporation rather than an individual."  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see 

ibid. (the worth of speech "does  not  depend  upon  the  identity  of  its  source,  whether 

corporation,  association,  union,  or  individual");  Buckley,  424 U. S., at 48-49 ("[T]he concept that government may restrict 
the  speech  of  some  elements  of  our  society  in  order  to  en-

hance  the  relative  voice  of  others  is  wholly  foreign  to  the First  Amendment"); 

Automobile  Workers,  supra,  at  597 
(Douglas,  J.,  dissenting);  CIO,  335  U. S.,  at  154-155  (Rut-ledge, J., concurring in result).  This protection for speech is 

inconsistent  with  Austin's  antidistortion  rationale.  Austin sought  to  defend  the  antidistortion  rationale  as  a  means  to 
prevent  corporations  from  obtaining  " `an  unfair  advantage 
in  the  political  marketplace' "  by  using  " `resources  amassed in  the  economic  marketplace.' "  494  U. S.,  at  659  (quoting 

MCFL,  supra,  at  257).  But  Buckley  rejected  the  premise that the Government has an interest "in equalizing the rela-
tive  ability  of  individuals  and  groups  to  influence  the  out-
come  of  elections."  424  U. S.,  at  48;  see  Bellotti,  supra, 
at  791,  n.  30.  Buckley  was  specific  in  stating  that  "the 
skyrocketing  cost  of  political  campaigns"  could  not  sustain 
the  governmental  prohibition.  424  U. S.,  at  26.  The  First 
Amendment's  protections  do  not  depend  on  the  speaker's 
"financial ability to engage in  public  discussion."  Id., at 49. 

The  Court  reaffirmed  these  conclusions  when  it  invali-
dated  the  BCRA  provision  that  increased  the  cap  on  con-
tributions  to  one  candidate  if  the  opponent  made  certain 
expenditures  from  personal  funds.  See  Davis  v.  Federal 
Election  Comm'n,  554  U. S.  724,  742  (2008)  ("Leveling  elec-
toral  opportunities  means  making  and  implementing  judg-
ments  about  which  strengths  should  be  permitted  to  con-
tribute  to  the  outcome  of  an  election.  The  Constitution, 
however,  confers  upon  voters,  not  Congress,  the  power  to 
choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art. I, 

$ 2,  and  it  is  a  dangerous  business  for  Congress  to  use  the 
election  laws  to  influence  the  voters'  choices").  The  rule 
that  political  speech  cannot  be  limited  based  on  a  speaker's 
wealth  is  a  necessary  consequence  of  the  premise  that  the 
First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of po-
litical speech based on the speaker's identity. 

Either  as  support  for  its  antidistortion  rationale  or  as  a 
further  argument,  the  Austin  majority  undertook  to  distin-

U. S.,  at  658-659.  This  does  not  suffice,  however,  to  allow laws  prohibiting  speech.  "It  is  rudimentary  that  the  State 
cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the for-
feiture  of  First  Amendment  rights."  Id.,  at 680  (Scalia,

Thus, under the Government's reasoning, wealthy media cor-porations  could have their  voices  diminished to put them on 

par  with  other  media  entities.  There  is  no  precedent  for permitting this under the First Amendment. 

The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law  now  under  consideration.  There  is  no  precedent  sup-
porting  laws  that  attempt  to  distinguish  between  corpora-

some  factions  is  "worse  than  the  disease."  The  Federalist No.  10,  p.  130  (B.  Wright  ed.  1961)  (J.  Madison).  Factions 

should be checked by permitting them all to speak, see ibid., and by entrusting the people to judge what is true and what 
is false. The  purpose  and  effect  of  this  law  is  to  prevent  corpora-
tions,  including  small  and  nonprofit  corporations,  from  pre-
senting  both  facts  and  opinions  to  the  public.  This  makes 
Austin's  antidistortion  rationale  all  the  more  an  aberration. 
"[T]he  First  Amendment  protects  the  right  of  corporations to  petition  legislative  and  administrative  bodies." 

Bellotti, 
435  U. S.,  at  792,  n.  31  (citing  California  Motor  Transport 
Co.  v.  Trucking  Unlimited,  404  U. S.  508,  510-511  (1972); 
Eastern  Railroad  Presidents  Conference  v.  Noerr  Motor 
Freight,  Inc.,  365  U. S.  127,  137-138  (1961)).  Corporate  ex-
ecutives  and  employees  counsel  Members  of  Congress  and 
Presidential  administrations  on  many  issues,  as  a  matter  of 
routine and often in private.  An amici brief filed on behalf 
of Montana and 25 other States notes that lobbying and cor-
porate communications with elected officials occur on a regu-
lar  basis.  Brief  for  State  of  Montana  et  al.  19.  When  that 
phenomenon is coupled with $ 441b, the result is that smaller 
or nonprofit corporations cannot raise a voice to object when 
other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are co-
operating  with  the  Government.  That  cooperation  may 
sometimes  be  voluntary,  or  it  may  be  at  the  demand  of  a 
Government official who uses his or her authority, influence, 
and  power  to  threaten  corporations  to  support  the  Govern-
ment's  policies.  Those  kinds  of  interactions  are  often  un-
known and unseen.  The speech that $ 441b forbids, though, 
is  public,  and  all  can  judge  its  content  and  purpose.  Ref-
erences  to  massive  corporate  treasuries  should  not  mask 
the  real  operation  of  this  law.  Rhetoric  ought  not  obscure 
reality.

though  smaller  corporations  may  not  have  the  resources  to do so.  And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associa-

Opinion of the Court 
(CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam)).  The Court, in conse-quence,  has  noted  that  restrictions  on  direct  contributions 

are  preventative,  because  few  if  any  contributions  to  candi-dates  will  involve 

quid  pro  quo  arrangements.  MCFL,  479 
U. S.,  at  260;  NCPAC,  470  U. S.,  at  500;  Federal  Election 
Comm'n  v.  National  Right  to  Work  Comm.,  459  U. S.  197, 
210 (1982) (NRWC).  The Buckley Court, nevertheless, sus-
tained  limits  on  direct  contributions  in  order  to  ensure against  the  reality  or  appearance  of  corruption.  That  case 

did  not  extend  this  rationale  to  independent  expenditures, and the Court does not do so here. 

"The  absence  of  prearrangement  and  coordination  of  an 
expenditure with  the  candidate or his agent not  only  under-
mines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also 
alleviates  the  danger  that  expenditures  will  be  given  as  a 
quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate." 
Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (independent expenditures 
have a "substantially diminished potential for abuse").  Lim-
its on independent expenditures, such as $ 441b, have a chill-
ing  effect  extending  well  beyond  the  Government's  interest 
in  preventing  quid  pro  quo  corruption.  The  anticorruption 
interest is not  sufficient to displace the  speech here in ques-
tion.  Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expendi-
tures  by  for-profit  corporations.  The  Government  does  not 
claim  that  these  expenditures  have  corrupted  the  political 
process  in  those  States.  See  Supp.  Brief  for  Appellee  18, 
n.  3;  Supp.  Brief  for  Chamber  of  Commerce  of  the  United 
States of America as Amicus Curiae 8-9, n. 5. 

A  single  footnote  in  Bellotti  purported  to  leave  open  the 
possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be 
shown to cause corruption.  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.  For the 
reasons explained above, we  now conclude  that independent 
expenditures,  including  those  made  by  corporations,  do  not 
give  rise  to  corruption  or  the  appearance  of  corruption. 
Dicta  in  Bellotti's  footnote  suggested  that  "a  corporation's 
right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no

Opinion of the Court 
comparable  right  in  the  quite  different  context  of  participa-tion  in  a  political  campaign  for  election  to  public  office." 

Ibid.  Citing the portion of Buckley that invalidated the fed-eral independent expenditure ban, 424 U. S., at 46, and a law 
review  student  comment,  Bellotti  surmised  that  "Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger 
of  real  or  apparent  corruption  in  independent  expenditures 
by corporations to influence candidate elections."  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26. 

Buckley, however, struck down a ban on inde-
pendent  expenditures  to  support  candidates  that  covered corporations,  424  U. S.,  at  23,  39,  n.  45,  and  explained  that 

"the  distinction  between discussion  of issues  and candidates 
and  advocacy  of  election  or  defeat  of  candidates  may  often 
dissolve  in  practical  application,"  id.,  at  42.  Bellotti's  dic-
tum  is  thus  supported  only  by  a  law  review  student  com-
ment,  which  misinterpreted  Buckley.  See  Comment,  The 
Regulation  of  Union  Political  Activity:  Majority  and  Minor-
ity  Rights  and  Remedies,  126  U.  Pa.  L.  Rev.  386,  408  (1977) 
(suggesting  that  "corporations  and  labor  unions  should  be 
held to different and more stringent standards  than an indi-
vidual  or  other  associations  under  a  regulatory  scheme  for 
campaign financing"). 

Seizing  on  this  aside  in  Bellotti's  footnote,  the  Court  in 
NRWC  did  say  there  is  a  "sufficient"  governmental  inter-
est  in  "ensur[ing]  that  substantial  aggregations  of  wealth 
amassed" by corporations would not "be used to incur politi-
cal  debts  from  legislators  who  are  aided  by  the  contribu-
tions."  459  U. S.,  at  207-208  (citing  Automobile  Workers, 
352  U. S.,  at  579);  see  459  U. S.,  at  210,  and  n.  7;  NCPAC, 
supra,  at  500-501  (NRWC  suggested  a  governmental  inter-
est  in  restricting  "the  influence  of  political  war  chests  fun-
neled  through  the  corporate  form").  NRWC,  however,  has 
little  relevance  here.  NRWC  decided  no  more  than  that  a 
restriction  on  a  corporation's  ability  to  solicit  funds  for  its 
segregated  PAC,  which  made  direct  contributions  to  candi-
dates,  did  not  violate  the  First  Amendment.  459  U. S.,  at

Opinion of the Court 
206.  NRWC thus involved contribution limits, see NCPAC, 
supra,  at  495-496,  which,  unlike  limits  on  independent  ex-
penditures,  have  been  an  accepted  means  to  prevent  quid 
pro  quo  corruption,  see  McConnell,  540  U. S.,  at  136-138, 
and  n.  40;  MCFL,  supra,  at  259-260.  Citizens  United  has 
not  made  direct  contributions  to  candidates,  and  it  has  not 
suggested  that  the  Court  should  reconsider  whether  contri-
bution  limits  should  be  subjected  to  rigorous  First  Amend-
ment scrutiny. 

When  Buckley  identified  a  sufficiently  important  govern-
mental  interest  in  preventing  corruption  or  the  appearance 
of corruption, that interest  was limited to quid pro quo cor-
ruption.  See McConnell, supra, at 296-298 (opinion of Ken-

360  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
The  appearance  of  influence  or  access,  furthermore,  will not  cause  the  electorate  to  lose  faith  in  our  democracy.  By 

definition,  an  independent  expenditure  is  political  speech presented  to  the  electorate  that  is  not  coordinated  with  a 
candidate.  See Buckley, supra, at 46.  The  fact  that a  cor-poration,  or any other  speaker, is willing to spend  money to 
try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the 
ultimate influence over elected officials.  This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse " `to take 

part in democratic governance' " because of additional politi-cal speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. 

Mc-
Connell,  supra,  at  144  (quoting  Nixon  v.  Shrink  Missouri 
Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390 (2000)). 

Caperton v.  A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. 868 (2009), is 
not  to  the  contrary.  Caperton  held  that  a  judge  was  re-
quired  to  recuse  himself  "when  a  person  with  a  personal 
stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportion-
ate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds 
or directing the judge's election campaign when the case was 
pending  or imminent."  Id.,  at  884.  The  remedy  of  recusal 
was  based  on  a  litigant's  due  process  right  to  a  fair  trial 
before an unbiased judge.  See Withrow v.  Larkin, 421 U. S. 
35,  46  (1975).  Caperton's  holding  was  limited  to  the  rule 
that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant's politi-
cal speech could be banned. 

The McConnell record was "over 100,000 pages" long, Mc-
Connell I, 251  F. Supp. 2d,  at  209, yet  it  "does  not  have  any 
direct  examples  of  votes  being  exchanged  for  .  .  .  expendi-
tures,"  id.,  at  560  (opinion  of  Kollar-Kotelly,  J.).  This  con-
firms Buckley's reasoning that independent  expenditures do 
not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corrup-
tion.  In fact,  there is  only scant  evidence  that  independent 
expenditures  even  ingratiate.  See  251  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  555- 
557  (opinion  of  Kollar-Kotelly,  J.).  Ingratiation  and  access, 
in  any  event,  are  not  corruption.  The  BCRA  record  estab-
lishes  that  certain  donations  to  political  parties,  called  "soft

money,"  were  made  to  gain  access  to  elected  officials.  Mc-Connell,  supra,  at  125,  130-131,  146-152;  see  McConnell  I, 

251  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  471-481,  491-506  (opinion  of  Kollar-Kotelly,  J.);  id.,  at  842-843,  858-859  (opinion  of  Leon,  J.). 
This  case,  however,  is  about  independent  expenditures,  not soft money.  When Congress finds that a problem exists, we 
must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose  an  unconstitutional  remedy.  If  elected  officials  suc-
cumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expedi-
ency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We  must  give  weight  to  attempts  by  Congress  to  seek  to 
dispel  either  the  appearance  or  the  reality  of  these  influ-ences.  The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply 
with  the  First  Amendment;  and  it  is  our  law  and  our  tradi-tion  that  more  speech,  not  less,  is  the  governing  rule.  An 
outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection  period  is  not  a  permissible  remedy.  Here  Con-
gress has  created categorical  bans on speech that are  asym-metrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption. 

3 
The  Government  contends  further  that  corporate  inde-pendent  expenditures  can  be  limited  because  of  its  interest 

in  protecting  dissenting  shareholders  from  being  compelled to  fund  corporate  political  speech.  This  asserted  interest, 
like  Austin's  antidistortion  rationale,  would  allow  the  Gov-ernment  to  ban  the  political  speech  even  of  media  corpora-
tions.  See supra, at 352-354.  Assume, for example, that a shareholder  of  a  corporation  that  owns  a  newspaper  dis-
agrees  with  the  political  views  the  newspaper  expresses. See 

Austin, 494 U. S., at 687 (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders "through the procedures  of  corporate  democracy."  Bellotti,  435  U. S.,  at 

794; see ibid., n. 34.  Those  reasons  are  sufficient  to  reject  this  shareholderprotection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both under-inclusive and overinclusive.  As to the first, if Congress had 
been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have  banned  corporate  speech  in  only  certain  media  within 
30 or 60 days before an election.  A dissenting shareholder's interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any 
time.  As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because it  covers  all  corporations,  including  nonprofit  corporations 
and  for-profit  corporations  with  only  single  shareholders. As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech 
but  to  consider  and  explore  other  regulatory  mechanisms. The  regulatory  mechanism  here,  based  on  speech,  contra-
venes the First Amendment. 

4 
We  need  not  reach  the  question  whether  the  Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or 

associations  from  influencing  our  Nation's  political  process. Cf.  2  U. S. C.  $ 441e  (contribution  and  expenditure  ban  ap-
plied  to  "foreign  national[s]").  Section  441b  is  not  limited to  corporations  or  associations  that  were  created  in  foreign 
countries  or  funded  predominantly  by  foreign  shareholders. Section  441b  therefore  would  be  overbroad  even  if  we  as-
sumed, arguendo, that the  Government  has  a  compelling in-terest in limiting foreign influence over our political process. 
See Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615.

decisis  include  the  antiquity  of  the  precedent,  the  reliance interests  at  stake,  and  of  course  whether  the  decision  was 

well  reasoned."  Montejo  v.  Louisiana,  556  U. S.  778,  792- 793  (2009)  (overruling 

Michigan  v.  Jackson,  475  U. S.  625 
(1986)).  We  have  also  examined  whether  "experience  has pointed  up  the  precedent's  shortcomings."

tin,  which  itself  contravened  this  Court's  earlier  precedents in 

Buckley  and  Bellotti.  "This  Court  has  not  hesitated 
to  overrule  decisions  offensive  to  the  First  Amendment."

and  labor  unions  is  set  forth  in  great  detail  in  [Automobile 
Workers],  supra,  at  570-584,  and  we  need  only  summarize 
the development here"). 

Austin  is  undermined  by  experience  since  its  announce-
ment.  Political  speech  is  so  ingrained  in  our  culture  that speakers  find  ways  to  circumvent  campaign  finance  laws. 

See,  e. g.,  McConnell,  540  U. S.,  at  176-177  ("Given  BCRA's 
tighter  restrictions  on  the  raising  and  spending  of  soft money, the incentives . . .  to  exploit [26 U. S. C. $ 527] organi-

zations will only increase").  Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not  have to circum-
vent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment 
rights.  Speakers  have  become  adept  at  presenting  citizens 
with sound  bites, talking points, and scripted messages that 
dominate  the  24-hour  news  cycle.  Corporations,  like  indi-
viduals,  do  not  have  monolithic  views.  On  certain  topics 
corporations  may  possess  valuable  expertise,  leaving  them 
the  best  equipped  to  point  out  errors  or  fallacies  in  speech 
of  all  sorts,  including  the  speech  of  candidates  and  elected 
officials. 

Rapid  changes  in  technology--and  the  creative  dynamic 
inherent  in  the  concept  of  free  expression--counsel  against 
upholding  a  law  that  restricts  political  speech  in  certain 
media  or  by  certain  speakers.  See  Part  II-C,  supra. 
Today,  30-second  television  ads  may  be  the  most  effective 
way  to  convey  a  political  message.  See  McConnell,  supra, 
at 261 (opinion of Scalia,

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  365 

Opinion of the Court 
No  serious  reliance  interests  are  at  stake.  As  the  Court stated  in  Payne  v.  Tennessee,  501  U. S.  808,  828  (1991),  reli-

ance  interests  are  important  considerations  in  property  and contract cases, where parties may have acted in conformance 
with  existing  legal  rules  in  order  to  conduct  transactions. Here,  though,  parties  have  been  prevented  from  acting-- 

corporations  have  been  banned  from  making  independent expenditures.  Legislatures  may  have  enacted  bans  on  cor-
porate  expenditures  believing  that  those  bans  were  con-stitutional.  This  is  not  a  compelling  interest  for 

stare decisis.  If  it  were,  legislative  acts  could  prevent  us  from 

overruling our own precedents, thereby interfering with our duty  "to  say  what  the  law  is." 

Marbury  v.  Madison,  1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). 

Due  consideration  leads  to  this  conclusion:  Austin,  494 U. S.  652,  should  be  and  now  is  overruled.  We  return  to 
the  principle  established  in  Buckley  and  Bellotti  that  the Government  may  not  suppress  political  speech  on  the  basis 
of  the  speaker's  corporate  identity.  No  sufficient  govern-mental interest justifies limits on the political speech of non-
profit or for-profit corporations. 

D 
Austin  is  overruled,  so  it  provides  no  basis  for  allowing the  Government  to  limit  corporate  independent  expendi-

tures.  As  the  Government  appears  to  concede,  overruling Austin "effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section 203, 
but also  2  U. S. C. 441b's prohibition on  the  use of corporate treasury funds for express advocacy."  Brief for Appellee 33, 
n.  12.  Section  441b's  restrictions  on  corporate  independent expenditures  are  therefore  invalid  and  cannot  be  applied  to 
Hillary. Given  our  conclusion  we  are  further  required  to  overrule 
the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA $ 203's extension of $ 441b's  restrictions  on  corporate  independent  expenditures. 
See  540  U. S.,  at  203-209.  The  McConnell  Court  relied  on 

366  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
the  antidistortion  interest  recognized  in  Austin  to  uphold  a 
greater  restriction  on  speech  than  the  restriction  upheld  in 
Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have found this interest 
unconvincing  and  insufficient.  This  part  of  McConnell  is 
now overruled. 

IV  

A  

Citizens  United  next  challenges  BCRA's  disclaimer  and 
disclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three ad-
vertisements  for  the  movie.  Under  BCRA  $ 311,  televised 
electioneering communications  funded by anyone other than 
a  candidate  must  include  a  disclaimer  that  " `------  is  re-
sponsible  for  the  content  of  this  advertising.' "  2  U. S. C. 

$ 441d(d)(2).  The  required  statement  must  be  made  in  a 
"clearly  spoken  manner,"  and  displayed  on  the  screen  in  a 
"clearly  readable  manner"  for  at  least  four  seconds.  Ibid. 
It  must  state  that  the  communication  "is  not  authorized  by 
any candidate or candidate's committee"; it must also display 
the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or 
group  that  funded  the  advertisement.  $ 441d(a)(3).  Under 
BCRA  $ 201,  any  person  who  spends  more  than  $10,000 
on  electioneering  communications  within  a  calendar  year 
must  file  a  disclosure  statement  with  the  FEC.  2  U. S. C. 

$ 434(f)(1).  That statement must identify the person making 
the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election 
to  which  the  communication  was  directed,  and  the  names  of 
certain contributors.  $ 434(f )(2). 

Disclaimer  and  disclosure  requirements  may  burden  the 
ability  to  speak,  but  they  "impose  no  ceiling  on  campaignrelated activities," Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, and "do not pre-

vent  anyone  from  speaking,"  McConnell,  supra,  at  201  (in-
ternal  quotation  marks  and  brackets  omitted).  The  Court 
has  subjected  these  requirements  to  "exacting  scrutiny," 
which  requires  a  "substantial  relation"  between  the  disclo-
sure requirement and a "sufficiently important" governmen-

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  367 

Opinion of the Court 
tal  interest.  Buckley,  supra,  at  64,  66  (internal  quotation marks omitted); see McConnell, supra, at 231-232. 

In  Buckley,  the  Court  explained  that  disclosure  could  be justified based on a governmental interest in "provid[ing] the 
electorate  with  information"  about  the  sources  of  election-related  spending.  424  U. S.,  at  66.  The 

McConnell  Court applied  this  interest  in  rejecting  facial  challenges  to  BCRA 

$$ 201  and  311.  540  U. S.,  at  196.  There  was  evidence  in the  record  that  independent  groups  were  running  electionrelated  advertisements  " `while  hiding  behind  dubious  and misleading  names.' "  Id.,  at  197  (quoting  McConnell  I,  251 
F.  Supp.  2d,  at  237).  The  Court  therefore  upheld  BCRA $$ 201  and  311  on  the  ground  that  they  would  help  citizens 
" `make informed choices in the political marketplace.' "  540 U. S.,  at  197  (quoting 

McConnell  I,  supra,  at  237);  see  540 U. S., at 231. 

Although  both  provisions  were  facially  upheld,  the  Court acknowledged  that  as-applied  challenges  would  be  available 
if a group could show a " `reasonable probability' " that disclo-sure of its contributors' names " `will subject them to threats, 
harassment,  or  reprisals  from  either  Government  officials or  private  parties.' " 

Id.,  at  198  (quoting  Buckley,  supra, at 74). 

For  the  reasons  stated  below,  we  find  the  statute valid  as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself. 

B 
Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 10-second ads to promote Hillary.  Under FEC regulations, 

a  communication  that  "[p]roposes  a  commercial  transaction" was not subject to 2 U. S. C. $ 441b's restrictions on corporate 
or union funding of electioneering communications.  11 CFR $ 114.15(b)(3)(ii).  The  regulations,  however,  do  not  exempt 
those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure re-quirements  in  BCRA  $$ 201  and  311.  See  72  Fed.  Reg. 
72901 (2007). 

368  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
Citizens  United  argues  that  the  disclaimer  requirements in  $ 311  are  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  its  ads.  It  con-

tends  that  the  governmental  interest  in  providing  informa-tion  to  the  electorate  does  not  justify  requiring  disclaimers 
for  any  commercial  advertisements,  including  the  ones at  issue  here.  We  disagree.  The  ads  fall  within  BCRA's 
definition  of  an  "electioneering  communication":  They  re-
ferred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a pri-mary  and  contained  pejorative  references  to  her  candidacy. 

See  530  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  276,  nn.  2-4.  The  disclaimers  re-quired  by  $ 311  "provid[e]  the  electorate  with  information," 
McConnell,  supra,  at  196,  and  "insure  that  the  voters  are 
fully  informed"  about  the  person  or  group  who  is  speaking, 
Buckley,  supra,  at  76;  see  also  Bellotti,  435  U. S.,  at  792, 
n. 32 ("Identification of the  source of advertising may  be re-
quired  as  a  means  of  disclosure,  so  that  the  people  will  be 
able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being sub-
jected").  At  the  very  least,  the  disclaimers  avoid  confusion 
by  making  clear  that  the  ads  are  not  funded  by  a  candidate 
or political party. 

Citizens  United  argues  that  $ 311  is  underinclusive  be-
cause  it  requires  disclaimers  for  broadcast  advertisements 
but  not  for  print  or  Internet  advertising.  It  asserts  that 

$ 311  decreases  both  the  quantity  and  effectiveness  of  the 
group's  speech  by  forcing  it  to  devote  four  seconds  of  each 
advertisement to the spoken disclaimer.  We rejected these 
arguments  in  McConnell,  supra,  at  230-231.  And  we  now 
adhere  to  that  decision  as  it  pertains  to  the  disclosure 
provisions. 

As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, 
the  disclosure  requirements  in  $ 201  must  be  confined  to 
speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. 
The principal opinion in WRTL limited 2 U. S. C. $ 441b's re-
strictions  on  independent  expenditures  to  express  advocacy 
and its functional equivalent.  551 U. S., at 469-476 (opinion 
of Roberts,

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  369 

Opinion of the Court 
lar distinction into BCRA's disclosure requirements.  We re-
ject this contention. 

The  Court  has  explained  that  disclosure  is  a  less  restric-
tive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of 
speech.  See, e. g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 262.  In Buckley, the 
Court  upheld  a  disclosure  requirement  for  independent  ex-
penditures  even  though  it  invalidated  a  provision  that  im-
posed  a  ceiling  on  those  expenditures.  424  U. S.,  at  75-76. 
In  McConnell, three  Justices  who  would  have  found  $ 441b 
to  be  unconstitutional  nonetheless  voted  to  uphold  BCRA's 
disclosure  and  disclaimer  requirements.  540  U. S.,  at  321 
(opinion  of  Kennedy,

370  CITIZENS  UNITED  v.  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N 

Opinion of the Court 
Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements can  chill donations  to an organization by  exposing donors to 

retaliation.  Some amici point to recent events in which do-nors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or other-
wise  targeted  for  retaliation.  See  Brief  for  Institute  for Justice  as 

Amicus  Curiae  13-16;  Brief  for  Alliance  Defense 
Fund  as  Amicus  Curiae  16-22.  In  McConnell,  the  Court 
recognized that $ 201 would be unconstitutional as applied to an  organization  if  there  were  a  reasonable  probability  that 

the  group's  members  would  face  threats,  harassment,  or  re-prisals  if  their  names  were  disclosed.  540  U. S.,  at  198. 
The  examples  cited  by  amici  are  cause  for  concern.  Citi-
zens United, however, has offered no evidence that its mem-
bers may face similar threats or reprisals.  To the contrary, 
Citizens  United has  been  disclosing  its  donors  for  years  and 
has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation. 

Shareholder  objections  raised  through  the  procedures  of 
corporate  democracy,  see  Bellotti,  supra,  at  794,  and  n.  34, 
can  be  more  effective  today  because  modern  technology 
makes  disclosures  rapid  and  informative.  A  campaign  fi-
nance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures 
with  effective  disclosure  has  not  existed  before  today.  It 
must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress' findings 
in  passing  BCRA  were  premised  on  a  system  without  ade-
quate  disclosure.  See  McConnell,  540  U. S.,  at  128  ("[T]he 
public  may  not  have  been  fully  informed  about  the  sponsor-
ship of so-called issue ads"); id., at 196-197 (citing McConnell 
I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237).  With the advent of the Internet, 
prompt  disclosure  of  expenditures  can  provide  shareholders 
and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations 
and  elected  officials  accountable  for  their  positions  and  sup-
porters.  Shareholders  can  determine  whether  their  corpo-
ration's  political  speech  advances  the  corporation's  interest 
in  making  profits,  and  citizens  can  see  whether  elected  offi-
cials  are  " `in  the  pocket'  of  so-called  moneyed  interests." 
540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of Scalia,

Cite as: 558 U. S. 310 (2010)  371 

Opinion of the Court 
261.  The  First  Amendment  protects  political  speech;  and disclosure  permits  citizens  and  shareholders  to  react  to  the 

speech of corporate entities in a proper way.  This transpar-ency  enables  the  electorate  to  make  informed  decisions  and 
give proper weight to different speakers and messages. 

C 
For the  same  reasons  we uphold  the  application of BCRA $$ 201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their application to Hil-

lary.  We  find  no  constitutional  impediment  to  the  applica-tion  of  BCRA's  disclaimer  and  disclosure  requirements  to  a 
movie  broadcast  via  video-on-demand.  And  there  has  been no  showing that,  as  applied  in  this  case,  these  requirements 
would impose a chill on speech or expression. 

V 
When  word  concerning  the  plot  of  the  movie  Mr.  Smith 
Goes to Washington reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution. 

See  Smoodin,  "Compulsory"  Viewing  for  Every  Citizen: 
Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3,  19,  and  n.  52  (Winter  1996)  (citing  Mr.  Smith  Riles  Wash-

ington,  Time,  Oct.  30,  1939,  p.  49);  Nugent,  Capra's  Capitol Offense,  N.  Y.  Times,  Oct.  29,  1939,  p.  X5.  Under  Austin, 
though,  officials  could  have  done  more  than  discourage  its distribution--they could have banned the film.  After all, it, 
like  Hillary,  was  speech  funded  by  a  corporation  that  was critical  of  Members of Congress. 

Mr.  Smith  Goes  to Wash-ington  may  be  fiction  and  caricature;  but  fiction  and  carica-

ture can be a powerful force. Modern  day  movies,  television  comedies,  or  skits  on  YouTube.com  might  portray  public  officials  or  public  policies  in unflattering ways.  Yet if a covered transmission during the 
blackout  period  creates  the  background  for  candidate  en-dorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a cor-
poration, other than an exempt media corporation, has made

matic  bankruptcy  stay  has  issued  pursuant  to  11  U. S. C.  $ 362. Respondent  contends  that  the  present  action  comes  within  the 
scope  of the  automatic  stay.  If  we  were to  grant  the petition  we would  be  required  to  construe  New  Jersey  law  without  the  aid of 
a  reasoned  state  appellate  court  decision  and  to  confront  a  proce-dural  obstacle  unrelated  to  the  question  presented.  Under  these 
circumstances, it is best to deny the petition.  It seems advisable, however,  to  note  that  the  petition  for  certiorari  does  implicate 
issues  of  constitutional  significance.

was  presumably  an  eyewitness;  (3)  the  fact  that  traffic  stops  are typically  less  invasive  than  searches  or  seizures  of  individuals  on 
foot;  and  (4)  the  diminished  expectation  of  privacy  enjoyed  by individuals  driving  their  cars  on  public  roads.  A  minority  of  ju-
risdictions,  meanwhile,  take  the  same  position  as  the  Virginia Supreme Court, requiring that officers first confirm an anonymous 
tip  of  drunk  or  erratic  driving  through  their  own  independent observation.

3  This  conflict  has  been  expressly  noted  by  the 

lower  courts.4 The  conflict  is  clear  and  the  stakes  are  high.  The  effect  of  the 

rule  below  will  be  to  grant  drunk  drivers  "one  free  swerve"  be-fore they  can  legally  be  pulled  over by  police.  It  will be  difficult 
for  an  officer  to  explain  to  the  family  of  a  motorist  killed  by  that swerve  that  the  police  had  a  tip  that  the  driver  of  the  other  car 
was  drunk,  but  that  they  were  powerless  to  pull  him  over,  even for  a  quick  check. 

Maybe  the  decision  of  the  Virginia  Supreme  Court  below  was correct,  and  the  Fourth  Amendment  bars  police  from  acting  on 
anonymous  tips  of  drunk  driving  unless  they  can  verify  each  tip. If  so,  then  the  dangerous  consequences  of  this  rule  are  unavoid-
able.  But  the  police  should  have  every  legitimate  tool  at  their disposal  for  getting  drunk  drivers  off  the  road.  I  would  grant 
certiorari  to  determine  if  this  is  one  of  them.

Under  our  normal  practice,  Muhammad's  timely  petition  for  cer-
tiorari would have been reviewed at our Conference on November 
24,  2009.  Virginia  has  scheduled  his  execution  for  November  10, 
however,  so  we  must  resolve  the  petition  on  an  expedited  basis 
unless we grant a temporary stay.  By denying Muhammad's stay 
application, we have allowed Virginia  to truncate our deliberative 
process  on  a  matter--involving  a  death  row  inmate--that  de-
mands  the  most  careful  attention.  This  result  is  particularly  un-
fortunate  in  light  of  the  limited  time  Muhammad  was  given  to 
make  his  case  in  the  District  Court. 

I  continue  to  believe  that  the  Court  would  be  wise  to  adopt  a 
practice  of  staying  all  executions  scheduled  in  advance  of  the 
completion  of  our  review  of  a  capital  defendant's  first  application 
for  a  federal  writ  of  habeas  corpus.  See,  e. g.,  Emmett  v.  Kelly,

rendered.  The  GVR  for  consideration  of  a  day's  old  Supreme Court  case  is  already  a  technical  violation  of  sound  practice 
and  should  not  be  extended further.  Since  we  review  judgments rather  than  opinions,  a  lower  court's  failure  to  discuss  a  pre-
existing  factor  it  should  have  discussed  is  no  basis  for  rever-sal.  Once  we  disregard  the  logic  (and  the  attendant  limits)  of 
"intervening-factor" GVRs, they metastasize into today's monster. We  should  at  least  give  it  a  new  and  honest  name--not  GVR, 
but perhaps SRMEOPR: Summary Remand  for a More Extensive Opinion  than  Petitioner  Requested.  If  the  acronym  is  ugly,  so  is 
the  monster.

dorsing  the  correctness  of  the  applicant's  statement,  stating 
that  the  applicant  possesses  all  the  qualifications  required 
for  admission,  and  affirming  that  the  applicant  is  of  good 
moral  and  professional  character.  Both  sponsors  must  be 
members  of the  Bar of  this  Court  who personally  know, but 
are not related to, the applicant. 

3.  If the documents submitted demonstrate that the appli-
cant  possesses  the  necessary  qualifications,  and  if  the  appli-
cant has signed the oath or affirmation and paid the required 
fee,  the  Clerk  will  notify  the  applicant  of  acceptance  by  the 
Court  as  a  member  of  the  Bar  and  issue  a  certificate  of  ad-
mission.  An  applicant  who  so  wishes  may  be  admitted  in 
open  court  on  oral  motion  by  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  this 
Court,  provided  that  all  other  requirements  for  admission 
have been satisfied. 

4.  Each  applicant shall sign the  following  oath or affirma-
tion:  I,  ...............,  do  solemnly  swear  (or  affirm)  that  as  an 
attorney and as a counselor of this Court, I will conduct my-
self  uprightly  and  according  to  law,  and  that  I  will  support 
the Constitution of the United States. 

5.  The fee for admission to the Bar and a certificate bear-
ing the seal of the Court is $200, payable to the United States 
Supreme  Court.  The  Marshal  will  deposit  such  fees  in  a 
separate fund to be disbursed by the Marshal at the direction 
of the Chief Justice for the costs of admissions, for the benefit 
of the Court and its Bar, and for related purposes. 

6.  The  fee  for  a  duplicate  certificate  of  admission  to  the 
Bar  bearing  the  seal  of  the  Court  is  $15,  and  the  fee  for  a 
certificate  of  good  standing  is  $10,  payable  to  the  United 
States Supreme Court.  The proceeds will be maintained by 
the Marshal as provided in paragraph 5 of this Rule.

conflicts  with  a  decision  by  a  state  court  of  last  resort; or  has  so  far  departed  from  the  accepted  and  usual 
course  of  judicial  proceedings,  or  sanctioned  such  a  de-parture  by  a  lower  court,  as  to  call  for  an  exercise  of 
this Court's supervisory power; (b)  a  state  court  of  last  resort  has  decided  an  impor-

has decided an important federal question in a way that conflicts with relevant decisions of this Court. 

A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted  error  consists  of  erroneous  factual  findings  or  the

the basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgment sought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and any 
order respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons why an  extension  of  time  is  justified.  The  application  must  be 
filed with the Clerk at least 10 days before the date the peti-tion is due, except in extraordinary circumstances.  For the

If the material required by this subparagraph is voluminous, it  may  be  presented  in  a  separate  volume  or  volumes  with 

appropriate covers. 2.  All  contentions  in  support  of  a  petition  for  a  writ  of 
certiorari shall be set out in the body of the petition, as pro-vided  in  subparagraph  1(h)  of  this  Rule.  No  separate  brief 
in  support of  a  petition  for  a  writ  of certiorari  may be  filed, and the Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari 
to which any supporting brief is annexed or appended. 3.  A  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be  stated 
briefly  and  in  plain  terms  and  may  not  exceed  the  word  or page limitations specified in Rule 33. 

4.  The  failure  of  a  petitioner  to  present  with  accuracy, brevity,  and  clarity  whatever  is  essential  to  ready  and  ade-
quate understanding of the  points requiring consideration is sufficient reason for the Court to deny a petition. 

5.  If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with this 
Rule  or  with  Rule  33  or  Rule  34,  the  Clerk  will  return  it with a letter indicating the deficiency.  A corrected petition 
submitted in accordance with Rule 29.2 no more than 60 days after  the  date  of  the  Clerk's  letter  will  be  deemed  timely.

2.  A  brief  in  opposition  should  be  stated  briefly  and  in 
plain terms and may not exceed the word or page limitations 
specified  in  Rule  33.  In  addition  to  presenting  other  argu-
ments for denying the petition, the brief in opposition should 
address  any  perceived  misstatement  of  fact  or  law  in  the 
petition that  bears  on  what issues properly  would be  before 
the  Court  if  certiorari  were  granted.  Counsel  are  admon-
ished  that  they  have  an  obligation  to  the  Court  to  point  out 
in  the  brief  in  opposition,  and  not  later,  any  perceived  mis-
statement made in  the  petition.  Any objection to consider-
ation  of a question presented  based on what  occurred in the 
proceedings  below,  if  the  objection  does  not  go  to  jurisdic-
tion,  may  be  deemed  waived  unless  called  to  the  Court's  at-
tention in the brief in opposition. 

3.  Any  brief  in  opposition  shall  be  filed  within  30  days 
after the  case is  placed on  the docket, unless  the  time is  ex-
tended by the Court or a Justice, or by the Clerk under Rule

5.  The  Clerk  will  distribute  the  petition  to  the  Court  for 
its  consideration  upon  receiving  an  express  waiver  of  the 
right  to  file  a  brief  in  opposition,  or,  if  no  waiver  or  brief  in

shall  be  made  on  both  the  Governor  and  the  Attorney  Gen-eral of that State. 

4.  The case  will be placed  on the  docket when  the  motion for  leave  to  file  and  the  initial  pleading  are  filed  with  the 
Clerk.  The Rule 38(a) docket fee shall be paid at that time. 5.  No  more  than  60  days  after  receiving  the  motion  for 
leave  to  file  and  the  initial  pleading,  an  adverse  party  shall file  40  copies  of  any  brief  in  opposition  to  the  motion,  with 
proof of service as required by Rule 29.  The Clerk will dis-tribute the filed documents to the Court for its consideration 
upon  receiving  an  express  waiver  of  the  right  to  file  a  brief in opposition, or, if no waiver or brief is filed, upon the expi-
ration of the time allowed for filing.  If a brief in opposition is  timely  filed,  the  Clerk  will  distribute  the  filed  documents 
to  the  Court  for  its  consideration  no  less  than  10  days  after the  brief  in  opposition  is  filed.  A  reply  brief  may  be  filed, 
but  consideration  of  the  case  will  not  be  deferred  pending its  receipt.  The  Court  thereafter  may  grant  or  deny  the 
motion,  set  it  for  oral  argument,  direct  that  additional documents  be  filed,  or  require  that  other  proceedings  be 
conducted. 6.  A  summons  issued  out  of  this  Court  shall  be  served

or statutes  under which  the  appeal is  taken.  A  copy  of the notice of appeal shall be served on all parties to the proceed-
ing as required by Rule 29, and proof of service shall be filed in the district court together with the notice of appeal. 

2.  All  parties  to  the  proceeding  in  the  district  court  are deemed  parties  entitled  to  file  documents  in  this  Court,  but 
a party having no interest in the outcome of the appeal may 
so  notify  the  Clerk  of  this  Court  and  shall  serve  a  copy  of the  notice  on  all  other  parties.  Parties  interested  jointly, 

severally,  or  otherwise  in  the  judgment  may  appeal  sepa-rately,  or  any  two  or  more  may  join  in  an  appeal.  When 
two or more judgments involving identical or closely related questions are sought to be reviewed on appeal from the same 
court, a notice of appeal for each judgment shall be filed with the  clerk  of  the  district  court,  but  a  single  jurisdictional 
statement covering all the judgments suffices.  Parties who 
file  no  document  will  not  qualify  for  any  relief  from  this Court. 

3.  No  more  than  60  days  after  filing  the  notice  of  appeal in  the  district  court,  the  appellant  shall  file  40  copies  of  a 
jurisdictional statement and shall pay the Rule 38 docket fee, except  that  an  appellant  proceeding

period not exceeding 60 days.  An application to extend the time  to file  a  jurisdictional statement  shall  set  out  the  basis 
for  jurisdiction  in  this  Court;  identify  the  judgment  sought to  be  reviewed;  include  a  copy  of  the  opinion,  any  order  re-
specting rehearing, and the notice of appeal; and set out spe-cific  reasons  why  an  extension  of  time  is  justified.  For  the 
time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules 21, 
22, and 30.  An application to extend the time to file a juris-dictional statement is not favored.

placed  on this Court's docket within  the  time prescribed for docketing,  the  district  court  may  dismiss  the  appeal  on  the 

appellee's  motion,  with  notice  to  all  parties,  and  may  make any  just  order  with  respect  to  costs.  If  the  district  court 
has  denied  the  appellee's  motion  to  dismiss  the  appeal,  the appellee  may move  this Court to docket and  dismiss the ap-
peal by filing an original and 10 copies of a motion presented in  conformity  with  Rules  21  and  33.2.  The  motion  shall  be 
accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29, and 
by a certificate from the clerk of the district court, certifying that  a  notice  of  appeal  was  filed  and  that  the  appellee's  mo-

tion to dismiss was denied.  The appellant may not thereaf-ter file a jurisdictional statement without special leave of the 
Court, and  the  Court may  allow costs  against  the  appellant. 6.  Within  30  days  after  the  case  is  placed  on  this  Court's 
docket,  the  appellee  may  file  a  motion  to  dismiss,  to  affirm, or  in  the  alternative  to  affirm  or  dismiss.  Forty  copies  of 
the motion shall be filed, except that an appellee proceeding

which shall comply fully with Rule 15.  If a party named as a  respondent  does  not  wish  to  respond  to  the  petition,  that 
party may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter. 
All persons  served are  deemed  respondents for all purposes in the proceedings in this Court. 

4.  (a)  A  petition  seeking  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2242, 
and in particular  with the provision in the last paragraph of $ 2242,  which  requires  a  statement  of  the  "reasons  for  not 
making  application  to  the  district  court  of  the  district  in which the applicant is held."  If the relief sought is from the 
judgment  of  a  state  court,  the  petition  shall  set  out  specifi-
cally  how  and  where  the  petitioner  has  exhausted  available remedies  in  the  state  courts  or  otherwise  comes  within 

the  provisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b).  To justify the  grant-ing  of  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus,  the  petitioner  must  show 
that  exceptional  circumstances  warrant  the  exercise  of  the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot 
be obtained in any other form or from any other court.  This writ is rarely granted.

to  be directed,  and  accompanied  by 10  copies  of  the  original application and proof of service as required by Rule 29.

tion  to  extend  the  time  to  file  a  brief  on  the  merits  is  not favored.  If  a  case  is  advanced  for  hearing,  the  time  to  file 
briefs  on  the  merits  may  be  abridged  as  circumstances  re-quire pursuant to an order of the Court on its own motion or 
that of a party. 6.  A  party  wishing  to  present  late  authorities,  newly  en-
acted  legislation,  or  other  intervening  matter  that  was  not available  in  time  to  be  included  in  a  brief  may  file  40  copies

be transmitted to the Clerk of Court and to opposing counsel of  record  at  the  time  the  brief  is  filed  in  accordance  with 
guidelines  established  by  the  Clerk.  The  electronic  trans-mission  requirement  is  in  addition  to  the  requirement  that

the  judgment,  order,  or  decision  under  review;  and  (4)  any other parts of the record that the parties particularly wish to 

bring  to  the  Court's  attention.  Any  of  the  foregoing  items already  reproduced  in  a  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari,  ju-
risdictional  statement,  brief  in  opposition  to  a  petition  for  a writ of certiorari, motion to dismiss or affirm, or any appen-
dix  to the foregoing, that was  prepared as required  by Rule 33.1,  need  not  be  reproduced  again  in  the  joint  appendix. 
The  petitioner  or  appellant  shall  serve  three  copies  of  the 
joint appendix on each of the other parties to the proceeding as required by Rule 29. 

2.  The parties are  encouraged to agree on the  contents of the  joint  appendix.  In  the  absence  of  agreement,  the  peti-
tioner  or  appellant,  within  10  days  after  entry  of  the  order granting  the  writ  of  certiorari,  noting  probable  jurisdiction, 
or postponing consideration of jurisdiction, shall serve on the respondent  or  appellee  a  designation  of  parts  of  the  record 
to  be  included  in  the  joint  appendix.  Within  10  days  after 
receiving the designation, a respondent or appellee who con-siders the parts of the record so designated insufficient shall 

serve  on  the  petitioner  or  appellant  a  designation  of  addi-tional  parts  to  be  included  in  the  joint  appendix,  and  the 
petitioner or appellant shall include the parts so designated. If  the  Court  has  permitted  the  respondent  or  appellee  to 
proceed  in

RULES  OF  THE  SUPREME  COURT  1197 
the joint appendix shall be paid initially by the petitioner or appellant;  but  a  petitioner  or  appellant  who  considers  that 

parts of the record designated by the respondent or appellee are  unnecessary  for  the  determination  of  the  issues  pre-
sented  may  so  advise  the  respondent  or  appellee,  who  then shall advance the cost of printing the additional parts, unless 
the Court or a Justice otherwise fixes the initial allocation of the  costs.  The  cost  of  printing  the  joint  appendix  is  taxed 
as a cost in the case, but if a party unnecessarily causes mat-
ter  to  be  included  in  the  joint  appendix  or  prints  excessive copies, the Court may impose these costs on that party. 

4.  (a)  On the parties' request, the Clerk may allow prepa-ration  of  the  joint  appendix  to  be  deferred  until  after  the 
briefs  have  been  filed.  In  that  event,  the  petitioner  or  ap-pellant  shall  file  the  joint  appendix  no  more  than  14  days 
after  receiving  the  brief  for  the  respondent  or  appellee. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this Rule shall be 
followed,  except  that  the  designations  referred  to  therein 
shall  be  made  by  each  party  when  that  party's  brief  is served.  Deferral of the joint appendix is not favored. 

(b)  If the deferred method is used, the briefs on the merits may  refer  to  the  pages  of  the  record.  In  that  event,  the 
joint appendix shall include in brackets on each page thereof the  page  number  of  the  record  where  that  material  may  be 
found.  A party wishing to refer directly to the pages of the joint appendix may serve and file copies of its brief prepared 
as  required  by  Rule  33.2  within  the  time  provided  by  Rule 25,  with  appropriate  references  to  the  pages  of  the  record. 
In that event, within 10 days after the joint appendix is filed, 
copies of the brief prepared as required by Rule 33.1 contain-ing references to the pages of the joint appendix in place of, 

or  in  addition  to,  the  initial  references  to  the  pages  of  the record,  shall  be  served  and  filed.  No  other  change  may  be 
made  in  the  brief  as  initially  served  and  filed,  except  that typographical errors may be corrected. 

5.  The  joint  appendix  shall  be  prefaced  by  a  table  of  con-
tents showing the parts of the record that it contains, in the 
order  in  which  the  parts  are  set  out,  with  references  to  the 

1198  RULES  OF  THE  SUPREME  COURT 
pages of the joint appendix at which each part begins.  The relevant  docket  entries  shall  be  set  out  after  the  table  of 

contents, followed by the other parts of the record in chrono-logical  order.  When  testimony  contained  in  the  reporter's 
transcript of proceedings is set out in the joint appendix, the page  of  the  transcript  at  which  the  testimony  appears  shall 
be  indicated  in  brackets  immediately  before  the  statement that  is  set  out.  Omissions  in  the  transcript  or  in  any  other 
document printed in the joint appendix shall be indicated by asterisks.  Immaterial  formal  matters  (

2.  The  Clerk  will  advise  counsel  when  they  are  required to  appear  for  oral  argument  and  will  publish  a  hearing  list 
in  advance  of  each  argument  session  for  the  convenience  of counsel and the information of the public. 

3.  The  Court,  on  its  own  motion  or  that  of  a  party,  may order  that  two  or  more  cases  involving  the  same  or  related 
questions  be  argued  together  as  one  case  or  on  such  other terms as the Court may prescribe.

5.  Regardless  of  the  number  of  counsel  participating  in oral  argument,  counsel  making  the  opening  argument  shall 
present the case fairly and completely and not reserve points of substance for rebuttal. 

6.  Oral  argument  will  not  be  allowed  on  behalf  of  any party for whom a brief has not been filed.

U. S. C. $ 1746 setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class  postage  has  been  prepaid.  If  the  postmark  is 
missing  or  not  legible,  or  if  the  third-party  commercial  car-rier does not provide the date the document was received by 
the  carrier,  the  Clerk  will  require  the  person  who  sent  the document  to  submit  a  notarized  statement  or  declaration  in 
compliance  with  28  U. S. C.  $ 1746  setting  out  the  details  of 
the filing and stating that the filing took place on a particular date within the permitted time. 

3.  Any  document  required  by  these  Rules  to  be  served may  be  served  personally,  by  mail,  or  by  third-party  com-
mercial  carrier  for  delivery  within  3  calendar  days  on  each party  to  the  proceeding  at  or  before  the  time  of  filing.  If 
the  document  has  been  prepared  as  required  by  Rule  33.1, three  copies  shall  be  served  on  each  other  party  separately 
represented  in  the  proceeding.  If  the  document  has  been 
prepared  as  required  by  Rule  33.2,  service  of  a  single  copy on each other separately represented party suffices.  If per-

sonal service is made, it shall consist of delivery at the office of the counsel  of record, either  to counsel or to  an employee 
therein.  If service is by mail or third-party commercial car-rier,  it  shall  consist  of  depositing  the  document  with  the 
United  States  Postal  Service,  with  no  less  than  first-class 
postage  prepaid,  or  delivery  to  the  carrier  for  delivery 
within 3 calendar days, addressed to counsel of record at the 
proper  address.  When  a  party  is  not  represented  by  coun-
sel,  service  shall  be  made  on  the  party,  personally,  by  mail, 
or  by  commercial  carrier.  Ordinarily,  service  on  a  party 
must  be  by  a  manner  at  least  as  expeditious  as  the  manner 
used to file the document with the Court. 

4.  (a)  If  the  United  States  or  any  federal  department,  of-
fice, agency, officer, or employee is a party to be served, serv-
ice  shall  be  made  on  the  Solicitor  General  of  the  United 
States, Room 5614, Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania 
Ave.,  N.  W.,  Washington,  DC  20530-0001.  When  an  agency 

1202  RULES  OF  THE  SUPREME  COURT 
of  the  United  States  that  is  a  party  is  authorized  by  law  to appear before this Court on its own behalf, or when an officer 

or employee of the United States is a party, the agency, offi-cer,  or  employee  shall  be  served  in  addition  to  the  Solicitor 
General. (b)  In any proceeding in this  Court in which the constitu-
tionality  of  an  Act  of  Congress  is  drawn  into  question,  and neither the United States nor any federal department, office, 
agency,  officer,  or  employee  is  a  party,  the  initial  document 
filed  in  this  Court  shall  recite  that  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(a)  may apply  and  shall  be  served  on  the  Solicitor  General  of  the 

United States, Room 5614, Department of Justice, 950 Penn-sylvania  Ave.,  N.  W.,  Washington,  DC  20530-0001.  In  such 
a  proceeding  from  any  court  of  the  United  States,  as  de-fined  by  28  U. S. C.  $ 451,  the  initial  document  also  shall 
state  whether  that  court,  pursuant  to  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(a), certified  to  the  Attorney  General  the  fact  that  the  constitu-
tionality  of  an  Act  of  Congress  was  drawn  into  question. 
See Rule 14.1(e)(v). (c)  In  any  proceeding  in  this  Court  in  which  the  constitu-

tionality of any statute of a State is drawn into question, and neither the State nor any agency, officer, or employee thereof 
is a party, the initial document filed in this Court shall recite that  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(b)  may  apply  and  shall  be  served  on 
the  Attorney  General  of  that  State.  In  such  a  proceeding 
from any court of the United States, as defined by 28 U. S. C. 

$ 451,  the  initial  document  also  shall  state  whether  that 
court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b), certified to the State 
Attorney  General  the  fact  that  the  constitutionality  of  a 
statute  of  that  State  was  drawn  into  question.  See  Rule 
14.1(e)(v). 

5.  Proof  of  service,  when  required  by  these  Rules,  shall 
accompany  the  document  when  it  is  presented  to  the  Clerk 
for  filing  and  shall  be  separate  from  it.  Proof  of  service 
shall contain, or be accompanied by, a statement that all par-
ties  required  to  be  served  have  been  served,  together  with 
a  list  of  the  names,  addresses,  and  telephone  numbers  of

counsel  indicating  the  name  of  the  party  or  parties  each counsel represents.  It is not necessary that service on each 

party required to be served be made in the same manner or evidenced  by  the  same  proof.  Proof  of  service  may  consist 
of any one of the following: (a)  an  acknowledgment  of  service,  signed  by  counsel  of 
record  for  the  party  served,  and  bearing  the  address  and telephone number of such counsel; 

(b)  a  certificate  of  service,  reciting  the  facts  and  circum-
stances  of  service  in  compliance  with  the  appropriate  para-graph  or  paragraphs  of  this  Rule,  and  signed  by  a  member 

of  the  Bar  of  this  Court  representing  the  party  on  whose behalf service is made or by an attorney appointed to repre-
sent that party under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, see 18 U. S. C.  $ 3006A(d)(6),  or  under  any  other  applicable  federal 
statute; or (c)  a  notarized  affidavit  or  declaration  in  compliance  with 
28  U. S. C.  $ 1746,  reciting  the  facts  and  circumstances  of 
service  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  paragraph  or paragraphs  of  this  Rule,  whenever  service  is  made  by  any 

person  not  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  this  Court  and  not  an attorney appointed  to represent a  party under  the  Criminal 
Justice  Act  of  1964,  see  18  U. S. C.  $ 3006A(d)(6),  or  under any other applicable federal statute.

quest.  Counsel shall ensure that there is adequate contrast 
between  the  printing  and  the  color  of  the  cover.  A  docu-
ment  filed  by  the  United  States,  or  by  any  other  federal 
party represented by the Solicitor General, shall have a gray
