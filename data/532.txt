CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2000

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR et al. v. KLAMATHWATER USERS PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-1871. Argued January 10, 2001--Decided March 5, 2001
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)

administers the Klamath Irrigation Project (Project), which uses water
from the Klamath River Basin to irrigate parts of Oregon and California. After the Department began developing the Klamath Project Operation Plan (Plan) to provide water allocations among competing uses
and users, the Department asked the Klamath and other Indian Tribes
(Basin Tribes or Tribes) to consult with Reclamation on the matter. A
memorandum of understanding between those parties called for assessment, in consultation with the Tribes, of the impacts of the Plan on
tribal trust resources. During roughly the same period, the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the
Klamath Tribe in an Oregon state-court adjudication intended to allocate water rights. Since the Bureau is responsible for administering
land and water held in trust for Indian tribes, it consulted with the
Klamath Tribe, and the two exchanged written memorandums on the
appropriate scope of the claims ultimately submitted by the Government
for the benefit of the Tribe. Respondent Klamath Water Users Protective Association (Association) is a nonprofit group, most of whose members receive water from the Project and have interests adverse to the
tribal interests owing to scarcity of water. The Association filed a series of requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), 5 U. S. C. $ 552, seeking access to communications between the

Bureau and the Basin Tribes. The Bureau turned over several documents, but withheld others under the attorney work-product and deliberative process privileges that are said to be incorporated in FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure "inter-agency or intra-agency
memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party
other than an agency in litigation with the agency," $ 552(b)(5). The
Association then sued the Bureau under FOIA to compel release of the
documents. The District Court granted the Government summary
judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling out any application of
Exemption 5 on the ground that the Tribes with whom the Department
has a consulting relationship have a direct interest in the subject matter
of the consultations. The court said that to hold otherwise would extend Exemption 5 to shield what amount to ex parte communications in
contested proceedings between the Tribes and the Department.

Held: The documents at issue are not exempt from FOIA's disclosure requirements as "inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters."
Pp. 7-16.

(a) Consistent with FOIA's goal of broad disclosure, its exemptions
have been consistently given a narrow compass. E. g., Department of
Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151. Pp. 7-8.

(b) To qualify under Exemption 5's express terms, a document must
satisfy two conditions: its source must be a Government agency, and it
must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial
standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds the
document. This Court's prior Exemption 5 cases have addressed the
second condition, and have dealt with the incorporation of civil discovery
privileges. So far as they matter here, those privileges include the
privilege for attorney work product and the so-called "deliberative process" privilege, which covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations that are part of a process by which
Government decisions and policies are formulated. NLRB v. Sears,
Roebuck & Co., 421 U. S. 132, 150. The point of Exemption 5 is not to

condition is no less important than the second; the communication must
be "inter-agency or intra-agency," 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(5). "[A]gency" is
defined to mean "each authority of the Government," $ 551(1), and includes entities such as Executive Branch departments, military departments, Government corporations, Government-controlled corporations,
and independent regulatory agencies, $ 552(f). Although Exemption 5's
terms and the statutory definitions say nothing about communications
with outsiders, some Courts of Appeals have held that a document prepared for a Government agency by an outside consultant qualifies as an

"intra-agency" memorandum. In such cases, the records submitted by
outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's deliberative process as documents prepared by agency personnel. The
fact about the consultant that is constant in the cases is that the consultant does not represent its own interest, or the interest of any other
client, when it advises the agency that hires it. Its only obligations are
to truth and its sense of what good judgment calls for, and in those
respects it functions just as an employee would be expected to do.
Pp. 8-11.

(c) The Department misplaces its reliance on this consultant corollary
to Exemption 5. The Department's argument skips a necessary step,
for it ignores the first condition of Exemption 5, that the communication
be "intra-agency or inter-agency." There is no textual justification for
draining that condition of independent vitality. Once the intra-agency
condition is applied, it rules out any application of Exemption 5 to tribal
communications on analogy to consultants' reports (assuming, which the
Court does not decide, that these reports may qualify as intra-agency
under Exemption 5). Consultants whose communications have typically been held exempt have not communicated with the Government in
their own interest or on behalf of any person or group whose interests
might be affected by the Government action addressed by the consultant. In that regard, consultants may be enough like the agency's own
personnel to justify calling their communications "intra-agency." The
Tribes, on the contrary, necessarily communicate with the Bureau with
their own, albeit entirely legitimate, interests in mind. While this fact
alone distinguishes tribal communications from the consultants' examples recognized by several Circuits, the distinction is even sharper, in
that the Tribes are self-advocates at the expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfy everyone. As to those documents bearing on
the Plan, the Tribes are obviously in competition with nontribal claimants, including those irrigators represented by the respondent. While
the documents at issue may not take the formally argumentative form
of a brief, their function is quite apparently to support the tribal claims.
The Court rejects the Department's assertion that the Klamath Tribe's
consultant-like character is clearer in the circumstances of the Oregon
adjudication, where the Department merely represents the interests of
the Tribe before a state court that will make any decision about the
respective rights of the contenders. Again, the dispositive point is that
the apparent object of the Tribe's communications is a decision by a
Government agency to support a claim by the Tribe that is necessarily
adverse to the interests of competitors because there is not enough
water to satisfy everyone. The position of the Tribe as Government
beneficiary is a far cry from the position of the paid consultant. The

Court also rejects the Department's argument that compelled release of
the documents at issue would impair the Department's performance of
its fiduciary obligation to protect the confidentiality of communications
with tribes. This boils down to requesting that the Court read an "Indian trust" exemption into the statute. There is simply no support for
that exemption in the statutory text, which must be read strictly to
serve FOIA's mandate of broad disclosure. Pp. 11-16.

I
Two separate proceedings give rise to this case, the first
a planning effort within the Department of the Interior's
Bureau of Reclamation, and the second a state water rights
adjudication in the Oregon courts. Within the Department
of the Interior, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) administers the Klamath Irrigation Project (Klamath Project
or Project), which uses water from the Klamath River Basin
to irrigate territory in Klamath County, Oregon, and two
northern California counties. In 1995, the Department
began work to develop a long-term operations plan for the
Project, to be known as the Klamath Project Operation Plan
(Plan), which would provide for allocation of water among
competing uses and competing water users. The Department asked the Klamath as well as the Hoopa Valley, Karuk,
and Yurok Tribes (Basin Tribes) to consult with Reclamation
on the matter, and a memorandum of understanding between
the Department and the Tribes recognized that "[t]he United
States Government has a unique legal relationship with Native American tribal governments," and called for "[a]ssessment, in consultation with the Tribes, of the impacts of the
[Plan] on Tribal trust resources." App. 59, 61.

During roughly the same period, the Department's Bureau
of Indian Affairs (Bureau) filed claims on behalf of the
Klamath Tribe alone in an Oregon state-court adjudication
intended to allocate water rights. Since the Bureau is responsible for administering land and water held in trust for
Indian tribes, 25 U. S. C. $ 1a; 25 CFR subch. H, pts. 150-181
(2000), it consulted with the Klamath Tribe, and the two exchanged written memorandums on the appropriate scope of
the claims ultimately submitted by the United States for the
benefit of the Klamath Tribe. The Bureau does not, how532US1 Unit: $U29 [09-05-02 18:19:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ever, act as counsel for the Tribe, which has its own lawyers
and has independently submitted claims on its own behalf.1

Respondent, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association (Association), is a nonprofit association of water users in
the Klamath River Basin, most of whom receive water from
the Klamath Project, and whose interests are adverse to the
tribal interests owing to scarcity of water. The Association
filed a series of requests with the Bureau under the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. $ 552, seeking access to
communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes
during the relevant time period. The Bureau turned over
several documents but withheld others as exempt under the
attorney work-product and deliberative process privileges.
These privileges are said to be incorporated in FOIA Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure "inter-agency or
intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be
available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation
with the agency." $ 552(b)(5). The Association then sued
the Bureau under FOIA to compel release of the documents.

By the time of the District Court ruling, seven documents
remained in dispute, three of them addressing the Plan,
three concerned with the Oregon adjudication, and the seventh relevant to both proceedings. See 189 F. 3d 1034, 1036
(CA9 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-49a. Six of the documents were prepared by the Klamath Tribe or its representative and were submitted at the Government's behest to
the Bureau or to the Department's Regional Solicitor; a Bureau official prepared the seventh document and gave it to
lawyers for the Klamath and Yurok Tribes. See ibid.

That is, the Tribes have their own attorneys, but the United States acts
as trustee." Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. "The United States has also filed claims

Opinion of the Court
The District Court granted the Government's motion forsummary judgment. It held that each document qualified

as an inter-agency or intra-agency communication for pur-poses of Exemption 5, and that each was covered by the deliberative process privilege or the attorney work-productprivilege, as having played a role in the Bureau's deliberations about the Plan or the Oregon adjudication. See 189F. 3d, at 1036, App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-32a, 56a-65a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 189F. 3d 1034 (1999). It recognized that some Circuits had
adopted a "functional" approach to Exemption 5, underwhich a document generated outside the Government might
still qualify as an "intra-agency" communication. See id., at1037-1038. The court saw no reason to go into that, however, for it ruled out any application of Exemption 5 on theground that "the Tribes with whom the Department has a
consulting relationship have a direct interest in the subjectmatter of the consultations."

Id., at 1038. The court saidthat "[t]o hold otherwise would extend Exemption 5 to shield

what amount to ex parte communications in contested pro-ceedings between the Tribes and the Department."

Ibid.Judge Hawkins dissented, for he saw the documents as

springing "from a relationship that remains consultativerather than adversarial, a relationship in which the Bureau
and Department were seeking the expertise of the Tribes,rather than opposing them." Id., at 1045. He saw the
proper enquiry as going not to a document's source, but tothe role it plays in agency decisionmaking. See id., at 1039.
We granted certiorari in view of the decision's significantimpact on the relationship between Indian tribes and the
Government, 530 U. S. 1304 (2000), and now affirm.

limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that dis-closure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act,"

Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 361 (1976);"[c]onsistent with the Act's goal of broad disclosure, these
exemptions have been consistently given a narrow compass,"Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151
(1989); see also FBI v. Abramson, 456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982)("FOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed").

A
Exemption 5 protects from disclosure "inter-agency orintra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be

available by law to a party other than an agency in litigationwith the agency." 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(5). To qualify, a document must thus satisfy two conditions: its source must be aGovernment agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a
privilege against discovery under judicial standards thatwould govern litigation against the agency that holds it.

Our prior cases on Exemption 5 have addressed the secondcondition, incorporating civil discovery privileges. See,

e. g.,United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792, 799-800

(1984); NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U. S. 132, 148(1975) ("Exemption 5 withholds from a member of the public
documents which a private party could not discover in litiga-tion with the agency"). So far as they might matter here,
those privileges include the privilege for attorney work-product and what is sometimes called the "deliberative process" privilege. Work product protects "mental processes ofthe attorney,"

United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 238(1975), while deliberative process covers "documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberationscomprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated," Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421U. S., at 150 (internal quotation marks omitted). The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realizationthat officials will not communicate candidly among them532US1 Unit: $U29 [09-05-02 18:19:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
selves if each remark is a potential item of discovery andfront page news, and its object is to enhance "the quality of

agency decisions," id., at 151, by protecting open and frankdiscussion among those who make them within the Government, see EPA v. Mink, 410 U. S. 73, 86-87 (1973); see alsoWeber Aircraft Corp., supra, at 802.

The point is not to protect Government secrecy pure andsimple, however, and the first condition of Exemption 5 is no
less important than the second; the communication must be"inter-agency or intra-agency." 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(5). Statutory definitions underscore the apparent plainness of thistext. With exceptions not relevant here, "agency" means
"each authority of the Government of the United States,"$ 551(1), and "includes any executive department, military
department, Government corporation, Government con-trolled corporation, or other establishment in the executive
branch of the Government . . . , or any independent regula-tory agency," $ 552(f).

Although neither the terms of the exemption nor the stat-utory definitions say anything about communications with
outsiders, some Courts of Appeals have held that in somecircumstances a document prepared outside the Government
may nevertheless qualify as an "intra-agency" memorandumunder Exemption 5. See, e. g., Hoover v. Dept. of Interior,
611 F. 2d 1132, 1137-1138 (CA5 1980); Lead Industries Assn.v. OSHA, 610 F. 2d 70, 83 (CA2 1979); Soucie v. David, 448
F. 2d 1067 (CADC 1971). In Department of Justice v. Ju-lian, 486 U. S. 1 (1988),

Justice Scalia, joined by Justices
O'Connor and White, explained that "the most naturalmeaning of the phrase `intra-agency memorandum' is a memorandum that is addressed both to and from employees of asingle agency,"

id., at 18, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). But hisopinion also acknowledged the more expansive reading by

some Courts of Appeals:

"It is textually possible and . . . in accord with the pur-pose of the provision, to regard as an intra-agency mem532US1 Unit: $U29 [09-05-02 18:19:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

orandum one that has been received by an agency, toassist it in the performance of its own functions, from a

person acting in a governmentally conferred capacityother than on behalf of another agency--e. g., in a capacity as employee or consultant to the agency, or as em-ployee or officer of another governmental unit (not an
agency) that is authorized or required to provide adviceto the agency."

Ibid.2

Typically, courts taking the latter view have held that theexemption extends to communications between Government

agencies and outside consultants hired by them. See, e. g.,
Hoover, supra, at 1138 ("In determining value, the govern-ment may deem it necessary to seek the objective opinion of

outside experts rather than rely solely on the opinions ofgovernment appraisers"); Lead Industries Assn., supra, at
83 (applying Exemption 5 to cover draft reports "preparedby outside consultants who had testified on behalf of the
agency rather than agency staff "); see also GovernmentLand Bank v. GSA, 671 F. 2d 663, 665 (CA5 1982) ("Both
parties agree that a property appraisal, performed undercontract by an independent professional, is an `intra-agency'
document for purposes of the exemption"). In such cases,the records submitted by outside consultants played essentially the same part in an agency's process of deliberation asdocuments prepared by agency personnel might have done.
To be sure, the consultants in these cases were independentcontractors and were not assumed to be subject to the degree of control that agency employment could have entailed;nor do we read the cases as necessarily assuming that an
outside consultant must be devoid of a definite point of viewwhen the agency contracts for its services. But the fact

2 The majority in Julian did not address the question whether the documents at issue were "inter-agency or intra-agency" records within the
meaning of Exemption 5, because it concluded that the documents would
be routinely discoverable in civil litigation and therefore would not be
covered by Exemption 5 in any event. 486 U. S., at 11-14.

about the consultant that is constant in the typical cases isthat the consultant does not represent an interest of its own,

or the interest of any other client, when it advises the agencythat hires it. Its only obligations are to truth and its sense
of what good judgment calls for, and in those respects theconsultant functions just as an employee would be expected
to do. B

The Department purports to rely on this consultant corol-lary to Exemption 5 in arguing for its application to the
Tribe's communications to the Bureau in its capacity of fidu-ciary for the benefit of the Indian Tribes. The existence of
a trust obligation is not, of course, in question, see United
States v. Cherokee Nation of Okla., 480 U. S. 700, 707 (1987);United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 225 (1983); Seminole

Nation v. United States, 316 U. S. 286, 296-297 (1942). Thefiduciary relationship has been described as "one of the primary cornerstones of Indian law," F. Cohen, Handbook ofFederal Indian Law 221 (1982), and has been compared to
one existing under a common law trust, with the UnitedStates as trustee, the Indian tribes or individuals as beneficiaries, and the property and natural resources managed bythe United States as the trust corpus. See, e. g., Mitchell,
supra, at 225. Nor is there any doubt about the plausibilityof the Government's assertion that the candor of tribal communications with the Bureau would be eroded without theprotections of the deliberative process privilege recognized
under Exemption 5. The Department is surely right in say-ing that confidentiality in communications with tribes is conducive to a proper discharge of its trust obligation.From the recognition of this interest in frank communication, which the deliberative process privilege might protect,the Department would have us infer a sufficient justification
for applying Exemption 5 to communications with theTribes, in the same fashion that Courts of Appeals have
found sufficient reason to favor a consultant's advice that

Opinion of the Court

way. But the Department's argument skips a necessarystep, for it ignores the first condition of Exemption 5, that

the communication be "intra-agency or inter-agency." TheDepartment seems to be saying that "intra-agency" is a
purely conclusory term, just a label to be placed on any doc-ument the Government would find it valuable to keep
confidential.There is, however, no textual justification for draining the
first condition of independent vitality, and once the intra-agency condition is applied,

3 it rules out any application of

Exemption 5 to tribal communications on analogy to consult-ants' reports (assuming, which we do not decide, that these

reports may qualify as intra-agency under Exemption 5).As mentioned already, consultants whose communications
have typically been held exempt have not been communi-cating with the Government in their own interest or on
behalf of any person or group whose interests might be af-fected by the Government action addressed by the consultant. In that regard, consultants may be enough like the agen-cy's own personnel to justify calling their communications
"intra-agency." The Tribes, on the contrary, necessarilycommunicate with the Bureau with their own, albeit entirely
legitimate, interests in mind. While this fact alone distin-guishes tribal communications from the consultants' examples recognized by several Courts of Appeals, the distinctionis even sharper, in that the Tribes are self-advocates at the
expense of others seeking benefits inadequate to satisfyeveryone.

3 Because we conclude that the documents do not meet this threshold
condition, we need not reach step two of the Exemption 5 analysis and
enquire whether the communications would normally be discoverable in
civil litigation. See United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792,
799 (1984).

4 Courts of Appeals have recognized at least two instances of intraagency consultants that arguably extend beyond what we have characterized as the typical examples. In Public Citizen, Inc. v. Department of
Justice, 111 F. 3d 168 (CADC 1997), former Presidents were so treated in

532US1 Unit: $U29 [09-05-02 18:19:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN

13Cite as: 532 U. S. 1 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
As to those documents bearing on the Plan, the Tribes areobviously in competition with nontribal claimants, including

those irrigators represented by the respondent. App. 66-71. The record shows that documents submitted by the
Tribes included, among others, "a position paper that dis-cusses water law legal theories" and "addresses issues related to water rights of the tribes," App. to Pet. for Cert.42a-43a, a memorandum "contain[ing] views on policy the
BIA could provide to other governmental agencies," "viewsconcerning trust resources,"

id., at 44a, and a letter "convey-ing the views of the Klamath Tribes concerning issues involved in the water rights adjudication," id., at 47a. Whilethese documents may not take the formally argumentative
form of a brief, their function is quite apparently to supportthe tribal claims. The Tribes are thus urging a position necessarily adverse to the other claimants, the water being inad-equate to satisfy the combined demand. As the Court of
Appeals said, "[t]he Tribes' demands, if satisfied, would leadto reduced water allocations to members of the Association
and have been protested by Association members who fearwater shortages and economic injury in dry years." 189
F. 3d, at 1035.The Department insists that the Klamath Tribe's
consultant-like character is clearer in the circumstances ofthe Oregon adjudication, since the Department merely represents the interests of the Tribe before a state court that will
their communications with the National Archives and Records Administration, even though the Presidents had their own, independent interests,
id., at 171. And in Ryan v. Department of Justice, 617 F. 2d 781 (CADC
1980), Senators' responses to the Attorney General's questionnaires about
the judicial nomination process were held exempt, even though we would
expect a Senator to have strong personal views on the matter. We need
not decide whether either instance should be recognized as intra-agency,
even if communications with paid consultants are ultimately so treated.
As explained above, the intra-agency condition excludes, at the least, communications to or from an interested party seeking a Government benefit
at the expense of other applicants.

4-6. But it is not that simple. Even if there were no rivalinterests at stake in the Oregon litigation, the Klamath Tribe
would be pressing its own view of its own interest in itscommunications with the Bureau. Nor could that interest
be ignored as being merged somehow in the fiduciary interest of the Government trustee; the Bureau in its fiduciarycapacity would be obliged to adopt the stance it believed to

be in the beneficiary's best interest, not necessarily the posi-tion espoused by the beneficiary itself. Cf. Restatement
(Second) of Trusts $ 176, Comment a (1957) ("[I]t is the duty
of the trustee to exercise such care and skill to preserve the
trust property as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise
in dealing with his own property . . .").

But, again, the dispositive point is that the apparent object
of the Tribe's communications is a decision by an agency of
the Government to support a claim by the Tribe that is necessarily adverse to the interests of competitors. Since there
is not enough water to satisfy everyone, the Government's
position on behalf of the Tribe is potentially adverse to other
users, and it might ask for more or less on behalf of the Tribe
depending on how it evaluated the tribal claim compared
with the claims of its rivals. The ultimately adversarial
character of tribal submissions to the Bureau therefore
seems the only fair inference, as confirmed by the Department's acknowledgment that its "obligation to represent the
Klamath Tribe necessarily coexists with the duty to protect
other federal interests, including in particular its interests
with respect to the Klamath Project." Reply Brief for Petitioners 8; cf. Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 142
(1983) ("[W]here Congress has imposed upon the United
States, in addition to its duty to represent Indian tribes, a
duty to obtain water rights for reclamation projects, and has
even authorized the inclusion of reservation lands within a
project, the analogy of a faithless private fiduciary cannot be

controlling for purposes of evaluating the authority of theUnited States to represent different interests"). The position of the Tribe as beneficiary is thus a far cry from theposition of the paid consultant.

Quite apart from its attempt to draw a direct analogy be-tween tribes and conventional consultants, the Department
argues that compelled release of the documents would itselfimpair the Department's performance of a specific fiduciary
obligation to protect the confidentiality of communicationswith tribes.

5 Because, the Department argues, traditional

fiduciary standards forbid a trustee to disclose informationacquired as a trustee when it should know that disclosure

would be against the beneficiary's interests, excluding theTribes' submissions to the Department from Exemption 5
would handicap the Department in doing what the lawrequires. Brief for Petitioners 36-37.

6 And in much the

same vein, the Department presses the argument that"FOIA is intended to cast light on existing government practices; it should not be interpreted and applied so as to compelfederal agencies to perform their assigned substantive functions in other than the normal manner." Id., at 29.All of this boils down to requesting that we read an "Indian trust" exemption into the statute, a reading that is out

5 The Department points out that the Plan-related documents submitted
by the Tribes were furnished to the Bureau rather than to Reclamation, a
fact which the Department claims reinforces the conclusion that the documents were provided to the Department in its capacity as trustee. Brief
for Petitioners 47. This fact does not alter our analysis, however, because
we think that even communications made in support of the trust relationship fail to fit comfortably within the statutory text.

6 We note that the Department cites the Restatement for the proposition

that a " `trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary not to disclose to a third
person information which he has acquired as trustee where he should
know that the effect of such disclosure would be detrimental to the interest of the beneficiary.' " Brief for Petitioners 36 (quoting Restatement
(Second) of Trusts $ 170, Comment s (1957)). It is unnecessary for us to
decide if the Department's duties with respect to its communications with
Indian tribes fit this pattern.

of the question for reasons already explored. There is sim-ply no support for the exemption in the statutory text, which

we have elsewhere insisted be read strictly in order to serveFOIA's mandate of broad disclosure,

7 which was obviously

expected and intended to affect Government operations. InFOIA, after all, a new conception of Government conduct

was enacted into law, " `a general philosophy of full agencydisclosure.' "

Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492U. S., at 142 (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.,

3 (1965)). "Congress believed that this philosophy, put intopractice, would help `ensure an informed citizenry, vital to
the functioning of a democratic society.' " 492 U. S., at 142(quoting NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U. S. 214,
242 (1978)). Congress had to realize that not every secretunder the old law would be secret under the new.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

envisioned that Exemption 5 would cover communications pursuant to the
Indian trust responsibility, or any other trust responsibility. Although as
a general rule we are hesitant to construe statutes in light of legislative
inaction, see Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574, 600 (1983),
we note that Congress has twice considered specific proposals to protect
Indian trust information, see Indian Amendment to Freedom of Information Act: Hearings on S. 2652 before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs
of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 94th Cong., 2d
Sess. (1976); Indian Trust Information Protection Act of 1978, S. 2773, 95th
Cong., 2d Sess. (1978). We do so because these proposals confirm the
commonsense reading that we give Exemption 5 today, as well as to emphasize that nobody in the Federal Government should be surprised by
this reading.

OHIO v. REINER
on petition for writ of certiorari to thesupreme court of ohio

No. 00-1028. Decided March 19, 2001
Respondent was tried for involuntary manslaughter in the death of his

infant son Alex, who died from "shaken baby syndrome." His defense
theory was that Alex was injured while in the care of the family's babysitter, Susan Batt. Batt informed the Ohio trial court before testifying that she intended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege, and
the court granted her transactional immunity. She then testified to the
jury that she had refused to testify without a grant of immunity on
the advice of counsel, although she had done nothing wrong. The jury
convicted respondent, and he appealed. The appeals court reversed,
and the State Supreme Court affirmed the reversal on the ground that
Batt had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege because she asserted innocence and that the trial court's grant of immunity was therefore unlawful. The court found that the wrongful grant of immunity prejudiced
respondent, because it effectively told the jury that Batt did not cause
Alex's injuries.

Held: Batt had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. This Court has jurisdiction over the Ohio Supreme
Court's judgment, which rests, as a threshold matter, on a determination
of federal law. See Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson,
478 U. S. 804, 816. The Fifth Amendment privilege's protection extends only to witnesses who have a reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486.
That inquiry is for the court; the witness' assertion does not by itself
establish the risk of incrimination. This Court has never held, however, that the privilege is unavailable to those who claim innocence. To
the contrary, the Court has emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions is to protect innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances. Grunewald v. United
States, 353 U. S. 391, 421. Batt had "reasonable cause" to apprehend
danger from her answers if questioned at respondent's trial. Thus, it
was reasonable for her to fear that answers to possible questions might
tend to incriminate her.

Certiorari granted; 89 Ohio St. 3d 342, 731 N. E. 2d 662, reversed and

remanded.

18 OHIO v. REINER

Per Curiam
Per Curiam.
The Supreme Court of Ohio here held that a witness whodenies all culpability does not have a valid Fifth Amendment

privilege against self-incrimination. Because our prece-dents dictate that the privilege protects the innocent as well
as the guilty, and that the facts here are sufficient to sustaina claim of privilege, we grant the petition for certiorari and
reverse.Respondent was charged with involuntary manslaughter
in connection with the death of his 2-month-old son Alex.The coroner testified at trial that Alex died from "shaken
baby syndrome," the result of child abuse. He estimatedthat Alex's injury most likely occurred minutes before the
child stopped breathing. Alex died two days later when hewas removed from life support. Evidence produced at trial
revealed that Alex had a broken rib and a broken leg at thetime of his death. His twin brother Derek, who was also
examined, had several broken ribs. Respondent had beenalone with Alex for half an hour immediately before Alex
stopped breathing. Respondent's experts testified thatAlex could have been injured several hours before his respiratory arrest. Alex was in the care of the family's babysitter, Susan Batt, at that time. Batt had cared for thechildren during the day for about two weeks prior to Alex's

death. The defense theory was that Batt, not respondent,was the culpable party.

Batt informed the court in advance of testifying that sheintended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. At the
State's request, the trial court granted her transactional im-munity from prosecution pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 2945.44 (1999). She then testified to the jury that she hadrefused to testify without a grant of immunity on the advice
of counsel, although she had done nothing wrong. Batt de-nied any involvement in Alex's death. She testified that she
had never shaken Alex or his brother at any time, specifically
on the day Alex suffered respiratory arrest. She said she

was unaware of and had nothing to do with the other injuries
to both children. The jury found respondent guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and he appealed.

The Court of Appeals of Ohio, Sixth District, reversed respondent's conviction on grounds not relevant to our decision
here. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the reversal, on
the alternative ground that Batt had no valid Fifth Amendment privilege and that the trial court's grant of immunity
under $ 2945.44 was therefore unlawful.* 89 Ohio St. 3d 342,
358, 731 N. E. 2d 662, 677 (2000). The court found that the
wrongful grant of immunity prejudiced respondent, because
it effectively told the jury that Batt did not cause Alex's
injuries.

The court recognized that the privilege against selfincrimination applies where a witness' answers "could reasonably `furnish a link in the chain of evidence' " against him,
id., at 352, 731 N. E. 2d, at 673 (quoting Hoffman v. United
States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951)). Hoffman, it noted, requires the trial court to determine whether the witness has
correctly asserted the privilege, and to order the witness to
answer questions if the witness is mistaken about the danger
of incrimination. Ibid. The court faulted the trial judge
for failing to question sufficiently Batt's assertion of the privilege. It noted that the Court of Appeals, in finding a valid
privilege, failed to consider the prosecutor's suggestion that
Batt's testimony would not incriminate her, and Batt's denial
of involvement in Alex's abuse when questioned by the Children's Services Board. The court held that "Susan Batt's

*Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2945.44 (1999) states in pertinent part: "In any
criminal proceeding . . . if a witness refuses to answer or produce information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, the court of
common pleas . . . unless it finds that to do so would not further the administration of justice, shall compel the witness to answer or produce the
information, if . . . [the prosecuting attorney so requests and] . . . [t]he
court . . . informs the witness that by answering, or producing the information he will receive [transactional] immunity . . . ." (Emphasis added.)

[trial] testimony did not incriminate her, because she denied
any involvement in the abuse. Thus, she did not have a
valid Fifth Amendment privilege." 89 Ohio St. 3d, at 355,731 N. E. 2d, at 675 (emphasis in original). The court emphasized that the defense's theory of Batt's guilt was notgrounds for a grant of immunity, "when the witness continues to deny any self-incriminating conduct." Ibid.

The Supreme Court of Ohio's decision that Batt waswrongly granted immunity under $ 2945.44 (and consequently, that reversal of respondent's conviction was re-quired) rested on the court's determination that Batt did not
have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. In discussing the
contours of that privilege, the court relied on our precedents.
We have observed that "this Court retains a role when a
state court's interpretation of state law has been influenced
by an accompanying interpretation of federal law." Three
Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984). The decision at
issue "fairly appears . . . to be interwoven with the federal
law," and no adequate and independent state ground is clear
from the face of the opinion. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.
1032, 1040-1041 (1983). We have jurisdiction over a statecourt judgment that rests, as a threshold matter, on a determination of federal law. See Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals
Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 816 (1986) ("[T]his Court
retains power to review the decision of a federal issue in a
state cause of action"); St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor,
210 U. S. 281, 293-294 (1908).

The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person . . . shall
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. As the Supreme Court of
Ohio acknowledged, this privilege not only extends "to answers that would in themselves support a conviction . . . but
likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the
chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant." Hoffman, 341 U. S., at 486. "[I]t need only be evident from the

implications of the question, in the setting in which it isasked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous be-cause injurious disclosure could result."

Id., at 486-487.
We have held that the privilege's protection extends onlyto witnesses who have "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer." Id., at 486. That inquiry is for
the court; the witness' assertion does not by itself establishthe risk of incrimination.

Ibid. A danger of "imaginary
and unsubstantial character" will not suffice. Mason v.
United States, 244 U. S. 362, 366 (1917). But we have never
held, as the Supreme Court of Ohio did, that the privilege is
unavailable to those who claim innocence. To the contrary,
we have emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment's
"basic functions . . . is to protect innocent men . . . `who
otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.' "
Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S. 391, 421 (1957) (quoting Slochower v. Board of Higher Ed. of New York City, 350
U. S. 551, 557-558 (1956)) (emphasis in original). In Grunewald, we recognized that truthful responses of an innocent
witness, as well as those of a wrongdoer, may provide the
government with incriminating evidence from the speaker's
own mouth. 353 U. S., at 421-422.

The Supreme Court of Ohio's determination that Batt
did not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege because
she denied any involvement in the abuse of the children
clearly conflicts with Hoffman and Grunewald. Batt had
"reasonable cause" to apprehend danger from her answers
if questioned at respondent's trial. Hoffman, supra, at
486. Batt spent extended periods of time alone with Alex
and his brother in the weeks immediately preceding discovery of their injuries. She was with Alex within the potential timeframe of the fatal trauma. The defense's theory of
the case was that Batt, not respondent, was responsible for
Alex's death and his brother's uncharged injuries. In this
setting, it was reasonable for Batt to fear that answers to

Per Curiam
possible questions might tend to incriminate her. Batttherefore had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against

self-incrimination.We do not, of course, address the question whether immunity from suit under $ 2945.44 was appropriate. Because theSupreme Court of Ohio mistakenly held that the witness'
assertion of innocence deprived her of her Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination, the petition for a writ of
certiorari is granted, the court's judgment is reversed, andthis case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC. v. MARKETINGDISPLAYS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 99-1571. Argued November 29, 2000--Decided March 20, 2001
Respondent, Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), holds now-expired utility

patents for a "dual-spring design" mechanism that keeps temporary
road and other outdoor signs upright in adverse wind conditions. MDI
claims that its sign stands were recognizable to buyers and users because the patented design was visible near the sign stand's base. After
the patents expired and petitioner TrafFix Devices, Inc., began marketing sign stands with a dual-spring mechanism copied from MDI's design,
MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1946 for, inter alia, trade
dress infringement. The District Court granted TrafFix's motion for
summary judgment, holding that no reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI had established secondary meaning in its alleged trade
dress, i. e., consumers did not associate the dual-spring design's look
with MDI; and, as an independent reason, that there could be no trade
dress protection for the design because it was functional. The Sixth
Circuit reversed. Among other things, it suggested that the District
Court committed legal error by looking only to the dual-spring design
when evaluating MDI's trade dress because a competitor had to find
some way to hide the design or otherwise set it apart from MDI's; explained, relying on Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U. S. 159,
165, that exclusive use of a feature must put competitors at a significant
non-reputation-related disadvantage before trade dress protection is denied on functionality grounds; and noted a split among the Circuits on
the issue whether an expired utility patent forecloses the possibility of
trade dress protection in the product's design.

Held: Because MDI's dual-spring design is a functional feature for which

there is no trade dress protection, MDI's claim is barred. Pp. 28-35.

(a) Trade dress can be protected under federal law, but the person
asserting such protection in an infringement action must prove that the
matter sought to be protected is not functional, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(3).
Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many
instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.
An expired utility patent has vital significance in resolving a trade dress
claim, for a utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein
claimed are functional. The central advance claimed in the expired util532US1 Unit: $U31 [09-06-02 12:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
24 TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC. v. MARKETING DISPLAYS, INC.

Syllabus
ity patents here is the dual-spring design, which is an essential feature
of the trade dress MDI now seeks to protect. However, MDI did not,
and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design
in the claims of the expired patents. The springs are necessary to the
device's operation, and they would have been covered by the claims of
the expired patents even though they look different from the embodiment revealed in those patents, see Sarkisian v. Winn-Proof Corp., 697
F. 2d 1313. The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature
in a utility patent's claims constitutes strong evidence of functionality is
well illustrated in this case. The design serves the important purpose
of keeping the sign upright in heavy wind conditions, and statements
in the expired patent applications indicate that it does so in a unique
and useful manner and at a cost advantage over alternative designs.
Pp. 28-32.

(b) In reversing the summary judgment against MDI, the Sixth Circuit gave insufficient weight to the importance of the expired utility
patents, and their evidentiary significance, in establishing the device's
functionality. The error was likely caused by its misinterpretation of
trade dress principles in other respects. " `In general terms a product
feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a trademark, `if it is essential
to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of
the article.' " Qualitex, supra, at 165 (quoting Inwood Laboratories,
Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 850, n. 10). This Court
has expanded on that meaning, observing that a functional feature is
one "the exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant
non-reputation-related disadvantage," Qualitex, supra, at 165, but that
language does not mean that competitive necessity is a necessary test
for functionality. Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider competitive
necessity. This Court has allowed trade dress protection to inherently
distinctive product features on the assumption that they were not functional. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 774. Here,
however, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the
sign stands are made by MDI, the design provides a unique and useful
mechanism to resist the wind's force. Functionality having been established, whether the design has acquired secondary meaning need not be
considered. Nor is it necessary to speculate about other design possibilities. Finally, this Court need not resolve here the question whether
the Patent Clause of the Constitution, of its own force, prohibits the
holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. Pp. 32-35.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Temporary road signs with warnings like "Road Work
Ahead" or "Left Shoulder Closed" must withstand strong
gusts of wind. An inventor named Robert Sarkisian obtained two utility patents for a mechanism built upon two
springs (the dual-spring design) to keep these and other outdoor signs upright despite adverse wind conditions. The
holder of the now-expired Sarkisian patents, respondent
Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), established a successful
business in the manufacture and sale of sign stands incorporating the patented feature. MDI's stands for road signs
were recognizable to buyers and users (it says) because the
dual-spring design was visible near the base of the sign.

26 TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC. v. MARKETING DISPLAYS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
This litigation followed after the patents expired and acompetitor, TrafFix Devices, Inc., sold sign stands with a

visible spring mechanism that looked like MDI's. MDI andTrafFix products looked alike because they were. When
TrafFix started in business, it sent an MDI product abroadto have it reverse engineered, that is to say copied. Complicating matters, TrafFix marketed its sign stands under aname similar to MDI's. MDI used the name "WindMaster,"
while TrafFix, its new competitor, used "WindBuster."MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1051 et seq.,against TrafFix for trademark infringement (based on the
similar names), trade dress infringement (based on the cop-ied dual-spring design), and unfair competition. TrafFix
counterclaimed on antitrust theories. After the UnitedStates District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
considered cross-motions for summary judgment, MDI pre-vailed on its trademark claim for the confusing similarity of
names and was held not liable on the antitrust counterclaim;and those two rulings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are
not before us. I

We are concerned with the trade dress question. TheDistrict Court ruled against MDI on its trade dress claim.
971 F. Supp. 262 (ED Mich. 1997). After determining thatthe one element of MDI's trade dress at issue was the dualspring design, id., at 265, it held that "no reasonable trierof fact could determine that MDI has established secondary
meaning" in its alleged trade dress, id., at 269. In otherwords, consumers did not associate the look of the dualspring design with MDI. As a second, independent reasonto grant summary judgment in favor of TrafFix, the District
Court determined the dual-spring design was functional.On this rationale secondary meaning is irrelevant because
there can be no trade dress protection in any event. In rul-ing on the functional aspect of the design, the District Court

27Cite as: 532 U. S. 23 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
noted that Sixth Circuit precedent indicated that the burdenwas on MDI to prove that its trade dress was nonfunctional,

and not on TrafFix to show that it was functional (a rulesince adopted by Congress, see 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(3) (1994
ed., Supp. V)), and then went on to consider MDI's argu-ments that the dual-spring design was subject to trade dress
protection. Finding none of MDI's contentions persuasive,
the District Court concluded MDI had not "proffered suf-ficient evidence which would enable a reasonable trier of

fact to find that MDI's vertical dual-spring design is non-functional." 971 F. Supp., at 276. Summary judgment was
entered against MDI on its trade dress claims.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the
trade dress ruling. 200 F. 3d 929 (1999). The Court of Appeals held the District Court had erred in ruling MDI failed
to show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether
it had secondary meaning in its alleged trade dress, id., at
938, and had erred further in determining that MDI could
not prevail in any event because the alleged trade dress was
in fact a functional product configuration, id., at 940. The
Court of Appeals suggested the District Court committed
legal error by looking only to the dual-spring design when
evaluating MDI's trade dress. Basic to its reasoning was
the Court of Appeals' observation that it took "little imagination to conceive of a hidden dual-spring mechanism or
a tri or quad-spring mechanism that might avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress." Ibid. The Court of Appeals explained that "[i]f TrafFix or another competitor chooses to
use [MDI's] dual-spring design, then it will have to find some
other way to set its sign apart to avoid infringing [MDI's]
trade dress." Ibid. It was not sufficient, according to the
Court of Appeals, that allowing exclusive use of a particular
feature such as the dual-spring design in the guise of trade
dress would "hinde[r] competition somewhat." Rather,
"[e]xclusive use of a feature must `put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage' before trade

Opinion of the Court
dress protection is denied on functionality grounds." Ibid.(quoting Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U. S. 159,

165 (1995)). In its criticism of the District Court's ruling onthe trade dress question, the Court of Appeals took note of
a split among Courts of Appeals in various other Circuits onthe issue whether the existence of an expired utility patent
forecloses the possibility of the patentee's claiming tradedress protection in the product's design. 200 F. 3d, at 939.
Compare Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. West Bend Co., 123 F. 3d246 (CA5 1997) (holding that trade dress protection is not
foreclosed), Thomas & Betts Corp. v. Panduit Corp., 138F. 3d 277 (CA7 1998) (same), and

Midwest Industries, Inc. v.Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F. 3d 1356 (CA Fed 1999) (same),

with Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. v. DuracraftCorp., 58 F. 3d 1498, 1500 (CA10 1995) ("Where a product
configuration is a significant inventive component of an in-vention covered by a utility patent . . . it cannot receive trade
dress protection"). To resolve the conflict, we granted cer-tiorari. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000).

It is well established that trade dress can be protectedunder federal law. The design or packaging of a product

may acquire a distinctiveness which serves to identify theproduct with its manufacturer or source; and a design or
package which acquires this secondary meaning, assumingother requisites are met, is a trade dress which may not be
used in a manner likely to cause confusion as to the origin,sponsorship, or approval of the goods. In these respects
protection for trade dress exists to promote competition.As we explained just last Term, see

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U. S. 205 (2000), various Courts

of Appeals have allowed claims of trade dress infringementrelying on the general provision of the Lanham Act which
provides a cause of action to one who is injured when a per-son uses "any word, term name, symbol, or device, or any

532US1 Unit: $U31 [09-06-02 12:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
combination thereof . . . which is likely to cause confusion . . .as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her

goods." 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(1)(A). Congress confirmedthis statutory protection for trade dress by amending the
Lanham Act to recognize the concept. Title 15 U. S. C.$ 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "In a civil action for
trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress
not registered on the principal register, the person who as-serts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that

the matter sought to be protected is not functional." Thisburden of proof gives force to the well-established rule that
trade dress protection may not be claimed for product features that are functional. Qualitex, supra, at 164-165; Two
Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 775 (1992).
And in Wal-Mart, supra, we were careful to caution against
misuse or overextension of trade dress. We noted that
"product design almost invariably serves purposes other
than source identification." Id., at 213.

Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition
that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products. In general, unless an intellectual
property right such as a patent or copyright protects an
item, it will be subject to copying. As the Court has explained, copying is not always discouraged or disfavored by
the laws which preserve our competitive economy. Bonito
Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 160
(1989). Allowing competitors to copy will have salutary effects in many instances. "Reverse engineering of chemical
and mechanical articles in the public domain often leads to
significant advances in technology." Ibid.

The principal question in this case is the effect of an expired patent on a claim of trade dress infringement. A prior
patent, we conclude, has vital significance in resolving the
trade dress claim. A utility patent is strong evidence that
the features therein claimed are functional. If trade dress
protection is sought for those features the strong evidence

532US1 Unit: $U31 [09-06-02 12:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
30 TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC. v. MARKETING DISPLAYS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
of functionality based on the previous patent adds greatweight to the statutory presumption that features are

deemed functional until proved otherwise by the party seek-ing trade dress protection. Where the expired patent
claimed the features in question, one who seeks to establishtrade dress protection must carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not functional, for instance by showing
that it is merely an ornamental, incidental, or arbitrary as-pect of the device.

In the case before us, the central advance claimed in theexpired utility patents (the Sarkisian patents) is the dualspring design; and the dual-spring design is the essential feature of the trade dress MDI now seeks to establish and to
protect. The rule we have explained bars the trade dress
claim, for MDI did not, and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality
based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the
claims of the expired patents.

The dual springs shown in the Sarkisian patents were well
apart (at either end of a frame for holding a rectangular sign
when one full side is the base) while the dual springs at issue
here are close together (in a frame designed to hold a sign
by one of its corners). As the District Court recognized,
this makes little difference. The point is that the springs
are necessary to the operation of the device. The fact that
the springs in this very different-looking device fall within
the claims of the patents is illustrated by MDI's own position
in earlier litigation. In the late 1970's, MDI engaged in a
long-running intellectual property battle with a company
known as Winn-Proof. Although the precise claims of the
Sarkisian patents cover sign stands with springs "spaced
apart," U. S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 4; U. S. Patent
No. 3,662,482, col. 4, the Winn-Proof sign stands (with
springs much like the sign stands at issue here) were found
to infringe the patents by the United States District Court
for the District of Oregon, and the Court of Appeals for the

Opinion of the Court
Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment. Sarkisian v. WinnProof Corp., 697 F. 2d 1313 (1983). Although the WinnProof traffic sign stand (with dual springs close together) didnot appear, then, to infringe the literal terms of the patent

claims (which called for "spaced apart" springs), the Winn-Proof sign stand was found to infringe the patents under
the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a finding of patent
infringement even when the accused product does not fallwithin the literal terms of the claims.

Id., at 1321-1322; see
generally Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical
Co., 520 U. S. 17 (1997). In light of this past ruling--a ruling
procured at MDI's own insistence--it must be concluded the
products here at issue would have been covered by the
claims of the expired patents.

The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature
in the claims of a utility patent constitutes strong evidence of
functionality is well illustrated in this case. The dual-spring
design serves the important purpose of keeping the sign upright even in heavy wind conditions; and, as confirmed by
the statements in the expired patents, it does so in a unique
and useful manner. As the specification of one of the patents recites, prior art "devices, in practice, will topple under
the force of a strong wind." U. S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col.
1. The dual-spring design allows sign stands to resist toppling in strong winds. Using a dual-spring design rather
than a single spring achieves important operational advantages. For example, the specifications of the patents note
that the "use of a pair of springs . . . as opposed to the use
of a single spring to support the frame structure prevents
canting or twisting of the sign around a vertical axis," and
that, if not prevented, twisting "may cause damage to the
spring structure and may result in tipping of the device."
U. S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 3. In the course of patent
prosecution, it was said that "[t]he use of a pair of spring
connections as opposed to a single spring connection . . .
forms an important part of this combination" because it

Opinion of the Court
"forc[es] the sign frame to tip along the longitudinal axis ofthe elongated ground-engaging members." App. 218. The

dual-spring design affects the cost of the device as well; itwas acknowledged that the device "could use three springs
but this would unnecessarily increase the cost of the device."Id., at 217. These statements made in the patent applications and in the course of procuring the patents demonstratethe functionality of the design. MDI does not assert that
any of these representations are mistaken or inaccurate, andthis is further strong evidence of the functionality of the
dual-spring design. III

In finding for MDI on the trade dress issue the Court ofAppeals gave insufficient recognition to the importance of
the expired utility patents, and their evidentiary significance,in establishing the functionality of the device. The error
likely was caused by its misinterpretation of trade dressprinciples in other respects. As we have noted, even if
there has been no previous utility patent the party assertingtrade dress has the burden to establish the nonfunctionality
of alleged trade dress features. MDI could not meet thisburden. Discussing trademarks, we have said " `[i]n general
terms, a product feature is functional,' and cannot serve asa trademark, `if it is essential to the use or purpose of the
article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.' "Qualitex, 514 U. S., at 165 (quoting Inwood Laboratories,
Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 850, n. 10(1982)). Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we
have observed that a functional feature is one the "exclusiveuse of [which] would put competitors at a significant nonreputation-related disadvantage." 514 U. S., at 165. TheCourt of Appeals in the instant case seemed to interpret this
language to mean that a necessary test for functionality is"whether the particular product configuration is a competitive necessity." 200 F. 3d, at 940. See also Vornado, 58F. 3d, at 1507 ("Functionality, by contrast, has been defined

532US1 Unit: $U31 [09-06-02 12:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

33Cite as: 532 U. S. 23 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
both by our circuit, and more recently by the Supreme Court,in terms of competitive need"). This was incorrect as a comprehensive definition. As explained in Qualitex, supra, and
Inwood, supra, a feature is also functional when it is essential to the use or purpose of the device or when it affects thecost or quality of the device. The

Qualitex decision did not
purport to displace this traditional rule. Instead, it quoted
the rule as Inwood had set it forth. It is proper to inquireinto a "significant non-reputation-related disadvantage" in

cases of esthetic functionality, the question involved in Qualitex. Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if
there is a competitive necessity for the feature. In Qualitex, by contrast, esthetic functionality was the central question, there having been no indication that the green-gold
color of the laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or
purpose of the product or its cost or quality.

The Court has allowed trade dress protection to certain
product features that are inherently distinctive. Two Pesos,
505 U. S., at 774. In Two Pesos, however, the Court at the
outset made the explicit analytic assumption that the trade
dress features in question (decorations and other features to
evoke a Mexican theme in a restaurant) were not functional.
Id., at 767, n. 6. The trade dress in those cases did not bar
competitors from copying functional product design features.
In the instant case, beyond serving the purpose of informing
consumers that the sign stands are made by MDI (assuming
it does so), the dual-spring design provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the wind. Functionality
having been established, whether MDI's dual-spring design
has acquired secondary meaning need not be considered.

There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did the Court
of Appeals, in speculation about other design possibilities,
such as using three or four springs which might serve the
same purpose. 200 F. 3d, at 940. Here, the functionality of
the spring design means that competitors need not explore

532US1 Unit: $U31 [09-06-02 12:28:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
34 TRAFFIX DEVICES, INC. v. MARKETING DISPLAYS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
whether other spring juxtapositions might be used. Thedual-spring design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of MDI's product; it is the reason the device works.Other designs need not be attempted.

Because the dual-spring design is functional, it is unneces-sary for competitors to explore designs to hide the springs,
say, by using a box or framework to cover them, as suggested
by the Court of Appeals. Ibid. The dual-spring design as-sures the user the device will work. If buyers are assured

the product serves its purpose by seeing the operative mech-anism that in itself serves an important market need. It
would be at cross-purposes to those objectives, and something of a paradox, were we to require the manufacturer to
conceal the very item the user seeks.

In a case where a manufacturer seeks to protect arbitrary,
incidental, or ornamental aspects of features of a product
found in the patent claims, such as arbitrary curves in the
legs or an ornamental pattern painted on the springs, a different result might obtain. There the manufacturer could
perhaps prove that those aspects do not serve a purpose
within the terms of the utility patent. The inquiry into
whether such features, asserted to be trade dress, are functional by reason of their inclusion in the claims of an expired
utility patent could be aided by going beyond the claims and
examining the patent and its prosecution history to see if the
feature in question is shown as a useful part of the invention.
No such claim is made here, however. MDI in essence seeks
protection for the dual-spring design alone. The asserted
trade dress consists simply of the dual-spring design, four
legs, a base, an upright, and a sign. MDI has pointed to
nothing arbitrary about the components of its device or the
way they are assembled. The Lanham Act does not exist
to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a
particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and
its period of exclusivity. The Lanham Act, furthermore,
does not protect trade dress in a functional design simply

35Cite as: 532 U. S. 23 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
because an investment has been made to encourage the pub-lic to associate a particular functional feature with a single manufacturer or seller. The Court of Appeals erred inviewing MDI as possessing the right to exclude competitors
from using a design identical to MDI's and to require thosecompetitors to adopt a different design simply to avoid copying it. MDI cannot gain the exclusive right to produce signstands using the dual-spring design by asserting that consumers associate it with the look of the invention itself.Whether a utility patent has expired or there has been no
utility patent at all, a product design which has a particularappearance may be functional because it is "essential to the
use or purpose of the article" or "affects the cost or qualityof the article."

Inwood, 456 U. S., at 850, n. 10.TrafFix and some of its amici argue that the Patent

Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, $ 8, cl. 8, of its own force,prohibits the holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. Brief for Petitioner 33-36; Brieffor Panduit Corp. as

Amicus Curiae 3; Brief for Malla Pol-lack as Amicus Curiae 2. We need not resolve this question. If, despite the rule that functional features may notbe the subject of trade dress protection, a case arises in
which trade dress becomes the practical equivalent of an ex-pired utility patent, that will be time enough to consider the
matter. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion. It is so ordered.

SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA
certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina

No. 00-5250. Argued January 9, 2001--Decided March 20, 2001
Under recent amendments to South Carolina law, capital jurors face two

questions at the sentencing phase of the trial. They decide first
whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence
of any statutory aggravating circumstance. If the jury fails to agree
unanimously on the presence of a statutory aggravator, it cannot make
a sentencing recommendation. In that event, the trial judge is charged
with sentencing the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum 30-year prison term. If, on the other hand, the jury
unanimously finds a statutory aggravator, it then recommends one of
two potential sentences--death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. No other sentencing option is available to the jury.

A South Carolina jury found petitioner Shafer guilty of murder,
armed robbery, and conspiracy. During the trial's sentencing phase,
Shafer's counsel and the prosecutor disagreed on the application of Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154, to this case. This Court held in
Simmons that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at
issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury
is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process requires
that the jury be informed of the defendant's parole ineligibility. Shafer's counsel maintained that Simmons required the trial judge to instruct the jury that under South Carolina law a life sentence carries
no possibility of parole. The prosecutor, in opposition, urged that no
Simmons instruction was required because the State did not plan to
argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future. Shafer's
counsel replied that the State had in fact put future dangerousness at
issue by introducing evidence of a postarrest assault by Shafer and jail
rules violations. The judge refused to charge on parole ineligibility,
stating that future dangerousness had not been argued. The judge also
denied Shafer's counsel leave to read in his closing argument lines from
the controlling statute stating plainly that a life sentence in South Carolina carries no possibility of parole. After the prosecution's closing argument, Shafer's counsel renewed his plea for a life without parole instruction on the ground that the State had placed future dangerousness
at issue by repeating the statements of an alarmed witness at the crime
scene that Shafer and his accomplices "might come back." The trial
judge again denied the request. Quoting a passage from the relevant

532US1 Unit: $U32 [09-05-02 18:30:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

37Cite as: 532 U. S. 36 (2001)
Syllabus
statute but not the full text, the judge twice told the jury that "life
imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." During its sentencing deliberations, the jury asked the judge whether, and under what
circumstances, someone convicted of murder could become eligible for
parole. The judge responded that "[p]arole eligibility or ineligibility
is not for your consideration." The jury unanimously found beyond a
reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of murder while attempting
armed robbery, and recommended the death penalty, which the judge
imposed.

The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed. Without considering whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the court
held Simmons generally inapplicable to the State's "new sentencing
scheme." Simmons is not triggered, the South Carolina court said, unless life without parole is the only legally available sentence alternative
to death. Currently, the court observed, when a capital jury begins its
sentencing deliberations, three alternative sentences are available: (1)
death, (2) life without the possibility of parole, or (3) a mandatory minimum 30-year sentence. Since an alternative to death other than life
without the possibility of parole exists, the court concluded, Simmons
no longer constrains capital sentencing in South Carolina.

Held:

1. The South Carolina Supreme Court incorrectly interpreted Simmons when it declared the case inapplicable to South Carolina's current
sentencing scheme. That court's reasoning might be persuasive if the
jury's sentencing discretion actually encompassed the three choices the
court identified: death, life without the possibility of parole, or a mandatory minimum 30-year sentence. But, that is not how the State's new
scheme works. Under the law now governing sentencing proceedings,
if the jury finds an aggravating circumstance, it must recommend a sentence, and its choices are limited to death and life without parole.
When the jury makes the threshold determination whether a statutory
aggravator exists, a tightly circumscribed factual inquiry, none of Simmons' due process concerns yet arise. At that stage, there are no "misunderstanding[s]" to avoid, no "false choice[s]" to guard against. See
Simmons, 512 U. S., at 161 (plurality opinion). The jury, as aggravating
circumstance factfinder, exercises no sentencing discretion itself. If no
aggravator is found, the judge takes over and has sole authority to impose the mandatory minimum so heavily relied upon by the State Supreme Court. It is only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment
whether to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become
critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that Simmons comes

38 SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Syllabus
into play, a stage at which South Carolina law provides no third choice,
no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole. See
Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 169. Thus, whenever future dangerousness is at issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South
Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed
that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. Pp. 48-51.

2. South Carolina's other grounds in support of the trial judge's
refusal to give Shafer's requested parole ineligibility instruction are
unavailing. Pp. 52-55.

(a) The State's argument that the jury was properly informed of
the law on parole ineligibility by the trial court's instructions and by
defense counsel's own argument is unpersuasive. To support that contention, the State sets out defense counsel's closing pleas that, if Shafer's
life is spared, he will die in prison after spending his natural life there,
as well as passages from the trial judge's instructions reiterating that
life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant. Displacement of the longstanding practice of parole availability remains a relatively recent development, and common sense indicates that many jurors
might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the possibility of
parole. Simmons, 512 U. S., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in

judgment). Indeed, until two years before Shafer's trial, South Carolina's law did not categorically preclude parole for capital defendants
sentenced to life imprisonment. Most plainly contradicting the State's
contention, the jury's written request for further instructions on the
question left no doubt about the jury's failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge's instructions any clear understanding of what a life sentence means. Cf., e. g., id., at 178. The jury's
comprehension was hardly aided by the court's final instruction declaring that parole eligibility was not for the jury's consideration. That
instruction did nothing to ensure that the jury was not misled and may
well have been taken to mean that parole was available but that the
jury, for some unstated reason, should be blind to this fact. E. g., id.,
at 170 (plurality opinion). Thus, although a life sentence for Shafer
would permit no parole or other release under current state law, this
reality was not conveyed to Shafer's jury by the court's instructions or
by the arguments defense counsel was allowed to make. Pp. 52-54.

(b) The State's contention that no parole ineligibility instruction
was required under Simmons because the State never argued that
Shafer would pose a future danger to society presents an issue that is
not ripe for this Court's resolution. The State Supreme Court, in order
to rule broadly that Simmons no longer governs capital sentencing in
the State, apparently assumed, arguendo, that future dangerousness had
been shown at Shafer's sentencing proceeding. Because that court did

not home in on the question whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the question is left open for the state court's attention and

This case concerns the right of a defendant in a capitalcase to inform the jury that, under the governing state law,

he would not be eligible for parole in the event that the jurysentences him to life imprisonment. In Simmons v. South
Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), this Court held that where acapital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and the
only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury islife imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process
entitles the defendant "to inform the jury of [his] parole ineli-gibility, either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel." Ramdass v. Angelone, 530 U. S. 156, 165 (2000) (plu-rality opinion) (describing

S. C. 291, 297, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 527 (2000). It presents thequestion whether the South Carolina Supreme Court misread our precedent when it declared Simmons inapplicableto South Carolina's current sentencing scheme. We hold
that South Carolina's Supreme Court incorrectly limited
Simmons and therefore reverse that court's judgment.

I
In April 1997, in the course of an attempted robbery inUnion County, South Carolina, then-18-year-old Wesley

Aaron Shafer, Jr., shot and killed a convenience store cashier.A grand jury indicted Shafer on charges of murder, attempted armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy. App. 2-4.Prior to trial, the prosecutor notified Shafer that the State
would seek the death penalty for the murder. App. 4-5. Inthat pursuit, the prosecutor further informed Shafer, the
State would present evidence of Shafer's "prior bad acts,"as well as his "propensity for [future] violence and unlawful
conduct." App. 6, 8.Under South Carolina law, juries in capital cases consider
guilt and sentencing in separate proceedings. S. C. CodeAnn. $$ 16-3-20(A), (B) (2000 Cum. Supp.). In the initial
(guilt phase) proceeding, the jury found Shafer guilty on allthree charges. Governing the sentencing proceeding, South
Carolina law instructs: "[T]he jury . . . shall hear additionalevidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the
punishment. . . . The State, the defendant, and his counselare permitted to present arguments for or against the sentence to be imposed." $ 16-3-20(B).Under amendments effective January 1, 1996, South Carolina capital jurors face two questions at sentencing. Theydecide first whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any statutory aggravatingcircumstance. If the jury fails to agree unanimously on

the presence of a statutory aggravator, "it shall not makea sentencing recommendation." $ 16-3-20(C). "[T]he trial

judge," in that event, "shall sentence the defendant to eitherlife imprisonment or a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years." Ibid.; see $ 16-3-20(B). If, onthe other hand, the jury unanimously finds a statutory aggravator, it then recommends one of two potential sentences--
death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.$$ 16-3-20(A), (B). No sentencing option other than death

or life without parole is available to the jury.During the sentencing proceeding in Shafer's case, the
State introduced evidence of his criminal record, past aggressive conduct, probation violations, and misbehavior in
prison. The State urged the statutory aggravating circumstance that Shafer had committed the murder in the course
of an attempted robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.
See $ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d). The defense presented evidence
of Shafer's abusive childhood and mental problems.

Near the completion of the parties' sentencing presentations, the trial judge conducted an in camera hearing on jury
instructions. Shafer's counsel maintained that due process,
and our decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S.
154 (1994), required the judge to instruct that under South
Carolina law a life sentence carries no possibility of parole.
The prosecutor, in opposition, urged that Shafer was not
entitled to a Simmons instruction because "the State has
not argued at any point . . . that he would be a danger to
anybody in the future, nor will we argue [that] in our closing
argument . . . ." App. 161. Shafer's counsel replied: "The
State cannot introduce evidence of future dangerousness,
and then say we are not going to argue it and [thereby avoid]
a charge on the law. . . . They have introduced [evidence of
a] post arrest assault, [and] post arrest violations of the rules
of the jail . . . . If you put a jailer on to say that [Shafer] is
charged with assault . . . on [the jailer], that is future dangerousness." App. 162. Ruling that "the matter of parole

ineligibility will not be charged," the trial judge stated: "Ifind that future dangerousness [was] not argued[;] if it's argued [in the prosecutor's closing], it may become different."App. 164.

Unsuccessful in his effort to gain a court instruction onparole ineligibility, Shafer's counsel sought permission to impart the information to the jury himself. He sought leaveto read in his closing argument lines from the controlling
statute, $ 16-3-20(A), stating plainly that a life sentence inSouth Carolina carries no possibility of parole. App. 164-
165.1 In accord with the State's motion "to prevent the de-fense from arguing in their closing argument anything to the
effect that [Shafer] will never get out of prison," App. 161,the judge denied the defense permission to read the statute's
text to the jury. App. 165.

1 Section 16-3-20(A) reads: "A person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to murder must be punished by death, by imprisonment for life, or
by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for thirty years. If the
State seeks the death penalty and a statutory aggravating circumstance
is found beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to subsections (B) and (C),
and a recommendation of death is not made, the trial judge must impose
a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, `life imprisonment' means until death of the offender. No person sentenced to life
imprisonment pursuant to this section is eligible for parole, community
supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to
receive any work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any
other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required
by this section. No person sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment for thirty years pursuant to this section is eligible for parole
or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any
work credits, education credits, good conduct credits, or any other credits
that would reduce the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for
thirty years required by this section. . . . When the Governor commutes a
sentence of death to life imprisonment under the provisions of Section 14
of Article IV of the Constitution of South Carolina, 1895, the commutee is
not eligible for parole, community supervision, or any early release program, nor is the person eligible to receive any work credits, good conduct
credits, education credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory imprisonment required by this subsection."

Opinion of the Court
After the prosecution's closing argument, and out of thepresence of the jury, Shafer's counsel renewed his plea for "a

life without parole charge." App. 188. He referred to hisearlier submissions and urged, in addition, that the State had
placed future dangerousness at issue during closing argu-ment by repeating the words of an alarmed witness at the
crime scene: "[T]hey [Shafer and his two accomplices] might
come back, they might come back." App. 188. The trialjudge denied the request. The judge "admit[ted he] had

some concern [as to whether the State's] argument . . . hadcrossed the line," but in the end he found "that it comes
close, but did not." App. 191-192.Instructing the jury, the judge explained:

"If you do not unanimously find the existence of the ag-gravating circumstance as set forth on the form [murder
during the commission of an attempted armed robbery],you do not need to go any further.

"If you find unanimously the existence of a statutoryaggravating circumstance . . . you will go further and
continue your deliberations."Once you have unanimously found and signed as to
the presence of an aggravated circumstance, you thenfurther deliberate, and determine whether or not Wesley Aaron Shafer should be sentence[d] to life imprisonment or death." App. 202.

The judge twice told the jury, quoting words from $ 16-3-20(A), that "life imprisonment means until the death of the

defendant." App. 201; see App. 209. In line with his priorrulings, the judge did not instruct that a life sentence, if
recommended by the jury, would be without parole. In the
concluding portion of his charge, he told the jury that "the
sentence you send to me by way of a recommendation will

defense once more renewed its "objection to the statutory

Opinion of the Court
language [on parole ineligibility] not being charged," App.221, and the judge again overruled the objection, App. 222.

Three hours and twenty-five minutes into its sentencingdeliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge containing two questions:

"1) Is there any remote chance for someone convictedof murder to become elig[i]ble for parole?

"2) Under what conditions would someone convicted formurder be elig[i]ble." App. 253.

Shafer's counsel urged the court to read to the jury the fol-lowing portion of $ 16-3-20(A):

"If the State seeks the death penalty and a statutoryaggravating circumstance is found beyond a reasonable
doubt . . . and a recommendation of death is not made,the trial judge must impose a sentence of life imprisonment. For purposes of this section, `life imprisonment'
means until death of the offender. No person sen-tenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section

is eligible for parole, community supervision, or anyearly release program, nor is the person eligible to
receive any work credits, education credits, goodconduct credits, or any other credits that would reduce the mandatory life imprisonment required bythis section." App. 226 (emphasis added).

He argued that the court's charge, which partially quotedfrom $ 16-3-20 (above in italics), but omitted the provision's
concluding sentence (above in boldface), had left the jurorsconfused about Shafer's parole eligibility. App. 226. The
State adhered to its position that "the jury should not beinformed as to any parole eligibility." App. 223. South
Carolina law, the prosecutor insisted, required the judge to"instruct the jury that it shall not consider parole eligibility
in reaching its decision, and that the term life imprisonmentand a death sentence should be understood in their ordinary
and plain meaning." App. 223-224.

Opinion of the Court
The trial judge decided "not . . . to charge the jury aboutparole ineligibility," App. 229, and informed counsel that he

would instruct:

"Your consideration is restricted to what sentence torecommend. I will, as trial judge, impose the sentence

you recommend. Section 16-3-20 of the South CarolinaCode of Laws provides that for the purpose of this
section life imprisonment means until the death of theoffender. Parole eligibility is not for your consideration." App. 236.
Shafer's counsel asked the judge "to take off the language ofparole eligibility." App. 236. The statement that "parole

eligibility is not to be considered by [the jury]," counsel ar-gued, "impl[ies] that it is available." App. 236; see App. 239
(Shafer's counsel reiterated: "[I]f you tell them they can'tconsider parole eligibility . . . that certainly implies that he
may be eligible.").Following counsels' arguments, and nearly an hour after
the jury tendered its questions, the trial judge instructed:

"Section 16-3-20 of our Code of Laws as applies tothis case in the process we're in, states that, quote, for

the purposes of this section life imprisonment meansuntil the death of the offender, end quote.

"Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for your con-sideration." App. 240.

The jury returned some 80 minutes later. It unanimouslyfound beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factor of
murder while attempting armed robbery, and recommendedthe death penalty. App. 242-243. The jury was polled, and
each member indicated his or her assent to the aggravatedcircumstance finding and to the death penalty recommendation. App. 243-248. Defense counsel asked that the jurybe polled on "the specific question as to whether parole eligibility, their belief therein, gave rise to the verdict," and"whether juror number 233 who works for probation and pa532US1 Unit: $U32 [09-05-02 18:30:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

judge denied both requests and imposed the death sentence.App. 248, 251.

Shafer appealed his death sentence to the South CarolinaSupreme Court. Noting our decision in Simmons, the

South Carolina Supreme Court acknowledged that "[w]henthe State places the defendant's future dangerousness at
issue and the only available alternative sentence to the deathpenalty is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury he is parole ineligible."340 S. C., at 297-298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. Without considering whether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions orclosing argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness at issue, the court held Simmons generally inapplicableto South Carolina's "new sentencing scheme." Under that
scheme, life without the possibility of parole and death arenot the only authorized sentences, the court said, for there
is a third potential sentence, "a mandatory minimum thirtyyear sentence." 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528 (citing
State v. Starnes, 340 S. C. 312, 531 S. E. 2d 907 (2000) (de-cided the same day as Shafer)).

3

2 The judge also sentenced Shafer to consecutive terms of 20 years in
prison for the attempted armed robbery and 5 years in prison for the
criminal conspiracy. App. 251-252.

3 South Carolina's "new" sentencing scheme changed the punishments

available for a capital murder conviction that did not result in a death
sentence. The capital sentencing law in effect at the time we decided
Simmons read: "A person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder
must be punished by death or by imprisonment for life and is not eligible
for parole until the service of twenty years; provided, however, that when
the State seeks the death penalty and an aggravating circumstance is specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt . . . , and a recommendation of
death is not made, the court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment
without eligibility for parole until the service of thirty years." S. C. Code
Ann. $ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 1993). What made Simmons parole ineligible
was the provision stating: "The board must not grant parole nor is parole
authorized to any prisoner serving a sentence for a second or subsequent
conviction, following a separate sentencing for a prior conviction, for vio532US1 Unit: $U32 [09-05-02 18:30:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Shafer had urged that a Simmons instruction was war-ranted under the new sentencing scheme, for when the jury

serves as sentencer, i. e., when it finds a statutory aggravat-ing circumstance, sentencing discretion is limited to death or
life without the possibility of parole. See 340 S. C., at 298,531 S. E. 2d, at 528. The South Carolina Supreme Court
read Simmons differently. In its view, "Simmons requiresthe trial judge instruct the jury the defendant is parole ineligible only if no other sentence than death, other than lifewithout the possibility of parole, is

legally available to thedefendant." 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528 (emphasis

in original) (citing Simmons, 512 U. S., at 178 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment)). "At the time [Shafer's] jury
began its deliberations," the court observed, "three alter-native sentences were available"; "[s]ince one of these alternatives to death was not life without the possibility ofparole," the court concluded, "Simmons was inapplicable."
340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.Chief Justice Finney dissented. "[T]he overriding principle to be drawn from [Simmons]," he stated, "is that dueprocess is violated when a jury's speculative misunderstanding about a capital defendant's parole eligibility is allowed to
go uncorrected." Id., at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534. Due proc-ess mandates reversal here, he concluded, because "the jury's

inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested pa-role was a possibility."

Ibid. Moreover, Chief Justice Finney added, when "a capital jury inquires about parole," id.,at 310, n. 2, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534, n. 2, even if the question "is

simply one of policy, as the majority suggests [it is], thenwhy not adopt a policy which gives the jurors the simpl[e]
truth: no parole." Id., at 311, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534.
lent crimes . . . ." $ 24-21-640. This latter provision has not been
amended; however, it did not apply to Shafer. Here, we consider whether
South Carolina's wholesale elimination of parole for capital defendants sentenced to life in prison, see S. C. Code Ann. $ 16-3-20 (2000 Cum. Supp.),
described supra, at 40-41, requires a Simmons instruction in all South
Carolina capital cases in which future dangerousness is "at issue."

48 SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1306 (2000), to determinewhether the South Carolina Supreme Court properly held

Simmons inapplicable to the State's current sentencing re-gime. We conclude that South Carolina's Supreme Court
misinterpreted Simmons, and we therefore reverse thatcourt's judgment.

II
South Carolina has consistently refused to inform the juryof a capital defendant's parole eligibility status.

4 We first

confronted this practice in Simmons. The South Carolinasentencing scheme then in effect, S. C. Code Ann. $$ 16-3-

20(A) and 24-21-610 (Supp. 1993), did not categorically pre-clude parole for capital defendants sentenced to life imprisonment, see supra, at 46-47, n. 3. Simmons, however, wasparole ineligible under that scheme because of prior convictions for crimes of violence. See $ 24-21-640; Simmons, 512U. S., at 156 (plurality opinion); id., at 176 (

O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment). Simmons' jury, in a note to the

judge during the penalty phase deliberations, asked: "Doesthe imposition of a life sentence carry with it the possibility
of parole?" Id., at 160 (plurality opinion). Over defensecounsel's objection, the trial judge in

Simmons instructed:"Do not consider parole or parole eligibility [in reaching your

4 At the time we decided Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154
(1994), South Carolina was one of only three States--Pennsylvania and
Virginia were the others--that "ha[d] a life-without-parole sentencing alternative to capital punishment for some or all convicted murderers but
refuse[d] to inform sentencing juries of th[at] fact." Id., at 168, n. 8.
Since Simmons, Virginia has abandoned this practice. Yarbrough v.
Commonwealth, 258 Va. 347, 374, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 616 (1999) ("[W]e hold
that in the penalty-determination phase of a trial where the defendant has
been convicted of capital murder, in response to a proffer of a proper
instruction from the defendant prior to submitting the issue of penaltydetermination to the jury or where the defendant asks for such an instruction following an inquiry from the jury during deliberations, the trial court
shall instruct the jury that the words `imprisonment for life' mean `imprisonment for life without possibility of parole.' ").

Opinion of the Court
verdict]. That is not a proper issue for your consideration."
Ibid. After receiving this response from the court, Simmons' jury returned a sentence of death, which Simmons un-successfully sought to overturn on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Id., at 160-161.Mindful of the "longstanding practice of parole availability," id., at 177 (O'Connor, J.), we recognized that Simmons'
jury, charged to chose between death and life imprisonment,may have been misled. Given no clear definition of "life imprisonment" and told not to consider parole eligibility, thatjury "reasonably may have believed that [Simmons] could be
released on parole if he were not executed." Id., at 161 (plurality opinion); see id., at 177-178 (O'Connor, J.). It did not
comport with due process, we held, for the State to "secur[e]
a death sentence on the ground, at least in part, of [defendant's] future dangerousness, while at the same time concealing from the sentencing jury the true meaning of its [only]
noncapital sentencing alternative, namely, that life imprisonment meant life without parole." Id., at 162 (plurality opinion); see id., at 178 (O'Connor, J.) ("Where the State puts
the defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only
available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment
without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury--by either argument or instruction--that he is parole ineligible.").

As earlier stated, see supra, at 46-47, the South Carolina
Supreme Court held Simmons "inapplicable under the
[State's] new sentencing scheme," 340 S. C., at 298, 531 S. E.
2d, at 528. Simmons is not triggered, the South Carolina
court said, unless life without parole is "the only legally
available sentence alternative to death." 340 S. C., at 298,
531 S. E. 2d, at 528. Currently, the court observed, when a
capital case jury begins its sentencing deliberations, three
alternative sentences are available: "1) death, 2) life without
the possibility of parole, or 3) a mandatory minimum thirty
year sentence." Ibid. "Since one of these alternatives to

50 SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Opinion of the Court
death [is] not life without the possibility of parole," the court
concluded, Simmons no longer constrains capital sentencing
in South Carolina. 340 S. C., at 299, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528.

This reasoning might be persuasive if the jury's sentencing
discretion encompassed the three choices the South Carolina
court identified. But, that is not how the State's new
scheme works. See supra, at 40-41. Under the law now
governing, in any case in which the jury does not unanimously find a statutory aggravator, death is not a permissible sentence and Simmons has no relevance. In such a case,
the judge alone becomes the sentencer. S. C. Code Ann.

$ 16-3-20(C) (2000 Cum. Supp.). Only if the jury finds an
aggravating circumstance does it decide on the sentence.
Ibid. And when it makes that decision, as was the case in
Simmons, only two sentences are legally available under
South Carolina law: death or life without the possibility of
parole. $ 16-3-20(C).

The South Carolina Supreme Court was no doubt correct
to this extent: At the time the trial judge instructed the jury
in Shafer's case, it was indeed possible that Shafer would
receive a sentence other than death or life without the possibility of parole. That is so because South Carolina, in line
with other States, gives capital juries, at the penalty phase,
discrete and sequential functions. Initially, capital juries
serve as factfinders in determining whether an alleged aggravating circumstance exists. Once that factual threshold
is passed, the jurors exercise discretion in determining the
punishment that ought to be imposed. The trial judge in
Shafer's case recognized the critical difference in the two
functions. He charged that "[a] statutory aggravating circumstance is a fact, an incident, a detail or an occurrence,"
the existence of which must be found beyond a reasonable
doubt. App. 203. Turning to the sentencing choice, he referred to considerations of "fairness and mercy," and the defendant's "moral culpability." App. 204. He also instructed

532US1 Unit: $U32 [09-05-02 18:30:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

51Cite as: 532 U. S. 36 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
that the jury was free to decide "whether . . . for any reason
or no reason at all Mr. Shafer should be sentenced to life
imprisonment rather than to death." App. 203.

In sum, when the jury determines the existence of a statutory aggravator, a tightly circumscribed factual inquiry,
none of Simmons' due process concerns arise. There are no
"misunderstanding[s]" to avoid, no "false choice[s]" to guard
against. See Simmons, 512 U. S., at 161 (plurality opinion).
The jury, as aggravating circumstance factfinder, exercises
no sentencing discretion itself. If no aggravator is found,
the judge takes over and has sole authority to impose the
mandatory minimum so heavily relied upon by the South
Carolina Supreme Court. See supra, at 46-47, 49-50. It is
only when the jury endeavors the moral judgment whether
to impose the death penalty that parole eligibility may become critical. Correspondingly, it is only at that stage that
Simmons comes into play, a stage at which South Carolina
law provides no third choice, no 30-year mandatory minimum, just death or life without parole. See Ramdass, 530
U. S., at 169 (Simmons applies where "as a legal matter,
there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison." (emphasis added)).5 We
therefore hold that whenever future dangerousness is at
issue in a capital sentencing proceeding under South Carolina's new scheme, due process requires that the jury be informed that a life sentence carries no possibility of parole.

5 Tellingly, the State acknowledged at oral argument that if future dangerousness was a factor, and the jury first reported finding an aggravator
before going on to its sentencing recommendation, a Simmons charge
would at that point be required. Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. We see no significant difference between that situation and the one presented here. Nor
does Justice Thomas' dissent in this case plausibly urge any such distinction. See post, at 56-58. If the jurors should be told life means no parole
in the hypothesized bifurcated sentencing proceeding, they should be
equally well informed in the actual uninterrupted proceeding.

52 SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Opinion of the Court

III
South Carolina offers two other grounds in support of the
trial judge's refusal to give Shafer's requested parole ineligibility instruction. First, the State argues that the jury was
properly informed of the law on parole ineligibility by the
trial court's instructions and by defense counsel's own argument. Second, the State contends that no parole ineligibility instruction was required under Simmons because the
State never argued Shafer would pose a future danger to
society. We now turn to those arguments.

A
"Even if this Court finds Simmons was triggered," the
State urges, "the defense's closing argument and the judge's
charge fulfilled the requirements of Simmons." Brief for
Respondent 38. To support that contention, the State sets
out defense counsel's closing pleas that, if Shafer's life is
spared, he will "die in prison" after "spend[ing] his natural
life there." Id., at 39. Next, the State recites passages
from the trial judge's instructions reiterating that "life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." Id.,
at 40.

The South Carolina Supreme Court, we note, never suggested that counsel's arguments or the trial judge's instructions satisfied Simmons. That court simply held Simmons
inapplicable under the State's new sentencing scheme. 340
S. C., at 298, 531 S. E. 2d, at 528. We do not find the State's
position persuasive. Displacement of "the longstanding
practice of parole availability" remains a relatively recent
development, and "common sense tells us that many jurors
might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the
possibility of parole." Simmons, 512 U. S., at 177-178
(O'Connor, J.). South Carolina's situation is illustrative.
Until two years before Shafer's trial, as we earlier noted, the
State's law did not categorically preclude parole for capital

Opinion of the Court
defendants sentenced to life imprisonment. See supra, at46-47, n. 3, and 48.

Most plainly contradicting the State's contention, Shafer'sjury left no doubt about its failure to gain from defense counsel's closing argument or the judge's instructions any clearunderstanding of what a life sentence means. The jurors
sought further instruction, asking: "Is there any remote
chance for someone convicted of murder to become elig[i]blefor parole?" App. 253; cf.

Simmons, 512 U. S., at 178
(O'Connor, J.) ("that the jury in this case felt compelled toask whether parole was available shows that the jurors did

not know whether or not a life-sentenced defendant will bereleased from prison").

6

The jury's comprehension was hardly aided by the court'sfinal instruction: "Parole eligibility or ineligibility is not for

your consideration." App. 240. That instruction did noth-ing to ensure that the jury was not misled and may well have
been taken to mean "that parole was available but that the
jury, for some unstated reason, should be blind to this fact."
Simmons, 512 U. S., at 170 (plurality opinion); see 340 S. C.,
at 310, 531 S. E. 2d, at 534 (Finney, C. J., dissenting) ("[T]he
jury's inquiry prompted a misleading response which suggested parole was a possibility."); State v. Kelly, 343 S. C.

that, if aggravators are found, a life sentence is not subject
to being reduced by parole, or any other method of early
release, the jury is likely to speculate unnecessarily on the
possibility of early release, and impose a sentence of death

6 Animating Justice Thomas' dissent is the conviction that the limited
information defense counsel was allowed to convey and the judge's charge
"left no room for speculation by the jury." Post, at 57. The full record
scarcely supports, and we do not share, that conviction. Cf. 340 S. C. 291,
310-311, 531 S. E. 2d 524, 534 (2000) (Finney, C. J., dissenting) ("the jury's

based upon `fear rather than reason.' " (quoting Yarbrough v.Commonwealth, 258 Va. 347, 369, 519 S. E. 2d 602, 613

(1999))).In sum, a life sentence for Shafer would permit no "parole,
community supervision, . . . early release program, . . . orany other credits that would reduce the mandatory life
imprisonment," S. C. Code Ann. $ 16-3-20(A) (2000 Cum.Supp.) (set out

supra, at 42, n. 1); this reality was not con-veyed to Shafer's jury by the court's instructions or by the

arguments defense counsel was allowed to make.

B
Ultimately, the State maintains that "[t]he prosecution didnot argue future dangerousness," so the predicate for a

Sim-mons charge is not present here. Brief for Respondent 42.

That issue is not ripe for our resolution.In the trial court, the prosecutor and defense counsel differed on what it takes to place future dangerousness "atissue." The prosecutor suggested that the State must
formally argue future dangerousness. App. 161. Defensecounsel urged that once the prosecutor introduces evidence
showing future dangerousness, the State cannot avoid a Sim-mons charge by saying the point was not argued or calling
the evidence by another name. See App. 161-162.As earlier recounted, the trial judge determined that future dangerousness was not at issue, but acknowledged, atone point, that the prosecutor had come close to crossing the
line. See supra, at 41-42, 43. The South Carolina SupremeCourt, in order to rule broadly that

Simmons no longergoverns capital sentencing in the State, apparently assumed,

arguendo, that future dangerousness had been shown atShafer's sentencing proceeding. See supra, at 46-47; cf.
Kelly, 343 S. C., at 363, 540 S. E. 2d, at 857 (recognizingthat future dangerousness is an issue when it is "a logical
inference from the evidence" or was "injected into the casethrough the State's closing argument"). Because the South

Thomas, J., dissenting
Carolina Supreme Court did not home in on the questionwhether the prosecutor's evidentiary submissions or closing

argument in fact placed Shafer's future dangerousness atissue, we leave that question open for the state court's attention and disposition. * * *

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the South CarolinaSupreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, dissenting.

While I concede that today's judgment is a logical exten-sion of

Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994),I am more attached to the logic of the Constitution, whose

Due Process Clause was understood as an embodiment ofcommon-law tradition, rather than as authority for federal courts to promulgate wise national rules of criminalprocedure.

As I pointed out in Simmons, that common-law traditiondoes not contain special jury-instruction requirements for
capital cases. Today's decision is the second page of the"whole new chapter" of our improvised " `death-is-different'
jurisprudence" that Simmons began. Id., at 185 (Scalia,
J., dissenting). The third page (or the fourth or fifth) willbe the (logical-enough) extension of this novel requirement

to cases in which the jury did not inquire into the possibilityof parole. Providing such information may well be a good
idea (though it will sometimes harm rather than help thedefendant's case)--and many States have indeed required it.
See App. B to Brief for Petitioner. The Constitution, how-ever, does not. I would limit Simmons to its facts.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
For better or, as I believe, worse, the majority's decisionin this case is the logical next step after

56 SHAFER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994). Now, whenever future dan-gerousness is placed at issue and the jury's potential sentencing choice is between life without parole and death, the trialcourt must instruct the jury on the impossibility of release
even if there is an alternative sentence available to the courtunder which the defendant could be released. However,
even accepting that sentencing courts in South Carolina
must now permit the jury to learn about the impossibilityof parole when life imprisonment is a sentencing possibility,

I believe that the court's instructions and the argumentsmade by counsel in Shafer's case were sufficient to inform
the jury of what "life imprisonment" meant for Shafer. I
therefore respectfully dissent.

In Simmons, a majority of this Court was concerned that
the jury in Simmons' trial reasonably could have believed
that, if he were sentenced to life, he would be eligible for
parole. See id., at 161 (plurality opinion); id., at 177-178
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore, Simmons' defense to future dangerousness--that because he sexually assaulted only elderly women, he would pose no danger
to fellow inmates, see id., at 157 (plurality opinion)--would
not have been effective. To correct the jury's possible misunderstanding of the availability of parole, Simmons requested several jury instructions, including one that would
explain that, if he were sentenced to life imprisonment, " `he
actually w[ould] be sentenced to imprisonment in the state
penitentiary for the balance of his natural life.' " Id., at 160.
The trial court rejected this instruction and instead ambiguously informed the jury that the term life imprisonment is
to be understood according to its " `plain and ordinary meaning,' " which did "nothing to dispel the misunderstanding
reasonable jurors may have about the way in which any particular State defines `life imprisonment.' " Id., at 169-170.

In this case, by contrast, the judge repeatedly explained
that "life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant." App. 201. The judge defined "life imprisonment" as

57Cite as: 532 U. S. 36 (2001)
Thomas, J., dissenting
"incarceration of the defendant until his death," id., at 209,and informed the jury that, if it chose the punishment of

life imprisonment, the verdict form would read " `We, thejury . . . unanimously recommend that the defendant, Wesley
Aaron Shafer, be imprisoned in the state penitentiary for thebalance of his natural life.' "

Id., at 213-214. Emphasizing
this very point, Shafer's counsel argued to the jury that
Shafer would never leave prison if he received a life sen-tence. See

id., at 192 ("The question is will the State execute him or will he just die in prison"); id., at 194 ("puttinga 19 year old in prison until he is dead" and "you can put

say give [him] life, he's not going home. . . . I'm just asking
for the smallest amount of mercy it takes to make a man, a
child spend the rest of his life in prison").

Given these explanations of what life imprisonment means,
which left no room for speculation by the jury, I can only
infer that the jury's questions regarding parole referred not
to Shafer's parole eligibility in the event the jury sentenced
Shafer to life, but rather to his parole eligibility in the event
it did not sentence him at all. In fact, both of the jury's
questions referred only to parole eligibility of someone "convicted of murder," id., at 239-240 (" `[I]s there any remote
chance that someone convicted of murder could become eligible for parole' "); id., at 240 (" `[U]nder what conditions would
someone convicted for murder be eligible [for parole]' "),
rather than parole eligibility of someone sentenced to life
imprisonment. Under South Carolina law, if the jury does
not find an aggravating circumstance, someone convicted of
murder could be sentenced to a term of 30 years' imprisonment or greater. See S. C. Code Ann. $ 16-3-20(C) (2000
Cum. Supp.). If the jury thought Shafer's release from
prison was a possibility in the event the judge sentenced
him, they would have been correct. To be sure, under South
Carolina's sentencing scheme, the jury did not need to know
what sentencing options were available to the judge in the

event the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance.But that is precisely why the trial court's answers were appropriate. It explained what "life" meant for purposes ofthe jury's sentencing option, and then added that "[p]arole
eligibility or ineligibility is not for your consideration."App. 240.

The majority appears to believe that it could develop juryinstructions that are more precise than those offered to Shafer's jury. It may well be right. But it is not this Court'srole to micromanage state sentencing proceedings or to develop model jury instructions. I would decline to interferefurther with matters that the Constitution leaves to the
States.

BUFORD v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 99-9073. Argued January 8, 2001--Decided March 20, 2001
The United States Sentencing Guidelines, as relevant here, define a career

offender as one with at least two prior felony convictions for violent or
drug-related crimes and provide that a sentencing judge must count as
a single prior conviction all "related" convictions, advising that they are
"related" when, inter alia, they were consolidated for sentencing. The
Seventh Circuit has held that because two prior convictions might have
been consolidated for sentencing, and hence related, even if a sentencing
court did not enter a formal consolidation order, a court should decide
whether such convictions were nonetheless functionally consolidated,
meaning that they were factually or logically related and sentencing
was joint. Petitioner Buford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery.
At sentencing, the Government conceded that her four prior robbery
convictions were related, but did not concede that her prior drug conviction was related to the robberies. The District Court decided that the
drug and robbery cases had not been consolidated, either formally or
functionally, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, reviewing the District
Court's decision deferentially rather than de novo.

Held: Deferential review is appropriate when an appeals court reviews a

trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination as to whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing. The relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to
"accept" a district court's "findings of fact" (unless "clearly erroneous"),
but also to "give due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts." 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(e) (emphasis added). The "deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented."
Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 98. Although Buford argues that
the nature of the question here--applying a Guideline term to undisputed facts--demands no deference at all, the district court is in a better
position than the appellate court to decide whether individual circumstances demonstrate functional consolidation. Experience with trials,
sentencing, and consolidation procedures will help a district judge draw
the proper inferences from the procedural descriptions provided. In
addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal decision, with legal
results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of
case-specific details. And the decision's fact-bound nature limits the

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises a narrow question of sentencing law.What standard of review applies when a court of appeals

reviews a trial court's Sentencing Guideline determination asto whether an offender's prior convictions were consolidated,
hence "related," for purposes of sentencing? In particular,should the appeals court review the trial court's decision deferentially or de novo? We conclude, as did the Court of Ap-peals, that deferential review is appropriate, and we affirm.

I
A
The trial court decision at issue focused on one aspect ofthe United States Sentencing Guidelines' treatment of "career offenders," a category of offender subject to particularlysevere punishment. The Guidelines define a "career offender" as an offender with "at least two prior felony con-victions" for violent or drug-related crimes. United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1 (Nov.2000) (USSG). At the same time, they provide that a sentencing judge must count as a single prior felony conviction

Opinion of the Court
all those that are "related" to one another. USSG $ 4B1.2(c),and comment., n. 3; $ 4A1.2(a)(2). And they advise (in an

application note) that prior convictions are "related" to oneanother when, inter alia, they "were consolidated for . . .
sentencing." $ 4A1.2, comment., n. 3.The Seventh Circuit has refined this "prior conviction"
doctrine yet further. It has held that two prior convictionsmight have been "consolidated for sentencing," and hence
"related," even if the sentencing court did not enter any formal order of consolidation. See United States v. Joseph, 50F. 3d 401, 404, cert. denied, 516 U. S. 847 (1995). In such an

instance, the Circuit has said, a court should decide whetherthe convictions were nonetheless "functionally consolidated," which means that the convictions were "factually orlogically related, and sentencing was joint." 201 F. 3d 937,
940 (2000) (emphasis added).

B
This case concerns "functional consolidation." Paula Bu-ford pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, a crime of violence, in federal court. The federal sentencing judge hadto decide whether Buford's five 1992 Wisconsin state-court
convictions were "related" to one another, and consequentlycounted as one single prior conviction, or whether they
should count as more than one.The Government conceded that four of the five prior convictions were "related" to one another. These four involveda series of gas station robberies. All four had been the subject of a single criminal indictment, and Buford had pleadedguilty to all four at the same time in the same court. See
USSG $ 4A1.2, comment., n. 3 (prior offenses are "related" if"consolidated for trial or sentencing").

The Government did not concede, however, that the fifthconviction, for a drug crime, was "related" to the other four.
The drug crime (possession of, with intent to deliver, co-caine) had taken place about the same time as the fourth

62 BUFORD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
robbery, and Buford claimed that the robberies had been motivated by her drug addiction. But the only evidentiary link
among the crimes was that the police had discovered the
cocaine when searching Buford's house after her arrest for
the robberies. Moreover, no formal order of consolidation
had been entered. The State had charged the drug offense
in a separate indictment and had assigned a different prosecutor to handle the drug case. A different judge had heard
Buford plead guilty to the drug charge in a different hearing
held on a different date; two different state prosecutors had
appeared before the sentencing court, one discussing drugs,
the other discussing the robberies; and the sentencing court
had entered two separate judgments.

Buford, without denying these facts, nonetheless pointed
to other circumstances that, in her view, showed that the
drug crime conviction had been "consolidated" with the robbery convictions for sentencing, rendering her drug conviction and robbery convictions "related." She pointed out
that the State had sent the four robbery cases for sentencing
to the very same judge who had heard and accepted her plea
of guilty to the drug charge; that the judge had heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases at the same time in
a single proceeding; that the judge had issued sentences for
all five crimes at the same time; and that the judge, having
imposed three sentences for the five crimes (6 years for the
drug crime, 12 years for two robberies, and 15 years for the
other two), had ordered all three to run concurrently.

The District Court, placing greater weight on the former
circumstances than on the latter, decided that the drug case
and the robbery cases had not been consolidated for sentencing, either formally or functionally. Buford appealed. The
Court of Appeals found the "functional consolidation" question a close one, and wrote that "the standard of appellate
review may be dispositive." 201 F. 3d, at 940. It decided
to review the District Court's decision "deferentially" rather

than "de novo." Id., at 942. And it affirmed that decision.
Ibid.

Buford sought certiorari. In light of the different Circuits' different approaches to the problem, we granted the
writ. Compare United States v. Irons, 196 F. 3d 634, 638
(CA6 1999) (relatedness decision reviewed for clear error);
United States v. Wiseman, 172 F. 3d 1196, 1219 (CA10)

States v. Davis, 922 F. 2d 1385, 1388 (CA9 1991) (same).

II
In arguing for de novo review, Buford points out that she
has not contested any relevant underlying issue of fact. She
disagrees only with the District Court's legal conclusion that
a legal label--"functional consolidation"--failed to fit the undisputed facts. She concedes, as she must, that this circumstance does not dispose of the standard of review question.
That is because the relevant federal sentencing statute requires a reviewing court not only to "accept" a district
court's "findings of fact" (unless "clearly erroneous"), but also
to "give due deference to the district court's application of
the guidelines to the facts." 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(e) (emphasis
added). And that is the kind of determination--application
of the Guidelines to the facts--that is at issue here. Hence
the question we must answer is what kind of "deference" is
"due." And, as we noted in Koon v. United States, 518 U. S.
81, 98 (1996), the "deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented."

532US1 Unit: $U33 [09-05-02 18:31:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
64 BUFORD v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Buford argues that the nature of the question presentedhere--applying a Sentencing Guidelines term to undisputed

facts--demands no deference at all. That is to say, the def-erence "due" is no deference; hence the Court of Appeals
should have reviewed the trial court's decision de novo. Bu-ford points out that, because the underlying facts are not in
dispute, witness credibility is not important. She adds that
de novo appellate review will help clarify and make meaning-ful the consolidation-related legal principles at issue. And

she says that de novo review will help avoid inconsistent trialcourt determinations about consolidation, thereby furthering
the Guidelines' effort to bring consistency to sentencing law.

Despite these arguments, we believe that the appellate
court was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than de novo. In Koon, we based our selection
of an abuse-of-discretion standard of review on the relative
institutional advantages enjoyed by the district court in
making the type of determination at issue. See id., at
98-99; cf. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) (deference may depend on whether "one judicial actor is better
positioned than another to decide the issue in question").
We concluded there that the special competence of the district court helped to make deferential review appropriate.
And that is true here as well. That is to say, the district
court is in a better position than the appellate court to decide
whether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates "functional consolidation."

That is so because a district judge sees many more "consolidations" than does an appellate judge. As a trial judge, a
district judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general, including consolidation procedures. And as a sentencing judge who must regularly review and classify defendants' criminal histories, a district
judge is more likely to be aware of which procedures the
relevant state or federal courts typically follow. Experience
with trials, sentencing, and consolidations will help that

Opinion of the Court
judge draw the proper inferences from the procedural de-scriptions provided.

In addition, factual nuance may closely guide the legal de-cision, with legal results depending heavily upon an understanding of the significance of case-specific details. See
Koon v. United States, supra, at 98-99 (District Court's detailed understanding of the case before it and experience
with other sentencing cases favored deferential review);
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 403-404
(1990) (fact-intensive nature of decision whether to imposesanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 made

deferential review appropriate); Pierce v. Underwood, 487
U. S. 552, 560 (1988) (District Court's familiarity with facts of
case warranted deferential review of determination whether
Government's legal position was "substantially justified").
In a case like this one, for example, under Seventh Circuit
doctrine, the District Judge usefully might have considered
the factual details of the crimes at issue in order to determine whether factual connections among those crimes,
rather than, say, administrative convenience, led Wisconsin
to sentence Buford simultaneously and concurrently for the
robbery and drug offenses. See United States v. Joseph, 50
F. 3d, at 404; United States v. Russell, 2 F. 3d 200, 204
(CA7 1993).

Nor can we place determinative weight upon the heightened uniformity benefits that Buford contends will result
from de novo review. The legal question at issue is a minor,
detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law, buried in a
judicial interpretation of an application note to a Sentencing Guideline. That question is not a generally recurring,
purely legal matter, such as interpreting a set of legal words,
say, those of an individual guideline, in order to determine
their basic intent. Nor is that question readily resolved by
reference to general legal principles and standards alone.
Rather, the question at issue grows out of, and is bounded
by, case-specific detailed factual circumstances. And the

Opinion of the Court
fact-bound nature of the decision limits the value of appellatecourt precedent, which may provide only minimal help when

other courts consider other procedural circumstances, otherstate systems, and other crimes. In any event, the Sentencing Commission itself gathers information on the sentencesimposed by different courts, it views the sentencing process
as a whole, it has developed a broad perspective on sentenc-ing practices throughout the Nation, and it can, by adjusting
the Guidelines or the application notes, produce more con-sistent sentencing results among similarly situated offenders
sentenced by different courts. Insofar as greater uniform-ity is necessary, the Commission can provide it. Cf.

Braxtonv. United States, 500 U. S. 344, 347-348 (1991) (Congress intended Sentencing Commission to play primary role in re-solving conflicts over interpretation of Guidelines).

III
In light of the fact-bound nature of the legal decision, thecomparatively greater expertise of the District Court, and

the limited value of uniform court of appeals precedent, weconclude that the Court of Appeals properly reviewed the
District Court's "functional consolidation" decision deferen-tially. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

FERGUSON et al. v. CITY OF CHARLESTON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-936. Argued October 4, 2000--Decided March 21, 2001
In the fall of 1988, staff members at the Charleston public hospital operated by the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) became concerned about an apparent increase in the use of cocaine by patients who
were receiving prenatal treatment. When the incidence of cocaine use
among maternity patients remained unchanged despite referrals for
counseling and treatment of patients who tested positive for that drug,
MUSC staff offered to cooperate with the city in prosecuting mothers
whose children tested positive for drugs at birth. Accordingly, a task
force made up of MUSC representatives, police, and local officials developed a policy which set forth procedures for identifying and testing
pregnant patients suspected of drug use; required that a chain of custody be followed when obtaining and testing patients' urine samples;
provided for education and treatment referral for patients testing positive; contained police procedures and criteria for arresting patients who
tested positive; and prescribed prosecutions for drug offenses and/or
child neglect, depending on the stage of the defendant's pregnancy.
Other than the provisions describing the substance abuse treatment to
be offered women testing positive, the policy made no mention of any
change in the prenatal care of such patients, nor did it prescribe any
special treatment for the newborns. Petitioners, MUSC obstetrical patients arrested after testing positive for cocaine, filed this suit challenging the policy's validity on, inter alia, the theory that warrantless and
nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory purposes
were unconstitutional searches. Among its actions, the District Court
instructed the jury to find for petitioners unless they had consented to
such searches. The jury found for respondents, and petitioners appealed, arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury's
consent finding. In affirming without reaching the consent question,
the Fourth Circuit held that the searches in question were reasonable
as a matter of law under this Court's cases recognizing that "special
needs" may, in certain exceptional circumstances, justify a search policy
designed to serve non-law-enforcement ends.

Held: A state hospital's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence of a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement purposes is an
unreasonable search if the patient has not consented to the procedure.

Syllabus
The interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter pregnant
women from using cocaine cannot justify a departure from the general
rule that an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant. Pp. 76-86.

(a) Because MUSC is a state hospital, its staff members are government actors subject to the Fourth Amendment's strictures. New Jersey
v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 335-337. Moreover, the urine tests at issue
were indisputably searches within that Amendment's meaning. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 617. Furthermore, both lower courts viewed the case as one involving MUSC's right
to conduct searches without warrants or probable cause, and this Court
must assume for purposes of decision that the tests were performed
without the patients' informed consent. Pp. 76-77.

(b) Because the hospital seeks to justify its authority to conduct drug
tests and to turn the results over to police without the patients' knowledge or consent, this case differs from the four previous cases in which
the Court considered whether comparable drug tests fit within the
closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless
searches. See Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 309; see also Skinner,
Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, and Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646. Those cases employed a balancing
test weighing the intrusion on the individual's privacy interest against
the "special needs" that supported the program. The invasion of privacy here is far more substantial than in those cases. In previous
cases, there was no misunderstanding about the purpose of the test or
the potential use of the test results, and there were protections against
the dissemination of the results to third parties. Moreover, those cases
involved disqualification from eligibility for particular benefits, not
the unauthorized dissemination of test results. The critical difference,
however, lies in the nature of the "special need" asserted. In each of
the prior cases, the "special need" was one divorced from the State's
general law enforcement interest. Here, the policy's central and indispensable feature from its inception was the use of law enforcement to
coerce patients into substance abuse treatment. Respondents' assertion that their ultimate purpose--namely, protecting the health of both
mother and child--is a beneficent one is unavailing. While the ultimate
goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question
into substance abuse treatment and off drugs, the immediate objective
of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes
in order to reach that goal. Given that purpose and given the extensive
involvement of law enforcement officials at every stage of the policy,
this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of "special needs." The fact that positive test results were turned over to the

Opinion of the Court
police does not merely provide a basis for distinguishing prior "special
needs" cases. It also provides an affirmative reason for enforcing the
Fourth Amendment's strictures. While state hospital employees, like
other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence of
criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in the course of routine
treatment, when they undertake to obtain such evidence from their

patients for the specific purpose of incriminating those patients, they
have a special obligation to make sure that the patients are fully informed about their constitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver
require. Cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436. Pp. 77-86.

unreasonable search if the patient has not consented to theprocedure. More narrowly, the question is whether the interest in using the threat of criminal sanctions to deter preg-nant women from using cocaine can justify a departure from
the general rule that an official nonconsensual search is un-constitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant.

I
In the fall of 1988, staff members at the public hospitaloperated in the city of Charleston by the Medical University

of South Carolina (MUSC) became concerned about an ap-parent increase in the use of cocaine by patients who were
receiving prenatal treatment.1 In response to this per-ceived increase, as of April 1989, MUSC began to order drug
screens to be performed on urine samples from maternitypatients who were suspected of using cocaine. If a patient
tested positive, she was then referred by MUSC staff to thecounty substance abuse commission for counseling and treatment. However, despite the referrals, the incidence of co-caine use among the patients at MUSC did not appear to
change.Some four months later, Nurse Shirley Brown, the case
manager for the MUSC obstetrics department, heard a newsbroadcast reporting that the police in Greenville, South Carolina, were arresting pregnant users of cocaine on the theorythat such use harmed the fetus and was therefore child
abuse.2 Nurse Brown discussed the story with MUSC'sgeneral counsel, Joseph C. Good, Jr., who then contacted

1 As several witnesses testified at trial, the problem of "crack babies"
was widely perceived in the late 1980's as a national epidemic, prompting
considerable concern both in the medical community and among the general populace.

2 Under South Carolina law, a viable fetus has historically been regarded

as a person; in 1995, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the
ingestion of cocaine during the third trimester of pregnancy constitutes
criminal child neglect. Whitner v. South Carolina, 328 S. C. 1, 492 S. E.

tested positive for drugs at birth.3After receiving Good's letter, Solicitor Condon took the
first steps in developing the policy at issue in this case. Heorganized the initial meetings, decided who would participate, and issued the invitations, in which he described hisplan to prosecute women who tested positive for cocaine
while pregnant. The task force that Condon formed in-cluded representatives of MUSC, the police, the County Substance Abuse Commission and the Department of SocialServices. Their deliberations led to MUSC's adoption of a

be followed when obtaining and testing urine samples, pre-sumably to make sure that the results could be used in subsequent criminal proceedings. The policy also provided foreducation and referral to a substance abuse clinic for patients
who tested positive. Most important, it added the threat oflaw enforcement intervention that "provided the necessary
`leverage' to make the [p]olicy effective." Brief for Re-spondents 8. That threat was, as respondents candidly acknowledge, essential to the program's success in gettingwomen into treatment and keeping them there.

The threat of law enforcement involvement was set forthin two protocols, the first dealing with the identification of
drug use during pregnancy, and the second with identifica-tion of drug use after labor. Under the latter protocol, the
police were to be notified without delay and the patientpromptly arrested. Under the former, after the initial positive drug test, the police were to be notified (and the patientarrested) only if the patient tested positive for cocaine a second time or if she missed an appointment with a substanceabuse counselor.

5 In 1990, however, the policy was modified

at the behest of the solicitor's office to give the patient whotested positive during labor, like the patient who tested positive during a prenatal care visit, an opportunity to avoid ar-rest by consenting to substance abuse treatment.

The last six pages of the policy contained forms for thepatients to sign, as well as procedures for the police to follow
when a patient was arrested. The policy also prescribed indetail the precise offenses with which a woman could be
charged, depending on the stage of her pregnancy. If thepregnancy was 27 weeks or less, the patient was to be
charged with simple possession. If it was 28 weeks or more,she was to be charged with possession and distribution to a
person under the age of 18--in this case, the fetus. If she

5 Despite the conditional description of the first category, when the policy was in its initial stages, a positive test was immediately reported to
the police, who then promptly arrested the patient.

delivered "while testing positive for illegal drugs," she wasalso to be charged with unlawful neglect of a child. App.

to Pet. for Cert. A-62. Under the policy, the police wereinstructed to interrogate the arrestee in order "to ascertain
the identity of the subject who provided illegal drugs to thesuspect." Id., at A-63. Other than the provisions describing the substance abuse treatment to be offered to womenwho tested positive, the policy made no mention of any
change in the prenatal care of such patients, nor did it pre-scribe any special treatment for the newborns.

Petitioners are 10 women who received obstetrical care atMUSC and who were arrested after testing positive for cocaine. Four of them were arrested during the initial imple-mentation of the policy; they were not offered the opportunity to receive drug treatment as an alternative to arrest.The others were arrested after the policy was modified in
1990; they either failed to comply with the terms of the drugtreatment program or tested positive for a second time. Respondents include the city of Charleston, law enforcementofficials who helped develop and enforce the policy, and representatives of MUSC.Petitioners' complaint challenged the validity of the policy
under various theories, including the claim that warrantlessand nonconsensual drug tests conducted for criminal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional searches. Respond-ents advanced two principal defenses to the constitutional
claim: (1) that, as a matter of fact, petitioners had consentedto the searches; and (2) that, as a matter of law, the searches
were reasonable, even absent consent, because they werejustified by special non-law-enforcement purposes. The
District Court rejected the second defense because thesearches in question "were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. [Instead,] the police came inand there was an agreement reached that the positive

screens would be shared with the police." App. 1248-1249.Accordingly, the District Court submitted the factual defense to the jury with instructions that required a verdict infavor of petitioners unless the jury found consent.

6 The jury

found for respondents.Petitioners appealed, arguing that the evidence was not

sufficient to support the jury's consent finding. The Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but withoutreaching the question of consent. 186 F. 3d 469 (1999).

Disagreeing with the District Court, the majority of the ap-pellate panel held that the searches were reasonable as a
matter of law under our line of cases recognizing that "spe-cial needs" may, in certain exceptional circumstances, justify
a search policy designed to serve non-law-enforcement ends.7

6 The instructions read: "THERE WERE NO SEARCH WARRANTS
ISSUED BY A MAGISTRATE OR ANY OTHER PROPER JUDICIAL
OFFICER TO PERMIT THESE URINE SCREENS TO BE TAKEN.
THERE NOT BEING A WARRANT ISSUED, THEY ARE UNREASONABLE AND IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES, UNLESS THE DEFENDANTS HAVE SHOWN
BY THE GREATER WEIGHT OR PREPONDERANCE OF THE
EVIDENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CONSENTED TO THOSE
SEARCHES." App. 1314-1315. Under the judge's instructions, in
order to find that the plaintiffs had consented to the searches, it was necessary for the jury to find that they had consented to the taking of the
samples, to the testing for evidence of cocaine, and to the possible disclosure of the test results to the police. Respondents have not argued, as
Justice Scalia does, that it is permissible for members of the staff of a
public hospital to use diagnostic tests "deceivingly" to obtain incriminating evidence from their patients. See post, at 94 (dissenting opinion).

7 The term "special needs" first appeared in Justice Blackmun's opinion

concurring in the judgment in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 351
(1985). In his concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the Court that
there are limited exceptions to the probable-cause requirement, in which
reasonableness is determined by "a careful balancing of governmental and
private interests," but concluded that such a test should only be applied
"in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs, beyond
the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probablecause requirement impracticable . . . ." Ibid. This Court subsequently

Opinion of the Court
On the understanding "that MUSC personnel conducted theurine drug screens for medical purposes wholly independent

of an intent to aid law enforcement efforts," 8 id., at 477, themajority applied the balancing test used in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656 (1989), and VernoniaSchool Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995), and concluded
that the interest in curtailing the pregnancy complicationsand medical costs associated with maternal cocaine use outweighed what the majority termed a minimal intrusion onthe privacy of the patients. In dissent, Judge Blake concluded that the "special needs" doctrine should not apply and
adopted the "special needs" terminology in O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S.
709, 720 (1987) (plurality opinion), and Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868,
873 (1987), concluding that, in limited circumstances, a search unsupported
by either warrant or probable cause can be constitutional when "special
needs" other than the normal need for law enforcement provide sufficient
justification. See also Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646,
652-653 (1995).

8 The majority stated that the District Court had made such a finding.

186 F. 3d, at 477. The text of the relevant finding, made in the context of
petitioners' now abandoned Title VI claim, reads as follows: "The policy
was applied in all maternity departments at MUSC. Its goal was not
to arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protect both the
mother and unborn child." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38. That finding,
however, must be read in light of this comment by the District Court with
respect to the Fourth Amendment claim:

". . . THESE SEARCHES WERE NOT DONE BY THE MEDICAL
UNIVERSITY FOR INDEPENDENT PURPOSES. IF THEY HAD
BEEN, THEN THEY WOULD NOT IMPLICATE THE FOURTH
AMENDMENT. OBVIOUSLY AS I POINT OUT THERE ON PAGE 4,
NORMALLY URINE SCREENS AND BLOOD TESTS AND THAT
TYPE OF THING CAN BE TAKEN BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS
WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FOURTH AMENDMENT. THE ONLY REASON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IS IMPLICATED HERE IS THAT THE POLICE CAME IN AND THERE
WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED THAT THE POSITIVE
SCREENS WOULD BE SHARED WITH THE POLICE. AND THEN
THE SCREEN IS NOT DONE INDEPENDENT OF POLICE, IT'S
DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLICE AND THAT IMPLICATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT." App. 1248-1249.

76 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Opinion of the Court
that the evidence of consent was insufficient to sustain thejury's verdict. 186 F. 3d, at 487-488.

We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1187 (2000), to review theappellate court's holding on the "special needs" issue. Because we do not reach the question of the sufficiency of theevidence with respect to consent, we necessarily assume for
purposes of our decision--as did the Court of Appeals--thatthe searches were conducted without the informed consent
of the patients. We conclude that the judgment should bereversed and the case remanded for a decision on the consent issue. III

Because MUSC is a state hospital, the members of its staffare government actors, subject to the strictures of the
Fourth Amendment. New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325,335-337 (1985). Moreover, the urine tests conducted by
those staff members were indisputably searches within themeaning of the Fourth Amendment.

Skinner v. RailwayLabor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 617 (1989).

9 Neither

the District Court nor the Court of Appeals concluded thatany of the nine criteria used to identify the women to be

searched provided either probable cause to believe that theywere using cocaine, or even the basis for a reasonable suspicion of such use. Rather, the District Court and the Courtof Appeals viewed the case as one involving MUSC's right

9 In arguing that the urine tests at issue were not searches, the dissent
attempts to disaggregate the taking and testing of the urine sample from
the reporting of the results to the police. See post, at 92. However, in
our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine screens taken by
state agents as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment
even though the results were not reported to the police, see, e. g., Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305 (1997); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,
515 U. S. 646 (1995); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489
U. S. 602, 617 (1989); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656
(1989), and respondents here do not contend that the tests were not
searches. Rather, they argue that the searches were justified by consent
and/or by special needs.

Opinion of the Court
to conduct searches without warrants or probable cause.10
Furthermore, given the posture in which the case comes to
us, we must assume for purposes of our decision that the
tests were performed without the informed consent of the
patients.11

Because the hospital seeks to justify its authority to conduct drug tests and to turn the results over to law enforcement agents without the knowledge or consent of the patients, this case differs from the four previous cases in which
we have considered whether comparable drug tests "fit
within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches." Chandler v. Miller, 520
U. S. 305, 309 (1997). In three of those cases, we sustained
drug tests for railway employees involved in train accidents,
Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602
(1989), for United States Customs Service employees seeking
promotion to certain sensitive positions, Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656 (1989), and for high school
students participating in interscholastic sports, Vernonia
School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995). In the fourth
case, we struck down such testing for candidates for designated state offices as unreasonable. Chandler v. Miller, 520
U. S. 305 (1997).

10 In a footnote to their brief, respondents do argue that the searches
were not entirely suspicionless. Brief for Respondents 23, n. 13. They
do not, however, point to any evidence in the record indicating that any of
the nine search criteria was more apt to be caused by cocaine use than
by some other factor, such as malnutrition, illness, or indigency. More
significantly, their legal argument and the reasoning of the majority panel
opinion rest on the premise that the policy would be valid even if the tests
were conducted randomly.

11 The dissent would have us do otherwise and resolve the issue of consent in favor of respondents. Because the Court of Appeals did not discuss this issue, we think it more prudent to allow that court to resolve the
legal and factual issues in the first instance, and we express no view on
those issues. See, e. g., Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198 (2001); National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999).

78 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Opinion of the Court
In each of those cases, we employed a balancing test thatweighed the intrusion on the individual's interest in privacy

against the "special needs" that supported the program. Asan initial matter, we note that the invasion of privacy in this
case is far more substantial than in those cases. In the pre-vious four cases, there was no misunderstanding about the
purpose of the test or the potential use of the test results,and there were protections against the dissemination of the
results to third parties.12 The use of an adverse test resultto disqualify one from eligibility for a particular benefit, such
as a promotion or an opportunity to participate in an extra-curricular activity, involves a less serious intrusion on privacy than the unauthorized dissemination of such results tothird parties. The reasonable expectation of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in ahospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared
with nonmedical personnel without her consent. See Brieffor American Medical Association as

Amicus Curiae 11;Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as

AmiciCuriae 6, 17-19.
13 In none of our prior cases was there any

intrusion upon that kind of expectation.14

12 Chandler, 520 U. S., at 312, 318; Acton, 515 U. S., at 658; Skinner, 489
U. S., at 621, n. 5, 622, n. 6; Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 663, 666-667, 672, n. 2.

13 There are some circumstances in which state hospital employees, like

other citizens, may have a duty to provide law enforcement officials with
evidence of criminal conduct acquired in the course of routine treatment,
see, e. g., S. C. Code Ann. $ 20-7-510 (2000) (physicians and nurses required
to report to child welfare agency or law enforcement authority "when in
the person's professional capacity the person" receives information that a
child has been abused or neglected). While the existence of such laws
might lead a patient to expect that members of the hospital staff might
turn over evidence acquired in the course of treatment to which the patient had consented, they surely would not lead a patient to anticipate that
hospital staff would intentionally set out to obtain incriminating evidence
from their patients for law enforcement purposes.

14 In fact, we have previously recognized that an intrusion on that expectation may have adverse consequences because it may deter patients from

Opinion of the Court
The critical difference between those four drug-testing
cases and this one, however, lies in the nature of the "special
need" asserted as justification for the warrantless searches.
In each of those earlier cases, the "special need" that was
advanced as a justification for the absence of a warrant or
individualized suspicion was one divorced from the State's
general interest in law enforcement.15 This point was emreceiving needed medical care. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599-600
(1977). Cf. Poland, Dombrowski, Ager, & Sokol, Punishing pregnant drug
users: enhancing the flight from care, 31 Drug and Alcohol Dependence
199-203 (1993).

15 As The Chief Justice recently noted: "The `special needs' doctrine,

which has been used to uphold certain suspicionless searches performed
for reasons unrelated to law enforcement, is an exception to the general
rule that a search must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing." Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 54 (2000) (dissenting opinion); see also nn. 16-17, infra. In T. L. O., we made a point of distinguishing searches "carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their
own authority" from those conducted "in conjunction with or at the behest
of law enforcement agencies." 469 U. S., at 341, n. 7.

The dissent, however, relying on Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868
(1987), argues that the special needs doctrine "is ordinarily employe[d],
precisely to enable searches by law enforcement officials who, of course,
ordinarily have a law enforcement objective." Post, at 100. Viewed in
the context of our special needs case law and even viewed in isolation,
Griffin does not support the proposition for which the dissent invokes it.
In other special needs cases, we have tolerated suspension of the Fourth
Amendment's warrant or probable-cause requirement in part because
there was no law enforcement purpose behind the searches in those cases,
and there was little, if any, entanglement with law enforcement. See
Skinner, 489 U. S., at 620-621; Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 665-666; Acton,
515 U. S., at 658. Moreover, after our decision in Griffin, we reserved the
question whether "routine use in criminal prosecutions of evidence obtained pursuant to the administrative scheme would give rise to an inference of pretext, or otherwise impugn the administrative nature of the . . .
program." Skinner, 489 U. S., at 621, n. 5. In Griffin itself, this Court
noted that "[a]lthough a probation officer is not an impartial magistrate,
neither is he the police officer who normally conducts searches against the
ordinary citizen." 483 U. S., at 876. Finally, we agree with petitioners

80 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Opinion of the Court
phasized both in the majority opinions sustaining the programs in the first three cases,16 as well as in the dissent in
the Chandler case.17 In this case, however, the central and
indispensable feature of the policy from its inception was the
use of law enforcement to coerce the patients into substance
abuse treatment. This fact distinguishes this case from
circumstances in which physicians or psychologists, in the

that Griffin is properly read as limited by the fact that probationers have
a lesser expectation of privacy than the public at large. Id., at 874-875.

16 In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989),

this Court noted that "[t]he FRA has prescribed toxicological tests, not to
assist in the prosecution of employees, but rather `to prevent accidents
and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs.' " Id., at 620-621 (quoting 49 CFR $ 219.1(a)
(1987)). Similarly, in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656
(1989), we concluded that it was "clear that the Customs Service's drugtesting program is not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement. Test results may not be used in a criminal prosecution of the
employee without the employee's consent." Id., at 665-666. In the same
vein, in Acton, 515 U. S., at 658, we relied in part on the fact that "the
results of the tests are disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel
who have a need to know; and they are not turned over to law enforcement
authorities or used for any internal disciplinary function" in finding the
searches reasonable.

17 "Today's opinion speaks of a `closely guarded' class of permissible suspicionless searches which must be justified by a `special need.' But this
term, as used in Skinner and Von Raab and on which the Court now relies,
was used in a quite different sense than it is used by the Court today. In
Skinner and Von Raab it was used to describe a basis for a search apart
from the regular needs of law enforcement, Skinner, [489 U. S.], at 620;
Von Raab, [489 U. S.], at 669. The `special needs' inquiry as delineated
there has not required especially great `importan[ce],' [520 U. S.], at 318,
unless one considers `the supervision of probationers,' or the `operation of
a government office,' Skinner, supra, at 620, to be especially `important.'
Under our precedents, if there was a proper governmental purpose other
than law enforcement, there was a `special need,' and the Fourth Amendment then required the familiar balancing between that interest and the
individual's privacy interest." Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S., at 325
(Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).

course of ordinary medical procedures aimed at helping the
patient herself, come across information that under rules of
law or ethics is subject to reporting requirements, which
no one has challenged here. See, e. g., Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs, American Medical Association, PolicyFinder, Current Opinions E-5.05 (2000) (requiring reporting
where "a patient threatens to inflict serious bodily harm to
another person or to him or herself and there is a reasonable
probability that the patient may carry out the threat"); Ark.
Code Ann. $ 12-12-602 (1999) (requiring reporting of intentionally inflicted knife or gunshot wounds); Ariz. Rev. Stat.
Ann. $ 13-3620 (Supp. 2000) (requiring "any . . . person having responsibility for the care or treatment of children" to
report suspected abuse or neglect to a peace officer or child
protection agency).18

Respondents argue in essence that their ultimate purpose--namely, protecting the health of both mother and
child--is a beneficent one. In Chandler, however, we did
not simply accept the State's invocation of a "special need."
Instead, we carried out a "close review" of the scheme at
issue before concluding that the need in question was not
"special," as that term has been defined in our cases. 520
U. S., at 322. In this case, a review of the M-7 policy plainly
reveals that the purpose actually served by the MUSC
searches "is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control." Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S.
32, 44 (2000).

In looking to the programmatic purpose, we consider all
the available evidence in order to determine the relevant
primary purpose. See, e. g., id., at 45-47. In this case, as

18 Our emphasis on this distinction should make it clear that, contrary to
the hyperbole in the dissent, we do not view these reporting requirements
as "clearly bad." See post, at 95-96, n. 3. Those requirements are simply not in issue here.

82 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Opinion of the Court
Judge Blake put it in her dissent below, "it . . . is clear

from the record that an initial and continuing focus of the
policy was on the arrest and prosecution of drug-abusing

mothers . . . ." 186 F. 3d, at 484. Tellingly, the document
codifying the policy incorporates the police's operational
guidelines. It devotes its attention to the chain of custody,
the range of possible criminal charges, and the logistics of
police notification and arrests. Nowhere, however, does the
document discuss different courses of medical treatment for
either mother or infant, aside from treatment for the mother's addiction.

Moreover, throughout the development and application of
the policy, the Charleston prosecutors and police were extensively involved in the day-to-day administration of the policy.
Police and prosecutors decided who would receive the reports of positive drug screens and what information would
be included with those reports. App. 78-80, 145-146, 1058-
1060. Law enforcement officials also helped determine the
procedures to be followed when performing the screens.19
Id., at 1052-1053. See also id., at 26-27, 945. In the course
of the policy's administration, they had access to Nurse
Brown's medical files on the women who tested positive, routinely attended the substance abuse team's meetings, and
regularly received copies of team documents discussing the
women's progress. Id., at 122-124, 609-610. Police took
pains to coordinate the timing and circumstances of the arrests with MUSC staff, and, in particular, Nurse Brown.
Id., at 1057-1058.

While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been
to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment

19 Accordingly, the police organized a meeting with the staff of the police
and hospital laboratory staffs, as well as Nurse Brown, in which the police
went over the concept of a chain of custody system with the MUSC staff.
App. 1052-1053.

Opinion of the Court
and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searcheswas to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes

20

in order to reach that goal.21 The threat of law enforcement

20 We italicize those words lest our reasoning be misunderstood. See
post, at 86-88 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In none of our
previous special needs cases have we upheld the collection of evidence for
criminal law enforcement purposes. Our essential point is the same as
Justice Kennedy's--the extensive entanglement of law enforcement
cannot be justified by reference to legitimate needs.

According to the dissent, the fact that MUSC performed tests prior to
the development of Policy M-7 should immunize any subsequent testing

policy despite the presence of a law enforcement purpose and extensive
law enforcement involvement. See post, at 98-100. To say that any therapeutic purpose did not disappear is simply to miss the point. What matters is that under the new policy developed by the solicitor's office and
MUSC, law enforcement involvement was the means by which that therapeutic purpose was to be met. Policy M-7 was, at its core, predicated on
the use of law enforcement. The extensive involvement of law enforcement and the threat of prosecution were, as respondents admitted, essential to the program's success.

21 Accordingly, this case differs from New York v. Burger, 482 U. S. 691

(1987), in which the Court upheld a scheme in which police officers were
used to carry out administrative inspections of vehicle dismantling businesses. That case involved an industry in which the expectation of privacy in commercial premises was "particularly attenuated" given the extent to which the industry in question was closely regulated. Id., at 700.
More important for our purposes, the Court relied on the "plain administrative purposes" of the scheme to reject the contention that the statute
was in fact "designed to gather evidence to enable convictions under the
penal laws . . . ." Id., at 715. The discovery of evidence of other violations would have been merely incidental to the purposes of the administrative search. In contrast, in this case, the policy was specifically designed
to gather evidence of violations of penal laws.

This case also differs from the handful of seizure cases in which we have
applied a balancing test to determine Fourth Amendment reasonableness.
See, e. g., Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 455 (1990);
United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 (1976). First, those cases
involved roadblock seizures, rather than "the intrusive search of the body
or the home." See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S., at 54-55 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S., at 561 ("[W]e deal

Opinion of the Court
may ultimately have been intended as a means to an end, but
the direct and primary purpose of MUSC's policy was to ensure the use of those means. In our opinion, this distinction
is critical. Because law enforcement involvement always
serves some broader social purpose or objective, under respondents' view, virtually any nonconsensual suspicionless
search could be immunized under the special needs doctrine
by defining the search solely in terms of its ultimate, rather
than immediate, purpose.22 Such an approach is inconsistent
with the Fourth Amendment. Given the primary purpose
of the Charleston program, which was to use the threat of
arrest and prosecution in order to force women into treatment, and given the extensive involvement of law enforcement officials at every stage of the policy, this case simply
does not fit within the closely guarded category of "special
needs." 23

The fact that positive test results were turned over to the
police does not merely provide a basis for distinguishing our
prior cases applying the "special needs" balancing approach
to the determination of drug use. It also provides an affirmative reason for enforcing the strictures of the Fourth
Amendment. While state hospital employees, like other citizens, may have a duty to provide the police with evidence

neither with searches nor with the sanctity of private dwellings, ordinarily
afforded the most stringent Fourth Amendment protection"). Second,
the Court explicitly distinguished the cases dealing with checkpoints from
those dealing with "special needs." Sitz, 496 U. S., at 450.

22 Thus, under respondents' approach, any search to generate evidence

for use by the police in enforcing general criminal laws would be justified
by reference to the broad social benefits that those laws might bring about
(or, put another way, the social harms that they might prevent).

23 It is especially difficult to argue that the program here was designed

simply to save lives. Amici claim a near consensus in the medical community that programs of the sort at issue, by discouraging women who use
drugs from seeking prenatal care, harm, rather than advance, the cause of
prenatal health. See Brief for American Medical Association as Amicus
Curiae 6-22; Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici
Curiae 17-21; Brief for NARAL Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae 18-19.

of criminal conduct that they inadvertently acquire in thecourse of routine treatment, when they undertake to obtain

such evidence from their patients for the specific purpose ofincriminating those patients, they have a special obligation
to make sure that the patients are fully informed about theirconstitutional rights, as standards of knowing waiver require.24 Cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).As respondents have repeatedly insisted, their motive was
benign rather than punitive. Such a motive, however, can-not justify a departure from Fourth Amendment protections,
given the pervasive involvement of law enforcement with thedevelopment and application of the MUSC policy. The stark

24 In fact, some MUSC staff made this distinction themselves. See Pl.
Exh. No. 14, Hulsey, 11-17-89, Coke Committee, 1-2 ("The use of medically
indicated tests for substance abuse, obtained in conventional manners,
must be distinguished from mandatory screening and collection of evidence using such methods as chain of custody, etc. . . . The question is
raised as to whether pediatricians should function as law enforcement officials. While the reporting of criminal activity to appropriate authorities
may be required and/or ethically just, the active pursuit of evidence to be
used against individuals presenting for medical care may not be proper").

The dissent, however, mischaracterizes our opinion as holding that "material which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else cannot be given
by that person to the police, and used for whatever evidence it may contain." Post, at 95. But, as we have noted elsewhere, given the posture
of the case, we must assume for purposes of decision that the patients did
not consent to the searches, and we leave the question of consent for the
Court of Appeals to determine. See n. 11, supra.

The dissent further argues that our holding "leaves law enforcement
officials entirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence obtained from `trusted' sources." See post, at 95. With all due
respect, we disagree. We do not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements. Rather, as we point
out above, in this case, medical personnel used the criteria set out in n. 4,
supra, to collect evidence for law enforcement purposes, and law enforcement officers were extensively involved in the initiation, design, and implementation of the program. In such circumstances, the Fourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and
suspicionless searches applies in the absence of consent. We decline to
accept the dissent's invitation to make a foray into dicta and address other
situations not before us.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
and unique fact that characterizes this case is that PolicyM-7 was designed to obtain evidence of criminal conduct by

the tested patients that would be turned over to the policeand that could be admissible in subsequent criminal prosecutions. While respondents are correct that drug abuse bothwas and is a serious problem, "the gravity of the threat alone
cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what meanslaw enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose." Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S., at 42-43. TheFourth Amendment's general prohibition against nonconsensual, warrantless, and suspicionless searches necessarily ap-plies to such a policy. See,

e. g., Chandler, 520 U. S., at 308;Skinner, 489 U. S., at 619.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
I agree that the search procedure in issue cannot be sus-tained under the Fourth Amendment. My reasons for this

conclusion differ somewhat from those set forth by theCourt, however, leading to this separate opinion.

I
The Court does not dispute that the search policy at somelevel serves special needs, beyond those of ordinary law enforcement, such as the need to protect the health of motherand child when a pregnant mother uses cocaine. Instead,
the majority characterizes these special needs as the "ulti-mate goal[s]" of the policy, as distinguished from the policy's
"immediate purpose," the collection of evidence of drug use,which, the Court reasons, is the appropriate inquiry for the
special needs analysis. Ante, at 81-84.The majority views its distinction between the ultimate
goal and immediate purpose of the policy as critical to its

87Cite as: 532 U. S. 67 (2001)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
analysis. Ante, at 83-84. The distinction the Court makes,however, lacks foundation in our special needs cases. All of

our special needs cases have turned upon what the majorityterms the policy's ultimate goal. For example, in

Skinner
v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989),had we employed the majority's distinction, we would have

identified as the relevant need the collection of evidence of
drug and alcohol use by railway employees. Instead, weidentified the relevant need as "[t]he Government's interest

in regulating the conduct of railroad employees to ensure[railroad] safety."

Id., at 620. In Treasury Employees v.
Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656 (1989), the majority's distinction
should have compelled us to isolate the relevant need as the
gathering of evidence of drug abuse by would-be drug interdiction officers. Instead, the special needs the Court identified were the necessities "to deter drug use among those
eligible for promotion to sensitive positions within the
[United States Customs] Service and to prevent the promotion of drug users to those positions." Id., at 666. In Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995), the
majority's distinction would have required us to identify the
immediate purpose of gathering evidence of drug use by
student-athletes as the relevant "need" for purposes of the
special needs analysis. Instead, we sustained the policy as
furthering what today's majority would have termed the policy's ultimate goal: "[d]eterring drug use by our Nation's
schoolchildren," and particularly by student-athletes, because "the risk of immediate physical harm to the drug user
or those with whom he is playing his sport is particularly
high." Id., at 661-662.

It is unsurprising that in our prior cases we have concentrated on what the majority terms a policy's ultimate goal,
rather than its proximate purpose. By very definition, in
almost every case the immediate purpose of a search policy
will be to obtain evidence. The circumstance that a particular search, like all searches, is designed to collect evidence

88 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
of some sort reveals nothing about the need it serves. Put adifferent way, although procuring evidence is the immediate

result of a successful search, until today that procurementhas not been identified as the special need which justifies
the search. II

While the majority's reasoning seems incorrect in the re-spects just discussed, I agree with the Court that the search
policy cannot be sustained. As the majority demonstratesand well explains, there was substantial law enforcement
involvement in the policy from its inception. None of ourspecial needs precedents has sanctioned the routine inclusion
of law enforcement, both in the design of the policy and inusing arrests, either threatened or real, to implement the
system designed for the special needs objectives. The spe-cial needs cases we have decided do not sustain the active
use of law enforcement, including arrest and prosecutions,as an integral part of a program which seeks to achieve
legitimate, civil objectives. The traditional warrant andprobable-cause requirements are waived in our previous
cases on the explicit assumption that the evidence obtainedin the search is not intended to be used for law enforcement
purposes. Most of those tested for drug use under the pol-icy at issue here were not brought into direct contact with
law enforcement. This does not change the fact, however,that, as a systemic matter, law enforcement was a part of
the implementation of the search policy in each of its applica-tions. Every individual who tested positive was given a letter explaining the policy not from the hospital but from thesolicitor's office. Everyone who tested positive was told a
second positive test or failure to undergo substance abusetreatment would result in arrest and prosecution. As the
Court holds, the hospital acted, in some respects, as an insti-tutional arm of law enforcement for purposes of the policy.
Under these circumstances, while the policy may well haveserved legitimate needs unrelated to law enforcement, it had

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
as well a penal character with a far greater connection to lawenforcement than other searches sustained under our special

needs rationale.In my view, it is necessary and prudent to be explicit in
explaining the limitations of today's decision. The begin-ning point ought to be to acknowledge the legitimacy of the
State's interest in fetal life and of the grave risk to the life
and health of the fetus, and later the child, caused by cocaineingestion. Infants whose mothers abuse cocaine during

pregnancy are born with a wide variety of physical and neu-rological abnormalities. See Chiriboga, Brust, Bateman, &
Hauser, Dose-Response Effect of Fetal Cocaine Exposure
on Newborn Neurologic Function, 103 Pediatrics 79 (1999)
(finding that, compared with unexposed infants, cocaineexposed infants experienced higher rates of intrauterine
growth retardation, smaller head circumference, global hypertonia, coarse tremor, and extensor leg posture). Prenatal exposure to cocaine can also result in developmental problems which persist long after birth. See Arendt,
Angelopoulos, Salvator, & Singer, Motor Development of
Cocaine-exposed Children at Age Two Years, 103 Pediatrics
86 (1999) (concluding that, at two years of age, children who
were exposed to cocaine in utero exhibited significantly less
fine and gross motor development than those not so exposed);
Chasnoff et al., Prenatal Exposure to Cocaine and Other
Drugs: Outcome at Four to Six Years, 846 Annals of the New
York Academy of Sciences 314, 319-320 (J. Harvey and B.
Kosofsky eds. 1998) (finding that 4- to 6-year-olds who were
exposed to cocaine in utero exhibit higher instances of depression, anxiety, social, thought, and attention problems,
and delinquent and aggressive behaviors than their unexposed counterparts). There can be no doubt that a mother's
ingesting this drug can cause tragic injury to a fetus and a
child. There should be no doubt that South Carolina can
impose punishment upon an expectant mother who has so
little regard for her own unborn that she risks causing him

or her lifelong damage and suffering. The State, by takingspecial measures to give rehabilitation and training to expectant mothers with this tragic addiction or weakness, actswell within its powers and its civic obligations.

The holding of the Court, furthermore, does not call intoquestion the validity of mandatory reporting laws such as
child abuse laws which require teachers to report evidenceof child abuse to the proper authorities, even if arrest and
prosecution is the likely result. That in turn highlights thereal difficulty. As this case comes to us, and as reputable
sources confirm, see K. Farkas, Training Health Care andHuman Services Personnel in Perinatal Substance Abuse, in
Drug & Alcohol Abuse Reviews, Substance Abuse DuringPregnancy and Childhood 13, 27-28 (R. Watson ed. 1995);
U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration, Pregnant,
Substance-Using Women 48 (1993), we must accept thepremise that the medical profession can adopt acceptable criteria for testing expectant mothers for cocaine use in orderto provide prompt and effective counseling to the mother
and to take proper medical steps to protect the child. Ifprosecuting authorities then adopt legitimate procedures to
discover this information and prosecution follows, that oughtnot to invalidate the testing. One of the ironies of the case,
then, may be that the program now under review, whichgives the cocaine user a second and third chance, might be
replaced by some more rigorous system. We must, how-ever, take the case as it comes to us; and the use of handcuffs,
arrests, prosecutions, and police assistance in designing andimplementing the testing and rehabilitation policy cannot be
sustained under our previous cases concerning mandatorytesting.

III
An essential, distinguishing feature of the special needscases is that the person searched has consented, though the

usual voluntariness analysis is altered because adverse con532US1 Unit: $U34 [09-05-02 19:02:31] PAGES PGT: OPLG

sequences (e. g., dismissal from employment or disqualifica-tion from playing on a high school sports team) will follow

from refusal. The person searched has given consent, as de-fined to take into account that the consent was not voluntary
in the full sense of the word. See Skinner, 489 U. S., at 615;
Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 660-661; Acton, 515 U. S., at 650-651.
The consent, and the circumstances in which it was given,
bear upon the reasonableness of the whole special needsprogram.

Here, on the other hand, the question of consent, even withthe special connotation used in the special needs cases, has
yet to be decided. Indeed, the Court finds it necessary totake the unreal step of assuming there was no voluntary consent at all. Thus, we have erected a strange world for deciding the case.

My discussion has endeavored to address the permissibility of a law enforcement purpose in this artificial context.
The role played by consent might have affected our assessment of the issues. My concurrence in the judgment, furthermore, should not be interpreted as having considered or
resolved the important questions raised by Justice Scalia
with reference to whether limits might be imposed on the
use of the evidence if in fact it were obtained with the patient's consent and in the context of the special needs program. Had we the prerogative to discuss the role played by
consent, the case might have been quite a different one. All
are in agreement, of course, that the Court of Appeals will
address these issues in further proceedings on remand.

With these remarks, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join as to Part II, dissenting.

There is always an unappealing aspect to the use of doctors and nurses, ministers of mercy, to obtain incriminating
evidence against the supposed objects of their ministration--
although here, it is correctly pointed out, the doctors and

Scalia, J., dissenting
nurses were ministering not just to the mothers but also tothe children whom their cooperation with the police was

meant to protect. But whatever may be the correct socialjudgment concerning the desirability of what occurred here,
that is not the issue in the present case. The Constitutiondoes not resolve all difficult social questions, but leaves the
vast majority of them to resolution by debate and the demo-cratic process--which would produce a decision by the citizens of Charleston, through their elected representatives, toforbid or permit the police action at issue here. The question before us is a narrower one: whether, whatever thedesirability of this police conduct, it violates the Fourth
Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and sei-zures. In my view, it plainly does not.

I
The first step in Fourth Amendment analysis is to identifythe search or seizure at issue. What petitioners, the Court,

and to a lesser extent the concurrence really object to isnot the urine testing, but the hospital's reporting of positive
drug-test results to police. But the latter is obviously not asearch. At most it may be a "derivative use of the product
of a past unlawful search," which, of course, "work[s] no newFourth Amendment wrong" and "presents a question, not of
rights, but of remedies." United States v. Calandra, 414U. S. 338, 354 (1974). There is only one act that could conceivably be regarded as a search of petitioners in the presentcase: the taking of the urine sample. I suppose the testing
of that urine for traces of unlawful drugs could be considereda search of sorts, but the Fourth Amendment protects only
against searches of citizens' "persons, houses, papers, and ef-fects"; and it is entirely unrealistic to regard urine as one of
the "effects" (i. e., part of the property) of the person whohas passed and abandoned it. Cf. California v. Greenwood,
486 U. S. 35 (1988) (garbage left at curb is not property pro-tected by the Fourth Amendment). Some would argue,

93Cite as: 532 U. S. 67 (2001)
Scalia, J., dissenting
I suppose, that testing of the urine is prohibited by some
generalized privacy right "emanating" from the "penumbras" of the Constitution (a question that is not before us);
but it is not even arguable that the testing of urine that has
been lawfully obtained is a Fourth Amendment search. (I
may add that, even if it were, the factors legitimizing the
taking of the sample, which I discuss below, would likewise
legitimize the testing of it.)

It is rudimentary Fourth Amendment law that a search
which has been consented to is not unreasonable. There is
no contention in the present case that the urine samples
were extracted forcibly. The only conceivable bases for saying that they were obtained without consent are the contentions (1) that the consent was coerced by the patients' need
for medical treatment, (2) that the consent was uninformed
because the patients were not told that the tests would include testing for drugs, and (3) that the consent was uninformed because the patients were not told that the results
of the tests would be provided to the police.1 (When the
court below said that it was reserving the factual issue of
consent, see 186 F. 3d 469, 476 (CA4 1999), it was referring
at most to these three--and perhaps just to the last two.)

1 The Court asserts that it is improper to "disaggregate the taking and
testing of the urine sample from the reporting of the results to the police,"
because "in our special needs cases, we have routinely treated urine
screens taken by state agents as searches within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment." Ante, at 76, n. 9. But in all of those cases, the
urine was obtained involuntarily. See Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305
(1997); Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995); Skinner
v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989); Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656 (1989). Where the taking of the urine
sample is unconsented (and thus a Fourth Amendment search), the subsequent testing and reporting of the results to the police are obviously part
of (or infected by) the same search; but where, as here, the taking of the
sample was not a Fourth Amendment search, it is necessary to consider
separately whether the testing and reporting were.

94 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Scalia, J., dissenting
Under our established Fourth Amendment law, the lasttwo contentions would not suffice, even without reference to

the special-needs doctrine. The Court's analogizing of thiscase to

Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and its
claim that "standards of knowing waiver" apply, ante, at 85,are flatly contradicted by our jurisprudence, which shows

that using lawfully (but deceivingly) obtained material for
purposes other than those represented, and giving that ma-terial or information derived from it to the police, is not

unconstitutional. In Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293(1966), "[t]he argument [was] that [the informant's] failure to
disclose his role as a government informant vitiated the consent that the petitioner gave" for the agent's access to evidence of criminal wrongdoing, id., at 300. We rejected that
argument, because "the Fourth Amendment [does not protect] a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom
he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it."
Id., at 302. Because the defendant had voluntarily provided
access to the evidence, there was no reasonable expectation
of privacy to invade. Abuse of trust is surely a sneaky and
ungentlemanly thing, and perhaps there should be (as there
are) laws against such conduct by the government. See,
e. g., 50 U. S. C. $ 403-7 (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (prohibiting the
"Intelligence Community['s]" use of journalists as agents).
That, however, is immaterial for Fourth Amendment purposes, for "however strongly a defendant may trust an apparent colleague, his expectations in this respect are not protected by the Fourth Amendment when it turns out that the
colleague is a government agent regularly communicating
with the authorities." United States v. White, 401 U. S. 745,
749 (1971) (emphasis added). The Hoffa line of cases, I may
note, does not distinguish between operations meant to catch
a criminal in the act, and those meant only to gather evidence of prior wrongdoing. See, e. g., United States v.
Miller, 425 U. S. 435, 440-443 (1976); cf. Illinois v. Perkins,
496 U. S. 292, 298 (1990) (relying on Hoffa in holding the

Miranda rule did not require suppression of an inmate con-fession given an agent posing as a fellow prisoner).

Until today, we have never held--or even suggested--thatmaterial which a person voluntarily entrusts to someone else
cannot be given by that person to the police, and used forwhatever evidence it may contain.

2 Without so much as discussing the point, the Court today opens a hole in our FourthAmendment jurisprudence, the size and shape of which is

entirely indeterminate. Today's holding would be remark-able enough if the confidential relationship violated by the
police conduct were at least one protected by state law. Itwould be surprising to learn, for example, that in a State
which recognizes a spousal evidentiary privilege the policecannot use evidence obtained from a cooperating husband or
wife. But today's holding goes even beyond that, sincethere does not exist any physician-patient privilege in South
Carolina. See, e. g., Peagler v. Atlantic Coast R. R. Co., 232S. C. 274, 101 S. E. 2d 821 (1958). Since the Court declines
even to discuss the issue, it leaves law enforcement officialsentirely in the dark as to when they can use incriminating
evidence obtained from "trusted" sources.3 Presumably the

2 Hoffa did say that the Fourth Amendment can be violated by "guileful
as well as by forcible intrusions into a constitutionally protected area."
385 U. S., at 301. The case it cited for that proposition, however, shows
what it meant: Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298 (1921), found a
Fourth Amendment violation where a Government agent who had obtained access to the defendant's office on pretext of a social visit carried
away private papers. "Guile" (rather than force) had been used to go
beyond the scope of the consented access to evidence. Whereas the search
in Gouled was invalidated, the search was approved in Lewis v. United
States, 385 U. S. 206 (1966), where an equally guileful agent stayed within
the bounds of the access to defendant's home, carrying away only a package of drugs that had been voluntarily provided.

3 The Court contends that its opinion does not leave law enforcement

officials in the dark as to when they can use incriminating evidence from
trusted sources, since it "do[es] not address a case in which doctors independently complied with reporting requirements," ante, at 85, n. 24. I
find it hard to understand how not addressing that point fails to leave

lines will be drawn in the case-by-case development of awhole new branch of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, taking yet another social judgment (which confidential relation-ships ought not be invaded by the police) out of democratic
control, and confiding it to the uncontrolled judgment of thisCourt--uncontrolled because there is no common-law precedent to guide it. I would adhere to our established law,which says that information obtained through violation of a
relationship of trust is obtained consensually, and is hencenot a search.

it enshrouded in darkness--unless the Court means that such reporting
requirements are clearly bad. (If voluntary betrayal of a trust in mere
cooperation with the police constitutes a Fourth Amendment search,
surely betrayal of a trust at the direction of the legislature must be.) But
in any event, reporting requirements are an infinitesimal part of the problem. What about a doctor's--or a spouse's--voluntary provision of information to the police, without the compulsion of a statute?

4 The Court contends that I am "mischaracteriz[ing]" its opinion, since

the Court is merely "assum[ing] for purposes of decision that the patients
did not consent to the searches, and [leaves] the question of consent for
the Court of Appeals to determine." Ibid. That is not responsive. The
"question of consent" that the Court leaves open is whether the patients
consented, not merely to the taking of the urine samples, but to the drug
testing in particular, and to the provision of the results to the police.
Consent to the taking of the samples alone--or even to the taking of the
samples plus the drug testing--does not suffice. The Court's contention
that the question of the sufficiency of that more limited consent is not
before us because respondents did not raise it, see ante, at 74, n. 6, is
simply mistaken. Part II of respondents' brief, entitled "The Petitioners
consented to the searches," argues that "Petitioners . . . freely and voluntarily . . . provided the urine samples"; that "each of the Petitioners signed
a consent to treatment form which authorized the MUSC medical staff to
conduct all necessary tests of those urine samples--including drug tests";
and that "[t]here is no precedent in this Court's Fourth Amendment search
and seizure jurisprudence which imposes any . . . requirement that the
searching agency inform the consenting party that the results of the
search will be turned over to law enforcement." Brief for Respondents
38-39. The brief specifically takes issue with the District Court's charge
to the jury--which the Court chooses to accept as an unexaminable
"given," see ante, at 74, n. 6--that "the Respondents were required to

Scalia, J., dissenting
There remains to be considered the first possible basis for
invalidating this search, which is that the patients were coerced to produce their urine samples by their necessitous
circumstances, to wit, their need for medical treatment of
their pregnancy. If that was coercion, it was not coercion
applied by the government--and if such nongovernmental
coercion sufficed, the police would never be permitted to use
the ballistic evidence obtained from treatment of a patient
with a bullet wound. And the Fourth Amendment would
invalidate those many state laws that require physicians to
report gunshot wounds,5 evidence of spousal abuse,6 and (like
the South Carolina law relevant here, see S. C. Code Ann.

$ 20-7-510 (2000)) evidence of child abuse.7

show that the Petitioners consented to MUSC disclosing the information
to law enforcement." Brief for Respondents 39.

In sum, I think it clear that the Court's disposition requires the holding
that violation of a relationship of trust constitutes a search. The opinion
itself implies that in its description of the issue left for the Court of Appeals on remand, see ante, at 77, n. 11: whether "the tests were performed
without the informed consent of the patients," ante, at 77 (emphasis
added)--informed, that is, that the urine would be tested for drugs and
that the results would be given to the police. I am happy, of course, to
accept the Court's illogical assurance that it intends no such holding, and
urge the Court of Appeals on remand to do the same.

7 The Court contends that I "would have us . . . resolve the issue of

consent in favor of respondents," whereas the Court's opinion "more prudent[ly] allow[s] [the Court of Appeals] to resolve the legal and factual
issues in the first instance, and . . . express[es] no view on those issues."
Ante, at 77, n. 11. That is not entirely so. The Court does not resolve
the factual issue whether there was consent to the drug testing and to

resolve the legal issue whether that consent was necessary, see ante, at
77, 84-85, and n. 24; and so do I. Since the Court concludes it was necessary, the factual inquiry is left for the Fourth Circuit on remand. Since I
conclude it was not necessary (and since no one contends that the taking

I think it clear, therefore, that there is no basis for sayingthat obtaining of the urine sample was unconstitutional.

The special-needs doctrine is thus quite irrelevant, since itoperates only to validate searches and seizures that are otherwise unlawful. In the ensuing discussion, however, I shallassume (contrary to legal precedent) that the taking of the
urine sample was (either because of the patients' necessitouscircumstances, or because of failure to disclose that the urine
would be tested for drugs, or because of failure to disclosethat the results of the test would be given to the police)
coerced. Indeed, I shall even assume (contrary to commonsense) that the testing of the urine constituted an unconsented search of the patients' effects. On those assump-tions, the special-needs doctrine would become relevant; and,
properly applied, would validate what was done here.The conclusion of the Court that the special-needs doctrine
is inapplicable rests upon its contention that respondents"undert[ook] to obtain [drug] evidence from their patients"
not for any medical purpose, but "for the specific purposeof incriminating those patients." Ante, at 85 (emphasis in
original). In other words, the purported medical rationalewas merely a pretext; there was no special need. See

Skin-ner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 621,

n. 5 (1989). This contention contradicts the District Court'sfinding of fact that the goal of the testing policy "was not to
arrest patients but to facilitate their treatment and protectboth the mother and unborn child." App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-38.8 This finding is binding upon us unless clearly erroof the urine sample was unconsented), there is on my analysis no factual
consent issue remaining.

8 The Court believes that this finding "must be read in light of" the

District Court's comment that " `these searches were not done by the medical university for independent purposes. . . . [T]he police came in and
there was an agreement reached that the positive screens would be shared
with the police. And then the screen is not done independent of police,

neous, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a). Not only do I find itsupportable; I think any other finding would have to be

overturned.The cocaine tests started in April 1989, neither at police
suggestion nor with police involvement. Expectant moth-ers who tested positive were referred by hospital staff
for substance-abuse treatment, ante, at 70 (opinion of theCourt)--an obvious health benefit to both mother and child.
See App. 43 (testimony that a single use of cocaine can causefetal damage). And, since "[i]nfants whose mothers abuse
cocaine during pregnancy are born with a wide variety ofphysical and neurological abnormalities,"

ante, at 89 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), which require medical at-tention, see Brief in Opposition A76-A77, the tests were of

additional medical benefit in predicting needed postnataltreatment for the child. Thus, in their origin--before the
police were in any way involved--the tests had an immedi-ate, not merely an "ultimate,"

ante, at 82 (opinion of theCourt), purpose of improving maternal and infant health.

Several months after the testing had been initiated, a nursediscovered that local police were arresting pregnant users of
cocaine for child abuse, the hospital's general counsel wrotethe county solicitor to ask "what, if anything, our Medical
Center needs to do to assist you in this matter," App. 499(South Carolina law requires child abuse to be reported, see
S. C. Code Ann. $ 20-7-510), the police suggested ways toavoid tainting evidence, and the hospital and police in conjunction used the testing program as a means of securingwhat the Court calls the "ultimate" health benefit of coercing
drug-abusing mothers into drug treatment. See ante, at 70-73, 82. Why would there be any reason to believe that, once

it's done in conjunction with the police and that implicates the Fourth
Amendment.' " Ante, at 75, n. 8, quoting App. 1247-1249. But all this
shows is that the explicit finding of medical purpose was not a finding of
exclusive medical purpose. As discussed later in text, the special-needs
doctrine contains no such exclusivity requirement.

532US1 Unit: $U34 [09-05-02 19:02:31] PAGES PGT: OPLG
100 FERGUSON v. CHARLESTON

Scalia, J., dissenting
this policy of using the drug tests for their "ultimate" health
benefits had been adopted, use of them for their original,
immediate, benefits somehow disappeared, and testing somehow became in its entirety nothing more than a "pretext"
for obtaining grounds for arrest? On the face of it, this
is incredible. The only evidence of the exclusively arrestrelated purpose of the testing adduced by the Court is that
the police-cooperation policy itself does not describe how to
care for cocaine-exposed infants. See ante, at 73, 82. But
of course it does not, since that policy, adopted months after
the cocaine testing was initiated, had as its only health object
the "ultimate" goal of inducing drug treatment through
threat of arrest. Does the Court really believe (or even
hope) that, once invalidation of the program challenged here
has been decreed, drug testing will cease?

In sum, there can be no basis for the Court's purported
ability to "distinguis[h] this case from circumstances in which
physicians or psychologists, in the course of ordinary medical
procedures aimed at helping the patient herself, come across
information that . . . is subject to reporting requirements,"
ante, at 80-81, unless it is this: That the addition of a lawenforcement-related purpose to a legitimate medical purpose
destroys applicability of the "special-needs" doctrine. But
that is quite impossible, since the special-needs doctrine was
developed, and is ordinarily employed, precisely to enable
searches by law enforcement officials who, of course, ordinarily have a law enforcement objective. Thus, in Griffin v.
Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868 (1987), a probation officer received
a tip from a detective that petitioner, a felon on probation,
possessed a firearm. Accompanied by police, he conducted
a warrantless search of petitioner's home. The weapon was
found and used as evidence in the probationer's trial for
unlawful possession of a firearm. See id., at 870-872. Affirming denial of a motion to suppress, we concluded that the
"special need" of assuring compliance with terms of release

532US1 Unit: $U34 [09-05-02 19:02:31] PAGES PGT: OPLG

101Cite as: 532 U. S. 67 (2001)
Scalia, J., dissenting
justified a warrantless search of petitioner's home. Notably,we observed that a probation officer is not

"the police officer who normally conducts searchesagainst the ordinary citizen. He is an employee of the
State Department of Health and Social Services who,while assuredly charged with protecting the public interest, is also supposed to have in mind the welfare ofthe probationer . . . . In such a setting, we think it
reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement."
Id., at 876-877.

Like the probation officer, the doctors here do not "ordinarilyconduc[t] searches against the ordinary citizen," and they are

"supposed to have in mind the welfare of the [mother andchild]." That they have in mind in addition the provision of
evidence to the police should make no difference. The Courtsuggests that if police involvement in this case was in some
way incidental and after-the-fact, that would make a differ-ence in the outcome. See

ante, at 80-84. But in Griffin,
even more than here, police were involved in the search fromthe very beginning; indeed, the initial tip about the gun came

from a detective. Under the factors relied upon by the
Court, the use of evidence approved in Griffin would havebeen permitted only if the parole officer had been untrained

in chain-of-custody procedures, had not known of the possi-bility a gun was present, and had been unaccompanied by
police when he simply happened upon the weapon. Whyany or all of these is constitutionally significant is baffling.

Petitioners seek to distinguish Griffin by observing thatprobationers enjoy a lesser expectation of privacy than does
the general public. That is irrelevant to the point I make
here, which is that the presence of a law enforcement purpose does not render the special-needs doctrine inapplicable.
In any event, I doubt whether Griffin's reasonable expectation of privacy in his home was any less than petitioners' reasonable expectation of privacy in their urine taken,

Scalia, J., dissenting
or in the urine tests performed, in a hospital--especiallyin a State such as South Carolina, which recognizes no

physician-patient testimonial privilege and requires the phy-sician's duty of confidentiality to yield to public policy, see
McCormick v. England, 328 S. C. 627, 633, 640-642, 494 S. E.2d 431, 434, 438-439 (App. 1997); and which requires medical conditions that indicate a violation of the law to be reported to authorities, see, e. g., S. C. Code Ann. $ 20-7-510(2000) (child abuse). Cf.

Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597-
598 (1977) (privacy interest does not forbid government torequire hospitals to provide, for law enforcement purposes,

names of patients receiving prescriptions of frequently
abused drugs).

The concurrence makes essentially the same basic error as
the Court, though it puts the point somewhat differently:
"The special needs cases we have decided," it says, "do not
sustain the active use of law enforcement . . . as an integral
part of a program which seeks to achieve legitimate, civil
objectives." Ante, at 88. Griffin shows that is not true.
Indeed, Griffin shows that there is not even any truth in
the more limited proposition that our cases do not support
application of the special-needs exception where the "legitimate, civil objectives" are sought only through the use of
law enforcement means. (Surely the parole officer in Griffin
was using threat of reincarceration to assure compliance
with parole.) But even if this latter proposition were true, it
would invalidate what occurred here only if the drug testing
sought exclusively the "ultimate" health benefits achieved by
coercing the mothers into drug treatment through threat of
prosecution. But in fact the drug testing sought, independently of law enforcement involvement, the "immediate"
health benefits of identifying drug-impaired mother and child
for necessary medical treatment. The concurrence concedes
that if the testing is conducted for medical reasons, the fact
that "prosecuting authorities then adopt legitimate procedures to discover this information and prosecution follows

Scalia, J., dissenting
. . . ought not to invalidate the testing." Ante, at 90 (empha-sis added). But here the police involvement in each case did

take place after the testing was conducted for independ-ent reasons. Surely the concurrence cannot mean that no
police-suggested procedures (such as preserving the chain ofcustody of the urine sample) can be applied until after the
testing; or that the police-suggested procedures must havebeen

designed after the testing. The facts in Griffin (andcommon sense) show that this cannot be so. It seems to me

that the only real distinction between what the concurrencemust reasonably be thought to be approving, and what we
have here, is that here the police took the lesser step of ini-tially threatening prosecution rather than bringing it.

* * *
As I indicated at the outset, it is not the function of thisCourt--at least not in Fourth Amendment cases--to weigh

petitioners' privacy interest against the State's interest inmeeting the crisis of "crack babies" that developed in the
late 1980's. I cannot refrain from observing, however, thatthe outcome of a wise weighing of those interests is by no
means clear. The initial goal of the doctors and nurses whoconducted cocaine testing in this case was to refer pregnant
drug addicts to treatment centers, and to prepare for neces-sary treatment of their possibly affected children. When
the doctors and nurses agreed to the program providing testresults to the police, they did so because (in addition to the
fact that child abuse was required by law to be reported)they wanted to use the sanction of arrest as a strong incentive for their addicted patients to undertake drug-addictiontreatment. And the police themselves used it for that benign purpose, as is shown by the fact that only 30 of 253women testing positive for cocaine were ever arrested, and
only 2 of those prosecuted. See App. 1125-1126. It wouldnot be unreasonable to conclude that today's judgment,
authorizing the assessment of damages against the county

solicitor and individual doctors and nurses who participatedin the program, proves once again that no good deed goes

unpunished.But as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned: There
was no unconsented search in this case. And if there was,it would have been validated by the special-needs doctrine.
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

105OCTOBER TERM, 2000
Syllabus

CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-1379. Argued November 6, 2000--Decided March 21, 2001
A provision in respondent's application for work at petitioner electronics

retailer required all employment disputes to be settled by arbitration.
After he was hired, respondent filed a state-law employment discrimination action against petitioner, which then sued in federal court to enjoin
the state-court action and to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA). The District Court entered the requested
order. The Ninth Circuit reversed, interpreting $ 1 of the FAA--which
excludes from that Act's coverage "contracts of employment of seamen,
railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or
interstate commerce"--to exempt all employment contracts from the
FAA's reach.

Held: The $ 1 exemption is confined to transportation workers.

Pp. 111-124.

(a) The FAA's coverage provision, $ 2, compels judicial enforcement
of arbitration agreements "in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction
involving commerce." In Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513
U. S. 265, the Court interpreted $ 2's "involving commerce" phrase as
implementing Congress' intent "to exercise [its] commerce power to the
full." Id., at 277. Pp. 111-113.

(b) The Court rejects respondent's contention that the word "transaction" in $ 2 extends only to commercial contracts, and that therefore an
employment contract is not a "contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce" at all. If that were true, the separate $ 1
exemption that is here at issue would be pointless. See, e. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 562. Accordingly, any argument that arbitration agreements in employment
contracts are not covered by the FAA must be premised on the language
of the $ 1 exclusion itself. Pp. 113-114.

(c) The statutory text forecloses the construction that $ 1 excludes
all employment contracts from the FAA. Respondent relies on AlliedBruce's expansive reading of "involving commerce" to contend that $ 1's
"engaged in . . . commerce" language should have a like reach, exempting from the FAA all employment contracts falling within Congress'
commerce power. This reading of $ 1 runs into the insurmountable tex532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
106 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS

Syllabus
tual obstacle that, unlike $ 2's "involving commerce" language, the $ 1
words "any other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce" constitute
a residual phrase, following, in the same sentence, explicit reference to
"seamen" and "railroad employees." The wording thus calls for application of the maxim ejusdem generis, under which the residual clause
should be read to give effect to the terms "seamen" and "railroad employees," and should be controlled and defined by reference to those
terms. See, e. g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499
U. S. 117, 129. Application of ejusdem generis is also in full accord with
other sound considerations bearing upon the proper interpretation of
the clause. In prior cases, the Court has read "engaged in commerce"
as a term of art, indicating a limited assertion of federal jurisdiction.
See, e. g., United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries,
422 U. S. 271, 279-280. The Court is not persuaded by the assertion
that its $ 1 interpretation should be guided by the fact that, when Congress adopted the FAA, the phrase "engaged in commerce" came close
to expressing the outer limits of its Commerce Clause power as then
understood, see, e. g., The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463,
498. This fact alone does not provide any basis to adopt, "by judicial
decision, rather than amendatory legislation," Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp
Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186, 202, an expansive construction of the FAA's
exclusion provision that goes beyond the meaning of the words Congress
used. While it is possible that Congress might have chosen a different
jurisdictional formulation had it known that the Court later would embrace a less restrictive reading of the Commerce Clause, $ 1's text precludes interpreting the exclusion provision to defeat the language of $ 2
as to all employment contracts. The statutory context in which the
"engaged in commerce" language is found, i. e., in a residual provision,
and the FAA's purpose of overcoming judicial hostility to arbitration
further compel that the $ 1 exclusion be afforded a narrow construction.
The better reading of $ 1, in accord with the prevailing view in the
Courts of Appeals, is that $ 1 exempts from the FAA only employment
contracts of transportation workers. Pp. 114-119.

(d) As the Court's conclusion is directed by $ 1's text, the rather
sparse legislative history of the exclusion provision need not be assessed. The Court rejects respondent's argument that the Court's
holding attributes an irrational intent to Congress by excluding from
the FAA's coverage those employment contracts that most involve interstate commerce, i. e., those of transportation workers, while including
employment contracts having a lesser connection to commerce. It is a
permissible inference that the former contracts were excluded because
Congress had already enacted, or soon would enact, statutes governing

Syllabus
transportation workers' employment relationships and did not wish to
unsettle established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes
covering those workers. As for the residual exclusion of "any other
class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce," it would
be rational for Congress to ensure that workers in general would be
covered by the FAA, while reserving for itself more specific legislation
for transportation workers. Pp. 119-121.

(e) Amici argue that, under the Court's reading, the FAA in effect
pre-empts state employment laws restricting the use of arbitration
agreements. That criticism is not properly directed at today's holding,
but at Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, holding that Congress
intended the FAA to apply in state courts, and to pre-empt state antiarbitration laws to the contrary. The Court explicitly declined to overrule Southland in Allied-Bruce, supra, at 272, and Congress has not
moved to overturn Southland in response to Allied-Bruce. Nor is
Southland directly implicated in this case, which concerns the application of the FAA in a federal, rather than in a state, court. The Court
should not chip away at Southland by indirection. Furthermore, there
are real benefits to arbitration in the employment context, including
avoidance of litigation costs compounded by difficult choice-of-law questions and by the necessity of bifurcating the proceedings where state
law precludes arbitration of certain types of employment claims but not
others. Adoption of respondent's position would call into doubt the efficacy of many employers' alternative dispute resolution procedures, in
the process undermining the FAA's proarbitration purposes and breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it. Allied-Bruce, supra,
at 275. Pp. 121-124.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) ex-cludes from the Act's coverage "contracts of employment of

seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workersengaged in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. $ 1.
All but one of the Courts of Appeals which have addressedthe issue interpret this provision as exempting contracts of
employment of transportation workers, but not other em-ployment contracts, from the FAA's coverage. A different
interpretation has been adopted by the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit, which construes the exemption so that

all contracts of employment are beyond the FAA's reach,whether or not the worker is engaged in transportation.
It applied that rule to the instant case. We now decide thatthe better interpretation is to construe the statute, as most
of the Courts of Appeals have done, to confine the exemptionto transportation workers.

claims under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act,Cal. Govt. Code Ann. $ 12900 et seq. (West 1992 and Supp.

of respondent's claims pursuant to the FAA, 9 U. S. C. $$ 1-16. The District Court entered the requested order. Respondent, the court concluded, was obligated by the arbitra-tion agreement to submit his claims against the employer to
binding arbitration. An appeal followed.While respondent's appeal was pending in the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court ruled on the keyissue in an unrelated case. The court held the FAA does
not apply to contracts of employment. See Craft v. Campbell Soup Co., 177 F. 3d 1083 (1999). In the instant case,following the rule announced in Craft, the Court of Appeals

held the arbitration agreement between Adams and CircuitCity was contained in a "contract of employment," and so
was not subject to the FAA. 194 F. 3d 1070 (1999). CircuitCity petitioned this Court, noting that the Ninth Circuit's

Congress enacted the FAA in 1925. As the Court has ex-plained, the FAA was a response to hostility of American

courts to the enforcement of arbitration agreements, a judi-cial disposition inherited from then-longstanding English
practice. See, e. g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,513 U. S. 265, 270-271 (1995);

Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson
Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 24 (1991). To give effect to thispurpose, the FAA compels judicial enforcement of a wide

range of written arbitration agreements. The FAA's cover-age provision, $ 2, provides that

"[a] written provision in any maritime transaction or acontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to
settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out
of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform
the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall
be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such

grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocationof any contract." 9 U. S. C. $ 2.

We had occasion in Allied-Bruce, supra, at 273-277, toconsider the significance of Congress' use of the words "involving commerce" in $ 2. The analysis began with a reaf-firmation of earlier decisions concluding that the FAA was
enacted pursuant to Congress' substantive power to regulateinterstate commerce and admiralty, see Prima Paint Corp.
v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 405 (1967), andthat the Act was applicable in state courts and pre-emptive
of state laws hostile to arbitration, see Southland Corp. v.
Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984). Relying upon these backgroundprinciples and upon the evident reach of the words "involving commerce," the Court interpreted $ 2 as implementingCongress' intent "to exercise [its] commerce power to the
full." Allied-Bruce, supra, at 277.The instant case, of course, involves not the basic coverage
authorization under $ 2 of the Act, but the exemption fromcoverage under $ 1. The exemption clause provides the Act
shall not apply "to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged
in foreign or interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. $ 1. MostCourts of Appeals conclude the exclusion provision is limited
to transportation workers, defined, for instance, as thoseworkers " `actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.' " Cole, supra, at 1471. As we statedat the outset, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
takes a different view and interprets the $ 1 exception toexclude all contracts of employment from the reach of the
FAA. This comprehensive exemption had been advocatedby

amici curiae in Gilmer, where we addressed the ques-tion whether a registered securities representative's employment discrimination claim under the Age Discriminationin Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29
U. S. C. $ 621 et seq., could be submitted to arbitration pursu-ant to an agreement in his securities registration application.

Opinion of the Court
Concluding that the application was not a "contract of em-ployment" at all, we found it unnecessary to reach the meaning of $ 1. See Gilmer, supra, at 25, n. 2. There is no suchdispute in this case; while Circuit City argued in its petition for certiorari that the employment application signedby Adams was not a "contract of employment," we declined
to grant certiorari on this point. So the issue reserved in
Gilmer is presented here. B

Respondent, at the outset, contends that we need not ad-dress the meaning of the $ 1 exclusion provision to decide the
case in his favor. In his view, an employment contract isnot a "contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate
commerce" at all, since the word "transaction" in $ 2 extendsonly to commercial contracts. See Craft, 177 F. 3d, at 1085
(concluding that $ 2 covers only "commercial deal[s] or mer-chant's sale[s]"). This line of reasoning proves too much, for
it would make the $ 1 exclusion provision superfluous. If allcontracts of employment are beyond the scope of the Act
under the $ 2 coverage provision, the separate exemption for"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or
any other class of workers engaged in . . . interstate com-merce" would be pointless. See, e. g., Pennsylvania Dept.
of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 562 (1990)("Our cases express a deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisionsin the same enactment"). The proffered interpretation of
"evidencing a transaction involving commerce," furthermore,would be inconsistent with

Gilmer v. Interstate/JohnsonLane Corp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), where we held that $ 2 required the arbitration of an age discrimination claim basedon an agreement in a securities registration application, a
dispute that did not arise from a "commercial deal or mer-chant's sale." Nor could respondent's construction of $ 2
be reconciled with the expansive reading of those wordsadopted in

Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 277, 279-280. If, then,

532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
114 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS

Opinion of the Court
there is an argument to be made that arbitration agreementsin employment contracts are not covered by the Act, it must

be premised on the language of the $ 1 exclusion provisionitself.

Respondent, endorsing the reasoning of the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit that the provision excludes all
employment contracts, relies on the asserted breadth of the
words "contracts of employment of . . . any other class ofworkers engaged in . . . commerce." Referring to our construction of $ 2's coverage provision in Allied-Bruce--con-cluding that the words "involving commerce" evidence the
congressional intent to regulate to the full extent of its
commerce power--respondent contends $ 1's interpretation
should have a like reach, thus exempting all employment contracts. The two provisions, it is argued, are coterminous;
under this view the "involving commerce" provision brings
within the FAA's scope all contracts within the Congress'
commerce power, and the "engaged in . . . commerce" language in $ 1 in turn exempts from the FAA all employment
contracts falling within that authority.

This reading of $ 1, however, runs into an immediate and,
in our view, insurmountable textual obstacle. Unlike the
"involving commerce" language in $ 2, the words "any other
class of workers engaged in . . . commerce" constitute a residual phrase, following, in the same sentence, explicit reference
to "seamen" and "railroad employees." Construing the residual phrase to exclude all employment contracts fails to
give independent effect to the statute's enumeration of the
specific categories of workers which precedes it; there would
be no need for Congress to use the phrases "seamen" and
"railroad employees" if those same classes of workers were
subsumed within the meaning of the "engaged in . . . commerce" residual clause. The wording of $ 1 calls for the
application of the maxim ejusdem generis, the statutory
canon that "[w]here general words follow specific words in a
statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to

532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enu-merated by the preceding specific words." 2A N. Singer,

Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction $ 47.17(1991); see also

Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991). Under this rule of construc-tion the residual clause should be read to give effect to the

terms "seamen" and "railroad employees," and should itself
be controlled and defined by reference to the enumeratedcategories of workers which are recited just before it; the

interpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails toproduce these results.

Canons of construction need not be conclusive and are
often countered, of course, by some maxim pointing in a different direction. The application of the rule ejusdem generis in this case, however, is in full accord with other sound
considerations bearing upon the proper interpretation of the
clause. For even if the term "engaged in commerce" stood
alone in $ 1, we would not construe the provision to exclude
all contracts of employment from the FAA. Congress uses
different modifiers to the word "commerce" in the design and
enactment of its statutes. The phrase "affecting commerce"
indicates Congress' intent to regulate to the outer limits
of its authority under the Commerce Clause. See, e. g.,
Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 277. The "involving commerce"
phrase, the operative words for the reach of the basic coverage provision in $ 2, was at issue in Allied-Bruce. That particular phrase had not been interpreted before by this Court.
Considering the usual meaning of the word "involving," and
the pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA, Allied-Bruce held
the "word `involving,' like `affecting,' signals an intent to
exercise Congress' commerce power to the full." Ibid. Unlike those phrases, however, the general words "in commerce" and the specific phrase "engaged in commerce" are
understood to have a more limited reach. In Allied-Bruce
itself the Court said the words "in commerce" are "oftenfound words of art" that we have not read as expressing

116 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS

Opinion of the Court
congressional intent to regulate to the outer limits of author-ity under the Commerce Clause.

Id., at 273; see also United
States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422U. S. 271, 279-280 (1975) (phrase "engaged in commerce" is

"a term of art, indicating a limited assertion of federal juris-diction");

Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000)
(phrase "used in commerce" "is most sensibly read to mean
active employment for commercial purposes, and not merelya passive, passing, or past connection to commerce").

It is argued that we should assess the meaning of thephrase "engaged in commerce" in a different manner here,
because the FAA was enacted when congressional authority
to regulate under the commerce power was to a large extent
confined by our decisions. See United States v. Lopez, 514
U. S. 549, 556 (1995) (noting that Supreme Court decisions
beginning in 1937 "ushered in an era of Commerce Clause
jurisprudence that greatly expanded the previously defined
authority of Congress under that Clause"). When the FAA
was enacted in 1925, respondent reasons, the phrase "engaged in commerce" was not a term of art indicating a limited assertion of congressional jurisdiction; to the contrary,
it is said, the formulation came close to expressing the outer
limits of Congress' power as then understood. See, e. g., The
Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 498 (1908) (holding unconstitutional jurisdictional provision in Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA) covering the employees of
"every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce"); Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 48-49 (1912);
but cf. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Behrens, 233 U. S. 473 (1914)
(noting in dicta that the amended FELA's application to common carriers "while engaging in commerce" did not reach
all employment relationships within Congress' commerce
power). Were this mode of interpretation to prevail, we
would take into account the scope of the Commerce Clause,
as then elaborated by the Court, at the date of the FAA's
enactment in order to interpret what the statute means now.

Opinion of the Court
A variable standard for interpreting common, jurisdic-tional phrases would contradict our earlier cases and bring

instability to statutory interpretation. The Court has de-clined in past cases to afford significance, in construing the
meaning of the statutory jurisdictional provisions "in com-merce" and "engaged in commerce," to the circumstance that
the statute predated shifts in the Court's Commerce Clause
cases. In FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U. S. 349 (1941),the Court rejected the contention that the phrase "in commerce" in $ 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat.719, 15 U. S. C. $ 45, a provision enacted by Congress in 1914,
should be read in as expansive a manner as "affecting commerce." See Bunte Bros., supra, at 350-351. We entertained a similar argument in a pair of cases decided in the
1974 Term concerning the meaning of the phrase "engaged
in commerce" in $ 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15
U. S. C. $ 18, another 1914 congressional enactment. See
American Building Maintenance, supra, at 277-283; Gulf
Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U. S. 186, 199-202 (1974).
We held that the phrase "engaged in commerce" in $ 7
"means engaged in the flow of interstate commerce, and was
not intended to reach all corporations engaged in activities
subject to the federal commerce power." American Building Maintenance, supra, at 283; cf. Gulf Oil, supra, at 202
(expressing doubt as to whether an "argument from the history and practical purposes of the Clayton Act" could justify
"radical expansion of the Clayton Act's scope beyond that
which the statutory language defines").

The Court's reluctance to accept contentions that Congress
used the words "in commerce" or "engaged in commerce" to
regulate to the full extent of its commerce power rests on
sound foundation, as it affords objective and consistent significance to the meaning of the words Congress uses when it
defines the reach of a statute. To say that the statutory
words "engaged in commerce" are subject to variable interpretations depending upon the date of adoption, even a date

118 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS

Opinion of the Court
before the phrase became a term of art, ignores the reasonwhy the formulation became a term of art in the first place:

The plain meaning of the words "engaged in commerce" isnarrower than the more open-ended formulations "affecting
commerce" and "involving commerce." See, e. g., Gulf Oil,
supra, at 195 (phrase "engaged in commerce" "appears to
denote only persons or activities within the flow of interstate
commerce"). It would be unwieldy for Congress, for theCourt, and for litigants to be required to deconstruct statutory Commerce Clause phrases depending upon the year ofa particular statutory enactment.

In rejecting the contention that the meaning of the phrase
"engaged in commerce" in $ 1 of the FAA should be given a
broader construction than justified by its evident language
simply because it was enacted in 1925 rather than 1938, we
do not mean to suggest that statutory jurisdictional formulations "necessarily have a uniform meaning whenever used
by Congress." American Building Maintenance Industries, supra, at 277. As the Court has noted: "The judicial
task in marking out the extent to which Congress has exercised its constitutional power over commerce is not that of
devising an abstract formula." A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v.
Walling, 316 U. S. 517, 520 (1942). We must, of course, construe the "engaged in commerce" language in the FAA with
reference to the statutory context in which it is found and
in a manner consistent with the FAA's purpose. These considerations, however, further compel that the $ 1 exclusion
provision be afforded a narrow construction. As discussed
above, the location of the phrase "any other class of workers
engaged in . . . commerce" in a residual provision, after
specific categories of workers have been enumerated, undermines any attempt to give the provision a sweeping, openended construction. And the fact that the provision is contained in a statute that "seeks broadly to overcome judicial
hostility to arbitration agreements," Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S.,
at 272-273, which the Court concluded in Allied-Bruce coun532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

119Cite as: 532 U. S. 105 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
seled in favor of an expansive reading of $ 2, gives no reasonto abandon the precise reading of a provision that exempts

contracts from the FAA's coverage.In sum, the text of the FAA forecloses the construction of

$ 1 followed by the Court of Appeals in the case under re-view, a construction which would exclude all employment
contracts from the FAA. While the historical argumentsrespecting Congress' understanding of its power in 1925 are
not insubstantial, this fact alone does not give us basis toadopt, "by judicial decision rather than amendatory legislation," Gulf Oil, supra, at 202, an expansive construction ofthe FAA's exclusion provision that goes beyond the meaning
of the words Congress used. While it is of course possibleto speculate that Congress might have chosen a different jurisdictional formulation had it known that the Court wouldsoon embrace a less restrictive reading of the Commerce
Clause, the text of $ 1 precludes interpreting the exclusionprovision to defeat the language of $ 2 as to all employment
contracts. Section 1 exempts from the FAA only contractsof employment of transportation workers.

C
As the conclusion we reach today is directed by the text of$ 1, we need not assess the legislative history of the exclusion

provision. See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 147-148 (1994) ("[W]e do not resort to legislative history to cloud
a statutory text that is clear"). We do note, however, thatthe legislative record on the $ 1 exemption is quite sparse.
Respondent points to no language in either Committee Re-port addressing the meaning of the provision, nor to any
mention of the $ 1 exclusion during debate on the FAA onthe floor of the House or Senate. Instead, respondent places
greatest reliance upon testimony before a Senate subcommit-tee hearing suggesting that the exception may have been
added in response to the objections of the president of theInternational Seamen's Union of America. See Hearing on

Opinion of the Court
S. 4213 and S. 4214 before a Subcommittee of the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9 (1923).

Legislative history is problematic even when the attempt isto draw inferences from the intent of duly appointed committees of the Congress. It becomes far more so when we con-sult sources still more steps removed from the full Congress
and speculate upon the significance of the fact that a certain
interest group sponsored or opposed particular legislation.Cf.

Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 51, n. 13 (1986) ("[N]one
of those statements was made by a Member of Congress, norwere they included in the official Senate and House Reports.

We decline to accord any significance to these statements").
We ought not attribute to Congress an official purpose based
on the motives of a particular group that lobbied for or
against a certain proposal--even assuming the precise intent
of the group can be determined, a point doubtful both as a
general rule and in the instant case. It is for the Congress,
not the courts, to consult political forces and then decide how
best to resolve conflicts in the course of writing the objective
embodiments of law we know as statutes.

Nor can we accept respondent's argument that our holding
attributes an irrational intent to Congress. "Under petitioner's reading of $ 1," he contends, "those employment contracts most involving interstate commerce, and thus most
assuredly within the Commerce Clause power in 1925 . . . are
excluded from [the] Act's coverage; while those employment
contracts having a less direct and less certain connection to
interstate commerce . . . would come within the Act's affirmative coverage and would not be excluded." Brief for
Respondent 38 (emphases in original).

We see no paradox in the congressional decision to exempt
the workers over whom the commerce power was most apparent. To the contrary, it is a permissible inference that
the employment contracts of the classes of workers in $ 1
were excluded from the FAA precisely because of Congress'
undoubted authority to govern the employment relationships

Opinion of the Court
at issue by the enactment of statutes specific to them. Bythe time the FAA was passed, Congress had already enacted

federal legislation providing for the arbitration of disputesbetween seamen and their employers, see Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872, 17 Stat. 262. When the FAA wasadopted, moreover, grievance procedures existed for railroad
employees under federal law, see Transportation Act of 1920,$$ 300-316, 41 Stat. 456, and the passage of a more comprehensive statute providing for the mediation and arbitrationof railroad labor disputes was imminent, see Railway Labor
Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, 46 U. S. C. $ 651 (repealed). Itis reasonable to assume that Congress excluded "seamen"
and "railroad employees" from the FAA for the simple rea-son that it did not wish to unsettle established or developing statutory dispute resolution schemes covering specificworkers.

As for the residual exclusion of "any other class of workersengaged in foreign or interstate commerce," Congress' demonstrated concern with transportation workers and theirnecessary role in the free flow of goods explains the linkage
to the two specific, enumerated types of workers identifiedin the preceding portion of the sentence. It would be rational for Congress to ensure that workers in general wouldbe covered by the provisions of the FAA, while reserving for
itself more specific legislation for those engaged in transpor-tation. See Pryner v. Tractor Supply Co., 109 F. 3d, at 358
(Posner, C. J.). Indeed, such legislation was soon to follow,with the amendment of the Railway Labor Act in 1936 to
include air carriers and their employees, see 49 Stat. 1189,45 U. S. C. $$ 181-188.

Various amici, including the attorneys general of 21States, object that the reading of the $ 1 exclusion provision

adopted today intrudes upon the policies of the separateStates. They point out that, by requiring arbitration agreements in most employment contracts to be covered by the

532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
122 CIRCUIT CITY STORES, INC. v. ADAMS

Opinion of the Court
FAA, the statute in effect pre-empts those state employmentlaws which restrict or limit the ability of employees and employers to enter into arbitration agreements. It is arguedthat States should be permitted, pursuant to their traditional
role in regulating employment relationships, to prohibit em-ployees like respondent from contracting away their right to
pursue state-law discrimination claims in court.

It is not our holding today which is the proper target ofthis criticism. The line of argument is relevant instead to

the Court's decision in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S.1 (1984), holding that Congress intended the FAA to apply
in state courts, and to pre-empt state antiarbitration laws to
the contrary. See id., at 16.

The question of Southland's continuing vitality was given
explicit consideration in Allied-Bruce, and the Court declined to overrule it. 513 U. S., at 272; see also id., at 282
(O'Connor, J., concurring). The decision, furthermore, is
not directly implicated in this case, which concerns the application of the FAA in a federal, rather than in a state, court.
The Court should not chip away at Southland by indirection,
especially by the adoption of the variable statutory interpretation theory advanced by the respondent in the instant case.
Not all of the Justices who join today's holding agreed with
Allied-Bruce, see 513 U. S., at 284 (Scalia, J., dissenting);
id., at 285 (Thomas, J., dissenting), but it would be incongruous to adopt, as we did in Allied-Bruce, a conventional reading of the FAA's coverage in $ 2 in order to implement proarbitration policies and an unconventional reading of the
reach of $ 1 in order to undo the same coverage. In AlliedBruce the Court noted that Congress had not moved to overturn Southland, see 513 U. S., at 272; and we now note that
it has not done so in response to Allied-Bruce itself.

Furthermore, for parties to employment contracts not
involving the specific exempted categories set forth in $ 1, it
is true here, just as it was for the parties to the contract
at issue in Allied-Bruce, that there are real benefits to the

Opinion of the Court
enforcement of arbitration provisions. We have been clearin rejecting the supposition that the advantages of the arbitration process somehow disappear when transferred tothe employment context. See

Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 30-32.
Arbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the costs oflitigation, a benefit that may be of particular importance

in employment litigation, which often involves smaller sums
of money than disputes concerning commercial contracts.These litigation costs to parties (and the accompanying burden to the courts) would be compounded by the difficultchoice-of-law questions that are often presented in disputes
arising from the employment relationship, cf. Egelhoff v.
Egelhoff, post, at 149 (noting possible "choice-of-law problems" presented by state laws affecting administration of
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 plans),
and the necessity of bifurcation of proceedings in those cases
where state law precludes arbitration of certain types of
employment claims but not others. The considerable complexity and uncertainty that the construction of $ 1 urged
by respondent would introduce into the enforceability of
arbitration agreements in employment contracts would call
into doubt the efficacy of alternative dispute resolution procedures adopted by many of the Nation's employers, in the
process undermining the FAA's proarbitration purposes and
"breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it."
Allied-Bruce, supra, at 275. The Court has been quite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can be enforced
under the FAA without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protection
against discrimination prohibited by federal law; as we noted
in Gilmer, " `[b]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a
party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the
statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,
rather than a judicial, forum.' " 500 U. S., at 26 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473
U. S. 614, 628 (1985)). Gilmer, of course, involved a federal

statute, while the argument here is that a state statute oughtnot be denied state judicial enforcement while awaiting the

outcome of arbitration. That matter, though, was addressedin Southland and Allied-Bruce, and we do not revisit the
question here. * * *

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Courtof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, and with whom Justice Souter joinsas to Parts II and III, dissenting.

Justice Souter has cogently explained why the Court'sparsimonious construction of $ 1 of the Federal Arbitration
Act (FAA or Act) is not consistent with its expansive readingof $ 2. I join his dissent, but believe that the Court's heavy
reliance on the views expressed by the Courts of Appealsduring the past decade makes it appropriate to comment
on three earlier chapters in the history of this venerablestatute.

I
Section 2 of the FAA makes enforceable written agree-ments to arbitrate "in any maritime transaction or a contract

evidencing a transaction involving commerce." 9 U. S. C.$ 2. If we were writing on a clean slate, there would be
good reason to conclude that neither the phrase "maritimetransaction" nor the phrase "contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce" was intended to encompass em-ployment contracts.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The history of the Act, which is extensive and well docu-mented, makes clear that the FAA was a response to the

refusal of courts to enforce commercial arbitration agree-ments, which were commonly used in the maritime context.
The original bill was drafted by the Committee on Com-merce, Trade, and Commercial Law of the American Bar Association (ABA) upon consideration of "the further extensionof the principle of

commercial arbitration." Report of theForty-third Annual Meeting of the ABA, 45 A. B. A. Rep. 75

(1920) (emphasis added). As drafted, the bill was under-stood by Members of Congress to "simply provid[e] for one
thing, and that is to give an opportunity to enforce an agree-ment in commercial contracts and admiralty contracts."
65 Cong. Rec. 1931 (1924) (remarks of Rep. Graham) (empha-sis added).

2 It is no surprise, then, that when the legislation

the FAA evinces Congress' intent to exercise its full Commerce Clause
power, id., at 277, the case did not involve a contract of employment, nor
did it consider whether such contracts fall within either category of $ 2's
coverage provision, however broadly construed, in light of the legislative
history detailed infra this page and 126-127.

2 Consistent with this understanding, Rep. Mills, who introduced the

original bill in the House, explained that it "provides that where there are
commercial contracts and there is disagreement under the contract, the
court can [en]force an arbitration agreement in the same way as other
portions of the contract." 65 Cong. Rec., at 11080 (emphasis added).

was first introduced in 1922,3 it did not mention employmentcontracts, but did contain a rather precise definition of the

term "maritime transactions" that underscored the commercial character of the proposed bill.4 Indeed, neither the history of the drafting of the original bill by the ABA, nor the
records of the deliberations in Congress during the years
preceding the ultimate enactment of the Act in 1925, contain
any evidence that the proponents of the legislation intended
it to apply to agreements affecting employment.

Nevertheless, the original bill was opposed by representatives of organized labor, most notably the president of the
International Seamen's Union of America,5 because of their

4th Sess. (1922) (H. R. 13522). See 64 Cong. Rec. 732, 797 (1922).

4 "[M]aritime transactions" was defined as "charter parties, bills of lading of water carriers, agreements relating to wharfage, supplies furnished
vessels or repairs to vessels, seamen's wages, collisions, or any other matters in foreign or interstate commerce which, if the subject of controversy,
would be embraced within admiralty jurisdiction." S. 4214, $ 1; H. R.
13522, $ 1. Although there was no illustrative definition of "contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce," the draft defined "commerce"
as "commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in any
Territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between
any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory and any
State or foreign nation, or between the District of Columbia and any State
or Territory or foreign nation." S. 4214, $ 1; H. R. 13522, $ 1. Considered
together, these definitions embrace maritime and nonmaritime commercial
transactions, and with one possible exception do not remotely suggest coverage of employment contracts. That exception, "seamen's wages," was
eliminated by the time the bill was reintroduced in the next session of
Congress, when the exclusions in $ 1 were added. See Joint Hearings on
S. 1005 and H. R. 646 before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the
Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924) (Joint Hearings); see also infra,

so with sundry other workers in `Interstate and Foreign Commerce.' "

That amendment is what the Court construes today. His-tory amply supports the proposition that it was an uncontroversial provision that merely confirmed the fact that no oneinterested in the enactment of the FAA ever intended or
expected that $ 2 would apply to employment contracts. Itis particularly ironic, therefore, that the amendment has provided the Court with its sole justification for refusing to givethe text of $ 2 a natural reading. Playing ostrich to the
substantial history behind the amendment, see ante, at 119("[W]e need not assess the legislative history of the exclusion
provision"), the Court reasons in a vacuum that "[i]f all contracts of employment are beyond the scope of the Act underthe $ 2 coverage provision, the separate exemption" in $ 1

"would be pointless," ante, at 113. But contrary to theCourt's suggestion, it is not "pointless" to adopt a clarifying
amendment in order to eliminate opposition to a bill. More-over, the majority's reasoning is squarely contradicted by
the Court's approach in Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of
America, 350 U. S. 198, 200, 201, n. 3 (1956), where the Court
concluded that an employment contract did not "evidence `a
transaction involving commerce' within the meaning of $ 2 ofthe Act," and therefore did not "reach the further question

whether in any event petitioner would be included in `anyother class of workers' within the exceptions of $ 1 of the
Act."The irony of the Court's reading of $ 2 to include contracts
of employment is compounded by its cramped interpretationof the exclusion inserted into $ 1. As proposed and enacted,
the exclusion fully responded to the concerns of the Seamen'sUnion and other labor organizations that $ 2 might encomherein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employes or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.' This exempted labor from the provisions of the law,
although its sponsors denied there was any intention to include labor disputes." Proceedings of the Forty-fifth Annual Convention of the American Federation of Labor 52 (1925).

pass employment contracts by expressly exempting the laboragreements not only of "seamen" and "railroad employees,"

but also of "any other class of workers engaged in foreignor interstate commerce." 9 U. S. C. $ 1 (emphasis added).
Today, however, the Court fulfills the original--and origi-nally unfounded--fears of organized labor by essentially rewriting the text of $ 1 to exclude the employment contracts
solely of "seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of
[transportation] workers engaged in foreign or interstate
commerce." See ante, at 119. In contrast, whether oneviews the legislation before or after the amendment to $ 1, it

is clear that it was not intended to apply to employment contracts at all.

II

A quarter century after the FAA was passed, many
Courts of Appeals were presented with the question whether
collective-bargaining agreements were "contracts of employment" for purposes of $ 1's exclusion. The courts split over
that question, with at least the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits answering in the affirmative,9 and the First and Sixth
Circuits answering in the negative.10 Most of these cases
neither involved employees engaged in transportation nor
turned on whether the workers were so occupied. Indeed,
the general assumption seemed to be, as the Sixth Circuit
stated early on, that $ 1 "was deliberately worded by the
Congress to exclude from the [FAA] all contracts of employ9 Lincoln Mills of Ala. v. Textile Workers, 230 F. 2d 81, 86 (CA5 1956),

Coach Employees v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., 192 F. 2d 310,

ment of workers engaged in interstate commerce." GatliffCoal Co. v. Cox, 142 F. 2d 876, 882 (1944).

The contrary view that the Court endorses today--namely,that only employees engaged in interstate transportation are
excluded by $ 1--was not expressed until 1954, by the ThirdCircuit in Tenney Engineering, Inc. v. Electrical Workers,
207 F. 2d 450, 452 (1953). And that decision, significantly,was rejected shortly thereafter by the Fourth Circuit. See
Electrical Workers v. Miller Metal Products, Inc., 215 F. 2d221, 224 (1954). The conflict among the Circuits that persisted in the 1950's thus suggests that it may be inappropri-ate to attach as much weight to recent Court of Appeals
opinions as the Court does in this case. See ante, at 109,110-111, 112.

Even more important than the 1950's conflict, however, isthe way in which this Court tried to resolve the debate. In
Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448 (1957),the Court granted certiorari to consider the union's claim
that, in a suit brought under $ 301 of the Labor ManagementRelations Act, 1947 (LMRA), a federal court may enforce
the arbitration clause in a collective-bargaining agreement.The union argued that such authority was implicitly granted
by $ 301 and explicitly granted by $ 2 of the FAA. In sup-port of the latter argument, the union asked the Court to
rule either that a collective-bargaining agreement is not a"contrac[t] of employment" within the meaning of the exclusion in $ 1, or that the exclusion is limited to transportationworkers.

11 The Court did not accept either argument, but

held that $ 301 itself provided the authority to compel arbi-tration. The fact that the Court relied on $ 301 of the

LMRA, a statutory provision that does not mention arbitra-tion, rather than the FAA, a statute that expressly authorizes the enforcement of arbitration agreements, strongly im-plies that the Court had concluded that the FAA simply did

the deliberations on the case, explained the disposition of theFAA issues. See 353 U. S., at 466-468 (dissenting opinion).

12

Even if Justice Frankfurter's description of the majority'srejection of the applicability of the FAA does not suffice to

establish Textile Workers as precedent for the meaning of$ 1, his opinion unquestionably reveals his own interpretation of the Act. Moreover, given that Justice Marshall andI have also subscribed to that reading of $ 1,

13 and that three

more Members of this Court do so in dissenting from today'sdecision, it follows that more Justices have endorsed that

view than the one the Court now adopts. That fact, ofcourse, does not control the disposition of this case, but it
does seem to me that it is entitled to at least as much respectas the number of Court of Appeals decisions to which the
Court repeatedly refers. III

overcome that attitude, but a number of this Court's casesdecided in the last several decades have pushed the pendu12 In Justice Frankfurter's words,

of $ 301. I would make this rejection explicit, recognizing that when Congress passed legislation to enable arbitration agreements to be enforced
by the federal courts, it saw fit to exclude this remedy with respect to
labor contracts." Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S., at

lum far beyond a neutral attitude and endorsed a policy thatstrongly favors private arbitration.

14 The strength of that

policy preference has been echoed in the recent Court ofAppeals opinions on which the Court relies.

15 In a sense,

therefore, the Court is standing on its own shoulders whenit points to those cases as the basis for its narrow construction of the exclusion in $ 1. There is little doubt that the
Court's interpretation of the Act has given it a scope farbeyond the expectations of the Congress that enacted it.

See, e. g., Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 17-21(1984) (

Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part); id., at 21-36 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).It is not necessarily wrong for the Court to put its own

imprint on a statute. But when its refusal to look beyondthe raw statutory text enables it to disregard countervailing
considerations that were expressed by Members of theenacting Congress and that remain valid today, the Court
misuses its authority. As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between
individual employees and large employers was the source of
organized labor's opposition to the Act, which it feared would
require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts.
That same concern, as Justice Souter points out, see post,

employment from mandatory arbitration. When the Courtsimply ignores the interest of the unrepresented employee,

it skews its interpretation with its own policy preferences.This case illustrates the wisdom of an observation made
by Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Court of Israel.He has perceptively noted that the "minimalist" judge "who
holds that the purpose of the statute may be learned only
from its language" has more discretion than the judge "whowill seek guidance from every reliable source." Judicial

Discretion 62 (Y. Kaufmann transl. 1989). A method of stat-utory interpretation that is deliberately uninformed, and
hence unconstrained, may produce a result that is consistentwith a court's own views of how things should be, but it
may also defeat the very purpose for which a provision was
enacted. That is the sad result in this case.

I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) provides for the enforceability of a written arbitration clause in
"any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce," 9 U. S. C. $ 2, while $ 1 exempts
from the Act's coverage "contracts of employment of seamen,
railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in
foreign or interstate commerce." Whatever the understanding of Congress's implied admiralty power may have
been when the Act was passed in 1925, the commerce power
was then thought to be far narrower than we have subsequently come to see it. As a consequence, there are two
quite different ways of reading the scope of the Act's provisions. One way would be to say, for example, that the coverage provision extends only to those contracts "involving
commerce" that were understood to be covered in 1925; the
other would be to read it as exercising Congress's commerce
jurisdiction in its modern conception in the same way it was

Souter, J., dissenting
thought to implement the more limited view of the Commerce Clause in 1925. The first possibility would result in
a statutory ambit frozen in time, behooving Congress to
amend the statute whenever it desired to expand arbitration
clause enforcement beyond its scope in 1925; the second
would produce an elastic reach, based on an understanding
that Congress used language intended to go as far as Congress could go, whatever that might be over time.

In Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265
(1995), we decided that the elastic understanding of $ 2 was
the more sensible way to give effect to what Congress intended when it legislated to cover contracts "involving commerce," a phrase that we found an apt way of providing that
coverage would extend to the outer constitutional limits
under the Commerce Clause. The question here is whether
a similarly general phrase in the $ 1 exemption, referring to
contracts of "any . . . class of workers engaged in foreign
or interstate commerce," should receive a correspondingly
evolutionary reading, so as to expand the exemption for employment contracts to keep pace with the enhanced reach
of the general enforceability provision. If it is tempting to
answer yes, on the principle that what is sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander, it is sobering to realize that the
Courts of Appeals have, albeit with some fits and starts as
noted by Justice Stevens, ante, at 129-130 (dissenting
opinion),1 overwhelmingly rejected the evolutionary reading
of $ 1 accepted by the Court of Appeals in this case. See
ante, at 110-111 (opinion of the Court) (citing cases). A ma1 Compare, e. g., Asplundh Tree Expert Co. v. Bates, 71 F. 3d 592, 600-

contracts of employment are generally excluded), and Gatliff Coal Co. v.
Cox, 142 F. 2d 876, 882 (CA6 1944) ("[T]he Arbitration Act excluded employment contracts"). See also Craft v. Campbell Soup Co., 177 F. 3d

jority of this Court now puts its imprimatur on the majorityview among the Courts of Appeals.

The number of courts arrayed against reading the $ 1 ex-emption in a way that would allow it to grow parallel to the
expanding $ 2 coverage reflects the fact that this minorityview faces two hurdles, each textually based and apparent
from the face of the Act. First, the language of coverage(a contract evidencing a transaction "involving commerce")
is different from the language of the exemption (a contractof a worker "engaged in . . . commerce"). Second, the "engaged in . . . commerce" catchall phrase in the exemptionis placed in the text following more specific exemptions for
employment contracts of "seamen" and "railroad employees."The placement possibly indicates that workers who are excused from arbitrating by virtue of the catchall exclusionmust resemble seamen and railroad workers, perhaps by
being employees who actually handle and move goods as theyare shipped interstate or internationally.

Neither hurdle turns out to be a bar, however. The firstobjection is at best inconclusive and weaker than the grounds
to reject it; the second is even more certainly inapposite, forreasons the Court itself has stated but misunderstood.

I
Is Congress further from a plenary exercise of the com-merce power when it deals with contracts of workers "engaged in . . . commerce" than with contracts detailing trans-actions "involving commerce?" The answer is an easy yes,
insofar as the former are only the class of labor contracts,while the latter are not so limited. But that is not the point.
The question is whether Congress used language indicatingthat it meant to cover as many contracts as the Commerce
Clause allows it to reach within each class of contracts ad-dressed. In Allied-Bruce we examined the 1925 context
and held that "involving commerce" showed just such a ple-nary intention, even though at the time we decided that case

532US1 Unit: $U35 [09-05-02 19:16:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
we had long understood "affecting commerce" to be the
quintessential expression of an intended plenary exercise of
commerce power. 513 U. S., at 273-274; see also Wickard v.
Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942).

Again looking to the context of the time, I reach the same
conclusion about the phrase "engaged in commerce" as a description of employment contracts exempted from the Act.
When the Act was passed (and the commerce power was
closely confined) our case law indicated that the only employment relationships subject to the commerce power were
those in which workers were actually engaged in interstate
commerce. Compare The Employers' Liability Cases, 207
U. S. 463, 496, 498 (1908) (suggesting that regulation of the
employment relations of railroad employees "actually engaged in an operation of interstate commerce" is permissible
under the Commerce Clause but that regulation of a railroad
company's clerical force is not), with Hammer v. Dagenhart,
247 U. S. 251, 271-276 (1918) (invalidating statute that had
the "necessary effect" of "regulat[ing] the hours of labor of
children in factories and mines within the States"). Thus,
by using "engaged in" for the exclusion, Congress showed an
intent to exclude to the limit of its power to cover employment contracts in the first place, and it did so just as clearly
as its use of "involving commerce" showed its intent to legislate to the hilt over commercial contracts at a more general
level. That conclusion is in fact borne out by the statement
of the then-Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who
suggested to Congress that the $ 1 exclusion language should
be adopted "[i]f objection appears to the inclusion of workers'
contracts in the law's scheme." Sales and Contracts to Sell

The Court cites FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U. S. 349(1941), United States v. American Building Maintenance

Industries, 422 U. S. 271 (1975), and Gulf Oil Corp. v. CoppPaving Co., 419 U. S. 186 (1974), for the proposition that "engaged in" has acquired a more restricted meaning as a termof art, immune to tampering now. Ante, at 117-118. But
none of the cited cases dealt with the question here, whetherexemption language is to be read as petrified when coverage
language is read to grow. Nor do the cases support theCourt's unwillingness to look beyond the four corners of the
statute to determine whether the words in question neces-sarily " `have a uniform meaning whenever used by Congress,' " ante, at 118 (quoting American Building Maintenance, supra, at 277). Compare ante, at 119 ("[W]e neednot assess the legislative history of the exclusion provision"),

with, e. g., American Building Maintenance, supra, at 279-283 (examining legislative history and agency enforcement of
the Clayton Act before resolving meaning of "engaged incommerce").

The Court has no good reason, therefore, to reject a read-ing of "engaged in" as an expression of intent to legislate
to the full extent of the commerce power over employmentcontracts. The statute is accordingly entitled to a coherent
reading as a whole, see, e. g., King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991), by treating the exemption for employment contracts as keeping pace with the expanded un-derstanding of the commerce power generally.

II
The second hurdle is cleared more easily still, and theCourt has shown how. Like some Courts of Appeals before

it, the majority today finds great significance in the fact that
the generally phrased exemption for the employment con-tracts of workers "engaged in commerce" does not stand

alone, but occurs at the end of a sequence of more specific

Souter, J., dissenting
exemptions: for "contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in
foreign or interstate commerce." Like those other courts,
this Court sees the sequence as an occasion to apply the interpretive maxim of ejusdem generis, that is, when specific
terms are followed by a general one, the latter is meant to
cover only examples of the same sort as the preceding specifics. Here, the same sort is thought to be contracts of
transportation workers, or employees of transporters, the
very carriers of commerce. And that, of course, excludes
respondent Adams from benefit of the exemption, for he is
employed by a retail seller.

Like many interpretive canons, however, ejusdem generis
is a fallback, and if there are good reasons not to apply it,
it is put aside. E. g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train
Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991).2 There are good reasons here. As Adams argued, it is imputing something very
odd to the working of the congressional brain to say that
Congress took care to bar application of the Act to the class
of employment contracts it most obviously had authority to
legislate about in 1925, contracts of workers employed by

would seem to have made more sense either to cover all coverable employment contracts or to exclude them all. In fact,

that arbitration could prove expensive or unfavorable to em2 What is more, the Court has repeatedly explained that the canon is

ployees, many of whom lack the bargaining power to resistan arbitration clause if their prospective employers insist on

one.3 And excluding all employment contracts from theAct's enforcement of mandatory arbitration clauses is consistent with Secretary Hoover's suggestion that the exemp-tion language would respond to any "objection . . . to the
inclusion of workers' contracts."The Court tries to deflect the anomaly of excluding only
carrier contracts by suggesting that Congress used the refer-ence to seamen and rail workers to indicate the class of
employees whose employment relations it had already legis-lated about and would be most likely to legislate about in the
future. Ante, at 120-121. This explanation, however, doesnothing to eliminate the anomaly. On the contrary, the explanation tells us why Congress might have referred specifi-cally to the sea and rail workers; but, if so, it also indicates
that Congress almost certainly intended the catchall phraseto be just as broad as its terms, without any interpretive
squeeze in the name of ejusdem generis.The very fact, as the Court points out, that Congress already had spoken on the subjects of sailors and rail workersand had tailored the legislation to the particular circumstances of the sea and rail carriers may well have been rea-son for mentioning them specifically. But making the specific references was in that case an act of special care to makesure that the FAA not be construed to modify the existing
legislation so exactly aimed; that was no reason at all to limitthe general FAA exclusion from applying to employment

3 Senator Walsh expressed this concern during a subcommittee hearing
on the FAA:

" `The trouble about the matter is that a great many of these contracts
that are entered into are really not voluntar[y] things at all. . . . It is the
same with a good many contracts of employment. A man says, "These
are our terms. All right, take it or leave it." Well, there is nothing for
the man to do except to sign it; and then he surrenders his right to have
his case tried by the court, and has to have it tried before a tribunal in
which he has no confidence at all.' " Hearing on S. 4213 et al., at 9.

contracts that had not been targeted with special legislation.Congress did not need to worry especially about the FAA's

effect on legislation that did not exist and was not contem-plated. As to workers uncovered by any specific legislation,
Congress could write on a clean slate, and what it wrote wasa general exclusion for employment contracts within Congress's power to regulate. The Court has understood thispoint before, holding that the existence of a special reason
for emphasizing specific examples of a statutory class cannegate any inference that an otherwise unqualified general
phrase was meant to apply only to matters ejusdem generis.4On the Court's own reading of the history, then, the explanation for the catchall is not ejusdem generis; instead, the ex-planation for the specifics is

Congress wanted "to make clear that coal was reserved even though existing law treated it differently from other minerals."

EGELHOFF v. EGELHOFF, a minor, by and through

her natural parent, BREINER, et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of washington
No. 99-1529. Argued November 8, 2000--Decided March 21, 2001
While David A. Egelhoff was married to petitioner, he designated her as

the beneficiary of a life insurance policy and pension plan provided by
his employer and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Shortly after petitioner and Mr. Egelhoff
divorced, Mr. Egelhoff died intestate. Respondents, Mr. Egelhoff's children by a previous marriage, filed separate suits against petitioner in
state court to recover the insurance proceeds and pension plan benefits.
They relied on a Washington statute that provides that the designation
of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset--defined to include
a life insurance policy or employee benefit plan--is revoked automatically upon divorce. Respondents argued that in the absence of a qualified named beneficiary, the proceeds would pass to them as Mr. Egelhoff's statutory heirs under state law. The trial courts concluded that
both the insurance policy and the pension plan should be administered
in accordance with ERISA, and granted petitioner summary judgment
in both cases. The Washington Court of Appeals consolidated the cases
and reversed, concluding that the statute was not pre-empted by
ERISA. The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the statute,
although applicable to employee benefit plans, does not "refe[r] to" or
have a "connection with" an ERISA plan that would compel pre-emption
under that statute.

Held: The state statute has a connection with ERISA plans and is therefore expressly pre-empted. Pp. 146-152.

(a) ERISA's pre-emption section, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), states that
ERISA "shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now
or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan" covered by ERISA.
A state law relates to an ERISA plan "if it has a connection with or
reference to such a plan." Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,
97. To determine whether there is a forbidden connection, the Court
looks both to ERISA's objectives as a guide to the scope of the state
law that Congress understood would survive, as well as to the nature
of the state law's effect on ERISA plans. California Div. of Labor
Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S.
316, 325. Applying this framework, the state statute has an impermissible connection with ERISA plans, as it binds plan administrators to a

Syllabus
particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. Administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather
than to those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an area of core ERISA concern, running counter to ERISA's
commands that a plan shall "specify the basis on which payments are
made to and from the plan," $ 1102(b)(4), and that the fiduciary shall
administer the plan "in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the plan," $ 1104(a)(1)(D). The state statute also has a prohibited connection with ERISA plans because it interferes with nationally uniform plan administration. Administrators cannot make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified in the plan
documents, but must familiarize themselves with state statutes so that
they can determine whether the named beneficiary's status has been
"revoked" by operation of law. The burden is exacerbated by the
choice-of-law problems that may confront an administrator when the
employer, the plan participant, and the participant's former spouse live
in different States. Although the Washington statute provides protection for administrators who have no actual knowledge of a divorce, they
still face the risk that a court might later find that they did have such
knowledge. If they instead decide to await the results of litigation
among putative beneficiaries before paying benefits, they will simply
transfer to the beneficiaries the costs of delay and uncertainty. Requiring administrators to master the relevant laws of 50 States and to
contend with litigation would undermine the congressional goal of minimizing their administrative and financial burdens. Differing state regulations affecting an ERISA plan's system for processing claims and
paying benefits impose precisely the burden that ERISA pre-emption
was intended to avoid. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1,
10. Pp. 146-150.

(b) Respondents' reasons why ordinary ERISA pre-emption analysis
should not apply here--that the state statute allows employers to opt
out; that it involves areas of traditional state regulation; and that if
ERISA pre-empts this statute, it also must pre-empt the various state
statutes providing that a murdering heir is not entitled to receive property as a result of the killing--are rejected. Pp. 150-152.

144 EGELHOFF v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner Donna Rae Egelhoff was married to David A.
Egelhoff. Mr. Egelhoff was employed by the Boeing Company, which provided him with a life insurance policy and a
pension plan. Both plans were governed by ERISA, and
Mr. Egelhoff designated his wife as the beneficiary under
both. In April 1994, the Egelhoffs divorced. Just over two
months later, Mr. Egelhoff died intestate following an automobile accident. At that time, Mrs. Egelhoff remained the
listed beneficiary under both the life insurance policy and the
pension plan. The life insurance proceeds, totaling $46,000,
were paid to her.

Respondents Samantha and David Egelhoff, Mr. Egelhoff 's
children by a previous marriage, are his statutory heirs
under state law. They sued petitioner in Washington state
court to recover the life insurance proceeds. Respondents
relied on a Washington statute that provides:

"If a marriage is dissolved or invalidated, a provision
made prior to that event that relates to the payment or
transfer at death of the decedent's interest in a nonprobate asset in favor of or granting an interest or power to
the decedent's former spouse is revoked. A provision
affected by this section must be interpreted, and the
nonprobate asset affected passes, as if the former spouse
failed to survive the decedent, having died at the time
of entry of the decree of dissolution or declaration of
invalidity." Wash. Rev. Code $ 11.07.010(2)(a) (1994).

That statute applies to "all nonprobate assets, wherever situated, held at the time of entry by a superior court of this
state of a decree of dissolution of marriage or a declaration
of invalidity." $ 11.07.010(1). It defines "nonprobate asset"
to include "a life insurance policy, employee benefit plan, annuity or similar contract, or individual retirement account."

$ 11.07.010(5)(a).

Opinion of the Court
Respondents argued that they were entitled to the life in-surance proceeds because the Washington statute disqualified Mrs. Egelhoff as a beneficiary, and in the absence of aqualified named beneficiary, the proceeds would pass to them
as Mr. Egelhoff 's heirs. In a separate action, respondentsalso sued to recover the pension plan benefits. Respondents
again argued that the Washington statute disqualified Mrs.
Egelhoff as a beneficiary and they were thus entitled to thebenefits under the plan.

The trial courts, concluding that both the insurance policyand the pension plan "should be administered in accordance"
with ERISA, granted summary judgment to petitioner in
both cases. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a, 48a. The Washington Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and reversed.
In re Estate of Egelhoff, 93 Wash. App. 314, 968 P. 2d 924
(1998). It concluded that the Washington statute was not
pre-empted by ERISA. Id., at 317, 968 P. 2d, at 925.
Applying the statute, it held that respondents were entitled
to the proceeds of both the insurance policy and the pension
plan. Ibid.

The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed. 139 Wash.
2d 557, 989 P. 2d 80 (1999). It held that the state statute,
although applicable to "employee benefit plan[s]," does not
"refe[r] to" ERISA plans to an extent that would require
pre-emption, because it "does not apply immediately and exclusively to an ERISA plan, nor is the existence of such a
plan essential to operation of the statute." Id., at 574, 989
P. 2d, at 89. It also held that the statute lacks a "connection
with" an ERISA plan that would compel pre-emption. Id.,
at 576, 989 P. 2d, at 90. It emphasized that the statute "does
not alter the nature of the plan itself, the administrator's
fiduciary duties, or the requirements for plan administration." Id., at 575, 989 P. 2d, at 90. Nor, the court concluded, does the statute conflict with any specific provision
of ERISA, including the antialienation provision, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1056(d)(1), because it "does not operate to divert benefit

plan proceeds from distribution under terms of the plan doc-uments," but merely alters "the underlying circumstances to

which the distribution scheme of [the] plan must be applied."139 Wash. 2d, at 578, 989 P. 2d, at 91.

Courts have disagreed about whether statutes like thatof Washington are pre-empted by ERISA. Compare, e. g.,
Manning v. Hayes, 212 F. 3d 866 (CA5 2000) (finding pre-emption), cert. pending, No. 00-265,* and

Metropolitan LifeIns. Co. v. Hanslip, 939 F. 2d 904 (CA10 1991) (same), with,

e. g., Emard v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 153 F. 3d 949 (CA9 1998)(finding no pre-emption), and 139 Wash. 2d, at 557, 989 P. 2d,
at 80 (same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari.530 U. S. 1242 (2000).

II
Petitioner argues that the Washington statute falls withinthe terms of ERISA's express pre-emption provision and

that it is pre-empted by ERISA under traditional principlesof conflict pre-emption. Because we conclude that the statute is expressly pre-empted by ERISA, we address only thefirst argument.

ERISA's pre-emption section, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), statesthat ERISA "shall supersede any and all State laws insofar
as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefitplan" covered by ERISA. We have observed repeatedly
that this broadly worded provision is "clearly expansive."New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield
Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655 (1995); see,e. g., Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374,
384 (1992) (listing cases in which we have described ERISApre-emption in broad terms). But at the same time, we
have recognized that the term "relate to" cannot be taken"to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy," or
else "for all practical purposes pre-emption would never runits course." Travelers, supra, at 655.

Opinion of the Court
We have held that a state law relates to an ERISA plan
"if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan."
Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 97 (1983). Petitioner focuses on the "connection with" part of this inquiry.
Acknowledging that "connection with" is scarcely more
restrictive than "relate to," we have cautioned against an
"uncritical literalism" that would make pre-emption turn on
"infinite connections." Travelers, supra, at 656. Instead,
"to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection, we look both to `the objectives of the ERISA statute
as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive,' as well as to the nature of the effect of
the state law on ERISA plans." California Div. of Labor
Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,
519 U. S. 316, 325 (1997), quoting Travelers, supra, at 656
(citation omitted).

Applying this framework, petitioner argues that the Washington statute has an impermissible connection with ERISA
plans. We agree. The statute binds ERISA plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status. The administrators must pay benefits to the
beneficiaries chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the plan documents. The statute thus implicates an
area of core ERISA concern. In particular, it runs counter
to ERISA's commands that a plan shall "specify the basis on
which payments are made to and from the plan," $ 1102(b)(4),
and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
plan," $ 1104(a)(1)(D), making payments to a "beneficiary"
who is "designated by a participant, or by the terms of [the]
plan." $ 1002(8).1 In other words, unlike generally applica1 One can of course escape the conflict between the plan documents
(which require making payments to the named beneficiary) and the statute
(which requires making payments to someone else) by calling the statute
an "invalidation" of the designation of the named beneficiary, and by ob532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ble laws regulating "areas where ERISA has nothing tosay," Dillingham, 519 U. S., at 330, which we have upheld

notwithstanding their incidental effect on ERISA plans, see,e. g., ibid., this statute governs the payment of benefits, a
central matter of plan administration.The Washington statute also has a prohibited connection
with ERISA plans because it interferes with nationally uni-form plan administration. One of the principal goals of
ERISA is to enable employers "to establish a uniform ad-ministrative scheme, which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement ofbenefits."

Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S.1, 9 (1987). Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans are

subject to different legal obligations in different States.The Washington statute at issue here poses precisely that
threat. Plan administrators cannot make payments sim-ply by identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan documents.2 Instead they must familiarize themselves with
serving that the plan documents are silent on whether "invalidation" is to
occur upon divorce. The dissent employs just such an approach. See
post, at 155-156 (opinion of Breyer, J.). Reading a clear statement as an
ambiguous metastatement enables one to avoid all kinds of conflicts between seemingly contradictory texts. Suppose, for example, that the
statute required that all pension benefits be paid to the Governor of Washington. That seems inconsistent with the plan documents (and with
ERISA), but the inconsistency disappears if one calls the statute an "invalidation" of the principal and alternate beneficiary designations. After
all, neither the plan nor ERISA actually says that beneficiaries cannot be
invalidated in favor of the Governor. This approach exploits the logical
inability of any text to contain a complete set of instructions for its own
interpretation. It has the vice--or perhaps the virtue, depending upon
one's point of view--of draining all language of its meaning.

2 Respondents argue that in this case, the disposition dictated by the

Washington statute is consistent with that specified in the plan documents.
Because Mr. Egelhoff designated "Donna R. Egelhoff wife" as the beneficiary of the life insurance policy, they contend that once the Egelhoffs
divorced, "there was no such person as `Donna R. Egelhoff wife'; the designated person had definitionally ceased to exist." Brief for Respondents
44 (emphasis in original); see also post, at 155 (Breyer, J., dissenting).
In effect, respondents ask us to infer that what Mr. Egelhoff meant when

532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
state statutes so that they can determine whether the namedbeneficiary's status has been "revoked" by operation of law.

And in this context the burden is exacerbated by the choice-of-law problems that may confront an administrator when
the employer is located in one State, the plan participantlives in another, and the participant's former spouse lives in
a third. In such a situation, administrators might find thatplan payments are subject to conflicting legal obligations.

To be sure, the Washington statute protects administra-tors from liability for making payments to the named beneficiary unless they have "actual knowledge of the dissolu-tion or other invalidation of marriage," Wash. Rev. Code

$ 11.07.010(3)(a) (1994), and it permits administrators to re-fuse to make payments until any dispute among putative
beneficiaries is resolved, $ 11.07.010(3)(b). But if adminis-trators do pay benefits, they will face the risk that a court
might later find that they had "actual knowledge" of a di-vorce. If they instead decide to await the results of litigation before paying benefits, they will simply transfer to thebeneficiaries the costs of delay and uncertainty.

ERISA administrators to master the relevant laws of 50States and to contend with litigation would undermine the

he filled out the form was not "Donna R. Egelhoff, who is my wife," but
rather "a new legal person--`Donna as spouse,' " Brief for Respondents
44. They do not mention, however, that below the "Beneficiary" line on
the form, the printed text reads, "First Name [space] Middle Initial [space]
Last Name [space] Relationship." See Appendix to opinion of Breyer,
J., post. Rather than impute to Mr. Egelhoff the unnatural (and indeed
absurd) literalism suggested by respondents, we conclude that he simply
provided all of the information requested by the form. The happenstance
that "Relationship" was on the same line as the beneficiary's name does
not, we think, evince an intent to designate "a new legal person."

3 The dissent observes that the Washington statute permits a plan administrator to avoid resolving the dispute himself and to let courts or
parties settle the matter. See post, at 158. This observation only presents an example of how the costs of delay and uncertainty can be passed
on to beneficiaries, thereby thwarting ERISA's objective of efficient plan
administration. Cf. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 9
(1987).

Opinion of the Court
congressional goal of "minimiz[ing] the administrative andfinancial burden[s]" on plan administrators--burdens ultimately borne by the beneficiaries. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 142 (1990).

We recognize that all state laws create some potential fora lack of uniformity. But differing state regulations affecting an ERISA plan's "system for processing claims and pay-ing benefits" impose "precisely the burden that ERISA preemption was intended to avoid." Fort Halifax, supra, at10. And as we have noted, the statute at issue here directly
conflicts with ERISA's requirements that plans be adminis-tered, and benefits be paid, in accordance with plan documents. We conclude that the Washington statute has a"connection with" ERISA plans and is therefore pre-empted.

III
Respondents suggest several reasons why ordinaryERISA pre-emption analysis should not apply here. First,

they observe that the Washington statute allows employersto opt out. According to respondents, the statute neither
regulates plan administration nor impairs uniformity be-cause it does not apply when "[t]he instrument governing
disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides other-wise." Wash. Rev. Code $ 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994). We do
not believe that the statute is saved from pre-emption simplybecause it is, at least in a broad sense, a default rule.

Even though the Washington statute's cancellation of pri-vate choice may itself be trumped by specific language in
the plan documents, the statute does "dictate the choice[s]facing ERISA plans" with respect to matters of plan administration. Dillingham, supra, at 334. Plan administra-tors must either follow Washington's beneficiary designation
scheme or alter the terms of their plan so as to indicate thatthey will not follow it. The statute is not any less of a regulation of the terms of ERISA plans simply because there aretwo ways of complying with it. Of course, simple noncom532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

151Cite as: 532 U. S. 141 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
pliance with the statute is not one of the options available to
plan administrators. Their only choice is one of timing, i. e.,
whether to bear the burden of compliance ex post, by paying
benefits as the statute dictates (and in contravention of the
plan documents), or ex ante, by amending the plan.4

Respondents emphasize that the opt-out provision makes
compliance with the statute less burdensome than if it were
mandatory. That is true enough, but the burden that remains is hardly trivial. It is not enough for plan administrators to opt out of this particular statute. Instead, they must
maintain a familiarity with the laws of all 50 States so that
they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the optout requirements of other, similar statutes. They also must
be attentive to changes in the interpretations of those statutes by state courts. This "tailoring of plans and employer
conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction" is
exactly the burden ERISA seeks to eliminate. IngersollRand, supra, at 142.

Second, respondents emphasize that the Washington statute involves both family law and probate law, areas of traditional state regulation. There is indeed a presumption
against pre-emption in areas of traditional state regulation
such as family law. See, e. g., Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439
U. S. 572, 581 (1979). But that presumption can be overcome where, as here, Congress has made clear its desire for
pre-emption. Accordingly, we have not hesitated to find
state family law pre-empted when it conflicts with ERISA
or relates to ERISA plans. See, e. g., Boggs v. Boggs, 520

4 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion that the resolution of this case
depends on one's view of federalism, see post, at 160-161, we are called
upon merely to interpret ERISA. And under the text of ERISA, the
fiduciary "shall" administer the plan "in accordance with the documents
and instruments governing the plan," 29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(D). The
Washington statute conflicts with this command because under this statute, the only way the fiduciary can administer the plan according to its
terms is to change the very terms he is supposed to follow.

Scalia, J., concurring
U. S. 833 (1997) (holding that ERISA pre-empts a state com-munity property law permitting the testamentary transfer

of an interest in a spouse's pension plan benefits).Finally, respondents argue that if ERISA pre-empts this
statute, then it also must pre-empt the various state statutesproviding that a murdering heir is not entitled to receive
property as a result of the killing. See, e. g., Cal. Prob. CodeAnn. $$ 250-259 (West 1991 and Supp. 2000); 755 Ill. Comp.
Stat., ch. 755, $ 5/2-6 (1999). In the ERISA context, these"slayer" statutes could revoke the beneficiary status of someone who murdered a plan participant. Those statutes arenot before us, so we do not decide the issue. We note, however, that the principle underlying the statutes--which havebeen adopted by nearly every State--is well established in
the law and has a long historical pedigree predating ERISA.See,

e. g., Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506, 22 N. E. 188 (1889).And because the statutes are more or less uniform nationwide, their interference with the aims of ERISA is at leastdebatable.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,

I join the opinion of the Court, since I believe that the
"relate to" pre-emptive provision of the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is assuredly triggered by a state law that contradicts ERISA. As the Courtnotes, "the statute at issue here directly conflicts with
ERISA's requirements that plans be administered, and bene-fits be paid, in accordance with plan documents."

Ante, at

vision, which--if it is interpreted to be anything other thana reference to our established jurisprudence concerning conflict and field pre-emption--has no discernible content thatwould not pick up every ripple in the pond, producing a result "that no sensible person could have intended." California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham
Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 336 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring). I persist in the view that we can bring some co-herence to this area, and can give the statute both a plausible

and precise content, only by interpreting the "relate to"clause as a reference to our ordinary pre-emption jurisprudence. See ibid.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

Like Justice Scalia, I believe that we should apply normal conflict pre-emption and field pre-emption principles
where, as here, a state statute covers ERISA and nonERISA documents alike. Ante this page (concurring opinion). Our more recent ERISA cases are consistent with this
approach. See De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, 520 U. S. 806, 812-813 (1997) (rejecting
literal interpretation of ERISA's pre-emption clause); California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham
Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 334 (1997) (narrowly interpreting the clause); New York State Conference of Blue
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S.
645, 656 (1995) ("go[ing] beyond the unhelpful text [of the
clause] and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term,
and look[ing] instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute
as a guide"). See also Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U. S. 833, 841
(1997) (relying on conflict pre-emption principles instead of
ERISA's pre-emption clause). And I fear that our failure to
endorse this "new approach" explicitly, Dillingham, supra,
at 336 (Scalia, J., concurring), will continue to produce an
"avalanche of litigation," De Buono, supra, at 809, n. 1, as

courts struggle to interpret a clause that lacks any "discern-ible content,"

ante, at 153 (Scalia, J., concurring), threatening results that Congress could not have intended.I do not agree with

Justice Scalia or with the majority,
however, that there is any plausible pre-emption principlethat leads to a conclusion that ERISA pre-empts the statute

at issue here. No one could claim that ERISA pre-empts
the entire field of state law governing inheritance--thoughsuch matters "relate to" ERISA broadly speaking. See

Travelers, supra, at 655. Neither is there any direct conflictbetween the Washington statute and ERISA, for the one
nowhere directly contradicts the other. Cf. ante, at 150
(claiming a "direc[t] conflic[t]" between ERISA and the
Washington statute). But cf. ante, at 146 (relying upon the
"relate to" language in ERISA's pre-emption clause).

The Court correctly points out that ERISA requires a
fiduciary to make payments to a beneficiary "in accordance
with the documents and instruments governing the plan."
29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(D). But nothing in the Washington
statute requires the contrary. Rather, the state statute
simply sets forth a default rule for interpreting documentary
silence. The statute specifies that a nonprobate asset will
pass at A's death "as if " A's "former spouse" had died first--
unless the "instrument governing disposition of the nonprobate asset expressly provides otherwise." Wash. Rev.
Code $ 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (1994) (emphasis added). This
state-law rule is a rule of interpretation, and it is designed
to carry out, not to conflict with, the employee's likely intention as revealed in the plan documents.

There is no direct conflict or contradiction between the
Washington statute and the terms of the plan documents
here at issue. David Egelhoff 's investment plan provides
that when a "beneficiary designation" is "invalid," the "benefits will be paid" to a "surviving spouse," or "[i]f there is no
surviving spouse," to the "children in equal shares." App.
40. The life insurance plan is silent about what occurs when

532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

155Cite as: 532 U. S. 141 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
a beneficiary designation is invalid. The Washington stat-ute fills in these gaps,

i. e., matters about which the documents themselves say nothing. Thus, the Washington stat-ute specifies that a beneficiary designation--here "Donna R.

Egelhoff wife" in the pension plan--is invalid where there isno longer any such person as Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. See
Appendix, infra. And the statute adds that in such instance
the funds would be paid to the children, who themselves arepotential pension plan beneficiaries.

The Court's "direct conflict" conclusion rests upon its claimthat "administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries
chosen by state law, rather than to those identified in the
plan documents." Ante, at 147. But the Court cannot
mean "identified anywhere in the plan documents," for the
Egelhoff children were "identified" as recipients in the pension plan documents should the initial designation to "Donna
R. Egelhoff wife" become invalid. And whether that initial
designation became invalid upon divorce is a matter about
which the plan documents are silent.

To refer to state law to determine whether a given name
makes a designation that is, or has become, invalid makes
sense where background property or inheritance law is at
issue, say, for example, where a written name is potentially
ambiguous, where it is set forth near, but not in, the correct
space, where it refers to a missing person perhaps presumed
dead, where the name was written at a time the employee
was incompetent, or where the name refers to an individual
or entity disqualified by other law, say, the rule against perpetuities or rules prohibiting a murderer from benefiting
from his crime. Why would Congress want the courts to
create an ERISA-related federal property law to deal with
such problems? Regardless, to refer to background state
law in such circumstances does not directly conflict with any
explicit ERISA provision, for no provision of ERISA forbids
reading an instrument or document in light of state property
law principles. In any event, in this case the plan docu532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
156 EGELHOFF v. EGELHOFF

Breyer, J., dissenting
ments explicitly foresee that a beneficiary designation maybecome "invalid," but they do not specify the invalidating

circumstances. Supra, at 154-155. To refer to state prop-erty law to fill in that blank cannot possibly create any direct
conflict with the plan documents.The majority simply denies that there is any blank to fill
in and suggests that the plan documents require the plan to
pay the designated beneficiary under all circumstances. See
ante, at 147-148, n. 1. But there is nonetheless an open
question, namely, whether a designation that (here explic-itly) refers to a wife remains valid after divorce. The question is genuine and important (unlike the imaginary example
in the majority's footnote). The plan documents themselves
do not answer the question any more than they describe
what is to occur in a host of other special circumstances (e. g.,
mental incompetence, intoxication, ambiguous names, etc.).
To determine whether ERISA permits state law to answer
such questions requires a careful examination of the particular state law in light of ERISA's basic policies. See ante, at
147; infra this page and 157-159. We should not short circuit that necessary inquiry simply by announcing a "direct
conflict" where none exists.

The Court also complains that the Washington statute restricts the plan's choices to "two." Ante, at 150. But it is
difficult to take this complaint seriously. After all, the two
choices that Washington gives the plan are (1) to comply
with Washington's rule or (2) not to comply with Washington's rule. What other choices could there be? A state
statute that asks a plan to choose whether it intends to comply is not a statute that directly conflicts with a plan. Quite
obviously, it is possible, not " `impossible,' " to comply with
both the Washington statute and federal law. Geier v.
American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 873 (2000).

The more serious pre-emption question is whether this
state statute " `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment
and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
gress.' " Ibid. (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,
67 (1941)). In answering that question, we must remember that petitioner has to overcome a strong presumption
against pre-emption. That is because the Washington statute governs family property law--a "fiel[d] of traditional
state regulation," where courts will not find federal preemption unless such was the " `clear and manifest purpose
of Congress,' " Travelers, 514 U. S., at 655 (quoting Rice v.
Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)), or the
state statute does " `major damage' to `clear and substantial'
federal interests," Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U. S. 572,
581 (1979) (quoting United States v. Yazell, 382 U. S. 341,
352 (1966)). No one can seriously argue that Congress has
clearly resolved the question before us. And the only damage to federal interests that the Court identifies consists of
the added administrative burden the state statute imposes
upon ERISA plan administrators.

The Court claims that the Washington statute "interferes
with nationally uniform plan administration" by requiring
administrators to "familiarize themselves with state statutes." Ante, at 148-149. But administrators have to familiarize themselves with state law in any event when they answer such routine legal questions as whether amounts due
are subject to garnishment, Mackey v. Lanier Collection
Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 838 (1988), who is a
"spouse," who qualifies as a "child," or when an employee is
legally dead. And were that "familiarizing burden" somehow overwhelming, the plan could easily avoid it by resolving the divorce revocation issue in the plan documents themselves, stating expressly that state law does not apply. The
"burden" thus reduces to a one-time requirement that would
fall primarily upon the few who draft model ERISA documents, not upon the many who administer them. So meager
a burden cannot justify pre-empting a state law that enjoys
a presumption against pre-emption.

158 EGELHOFF v. EGELHOFF

Breyer, J., dissenting
The Court also fears that administrators would have tomake difficult choice-of-law determinations when parties live

in different States. Ante, at 148-149. Whether this prob-lem is or is not "major" in practice, the Washington statute
resolves it by expressly setting forth procedures wherebythe parties or the courts,

not the plan administrator, are responsible for resolving it. See $$ 11.07.010(3)(b)(i)-(ii) (stating that a plan may "without liability, refuse to pay or trans-fer a nonprobate asset" until "[a]ll beneficiaries and other

interested persons claiming an interest have consented inwriting to the payment or transfer" or "[t]he payment or
transfer is authorized or directed by a court of proper jurisdiction"); $ 11.07.010(3)(c) (plan may condition payment on
provision of security by recipient to indemnify plan for
costs); $ 11.07.010(2)(b)(i) (plan may avoid default rule by expressing its intent in the plan documents).

The Court has previously made clear that the fact that
state law "impose[s] some burde[n] on the administration of
ERISA plans" does not necessarily require pre-emption.
De Buono, 520 U. S., at 815; Mackey, supra, at 831 (upholding
state garnishment law notwithstanding claim that "benefit
plans subjected to garnishment will incur substantial administrative burdens"). Precisely, what is it about this statute's
requirement that distinguishes it from the " `myriad state
laws' " that impose some kind of burden on ERISA plans?
De Buono, supra, at 815 (quoting Travelers, supra, at 668).

Indeed, if one looks beyond administrative burden, one
finds that Washington's statute poses no obstacle, but furthers ERISA's ultimate objective--developing a fair system for protecting employee benefits. Cf. Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717,
720 (1984). The Washington statute transfers an employee's
pension assets at death to those individuals whom the
worker would likely have wanted to receive them. As many
jurisdictions have concluded, divorced workers more often
prefer that a child, rather than a divorced spouse, receive

532US1 Unit: $U36 [09-09-02 12:41:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

159Cite as: 532 U. S. 141 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
those assets. Of course, an employee can secure this resultby changing a beneficiary form; but doing so requires awareness, understanding, and time. That is why Washington andmany other jurisdictions have created a statutory assumption that divorce works a revocation of a designation in favorof an ex-spouse. That assumption is embodied in the Uniform Probate Code; it is consistent with human experience;
and those with expertise in the matter have concluded thatit "more often" serves the cause of "[ j]ustice." Langbein,

The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law ofSuccession, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1108, 1135 (1984).

In forbidding Washington to apply that assumption here,
the Court permits a divorced wife, who already acquired,
during the divorce proceeding, her fair share of the couple's
community property, to receive in addition the benefits that
the divorce court awarded to her former husband. To be
more specific, Donna Egelhoff already received a business, an
IRA account, and stock; David received, among other things,
100% of his pension benefits. App. 31-34. David did not
change the beneficiary designation in the pension plan or life
insurance plan during the 6-month period between his divorce and his death. As a result, Donna will now receive a
windfall of approximately $80,000 at the expense of David's
children. The State of Washington enacted a statute to prevent precisely this kind of unfair result. But the Court, relying on an inconsequential administrative burden, concludes
that Congress required it.

Finally, the logic of the Court's decision does not stop at
divorce revocation laws. The Washington statute is virtually indistinguishable from other traditional state-law rules,
for example, rules using presumptions to transfer assets in
the case of simultaneous deaths, and rules that prohibit a
husband who kills a wife from receiving benefits as a result
of the wrongful death. It is particularly difficult to believe
that Congress wanted to pre-empt the latter kind of statute.
But how do these statutes differ from the one before us?

Breyer, J., dissenting
Slayer statutes--like this statute--"gover[n] the payment ofbenefits, a central matter of plan administration."

Ante, at
148. And contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 152,slayer statutes vary from State to State in their details just

like divorce revocation statutes. Compare Ariz. Rev. Stat.Ann. $ 14-2803(F) (1995) (requiring proof, in a civil proceeding, under preponderance of the evidence standard); Haw.
Rev. Stat. $ 560:2-803(g) (1999) (same), with Ga. Code Ann.$ 53-1-5(d) (Supp. 1996) (requiring proof under clear and convincing evidence standard); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18-A,$ 2-803(e) (1998) (same); and Ala. Code $ 43-8-253(e) (1991)
(treating judgment of conviction as conclusive when it becomes final); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18-A, $ 2-803(e) (1998)
(same), with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14-2803(F) (1995) (treating judgment of conviction as conclusive only after "all right
to appeal has been exhausted"); Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 560:2-
803(g) (1999) (same). Indeed, the "slayer" conflict would
seem more serious, not less serious, than the conflict before
us, for few, if any, slayer statutes permit plans to opt out of
the state property law rule.

"ERISA pre-emption analysis," the Court has said,
must "respect" the "separate spher[e]" of state "authority."
Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 19 (1987)
(quoting Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504,
522 (1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so stating, the Court has recognized the practical importance of
preserving local independence, at retail, i. e., by applying
pre-emption analysis with care, statute by statute, line by
line, in order to determine how best to reconcile a federal
statute's language and purpose with federalism's need to preserve state autonomy. Indeed, in today's world, filled with
legal complexity, the true test of federalist principle may lie,
not in the occasional constitutional effort to trim Congress'
commerce power at its edges, United States v. Morrison, 529
U. S. 598 (2000), or to protect a State's treasury from a private damages action, Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.

Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J.
Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001), but rather in those many statu-tory cases where courts interpret the mass of technical detail

that is the ordinary diet of the law, AT&T Corp. v. IowaUtilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 427 (1999) (

Breyer, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part).

In this case, "field pre-emption" is not at issue. There isno "direct" conflict between state and federal statutes. The
state statute poses no significant obstacle to the accomplish-ment of any federal objective. Any effort to squeeze some
additional pre-emptive force from ERISA's words (i. e., "re-late to") is inconsistent with the Court's recent case law.
And the state statute before us is one regarding family prop-erty--a "fiel[d] of traditional state regulation," where the
interpretive presumption against pre-emption is particularlystrong. Travelers, 514 U. S., at 655. For these reasons,
I disagree with the Court's conclusion. And, consequently,I dissent.

162 OCTOBER TERM, 2000

Syllabus

TEXAS v. COBB
certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas

No. 99-1702. Argued January 16, 2001--Decided April 2, 2001
While under arrest for an unrelated offense, respondent confessed to a

home burglary, but denied knowledge of a woman and child's disappearance from the home. He was indicted for the burglary, and counsel was
appointed to represent him. He later confessed to his father that he
had killed the woman and child, and his father then contacted the police.
While in custody, respondent waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and confessed to the murders. He was convicted
of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal to the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals, he argued, inter alia, that his confession
should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his
Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which he claimed attached when
counsel was appointed in the burglary case. The court reversed and
remanded, holding that once the right to counsel attaches to the offense
charged, it also attaches to any other offense that is very closely related
factually to the offense charged.

Held: Because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is "offense specific,"

it does not necessarily extend to offenses that are "factually related" to
those that have actually been charged. Pp. 167-174.

(a) In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176, this Court held that a
defendant's statements regarding offenses for which he has not been
charged are admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth
Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses. Although some
lower courts have read into McNeil's offense-specific definition an
exception for crimes that are "factually related" to a charged offense,
and have interpreted Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, and Maine v.
Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, to support this view, this Court declines to do so.
Brewer did not address the question at issue here. And to the extent
Moulton spoke to the matter at all, it expressly referred to the offensespecific nature of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In predicting
that the offense-specific rule will prove disastrous to suspects' constitutional rights and will permit the police almost total license to conduct
unwanted and uncounseled interrogations, respondent fails to appreciate
two critical considerations. First, there can be no doubt that a suspect
must be apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incrimination and
to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial
interrogation. See Miranda, supra, at 479. Here, police scrupulously

532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

163Cite as: 532 U. S. 162 (2001)
Syllabus
followed Miranda's dictates when questioning respondent. Second, the
Constitution does not negate society's interest in the police's ability to
talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with
other offenses. See McNeil, supra, at 181. Pp. 167-172.

(b) Although the Sixth Amendment right to counsel clearly attaches
only to charged offenses, this Court has recognized in other contexts
that the definition of an "offense" is not necessarily limited to the four
corners of a charging document. The test to determine whether there
are two different offenses or only one is whether each provision requires
proof of a fact which the other does not. Blockburger v. United States,
284 U. S. 299, 304. The Blockburger test has been applied to delineate
the scope of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, which prevents multiple or successive prosecutions for the "same offense." See,
e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 164-166. There is no constitutional
difference between "offense" in the double jeopardy and right-to-counsel
contexts. Accordingly, when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
attaches, it encompasses offenses that, even if not formally charged,
would be considered the same offense under the Blockburger test.
Pp. 172-174.

(c) At the time respondent confessed to the murders, he had been
indicted for burglary but had not been charged in the murders. As
defined by Texas law, these crimes are not the same offense under
Blockburger. Thus, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar
police from interrogating respondent regarding the murders, and his
confession was therefore admissible. P. 174.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a criminaldefendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches not

We hold that our decision in McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S.171 (1991), meant what it said, and that the Sixth Amendment right is "offense specific."In December 1993, Lindsey Owings reported to the

shared with his wife, Margaret, and their 16-month-olddaughter, Kori Rae, had been burglarized. He also informed police that his wife and daughter were missing.Respondent Raymond Levi Cobb lived across the street from
the Owings. Acting on an anonymous tip that respondentwas involved in the burglary, Walker County investigators
questioned him about the events. He denied involvement.
In July 1994, while under arrest for an unrelated offense,respondent was again questioned about the incident. Respondent then gave a written statement confessing to theburglary, but he denied knowledge relating to the disappearances. Respondent was subsequently indicted for the burglary, and Hal Ridley was appointed in August 1994 to represent respondent on that charge.

Shortly after Ridley's appointment, investigators asked
and received his permission to question respondent about
the disappearances. Respondent continued to deny involvement. Investigators repeated this process in September
1995, again with Ridley's permission and again with the
same result.

In November 1995, respondent, free on bond in the burglary case, was living with his father in Odessa, Texas. At
that time, respondent's father contacted the Walker County
Sheriff 's Office to report that respondent had confessed to
him that he killed Margaret Owings in the course of the burglary. Walker County investigators directed respondent's
father to the Odessa police station, where he gave a statement. Odessa police then faxed the statement to Walker
County, where investigators secured a warrant for respondent's arrest and faxed it back to Odessa. Shortly thereafter,
Odessa police took respondent into custody and administered
warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436
(1966). Respondent waived these rights.

After a short time, respondent confessed to murdering
both Margaret and Kori Rae. Respondent explained that
when Margaret confronted him as he was attempting to re532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

move the Owings' stereo, he stabbed her in the stomach witha knife he was carrying. Respondent told police that he

dragged her body to a wooded area a few hundred yardsfrom the house. Respondent then stated:

" `I went back to her house and I saw the baby layingon its bed. I took the baby out there and it was sleeping the whole time. I laid the baby down on the groundfour or five feet away from its mother. I went back to
my house and got a flat edge shovel. That's all I couldfind. Then I went back over to where they were and
I started digging a hole between them. After I gotthe hole dug, the baby was awake. It started going
toward its mom and it fell in the hole. I put the lady in
the hole and I covered them up. I remember stabbinga different knife I had in the ground where they were.

I was crying right then.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9to A-10.

Respondent later led police to the location where he had
buried the victims' bodies.Respondent was convicted of capital murder for murdering more than one person in the course of a single criminal transaction. See Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 19.03(a)(7)(A)(1994). He was sentenced to death. On appeal to the

Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, respondent argued,
inter alia, that his confession should have been suppressed
because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amend-ment right to counsel. Relying on

Michigan v. Jackson,
475 U. S. 625 (1986), respondent contended that his rightto counsel had attached when Ridley was appointed in the

burglary case and that Odessa police were therefore required
to secure Ridley's permission before proceeding with the
interrogation.

The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed respondent's
conviction by a divided vote and remanded for a new trial.
The court held that "once the right to counsel attaches to

Opinion of the Court
the offense charged, it also attaches to any other offense thatis very closely related factually to the offense charged."

2000 WL 275644, *3 (2000) (citations omitted). Finding thecapital murder charge to be "factually interwoven with
the burglary," the court concluded that respondent's SixthAmendment right to counsel had attached on the capital
murder charge even though respondent had not yet beencharged with that offense.

Id., at *4. The court furtherfound that respondent had asserted that right by accepting

Ridley's appointment in the burglary case. See ibid. Ac-cordingly, it deemed the confession inadmissible and found
that its introduction had not been harmless error. See id.,at *4-*5. Three judges dissented, finding Michigan v. Jackson to be distinguishable and concluding that respondenthad made a valid unilateral waiver of his right to counsel
before confessing. See 2000 WL, at *5-*13 (opinion of Mc-Cormick, P. J.).

The State sought review in this Court, and we grantedcertiorari to consider first whether the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel extends to crimes that are "factually re-lated" to those that have actually been charged, and second
whether respondent made a valid unilateral waiver of thatright in this case. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000). Because we answer the first question in the negative, we do not reach thesecond.

The Sixth Amendment provides that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have
the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." In McNeil v.
Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171 (1991), we explained when thisright arises:

"The Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] . . . is offensespecific. It cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions, for it does not attach until a prosecution iscommenced, that is, at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings--whether by wayof formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, in532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

formation, or arraignment." Id., at 175 (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted).

Accordingly, we held that a defendant's statements regard-ing offenses for which he had not been charged were admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amend-ment right to counsel on other charged offenses. See id.,
at 176.Some state courts and Federal Courts of Appeals, however, have read into McNeil's offense-specific definition anexception for crimes that are "factually related" to a charged
offense.1 Several of these courts have interpreted Brewerv. Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (1977), and Maine v. Moulton,
474 U. S. 159 (1985)--both of which were decided well before
McNeil--to support this view, which respondent now invitesus to approve. We decline to do so.

In Brewer, a suspect in the abduction and murder of a10-year-old girl had fled from the scene of the crime in Des
Moines, Iowa, some 160 miles east to Davenport, Iowa,where he surrendered to police. An arrest warrant was
issued in Des Moines on a charge of abduction, and thesuspect was arraigned on that warrant before a Davenport
judge. Des Moines police traveled to Davenport, took theman into custody, and began the drive back to Des Moines.
Along the way, one of the officers persuaded the suspectto lead police to the victim's body. The suspect ultimately
was convicted of the girl's murder. This Court upheld thefederal habeas court's conclusion that police had violated
the suspect's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We heldthat the officer's comments to the suspect constituted in1 See, e. g., United States v. Covarrubias, 179 F. 3d 1219, 1223-1224

Opinion of the Court
terrogation and that the suspect had not validly waived his
right to counsel by responding to the officer. See 430 U. S.,
at 405-406.

Respondent suggests that Brewer implicitly held that the
right to counsel attached to the factually related murder
when the suspect was arraigned on the abduction charge.
See Brief for Respondent 4. The Court's opinion, however,
simply did not address the significance of the fact that the
suspect had been arraigned only on the abduction charge,
nor did the parties in any way argue this question. Constitutional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions
which did not address the question at issue. Cf. Hagans
v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974) ("[W]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions
sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound
when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue
before us").

Moulton is similarly unhelpful to respondent. That case
involved two individuals indicted for a series of thefts, one
of whom had secretly agreed to cooperate with the police
investigation of his codefendant, Moulton. At the suggestion of police, the informant recorded several telephone
calls and one face-to-face conversation he had with Moulton
during which the two discussed their criminal exploits and
possible alibis. In the course of those conversations, Moulton made various incriminating statements regarding both
the thefts for which he had been charged and additional
crimes. In a superseding indictment, Moulton was charged
with the original crimes as well as burglary, arson, and three
additional thefts. At trial, the State introduced portions
of the recorded face-to-face conversation, and Moulton ultimately was convicted of three of the originally charged
thefts plus one count of burglary. Moulton appealed his
convictions to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, arguing that introduction of the recorded conversation violated

Opinion of the Court
his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. That court agreed,holding:

" `Those statements may be admissible in the investiga-tion or prosecution of charges for which, at the time the
recordings were made, adversary proceedings had notyet commenced. But as to the charges for which Moulton's right to counsel had already attached, his incrimi-nating statements should have been ruled inadmissible
at trial, given the circumstances in which they were ac-quired.' " 474 U. S., at 168 (quoting State v. Moulton,
481 A. 2d 155, 161 (1984)).
We affirmed.Respondent contends that, in affirming reversal of both

the theft and burglary charges, the Moulton Court musthave concluded that Moulton's Sixth Amendment right to
counsel attached to the burglary charge. See Brief for Re-spondent 13-14; see also Brief for the National Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 22-23.But the

Moulton Court did not address the question nowbefore us, and to the extent

Moulton spoke to the matter atall, it expressly referred to the offense-specific nature of the

Sixth Amendment right to counsel:

"The police have an interest in the thorough investi-gation of crimes for which

formal charges have alreadybeen filed. They also have an interest in investigating

new or additional crimes. Investigations of either typeof crime may require surveillance of individuals already
under indictment. Moreover, law enforcement officialsinvestigating an individual suspected of committing one
crime and formally charged with having committed an-other crime obviously seek to discover evidence useful
at a trial of either crime. In seeking evidence pertain-ing to pending charges, however, the Government's investigative powers are limited by the Sixth Amendmentrights of the accused. . . . On the other hand, to exclude

Opinion of the Court
evidence pertaining to charges as to which the SixthAmendment right to counsel had not attached at the

time the evidence was obtained, simply because othercharges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily
frustrate the public's interest in the investigation ofcriminal activities." 474 U. S., at 179-180 (emphasis
added; footnote omitted).
See also id., at 168 ("[T]he purpose of their meeting was todiscuss the

pending charges"); id., at 177 ("[T]he policeknew . . . that Moulton and [the informant] were meeting for

the express purpose of discussing the pending charges . . ."(emphasis added)). Thus, respondent's reliance on

Moultonis misplaced and, in light of the language employed there and

subsequently in McNeil, puzzling.Respondent predicts that the offense-specific rule will
prove "disastrous" to suspects' constitutional rights andwill "permit law enforcement officers almost complete and
total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interro-gations." Brief for Respondent 8-9. Besides offering no
evidence that such a parade of horribles has occurred inthose jurisdictions that have not enlarged upon McNeil, he
fails to appreciate the significance of two critical considera-tions. First, there can be no doubt that a suspect must be
apprised of his rights against compulsory self-incriminationand to consult with an attorney before authorities may conduct custodial interrogation. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384U. S., at 479;

Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435(2000) (quoting Miranda). In the present case, police scrupulously followed Miranda's dictates when questioning re-spondent.

2 Second, it is critical to recognize that the Con2 Curiously, while predicting disastrous consequences for the core values underlying the Sixth Amendment, see post, at 179-183 (opinion of
Breyer, J.), the dissenters give short shrift to the Fifth Amendment's
role (as expressed in Miranda and Dickerson) in protecting a defendant's
right to consult with counsel before talking to police. Even though the
Sixth Amendment right to counsel has not attached to uncharged offenses,

532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
172 TEXAS v. COBB

Opinion of the Court
stitution does not negate society's interest in the ability ofpolice to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have

been charged with other offenses.

"Since the ready ability to obtain uncoerced confessionsis not an evil but an unmitigated good, society would

be the loser. Admissions of guilt resulting from valid
Miranda waivers `are more than merely "desirable";they are essential to society's compelling interest in

finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate thelaw.' "

McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181 (quoting Moran v. Bur-bine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).

See also Moulton, supra, at 180 ("[T]o exclude evidence per-taining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right
to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence wasobtained, simply because other charges were pending at that
time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public's interest inthe investigation of criminal activities").

Although it is clear that the Sixth Amendment right tocounsel attaches only to charged offenses, we have recogdefendants retain the ability under Miranda to refuse any police questioning, and, indeed, charged defendants presumably have met with
counsel and have had the opportunity to discuss whether it is advisable
to invoke those Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, in all but the rarest of
cases, the Court's decision today will have no impact whatsoever upon a
defendant's ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right.

It is also worth noting that, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see
post, at 177-178, 179, there is no "background principle" of our Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence establishing that there may be no contact between a defendant and police without counsel present. The dissent would
expand the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel in a criminal prosecution into a rule which " `exists to prevent lawyers from taking
advantage of uncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the
lawyer-client relationship.' " Post, at 181 (quoting ABA Ann. Model Rule
of Profesional Conduct 4.2 (4th ed. 1999)). Every profession is competent
to define the standards of conduct for its members, but such standards
are obviously not controlling in interpretation of constitutional provisions.
The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is personal to the defendant and
specific to the offense.

Opinion of the Court
nized in other contexts that the definition of an "offense"is not necessarily limited to the four corners of a charging

instrument. In Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299(1932), we explained that "where the same act or transaction
constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are two
offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proofof a fact which the other does not."

Id., at 304. We havesince applied the Blockburger test to delineate the scope

of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause, whichprevents multiple or successive prosecutions for the "same
offence." See, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 164-166(1977). We see no constitutional difference between the
meaning of the term "offense" in the contexts of doublejeopardy and of the right to counsel. Accordingly, we hold
that when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches,it does encompass offenses that, even if not formally charged,
would be considered the same offense under the Blockburger test.3While simultaneously conceding that its own test "lacks

the precision for which police officers may hope," post, at186, the dissent suggests that adopting Blockburger's definition of "offense" will prove difficult to administer. But it isthe dissent's vague iterations of the " `closely related to' " or
" `inextricably intertwined with' " test, post, at 186, thatwould defy simple application. The dissent seems to presuppose that officers will possess complete knowledge of thecircumstances surrounding an incident, such that the officers
will be able to tailor their investigation to avoid addressingfactually related offenses. Such an assumption, however, ignores the reality that police often are not yet aware of the

3 In this sense, we could just as easily describe the Sixth Amendment
as "prosecution specific," insofar as it prevents discussion of charged offenses as well as offenses that, under Blockburger, could not be the subject
of a later prosecution. And, indeed, the text of the Sixth Amendment
confines its scope to "all criminal prosecutions."

exact sequence and scope of events they are investigating--indeed, that is why police must investigate in the first place.

Deterred by the possibility of violating the Sixth Amend-ment, police likely would refrain from questioning certain
defendants altogether.It remains only to apply these principles to the facts at
hand. At the time he confessed to Odessa police, respondenthad been indicted for burglary of the Owings residence, but
he had not been charged in the murders of Margaret andKori Rae. As defined by Texas law, burglary and capital
murder are not the same offense under Blockburger. Com-pare Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 30.02(a) (1994) (requiring entry
into or continued concealment in a habitation or building)with $ 19.03(a)(7)(A) (requiring murder of more than one person during a single criminal transaction). Accordingly, theSixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar police from
interrogating respondent regarding the murders, and re-spondent's confession was therefore admissible.

The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texasis reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia and
Justice Thomas join, concurring.

The Court's opinion is altogether sufficient to explain whythe decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should

be reversed for failure to recognize the offense-specific na-ture of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It seems
advisable, however, to observe that the Court has reachedits conclusion without the necessity to reaffirm or give approval to the decision in Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625(1986). This course is wise, in my view, for the underlying
theory of Jackson seems questionable.As the facts of the instant case well illustrate, it is difficult to understand the utility of a Sixth Amendment rulethat operates to invalidate a confession given by the free

Kennedy, J., concurring
choice of suspects who have received proper advice of their
Miranda rights but waived them nonetheless. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). The Miranda rule,and the related preventative rule of

Edwards v. Arizona,
451 U. S. 477 (1981), serve to protect a suspect's voluntarychoice not to speak outside his lawyer's presence. The parallel rule announced in Jackson, however, supersedes the
suspect's voluntary choice to speak with investigators.After

Jackson had been decided, the Court made the following observation with respect to Edwards:

"Preserving the integrity of an accused's choice tocommunicate with police only through counsel is the essence of Edwards and its progeny--not barring an accused from making an initial election as to whether hewill face the State's officers during questioning with the

aid of counsel, or go it alone. If an accused `knowinglyand intelligently' pursues the latter course, we see no
reason why the uncounseled statements he then makesmust be excluded at his trial."

Patterson v. Illinois,
487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988).

There is little justification for not applying the same course
of reasoning with equal force to the court-made preventa-tive rule announced in

Jackson; for Jackson, after all, was a
wholesale importation of the Edwards rule into the SixthAmendment.

In the instant case, Cobb at no time indicated to law en-forcement authorities that he elected to remain silent about
the double murder. By all indications, he made the volun-tary choice to give his own account. Indeed, even now Cobb
does not assert that he had no wish to speak at the time he
confessed. While the Edwards rule operates to preserve
the free choice of a suspect to remain silent, if Jackson were
to apply it would override that choice.

There is further reason to doubt the wisdom of the Jackson holding. Neither Miranda nor Edwards enforces the

176 TEXAS v. COBB

Kennedy, J., concurring
Fifth Amendment right unless the suspect makes a clear and
unambiguous assertion of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation. Davis v. United States,
512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994). Where a required Miranda warning has been given, a suspect's later confession, made outside counsel's presence, is suppressed to protect the Fifth
Amendment right of silence only if a reasonable officer
should have been certain that the suspect expressed the
unequivocal election of the right.

The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches quite
without reference to the suspect's choice to speak with investigators after a Miranda warning. It is the commencement of a formal prosecution, indicated by the initiation of
adversary judicial proceedings, that marks the beginning
of the Sixth Amendment right. See ante, at 167-168 (quoting McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991)). These
events may be quite independent of the suspect's election to
remain silent, the interest which the Edwards rule serves to
protect with respect to Miranda and the Fifth Amendment,
and it thus makes little sense for a protective rule to attach
absent such an election by the suspect. We ought to question the wisdom of a judge-made preventative rule to protect
a suspect's desire not to speak when it cannot be shown that
he had that intent.

Even if Jackson is to remain good law, its protections
should apply only where a suspect has made a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right not to speak outside the
presence of counsel, the same clear election required under
Edwards. Cobb made no such assertion here, yet Justice
Breyer's dissent rests upon the assumption that the Jackson rule should operate to exclude the confession no matter.
There would be little justification for this extension of a rule
that, even in a more limited application, rests on a doubtful
rationale.

Justice Breyer defends Jackson by arguing that, once
a suspect has accepted counsel at the commencement of ad532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

177Cite as: 532 U. S. 162 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
versarial proceedings, he should not be forced to confrontthe police during interrogation without the assistance of

counsel. See post, at 179-181. But the acceptance of coun-sel at an arraignment or similar proceeding only begs the
question: acceptance of counsel for what? It is quite unre-markable that a suspect might want the assistance of an expert in the law to guide him through hearings and trial, and
the attendant complex legal matters that might arise, butnonetheless might choose to give on his own a forthright

account of the events that occurred. A court-made rulethat prevents a suspect from even making this choice serves
little purpose, especially given the regime of Miranda and
Edwards.

With these further remarks, I join in full the opinion ofthe Court.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

This case focuses upon the meaning of a single word, "offense," when it arises in the context of the Sixth Amendment. Several basic background principles define thatcontext.

First, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel plays a cen-tral role in ensuring the fairness of criminal proceedings
in our system of justice. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372U. S. 335, 344 (1963);

Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57
(1932).

Second, the right attaches when adversary proceedings,
triggered by the government's formal accusation of a crime,
begin. See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 401 (1977);
Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689 (1972); Massiah v. United
States, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964).

Third, once this right attaches, law enforcement officials
are required, in most circumstances, to deal with the defendant through counsel rather than directly, even if the
defendant has waived his Fifth Amendment rights. See
Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 633, 636 (1986) (waiver

of right to presence of counsel is assumed invalid unless ac-cused initiates communication);

Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S.
159, 176 (1985) (Sixth Amendment gives defendant right "torely on counsel as a `medium' between him and the State").

Cf. ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2001)(lawyer is generally prohibited from communicating with
a person known to be represented by counsel "about the
subject of the representation" without counsel's "consent");Green, A Prosecutor's Communications with Defendants:

What Are the Limits?, 24 Crim. L. Bull. 283, 284, and n. 5(1988) (version of Model Rule 4.2 or its predecessor has been
adopted by all 50 States).

Fourth, the particular aspect of the right here at issue--
the rule that the police ordinarily must communicate with
the defendant through counsel--has important limits. In
particular, recognizing the need for law enforcement officials
to investigate "new or additional crimes" not the subject
of current proceedings, Maine v. Moulton, supra, at 179,
this Court has made clear that the right to counsel does not
attach to any and every crime that an accused may commit
or have committed, see McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171,
175-176 (1991). The right "cannot be invoked once for all
future prosecutions," and it does not forbid "interrogation
unrelated to the charge." Id., at 175, 178. In a word, as
this Court previously noted, the right is "offense specific."
Id., at 175.

This case focuses upon the last-mentioned principle, in
particular upon the meaning of the words "offense specific."
These words appear in this Court's Sixth Amendment case
law, not in the Sixth Amendment's text. See U. S. Const.,
Amdt. 6 (guaranteeing right to counsel "[i]n all criminal
prosecutions"). The definition of these words is not selfevident. Sometimes the term "offense" may refer to words
that are written in a criminal statute; sometimes it may refer
generally to a course of conduct in the world, aspects of
which constitute the elements of one or more crimes; and

532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

179Cite as: 532 U. S. 162 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
sometimes it may refer, narrowly and technically, just tothe conceptually severable aspects of the latter. This case

requires us to determine whether an "offense"--for SixthAmendment purposes--includes factually related aspects of
a single course of conduct other than those few acts thatmake up the essential elements of the crime charged.

We should answer this question in light of the Sixth
Amendment's basic objectives as set forth in this Court'scase law. At the very least, we should answer it in a way

that does not undermine those objectives. But the Courttoday decides that "offense" means the crime set forth within
"the four corners of a charging instrument," along with
other crimes that "would be considered the same offense"
under the test established by Blockburger v. United States,
284 U. S. 299 (1932). Ante, at 173. In my view, this unnecessarily technical definition undermines Sixth Amendment protections while doing nothing to further effective
law enforcement.

For one thing, the majority's rule, while leaving the Fifth
Amendment's protections in place, threatens to diminish
severely the additional protection that, under this Court's
rulings, the Sixth Amendment provides when it grants
the right to counsel to defendants who have been charged
with a crime and insists that law enforcement officers thereafter communicate with them through that counsel. See,
e. g., Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 632 (Sixth Amendment prevents police from questioning represented defendant through informants even when Fifth Amendment would
not); Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300, n. 4 (1980)
(Fifth Amendment right, unlike Sixth, applies only in custodial interrogation).

Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, and Justice
Thomas, if not the majority, apparently believe these protections constitutionally unimportant, for, in their view, "the
underlying theory of Jackson seems questionable." Ante,
at 174 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Both the majority and

concurring opinions suggest that a suspect's ability to invokehis Fifth Amendment right and "refuse any police questioning" offers that suspect adequate constitutional protection.
Ante, at 172, n. 2 (majority opinion); see also ante, at 175-176
(Kennedy, J., concurring). But that is not so.

Jackson focuses upon a suspect--perhaps a frightened or
uneducated suspect--who, hesitant to rely upon his own unaided judgment in his dealings with the police, has invokedhis constitutional right to legal assistance in such matters.

See Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S., at 634, n. 7 (" `The simplefact that [a] defendant has requested an attorney indicates
that he does not believe that he is sufficiently capable of dealing with his adversaries singlehandedly' ") (quoting People
v. Bladel, 421 Mich. 39, 63-64, 365 N. W. 2d 56, 67 (1984)).
Jackson says that, once such a request has been made, the
police may not simply throw that suspect--who does not
trust his own unaided judgment--back upon his own devices
by requiring him to rely for protection upon that same unaided judgment that he previously rejected as inadequate.
In a word, the police may not force a suspect who has asked
for legal counsel to make a critical legal choice without the
legal assistance that he has requested and that the Constitution guarantees. See McNeil v. Wisconsin, supra, at 177-
178 ("The purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guarantee . . . is to `protec[t] the unaided layman at critical
confrontations' with his `expert adversary' ") (quoting United
States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 189 (1984)). The Constitution does not take away with one hand what it gives with the
other. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S., at 344 (Sixth
Amendment means that a person charged with a crime need
not "face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him"); Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 633, 635 (presuming "that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at every critical stage
of the prosecution" even if the defendant fails to invoke his
Fifth Amendment rights at the time of interrogation);
cf. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981) (when

accused has expressed desire to deal with police throughcounsel, police may not reinitiate interrogation until counsel

has been made available); ABA Ann. Model Rule of Profes-sional Conduct 4.2, p. 398, comment. (4th ed. 1999) ("Rule
4.2 . . . exists to prevent lawyers from taking advantage ofuncounseled laypersons and to preserve the integrity of the
lawyer-client relationship").

For these reasons, the Sixth Amendment right at issue isindependent of the Fifth Amendment's protections; and the

importance of this Sixth Amendment right has been repeat-edly recognized in our cases. See,

e. g., Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 636 ("We conclude that the assertion [of the
right to counsel] is no less significant, and the need for additional safeguards no less clear, when the request for counsel is made at an arraignment and when the basis for the
claim is the Sixth Amendment").

Justice Kennedy primarily relies upon Patterson v.
Illinois, 487 U. S. 285 (1988), in support of his conclusion
that Jackson is not good law. He quotes Patterson's statement that the Constitution does " `not ba[r] an accused from
making an initial election as to whether' " to speak with
the police without counsel's assistance. Ante, at 175 (quoting Patterson v. Illinois, supra, at 291).

This statement, however, cannot justify the overruling
of Jackson. That is because, in Patterson itself, this Court
noted, "as a matter of some significance," that, at the time
he was interrogated, the defendant had neither retained nor
accepted the appointment of counsel. 487 U. S., at 290, n. 3.
We characterized our holding in Jackson as having depended
upon "the fact that the accused `ha[d] asked for the help of a
lawyer' in dealing with the police," 487 U. S., at 291 (quoting
Michigan v. Jackson, supra, at 631), and explained that,
"[o]nce an accused has a lawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of the
attorney-client relationship takes effect," 487 U. S., at 290,
n. 3 (citing Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S., at 176).

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy also criticizes Jackson on the groundthat it prevents a suspect "from . . . making th[e] choice" to

"give . . . a forthright account of the events that occurred."
Ante, at 177. But that is not so. A suspect may initiate
communication with the police, thereby avoiding the riskthat the police induced him to make, unaided, the kind of

critical legal decision best made with the help of counsel,
whom he has requested.Unlike

Justice Kennedy, the majority does not call Jackson itself into question. But the majority would underminethat case by significantly diminishing the Sixth Amendment

protections that the case provides. That is because criminal
codes are lengthy and highly detailed, often proliferating
"overlapping and related statutory offenses" to the point
where prosecutors can easily "spin out a startlingly numerous series of offenses from a single . . . criminal transaction."
Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, 445, n. 10 (1970). Thus, an
armed robber who reaches across a store counter, grabs
the cashier, and demands "your money or your life," may
through that single instance of conduct have committed several "offenses," in the majority's sense of the term, including
armed robbery, assault, battery, trespass, use of a firearm to
commit a felony, and perhaps possession of a firearm by a
felon, as well. A person who is using and selling drugs on
a single occasion might be guilty of possessing various drugs,
conspiring to sell drugs, being under the influence of illegal
drugs, possessing drug paraphernalia, possessing a gun in
relation to the drug sale, and, depending upon circumstances,
violating various gun laws as well. A protester blocking
an entrance to a federal building might also be trespassing,
failing to disperse, unlawfully assembling, and obstructing
Government administration all at one and the same time.

The majority's rule permits law enforcement officials
to question those charged with a crime without first approaching counsel, through the simple device of asking questions about any other related crime not actually charged in

532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN

183Cite as: 532 U. S. 162 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
the indictment. Thus, the police could ask the individualcharged with robbery about, say, the assault of the cashier

not yet charged, or about any other uncharged offense (un-less under

Blockburger's definition it counts as the "same
crime"), all without notifying counsel. Indeed, the majori-ty's rule would permit law enforcement officials to question

anyone charged with any crime in any one of the examples
just given about his or her conduct on the single relevantoccasion without notifying counsel unless the prosecutor

has charged every possible crime arising out of that samebrief course of conduct. What Sixth Amendment sense--
what common sense--does such a rule make? What is left
of the "communicate through counsel" rule? The majority's
approach is inconsistent with any common understanding
of the scope of counsel's representation. It will undermine
the lawyer's role as " `medium' " between the defendant and
the government. Maine v. Moulton, supra, at 176. And it
will, on a random basis, remove a significant portion of the
protection that this Court has found inherent in the Sixth
Amendment.

In fact, under the rule today announced by the majority,
two of the seminal cases in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence would have come out differently. In Maine v.
Moulton, which the majority points out "expressly referred
to the offense-specific nature of the Sixth Amendment right
to counsel," ante, at 170, we treated burglary and theft as
the same offense for Sixth Amendment purposes. Despite
the opinion's clear statement that "[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth
Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses," 474 U. S., at 180, n. 16, the
Court affirmed the lower court's reversal of both burglary
and theft charges even though, at the time that the incriminating statements at issue were made, Moulton had been
charged only with theft by receiving, id., at 162, 167, 180.
Under the majority's rule, in contrast, because theft by re532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:49] PAGES PGT: OPIN
184 TEXAS v. COBB

Breyer, J., dissenting
ceiving and burglary each required proof of a fact that theother did not, only Moulton's theft convictions should have

been overturned. Compare Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A,$ 359 (1981) (theft) (requiring knowing receipt, retention, or
disposal of stolen property with the intent to deprive theowner thereof), with $ 401 (burglary) (requiring entry of a
structure without permission and with the intent to commit
a crime).In

Brewer v. Williams, the effect of the majority's rule
would have been even more dramatic. Because first-degreemurder and child abduction each required proof of a fact

not required by the other, and because at the time of the
impermissible interrogation Williams had been charged only
with abduction of a child, Williams' murder conviction should
have remained undisturbed. See 430 U. S., at 390, 393-395,
406. Compare Iowa Code $ 690.2 (1950 and Supp. 1978)
(first-degree murder) (requiring a killing) with Iowa Code

$ 706.2 (1950) (repealed 1978) (child-stealing) (requiring proof
that a child under 16 was taken with the intent to conceal
the child from his or her parent or guardian). This is not
to suggest that this Court has previously addressed and
decided the question presented by this case. Rather, it is
to point out that the Court's conception of the Sixth Amendment right at the time that Moulton and Brewer were decided naturally presumed that it extended to factually related but uncharged offenses.

At the same time, the majority's rule threatens the legal
clarity necessary for effective law enforcement. That is
because the majority, aware that the word "offense" ought
to encompass something beyond "the four corners of the
charging instrument," imports into Sixth Amendment
law the definition of "offense" set forth in Blockburger v.
United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), a case interpreting the
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which
Clause uses the word "offence" but otherwise has no relevance here. Whatever Fifth Amendment virtues Block532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

185Cite as: 532 U. S. 162 (2001)
Breyer, J., dissenting
burger may have, to import it into this Sixth Amendmentcontext will work havoc.

In theory, the test says that two offenses are the "sameoffense" unless each requires proof of a fact that the other
does not. See ante, at 173 (majority opinion). That meansthat most of the different crimes mentioned above are not
the "same offense." Under many States' laws, for example, the statute defining assault and the statute definingrobbery each requires proof of a fact that the other does

not. Compare, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 211 (West 1999)(robbery) (requiring taking of personal property of another)
with $ 240 (assault) (requiring attempt to commit violent
injury). Hence the extension of the definition of "offense"
that is accomplished by the use of the Blockburger test
does nothing to address the substantial concerns about the
circumvention of the Sixth Amendment right that are raised
by the majority's rule.

But, more to the point, the simple-sounding Blockburger
test has proved extraordinarily difficult to administer in
practice. Judges, lawyers, and law professors often disagree about how to apply it. See, e. g., United States v.
Woodward, 469 U. S. 105, 108 (1985) (per curiam) (holding
that lower court misapplied Blockburger test). Compare
United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 697-700 (1993) (opinion
of Scalia, J.) (applying Blockburger and concluding that
contempt is same offense as underlying substantive crime),
with 509 U. S., at 716-720 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (applying Blockburger and deciding that the two are separate offenses). The test has
emerged as a tool in an area of our jurisprudence that The
Chief Justice has described as "a veritable Sargasso Sea
which could not fail to challenge the most intrepid judicial
navigator." Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 343
(1981). Yet the Court now asks, not the lawyers and judges
who ordinarily work with double jeopardy law, but police
officers in the field, to navigate Blockburger when they ques532US1 Unit: $U37 [09-19-02 20:30:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
tion suspects. Cf. New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458(1981) (noting importance of clear rules to guide police behavior). Some will apply the test successfully; some willnot. Legal challenges are inevitable. The result, I believe,
will resemble not so much the Sargasso Sea as the criminallaw equivalent of Milton's "Serbonian Bog . . . Where Armies
whole have sunk."

There is, of course, an alternative. We can, and should,define "offense" in terms of the conduct that constitutes

the crime that the offender committed on a particular occa-sion, including criminal acts that are "closely related to"
or "inextricably intertwined with" the particular crime set
forth in the charging instrument. This alternative is not
perfect. The language used lacks the precision for which
police officers may hope; and it requires lower courts to
specify its meaning further as they apply it in individual
cases. Yet virtually every lower court in the United States
to consider the issue has defined "offense" in the Sixth
Amendment context to encompass such closely related acts.
See ante, at 168, n. 1 (majority opinion) (citing cases from the
Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits as well as
state courts in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania); Taylor
v. State, 726 So. 2d 841, 845 (Fla. App. 1999); People v.
Clankie, 124 Ill. 2d 456, 462-466, 530 N. E. 2d 448, 451-453
(1988); State v. Tucker, 137 N. J. 259, 277-278, 645 A. 2d 111,
120-121 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1090 (1995). These
courts have found offenses "closely related" where they involved the same victim, set of acts, evidence, or motivation.
See, e. g., Taylor v. State, supra, at 845 (stolen property
charges and burglary); State v. Tucker, supra, at 278, 645
A. 2d, at 121 (burglary, robbery, and murder of home's occupant); In re Pack, 420 Pa. Super. 347, 355-356, 616 A. 2d

location, or factual circumstances significantly separated the

one from the other. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Rainwater,425 Mass. 540, 547-549, and n. 7, 681 N. E. 2d 1218, 1224,

and n. 7 (1997) (vehicle theft charge and earlier vehicle theftsin same area), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 1095 (1998);

N. E. 2d 143, 149 (murder and weapons charges), appeal de-nied, 141 Ill. 2d 549, 580 N. E. 2d 123 (1991).

One cannot say in favor of this commonly followed ap-proach that it is perfectly clear--only that, because it comports with common sense, it is far easier to apply than that
of the majority. One might add that, unlike the majority's
test, it is consistent with this Court's assumptions in previous cases. See Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S., at 162, 167,
180 (affirming reversal of both burglary and theft convictions); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S., at 389, 390, 393, 406
(affirming grant of habeas which vacated murder conviction).
And, most importantly, the "closely related" test furthers,
rather than undermines, the Sixth Amendment's "right to
counsel," a right so necessary to the realization in practice
of that most "noble ideal," a fair trial. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S., at 344.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following this commonly accepted approach, found that the charged burglary
and the uncharged murders were "closely related." All
occurred during a short period of time on the same day in
the same basic location. The victims of the murders were
also victims of the burglary. Cobb committed one of the
murders in furtherance of the robbery, the other to cover up
the crimes. The police, when questioning Cobb, knew that
he already had a lawyer representing him on the burglary charges and had demonstrated their belief that this
lawyer also represented Cobb in respect to the murders
by asking his permission to question Cobb about the murders on previous occasions. The relatedness of the crimes

is well illustrated by the impossibility of questioning Cobbabout the murders without eliciting admissions about the

burglary. See, e. g., Tr. 157 (Feb. 19, 1997) (testimony bypolice officer who obtained murder confession) ("Basically
what he told us is he had gone over to the house to bur-glarize it and nobody was home"); 22 Record, State's Exh. 20
(typed statement by Cobb) (admitting that he committed themurders after entering the house and stealing stereo parts).
Nor, in my view, did Cobb waive his right to counsel. See
supra, at 180-181. These considerations are sufficient.The police officers ought to have spoken to Cobb's counsel

before questioning Cobb. I would affirm the decision of theTexas court.

Consequently, I dissent.

LUJAN, LABOR COMMISSIONER OF CALIFORNIA,

et al. v. G & G FIRE SPRINKLERS, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-152. Argued February 26, 2001--Decided April 17, 2001
The California Labor Code (Code) authorizes the State to order withholding of payments due a contractor on a public works project if a
subcontractor on the project fails to comply with certain Code requirements; permits the contractor, in turn, to withhold similar sums from
the subcontractor; and permits the contractor, or his assignee, to sue
the awarding body for alleged breach of the contract in not making
payment to recover the wages or penalties withheld. After petitioner
State Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) determined
that respondent G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (G & G), as a subcontractor
on three public works projects, had violated the Code, it issued notices
directing the awarding bodies on those projects to withhold from the
contractors an amount equal to the wages and penalties forfeited due
to G & G's violations. The awarding bodies withheld payment from
the contractors, who in turn withheld G & G's payment. G & G filed a
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit against DLSE and other state petitioners in
the District Court, claiming that the issuance of the notices without a
hearing deprived it of property without due process in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The court granted G & G summary judgment, declared the relevant Code sections unconstitutional, and enjoined
the State from enforcing the provisions against G & G. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. This Court granted certiorari, vacated that judgment,
and remanded for reconsideration in light of its decision in American
Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U. S. 40, that the respondents there
had no property interest in payment for disputed medical treatment
pending review of the treatment's reasonableness and necessity, as authorized by state law. On remand, the Ninth Circuit reinstated its
prior judgment and opinion, explaining that G & G's rights were violated not because it was deprived of immediate payment, but because
the state statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all.

Held: Because state law affords G & G sufficient opportunity to pursue

its claim for payment under its contracts in state court, the statutory
scheme does not deprive it of due process. In each of this Court's

cases relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, the claimant was denied a right
by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to exercise ownership dominion over real or personal property, or to pursue a gainful occupation. See, e. g., United States v. James Daniel Good Real
Property, 510 U. S. 43, 62. Unlike those claimants, G & G has not been
deprived of any present entitlement. It has been deprived of payment
that it contends it is owed under a contract, based on the State's determination that it failed to comply with the contract's terms. That property interest can be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract
suit. If California makes ordinary judicial process available to G & G
for resolving its contractual dispute, that process is due process. Here,
the Code, by allowing a contractor to assign the right of suit, provides
a means by which a subcontractor may bring a breach-of-contract suit
to recover withheld payments. That damages may not be awarded
until the suit's conclusion does not deprive G & G of its claim. Even
if G & G could not obtain assignment, it appears that a breach-ofcontract suit against the contractor remains available under state
common law, although final determination of the question rests in the
hands of the California courts. Pp. 195-199.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the
Court.

The California Labor Code (Code or Labor Code) authorizes the State to order withholding of payments due a
contractor on a public works project if a subcontractor on
the project fails to comply with certain Code requirements.
The Code permits the contractor, in turn, to withhold similar
sums from the subcontractor. The Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit held that the relevant Code provisions violate
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutory scheme does not afford the subcontractor
a hearing before or after such action is taken. We granted
certiorari, 531 U. S. 924 (2000), and we reverse.

Petitioners are the California Division of Labor Standards
Enforcement (DLSE), the California Department of Industrial Relations, and several state officials in their official
capacities. Respondent G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. (G & G),
is a fire-protection company that installs fire sprinkler systems. G & G served as a subcontractor on several California public works projects. "Public works" include construction work done under contract and paid for in whole or part
by public funds. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. $ 1720 (West Supp.
2001). The department, board, authority, officer, or agent
awarding a contract for public work is called the "awarding
body." $ 1722 (West 1989). The California Labor Code requires that contractors and subcontractors on such projects
pay their workers a prevailing wage that is determined by
the State. $$ 1771, 1772, 1773 (West 1989 and Supp. 2001).
At the time relevant here, if workers were not paid the prevailing wage, the contractor was required to pay each worker
the difference between the prevailing wage and the wages
paid, in addition to forfeiting a penalty to the State. $ 1775

The Labor Code provides that "[b]efore making paymentsto the contractor of money due under a contract for public
work, the awarding body shall withhold and retain there-from all wages and penalties which have been forfeited

Amendments to $ 1775 also state that either the contractor or the subcontractor may pay workers the difference between the prevailing wage

Commissioner in certain circumstances); $ 1775(b)(3) (contractor shall
take corrective action to halt subcontractor's failure to pay prevailing

retains the wages and penalties "pending the outcome of the
suit." $ 1731.3

In 1995, DLSE determined that G & G, as a subcontractor
on three public works projects, had violated the Labor Code
by failing to pay the prevailing wage and failing to keep
and/or furnish payroll records upon request. DLSE issued
notices to the awarding bodies on those projects, directing
them to withhold from the contractors an amount equal to
the wages and penalties forfeited due to G & G's violations.
The awarding bodies withheld payment from the contractors,
who in turn withheld payment from G & G. The total withheld, according to respondent, exceeded $135,000. App. 68.

G & G sued petitioners in the District Court for the Central District of California. G & G sought declaratory and
injunctive relief pursuant to Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983, claiming that the issuance of withholding notices
without a hearing constituted a deprivation of property
without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The District Court granted respondent's
motion for summary judgment, declared $$ 1727, 1730-1733,
1775, 1776(g), and 1813 of the Labor Code unconstitutional,
and enjoined the State from enforcing these provisions

3 Sections 1730-1733 of the Code have been repealed, effective July 1,
2001. Section 1742 has replaced them. It provides that "[a]n affected
contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of a civil wage and penalty
assessment [under the Code] by transmitting a written request to the
office of the Labor Commissioner." $ 1742(a). The contractor or subcontractor is then entitled to a hearing before the Director of Industrial
Relations, who shall appoint an impartial hearing officer. Within 45 days
of the hearing, the director shall issue a written decision affirming, modifying, or dismissing the assessment. A contractor or subcontractor may
obtain review of the director's decision by filing a petition for a writ of
the mandate in state superior court. $$ 1742(b), (c). These provisions
are not yet in effect and these procedures were not available to respondent
at the time of the withholding of payments at issue here.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-cuit affirmed.

G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc. v. Bradshaw, 156
F. 3d 893, 898 (1998) (Bradshaw I). The court concludedthat G & G "has a property interest in being paid in full for

the construction work it has completed," id., at 901, and
found that G & G was deprived of that interest "as a resultof the state's action,"

id., at 903. It decided that because
subcontractors were "afforded neither a pre- nor post-deprivation hearing when payments [were] withheld," the

statutory scheme violated the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 904.

Following Bradshaw I, we decided American Mfrs. Mut.
Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U. S. 40 (1999), where respondents
also alleged a deprivation of property without due process
of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sullivan
involved a challenge to a private insurer's decision to withhold payment for disputed medical treatment pending review of its reasonableness and necessity, as authorized by
state law. We held that the insurer's action was not "fairly
attributable to the State," and that respondents therefore
failed to satisfy a critical element of their $ 1983 claim.
Id., at 58. We also decided that because state law entitled
respondents to reasonable and necessary medical treatment,
respondents had no property interest in payment for medical
treatment not yet deemed to meet those criteria. Id., at 61.
We granted certiorari in Bradshaw I, vacated the judgment
of the Court of Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration
in light of Sullivan. Bradshaw v. G & G Fire Sprinklers,

On remand, the Court of Appeals reinstated its prior
judgment and opinion, again by a divided vote. The court
held that the withholding of payments was state action because it was "specifically directed by State officials . . . [and]
the withholding party has no discretion." G & G Fire

Opinion of the Court
Sprinklers, Inc. v. Bradshaw, 204 F. 3d 941, 944 (CA9 2000).In its view, its prior opinion was consistent with

Sullivan
because it "specifically held that G & G did not have a rightto payment of the disputed funds pending the outcome of

whatever kind of hearing would be afforded," and "explicitlyauthorized the withholding of payments pending the hearing." 204 F. 3d, at 943. The court explained that G & G's
rights were violated not because it was deprived of immedi-ate payment, but "because the California statutory scheme

afforded no hearing at all when state officials directed thatpayments be withheld."

Id., at 943-944.
Where a state law such as this is challenged on due process grounds, we inquire whether the State has deprived
the claimant of a protected property interest, and whether
the State's procedures comport with due process. Sullivan,
supra, at 59. We assume, without deciding, that the withholding of money due respondent under its contracts occurred under color of state law, and that, as the Court of
Appeals concluded, respondent has a property interest of the
kind we considered in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455
U. S. 422 (1982), in its claim for payment under its contracts.
204 F. 3d, at 943-944. Because we believe that California
law affords respondent sufficient opportunity to pursue that
claim in state court, we conclude that the California statutory scheme does not deprive G & G of its claim for payment without due process of law. See Logan, supra, at 433
("[T]he Due Process Clause grants the aggrieved party the
opportunity to present his case and have its merits fairly
judged").

The Court of Appeals relied upon several of our cases
dealing with claims of deprivation of a property interest
without due process to hold that G & G was entitled to a
reasonably prompt hearing when payments were withheld.

to commit or to facilitate commission of a federal drug of-fense notice and a hearing before seizing the property. 510
U. S., at 62. In Barchi, we held that a racetrack trainersuspended for 15 days on suspicion of horse drugging was
entitled to a prompt postdeprivation administrative or judi-cial hearing. 443 U. S., at 63-64. And in

Mallen, we heldthat the president of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured bank suspended from office by the FDICwas accorded due process by a notice and hearing procedure which would render a decision within 90 days of thesuspension. 486 U. S., at 241-243. See also Sniadach v.
Family Finance Corp. of Bay View, 395 U. S. 337 (1969)(holding that due process requires notice and a hearing before wages may be garnished).In each of these cases, the claimant was denied a right
by virtue of which he was presently entitled either to ex-ercise ownership dominion over real or personal property,
or to pursue a gainful occupation. Unlike those claimants,respondent has not been denied any present entitlement.
G & G has been deprived of payment that it contends itis owed under a contract, based on the State's determination that G & G failed to comply with the contract's terms.G & G has only a claim that it did comply with those terms
and therefore that it is entitled to be paid in full. Thoughwe assume for purposes of decision here that G & G has a
property interest in its claim for payment, see supra, at 195,it is an interest, unlike the interests discussed above, that
can be fully protected by an ordinary breach-of-contract suit.In

Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S.886, 895 (1961) (citations omitted), we said:

"The very nature of due process negates any conceptof inflexible procedures universally applicable to every
imaginable situation. ` "[D]ue process," unlike somelegal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed

content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.' Itis `compounded of history, reason, the past course of

decisions . . . .' "
We hold that if California makes ordinary judicial processavailable to respondent for resolving its contractual dispute,

that process is due process.The California Labor Code provides that "the contractor
or his or her assignee" may sue the awarding body "onthe contract for alleged breach thereof " for "the recovery
of wages or penalties." $$ 1731, 1732 (West Supp. 2001).There is no basis here to conclude that the contractor would
refuse to assign the right of suit to its subcontractor. Infact, respondent stated at oral argument that it has sued
awarding bodies in state superior court pursuant to $$ 1731-1733 of the Labor Code to recover payments withheld on
previous projects where it served as a subcontractor. SeeTr. of Oral Arg. 27, 40-41, 49-50. Presumably, respondent brought suit as an assignee of the contractors on thoseprojects, as the Code requires. $ 1732 (West Supp. 2001).
Thus, the Labor Code, by allowing assignment, provides ameans by which a subcontractor may bring a claim for breach
of contract to recover wages and penalties withheld.Respondent complains that a suit under the Labor Code
is inadequate because the awarding body retains the wagesand penalties "pending the outcome of the suit," $ 1731,
which may last several years. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. A law-suit of that duration, while undoubtedly something of a
hardship, cannot be said to deprive respondent of its claimfor payment under the contract. Lawsuits are not known
for expeditiously resolving claims, and the standard practicein breach-of-contract suits is to award damages, if appropriate, only at the conclusion of the case.Even if respondent could not obtain assignment of the
right to sue the awarding body under the contract, it ap-pears that a suit for breach of contract against the contractor remains available under California common law. See 1

Opinion of the Court
B. Witkin, Summary of California Law $$ 791, 797 (9th ed.1987) (defining breach as the "unjustified or unexcused . . .

failure to perform a contract" and describing the remediesavailable under state law). To be sure, $ 1732 of the Labor
Code provides that suit on the contract against the awardingbody is the "exclusive remedy of the contractor or his or her
assignees" with respect to recovery of withheld wages and
penalties. $ 1732 (West Supp. 2001). But the remedy is ex-clusive only with respect to the contractor and his assignees,

and thus by its terms not the exclusive remedy for a subcon-tractor who does not receive assignment. See,

e. g., J & K
Painting Co., Inc. v. Bradshaw, 45 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1402,
53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 496, 501 (1996) (allowing subcontractor to
challenge Labor Commissioner's action by petition for a writ
of the mandate).

In J & K Painting, the California Court of Appeal rejected the argument that $ 1732 requires a subcontractor
to obtain an assignment and that failure to do so is "fatal to
any other attempt to secure relief." Id., at 1401, n. 7, 53
Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 501, n. 7. The Labor Code does not expressly impose such a requirement, and that court declined
to infer an intent to "create remedial exclusivity" in this
context. Ibid. It thus appears that subcontractors like respondent may pursue their claims for payment by bringing
a standard breach-of-contract suit against the contractor
under California law. Our view is necessarily tentative,
since the final determination of the question rests in the
hands of the California courts, but respondent has not convinced us that this avenue of relief is closed to it. See id.,
at 1401, and n. 4, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 500, and n. 4 (noting
that the contractor might assert a variety of defenses to the
subcontractor's suit for breach of contract without evaluating
their soundness). As the party challenging the statutory
withholding scheme, respondent bears the burden of demonstrating its unconstitutionality. Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462
U. S. 919, 944 (1983) (statutes presumed constitutional). We

UNITED STATES v. CLEVELAND INDIANSBASEBALL CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-203. Argued February 27, 2001--Decided April 17, 2001
Under a grievance settlement agreement, respondent Cleveland Indians

Baseball Company (Company) owed 8 players backpay for wages due
in 1986 and 14 players backpay for wages due in 1987. The Company
paid the back wages in 1994. This case presents the question whether,
under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal
Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), the back wages should be taxed by
reference to the year they were actually paid (1994) or, instead, by reference to the years they should have been paid (1986 and 1987). Both
tax rates and the amount of the wages subject to tax (the wage base)
have risen over time. Consequently, allocating the 1994 payments
back to 1986 and 1987 would generate no additional FICA or FUTA
tax liability for the Company and its former employees, while treating the back wages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Company
and the employees to significant tax liability. The Company paid its
share of employment taxes on the back wages according to 1994 tax
rates and wage bases. After the Internal Revenue Service denied
its claims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiated this
action in District Court. The Company relied on Sixth Circuit precedent holding that a settlement for back wages should not be allocated
to the period when the employer finally pays but to the periods when
the wages were not paid as usual. The District Court, bound by that
precedent, entered judgment for the Company and ordered the Government to refund FICA and FUTA taxes. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to

the year the wages are in fact paid. Pp. 208-220.

(a) The Internal Revenue Code imposes FICA and FUTA taxes "on
every employer . . . equal to [a percentage of] wages . . . paid by him
with respect to employment." 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301.
The Social Security tax provision, $ 3111(a), prescribes tax rates applicable to "wages paid during" each year from 1984 onward. The Medicare
tax provision, $ 3111(b)(6), sets the tax rate "with respect to wages
paid after December 31, 1985." And the FUTA tax provision, $ 3301,
sets the rate as a percentage "in the case of calendar years 1988 through

Syllabus
2007 . . . of the total wages . . . paid by [the employer] during the calendar year." Section 3121(a) establishes the annual ceiling on wages
subject to Social Security tax by defining "wages" to exclude any remuneration "paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar
year" that exceeds "remuneration . . . equal to the contribution and
benefit base . . . paid to [such] individual . . . during the calendar year
with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective."
Section 3306(b)(1) similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax.
Pp. 208-209.

(b) The Government calls attention to these provisions' constant references to wages paid during a calendar year as the touchstone for
determining the applicable tax rate and wage base. The meaning of
this language, the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed
according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardless of when
they should have been paid. The Court agrees with the Company that
Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, undermines the Government's plain language argument. The Nierotko Court concluded that,
for purposes of determining a wrongfully discharged worker's eligibility
for Social Security benefits under $ 209(g), as that provision was formulated in the 1939 Amendments to the Social Security Act, a backpay
award had to be allocated as wages to calendar quarters of the year
"when the regular wages were not paid as usual." Id., at 370, and n. 25.
The Court found no conflict between this allocation-back rule and language in $ 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to the number of calendar
quarters "in which" a minimum amount of "wages" "has been paid."
Nierotko's allocation holding for benefits eligibility purposes, which
the Government does not here urge the Court to overrule, thus turned
on an implicit construction of $ 209(g)'s terms--"wages" "paid" "in"
"a calendar quarter"--to include "regular wages" that should have
been paid but "were not paid as usual," id., at 370. Given this construction, it cannot be said that the FICA and FUTA provisions prescribing
tax rates based on wages paid during a calendar year have a plain
meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have
been paid. Pp. 209-212.

(c) However, the Court rejects the Company's contention that, because Nierotko read the 1939 "wages paid" language for benefits eligibility purposes to accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, the
identical 1939 "wages paid" language for tax purposes must be read the
same way. Nierotko dealt specifically and only with Social Security
benefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocation holding in
Nierotko in all likelihood reflected concern that the benefits scheme
created in 1939 would be disserved by allowing an employer's wrong532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus

doing to reduce the quarters of coverage an employee would otherwise
be entitled to claim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies
the tax provisions. The legislative history demonstrates that the 1939
Amendments adopting the "wages paid" rule for taxation were designed to address Congress' worry that, as tax rates increased from
year to year, administrative difficulties and confusion would attend
the taxation of wages payable in one year, but not actually paid until
another year. Pp. 212-214.

(d) The Court is not persuaded Congress incorporated Nierotko's
treatment of backpay into the tax provisions when it amended the Social
Security Act shortly after Nierotko was decided. Prior to 1946, the
FICA and FUTA wage bases were defined in terms of remuneration
paid with respect to employment during a given year. The 1946 law
amended $ 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for purposes of benefits calculation, by adopting the "wages paid" language
already present in $ 209(g), the provision construed in Nierotko. Congress also used identical "wages paid" language in redefining the FICA
and FUTA wage bases for tax purposes. Although the legislative history makes clear that Congress sought to achieve conformity between
the tax and benefits provisions, the conformity Congress sought had
nothing to do with Nierotko's treatment of backpay. Rather, Congress'
purpose in amending the FICA and FUTA wage bases for tax and benefits purposes was to define the yardstick for measuring "wages" as the
amount paid during the calendar year without regard to the year in
which the employment occurred. Because the concern that animates
Nierotko's treatment of backpay in the benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a desire for conformity not only with respect to the general rule for measuring "wages," but also with respect to Nierotko's backpay exception.
Pp. 214-216.

(e) There is some force to the Company's contention that the Government's refusal to allocate back wages to the year they should have been
paid creates inequities in taxation and incentives for strategic behavior
that Congress did not intend. But this case presents no structural unfairness in taxation comparable to the structural inequity in Nierotko's
context. In Nierotko, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year
it is actually paid would never work to the employee's advantage; it
could inure only to the detriment of the employee, counter to the thrust
of the benefits eligibility provisions. Here, by contrast, the Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as in this case; other
times it works to the disadvantage of the fisc. Anomalous results must
be considered in light of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexity and minimizing administrative confusion within the FICA and

Syllabus
FUTA tax schemes. Given these concerns, it cannot be said that the
Government's rule is incompatible with the statutory scheme. The
most that can be said is that Congress intended the tax provisions to
be both efficiently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals
the tension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meet those
twin aims. Pp. 216-218.

(f) Confronted with this tension, the Court defers to the Internal
Revenue Service's interpretation. The Court does not sit as a committee of revision to perfect the administration of the tax laws. United
States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 306-307. Instead, it defers to the Commissioner's regulations as long as they implement the congressional
mandate in a reasonable manner. Id., at 307. The Internal Revenue
Service has long maintained regulations interpreting the FICA and
FUTA tax provisions. In their current form, the regulations specify
that wages must be taxed according to the year they are actually paid.
Echoing the language in 26 U. S. C. $ 3111(a) (FICA) and $ 3301 (FUTA),
these regulations have continued unchanged in their basic substance
since 1940. Although the regulations, like the statute, do not specifically address backpay, the Service has consistently interpreted them
to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages
are actually paid, regardless of when those wages were earned or
should have been paid. The Court need not decide whether the Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to deference. In this case, the
Rulings simply reflect the agency's longstanding interpretation of its
own regulations. Because that interpretation is reasonable, it attracts
substantial judicial deference. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and theFederal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) impose excise taxes

on employee wages to fund Social Security, Medicare, andunemployment compensation programs. This case concerns
the application of FICA and FUTA taxes to payments ofback wages. The Internal Revenue Service has consistently
maintained that, for tax purposes, backpay awards should beattributed to the year the award is actually paid. Respondent Cleveland Indians Baseball Company (Company) urges,and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held, that such
awards must be allocated, as they are for purposes of SocialSecurity benefits eligibility, to the periods in which the
wages should have been paid. According due respect to theService's reasonable, longstanding construction of the governing statutes and its own regulations, we hold that backwages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to
the year the wages are in fact paid.

Pursuant to a settlement of grievances asserted by theMajor League Baseball Players Association concerning players' free agency rights, several Major League Baseball clubsagreed to pay $280 million to players with valid claims for
salary damages. Under the agreement, the Company owed8 players a total of $610,000 in salary damages for 1986, and
it owed 14 players a total of $1,457,848 in salary damagesfor 1987. The Company paid the awards in 1994. No award
recipient was a Company employee in that year.

Opinion of the Court
This case concerns the proper FICA and FUTA tax treat-ment of the 1994 payments. Under FICA, both employees

and employers must pay tax on wages to fund Social Securityand Medicare; under FUTA, employers (but not employees)
must pay tax on wages to fund unemployment benefits.For purposes of this litigation, the Government and the
Company stipulated that the settlement payments awarded
to the players qualify as "wages" within the meaning ofFICA and FUTA. The question presented is whether those

payments, characterized as back wages, should be taxedby reference to the year they were actually paid (1994), as
the Government urges, or by reference to the years theyshould have been paid (1986 and 1987), as the Company and
its supporting amicus, the Major League Baseball PlayersAssociation, contend.

In any given year, the amount of FICA and FUTA taxowed depends on two determinants. The first is the tax
rate. 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101, 3111 (FICA), $ 3301 (FUTA). The
second is the statutory ceiling on taxable wages (also called
the wage base), which limits the amount of annual wages
subject to tax. $ 3121(a)(1) (FICA), $ 3306(b)(1) (FUTA).
Both determinants have increased over time. In 1986, the
Social Security tax on employees and employers was 5.7 percent on wages up to $42,000; 1 in 1987, it was 5.7 percent on
wages up to $43,800; 2 and in 1994, 6.2 percent on wages up
to $60,600.3 Although the Medicare tax on employees and
employers remained constant at 1.45 percent from 1986 to
1994,4 the taxable wage base rose from $42,000 in 1986
to $43,800 in 1987,5 and by 1994, Congress had abolished the

tax.6 In 1986 and 1987, the FUTA tax was 6.0 percent on
wages up to $7,000; 7 in 1994, it was 6.2 percent on wages up
to $7,000.8

In this case, allocating the 1994 payments back to 1986
and 1987 works to the advantage of the Company and its
former employees. The reason is that all but one of the
employees who received back wages in 1994 had already
collected wages from the Company exceeding the taxable
maximum in 1986 and 1987. Because those employees as
well as the Company paid the maximum amount of employment taxes chargeable in 1986 and 1987, allocating the 1994
payments back to those years would generate no additional
FICA or FUTA tax liability. By contrast, treating the back
wages as taxable in 1994 would subject both the Company
and its former employees to significant tax liability. The
Company paid none of the employees any other wages in
1994,9 and FICA and FUTA taxes attributable to that year

Company--would be entitled to a credit or refund of any Social Security
tax paid in excess of the amount of tax due on a single taxable wage
base ($60,600). 26 U. S. C. $ 6413(c)(1). To illustrate, suppose a player
received $50,000 in back wages from the Cleveland Indians and an additional $50,000 in wages from the New York Mets in 1994. Assuming all
$100,000 in wages are taxed in 1994, the player would be entitled to a
credit or refund of Social Security tax paid in excess of the amount of tax
due on $60,600. By contrast, the Indians and the Mets would each be
liable for Social Security taxes on $50,000 in wages paid to that player.
26 U. S. C. $ 3111 (Social Security tax is "an excise tax, with respect to
having individuals in his employ"). Thus, under the Government's proposed rule, the Cleveland Indians would owe Social Security taxes on
all amounts up to $60,600 that it paid to each player in 1994, regardless
of whether the players themselves had reached or exceeded the $60,600
ceiling through multiple wage sources.

would be calculated according to tax rates and wage baseshigher than their levels in 1986 and 1987.

Uncertain about the proper rule of taxation, the Com-pany paid its share of employment taxes on the back wages
according to 1994 tax rates and wage bases. Its FICApayment totaled $99,382, and its FUTA payment totaled
$1,008.10 After the Internal Revenue Service denied itsclaims for a refund of those payments, the Company initiated
this action in District Court, relying on Bowman v. United
States, 824 F. 2d 528 (CA6 1987). In Bowman, the SixthCircuit held that "[a] settlement for back wages should not

be allocated to the period when the employer finally paysbut `should be allocated to the periods when the regular
wages were not paid as usual.' " Id., at 530 (quoting SocialSecurity Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 370 (1946)). The
District Court, bound by Bowman, entered judgment for theCompany and ordered the Government to refund $97,202 in
FICA and FUTA taxes.11On appeal, the Government observed that two Courts
of Appeals have held, in disagreement with Bowman, thatunder the law as implemented by Treasury Regulations,
wages are to be taxed for FICA purposes in the year theyare actually received.

Walker v. United States, 202 F. 3d1290, 1292-1293 (CA10 2000) (finding Nierotko "inapposite"

and Bowman "unpersuasive"); Hemelt v. United States, 122F. 3d 204, 210 (CA4 1997) (finding it "clear under the Treasury Regulations that `wages' are to be taxed for FICA pur-poses in the year in which they are received"). The Court

10 Although the Company also withheld $99,382 to pay the employees'
share of FICA taxes, it does not seek to recover any taxes paid on behalf
of the employees in this suit.

11 This amount is slightly less than the total FICA and FUTA taxes paid

by the Company in 1994. The reason is that one of the employees who
received a 1994 payment for wages due in 1987 received no wages from
the Company in 1987. The Company thus owed a small amount of FICA
and FUTA taxes on the back wages paid to him even when those wages
were allocated back to 1987.

The Internal Revenue Code imposes employment taxes
"on every employer . . . equal to [a percentage of] wages . . .
paid by him with respect to employment." 26 U. S. C.

$$ 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301. The Social Security tax provision,

$ 3111(a), contains a table prescribing tax rates applicable to
"wages paid during" each year from 1984 onward (e. g., "In
cases of wages paid during . . . 1990 or thereafter . . . [t]he
rate shall be . . . 6.2 percent."). The Medicare tax provision, $ 3111(b)(6), says "with respect to wages paid after
December 31, 1985, the rate shall be 1.45 percent." And the
FUTA tax provision, 26 U. S. C. $ 3301 (1994 ed., Supp. IV),
says the rate shall be "6.2 percent in the case of calendar
years 1988 through 2007 . . . of the total wages (as defined in
section 3306(b)) paid by [the employer] during the calendar
year."

Section 3121(a) of the Code establishes the annual ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax. It does so by
defining "wages" to exclude any remuneration "paid to [an]
individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" that
exceeds "remuneration . . . equal to the contribution and
benefit base . . . paid to [such] individual by [such] employer
during the calendar year with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective." Section 3306(b)(1)
similarly limits annual wages subject to FUTA tax by excluding from "wages" any remuneration "paid to [an] individual by [an] employer during [a] calendar year" that exceeds
"remuneration . . . equal to $7,000 . . . paid to [such] individual
by [such] employer during [the] calendar year."

Opinion of the Court
Both sides in this controversy have offered plausible inter-pretations of Congress' design. We set out next the parties'

positions and explain why we ultimately defer to the In-ternal Revenue Service's reasonable, consistent, and longstanding interpretation of the FICA and FUTA provisionsin point. Under that interpretation, wages must be taxed
according to the year they are actually paid.

A
In the Government's view, the text of the controllingFICA and FUTA tax provisions explicitly instructs that

employment taxes shall be computed by applying the taxrate and wage base in effect when wages are actually paid.
In particular, the Government calls attention to the statute'sconstant references to wages paid during a calendar year as
the touchstone for determining the applicable tax rate andwage base. 26 U. S. C. $ 3111(a) (setting Social Security tax
rates for "wages paid during" particular calendar years);$ 3121(a) (defining Social Security wage base in terms of
"remuneration . . . paid . . . during the calendar year"); $ 3301(setting FUTA tax rate as a percentage of "wages . . .
paid . . . during the calendar year"); $ 3306(b)(1) (definingFUTA wage base in terms of "remuneration . . . paid . . .
during any calendar year"). The meaning of this language,the Government contends, is plain: Wages are taxed according to the calendar year they are in fact paid, regardlessof when they should have been paid.

In support of this reading, the Government observes thatCongress chose the words in the current statute specifically
to replace language in the original 1935 Social Security Actproviding that FICA and FUTA tax rates applied to wages
paid or received "with respect to employment during the
calendar year." Social Security Act (1935 Act), $$ 801, 804,901, 49 Stat. 636-637, 639 (emphasis added). The Treasury

Department had interpreted this 1935 language to mean thatwages are taxed at "the rate in effect

at the time of the

performance of the services for which the wages were paid."Treas. Regs. 91, Arts. 202, 302 (1936) (emphasis added). In

1939, Congress amended the 1935 Act to provide that FICAand FUTA tax rates would no longer apply on the basis of
when services were performed, but would instead apply"with respect to

wages paid during the calendar yea[r]."
Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (1939 Amendments), $$ 604, 608, 53 Stat. 1383, 1387 (emphasis added).This 1939 language remains essentially unchanged in the current FICA and FUTA tax provisions, 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a)and 3301.

Acknowledging that the 1939 Amendments established
a "wages paid" rule for FICA and FUTA taxation, the
Company nevertheless argues that Social Security Bd. v.
Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358 (1946), undermines the Government's plain language argument. According due weight to
our precedent, we agree.

In Nierotko, the National Labor Relations Board had
ordered the reinstatement of a wrongfully discharged employee with "back pay" covering wages lost during the
period from February 1937 to September 1939. Id., at 359.
The employer paid the award in July 1941. Id., at 359-360.
The primary question presented and aired in the Court's
opinion was whether backpay for a time in which the employee was not on the job should nevertheless count as
"wages" in determining the employee's eligibility for Social
Security benefits. Id., at 359. Notwithstanding the contrary view of the Social Security Board and the Bureau
of Internal Revenue, the Court held that backpay covering the wrongful discharge period met the definition of
"wages" in the 1935 Act. Id., at 360-370.

In the final two paragraphs of the Nierotko opinion, the
Court took up the question of how the backpay award should
be allocated for purposes of determining the worker's eligibility for benefits. As originally enacted, the Social Security Act extended benefits to persons over 65 who had

earned at least $2,000 in wages in each of any five years after1936. 1935 Act, $$ 201(a), 210(c), 49 Stat. 622, 625. In 1939,

however, Congress introduced a new scheme, which remainsin place today, tying eligibility for benefits to the number
of calendar-year "quarters of coverage" accumulated by anindividual. 1939 Amendments, $$ 209(g), (h), 53 Stat. 1376-
1377 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $$ 413(a)(2), 414). Section 209(g)
defined a "quarter of coverage" as either "a calendar quarterin which the individual has been paid not less than $50 in

wages" or any quarter except the first "where an individualhas been paid in a calendar year $3,000 or more in wages."
53 Stat. 1377.

Nierotko swiftly dispatched the question whether " `back
pay' must be allocated as wages . . . to the `calendar quarters'
of the year in which the money would have been earned, if
the employee had not been wrongfully discharged." 327
U. S., at 370. Rejecting the Government's argument that
such allocation was impermissible because the 1939 Amendments to the benefits scheme refer to " `wages' to be `paid' in
certain `quarters,' " id., at 370, and n. 25 (citing id., at 362,
n. 7 (citing $ 209(g))), the Court concluded: "If, as we have
held above, `back pay' is to be treated as wages, we have no
doubt that it should be allocated to the periods when the
regular wages were not paid as usual." Id., at 370.

Although the allocation question in Nierotko was a secondary issue addressed summarily by the Court, we think the
Company is correct that Nierotko undercuts the plain meaning argument urged by the Government here. Nierotko
found no conflict between an allocation-back rule for backpay
and the language in $ 209(g) tying benefits eligibility to the
number of calendar quarters "in which" a minimum amount
of "wages" "has been paid." The Court's allocation holding
for benefits eligibility purposes, which the Government does
not urge us to overrule, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, thus turned on
an implicit construction of $ 209(g)'s terms--"wages" "paid"
"in" "a calendar quarter"--to include "regular wages" that

should have been paid but "were not paid as usual," 327 U. S.,
at 370. Given this construction of $ 209(g), now codified in
42 U. S. C. $ 413(a)(2), we cannot say that the FICA and
FUTA provisions prescribing tax rates based on wages paid
during a calendar year, codified in 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a),
3301, have a plain meaning that precludes allocation of backpay to the year it should have been paid. Cf. Hilton v.
South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 205
(1991) ("stare decisis is most compelling" where "a pure
question of statutory construction" is involved).

B
From here, we part ways with the Company. Although
we agree that Nierotko blocks the Government's argument
that the "wages paid" formulation in 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a)
and 3301 has a dispositively plain meaning, we reject the
Company's next contention. Because Nierotko read the
1939 "wages paid" language for benefits eligibility purposes
to accommodate an allocation-back rule for backpay, the
Company urges, the identical 1939 "wages paid" language for
tax purposes must be read the same way. We do not agree
that the latter follows from the former like the night, the day.

Nierotko dealt specifically and only with Social Security
benefits eligibility, not with taxation. The Court's allocation
holding in Nierotko in all likelihood reflected concern that
the benefits scheme created in 1939 would be disserved by
allowing an employer's wrongdoing to reduce the quarters
of coverage an employee would otherwise be entitled to
claim toward eligibility. No similar concern underlies the
tax provisions. Although Social Security taxes are used to
pay for Social Security benefits in the aggregate, there is no
direct relation between taxes and benefits at the level of an
individual employee. As the Company itself acknowledges,
"Social Security tax `contributions,' unlike private pension
contributions, do not create in the contributor a property
right to benefits against the government, and wages rather

Opinion of the Court
than [tax] contributions are the statutory basis for calcu-lating an individual's benefits." Brief for Respondent 14.

Nierotko thus does not compel symmetrical constructionof the "wages paid" language in the discrete taxation and
benefits eligibility contexts. Although we generally pre-sume that "identical words used in different parts of the
same act are intended to have the same meaning," Atlantic
Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433(1932), the presumption "is not rigid," and "the meaning

[of the same words] well may vary to meet the purposes ofthe law," ibid. Cf. Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" in
the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933) ("The tend-ency to assume that a word which appears in two or more
legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose,has and should have precisely the same scope in all of
them . . . has all the tenacity of original sin and must con-stantly be guarded against."). The benefits scheme delineated in Title 42 would "no doubt" be set awry without anallocation-back rule for back wages, notwithstanding "accounting difficulties." Nierotko, 327 U. S., at 370. But thatsurely cannot be said for the taxation scheme described in
Title 26, where Congress' evident concern was not workereligibility for benefits, but fiscal administrability.

12

12 In determining that "accounting difficulties" were "not . . . insuperable" to its allocation holding, Nierotko noted that " `backpay' is now
treated distributively" under $ 119 of the Revenue Act of 1943. 327 U. S.,
at 370, and n. 26. Section 119 provided that backpay exceeding 15 percent
of gross income may be allocated to earlier periods for income tax purposes if such allocation would reduce the taxpayer's liability. $ 119(a), 58
Stat. 39. But Congress eliminated the 1943 backpay allocation rule in
1964, see Pub. L. 88-272, $ 232(a), 78 Stat. 107, leaving behind the principle, "too firmly embedded in the income tax law to permit of any question," that "payments of compensation are income to a taxpayer on a cash
basis in the year of receipt, as distinguished from the year in which the
compensation is earned," 2 J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation

$ 12.42, p. 179 (1973). The symmetry urged by the Company in construing
the tax and benefits provisions of FICA and FUTA thus comes only at the
expense of asymmetry in the collection of income taxes and employment
taxes.

Opinion of the Court

The 1939 Amendments adopting the "wages paid" rule fortaxation reflected Congress' worry that, as tax rates increase from year to year, "difficulties and confusion" wouldattend the taxation of wages payable in one year, but not
actually paid until another year. S. Rep. No. 734, 76thCong., 1st Sess., 75-76; see also H. R. Rep. No. 728, 76th
Cong., 1st Sess., 57-58. Congress understood that an employee's annual compensation may be "based on a percentageof profits, or on future royalties, the amount of which cannot

be determined until long after the close of the year."S. Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., at 75. Requiring employers to "estimate unascertained amounts and pay taxes
and contributions on that basis" would "cause a burden on
employers and administrative authorities alike." Id., at 75-
76. Congress correctly anticipated that "[t]he placing of
[FICA and FUTA] tax[es] on the `wages paid' basis [would]
relieve this situation." Id., at 76. "Under the amendment
the rate applicable would be the rate in effect at the time
that the wages are paid and received without reference to
the rate which was in effect at the time the services were
performed." H. R. Rep. No. 728, supra, at 58.

As an additional ground for construing the tax and benefits
provisions in pari materia, the Company insists that Congress incorporated Nierotko's treatment of backpay into the
tax provisions when it amended the Social Security Act
shortly after Nierotko was decided. Prior to 1946, the
FICA and FUTA wage bases had been defined in terms of
remuneration "paid . . . with respect to employment during"
a given year. 1935 Act, $ 811(a), 49 Stat. 639 (FICA); 1939
Amendments, $ 606, 53 Stat. 1383 (FUTA). Paralleling the
1939 Amendments to the tax rate provisions, Congress in
1946 established the current "wages paid" rule for identifying the wages that compose the FICA and FUTA wage bases
in a given year. Social Security Act Amendments of 1946
(1946 Amendments), $$ 412, 414, 60 Stat. 989-991 (codified
at 26 U. S. C. $$ 3121(a), 3306(b)(1)). The 1946 law amended

Opinion of the Court

$ 209(a), which defines the Social Security wage base for pur-poses of benefits calculation, by adopting the "wages paid"

language already present in $ 209(g), the provision construedin

Nierotko. $ 414, 60 Stat. 990-991. Congress also used
identical "wages paid" language in redefining the FICA andFUTA wage bases for tax purposes. $ 412, 60 Stat. 989.

Relying on the presumption that $ 209(a), as amended, incorporated Nierotko's construction of $ 209(g), see Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-699 (1979), and observing that Congress redefined the wage bases for taxationto "confor[m] with the changes in section 209(a)," S. Rep.

No. 1862, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946); H. R. Rep. No. 2447,
79th Cong., 2d Sess., 35 (1946), the Company urges that the
amended benefits and tax provisions codified Nierotko's
backpay allocation rule.

We are unpersuaded. Even assuming that the benefits
provision, $ 209(a), is properly construed as incorporating
Nierotko's reading of $ 209(g), we think the "confor[mity]"
Congress sought to achieve between the tax and benefits provisions, S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 36; H. R. Rep.
No. 2447, supra, at 35, had nothing to do with Nierotko's
treatment of backpay. The Committee Reports make clear
that Congress' purpose in amending the FICA and FUTA
wage bases was to define the "yardstick" for measuring
"wages" as "the amount paid during the calendar year . . . ,
without regard to the year in which the employment occurred." S. Rep. No. 1862, supra, at 35 (emphasis added);
H. R. Rep. No. 2447, supra, at 35 (emphasis added). It is
with respect to this rule--measuring "wages" based on "the
amount paid during the calendar year"--that Congress
sought conformity between the Title 26 tax provisions and
the Title 42 benefits provision. See S. Rep. No. 1862, supra,
at 36 (tax wage base), 37 (benefits wage base); H. R. Rep.
No. 2447, supra, at 35 (tax wage base), 36 (benefits wage
base). Far from indicating an intent to codify Nierotko,
those Reports suggest that Congress, if it considered

Opinion of the Court

Nierotko at all, considered it an exception to the generalrule for measuring "wages" in a given year.

13 Because the

concern that animates Nierotko's treatment of backpay inthe benefits context has no relevance to the tax side, supra,

at 212-213, it makes no sense to attribute to Congress a de-sire for conformity not only with respect to the general rule
for measuring "wages," but also with respect to Nierotko'sbackpay exception.

C
Were the Company to rely solely on arguments for sym-metry in statutory construction, we would be inclined to

conclude, given Nierotko's lack of concern with taxation,that the tax provisions themselves, informed by legislative
purpose, require back wages to be taxed according to theyear they are actually paid. But the Company has one more
arrow in its quiver.Apart from its arguments for symmetry, the Company
contends that the Government's refusal to allocate backwages to the year they should have been paid creates in13 Indeed, the contemporaneous understanding of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue was that the 1946 Amendments supplanted Nierotko's
allocation rule for backpay. See Letter from Joseph D. Nunan, Jr., Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to Social Security Administration, Bureau
of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (Mar. 6, 1947) ("The Nierotko decision
requiring your Agency to make an allocation of the back pay award to
prior periods was rendered on the basis of the law in effect at that time.
The Social Security Act Amendments of 1946, having been enacted subsequent to the date of the Nierotko decision, must be interpreted in the
light of the language contained in such Amendments and the Congressional intent.") (available in Lodging for Respondent, Exh. F). Nevertheless, for benefits eligibility and calculation purposes, the Social Security
Administration (SSA) by regulation continues to apply the Nierotko rule
to "[b]ack pay under a statute," 20 CFR $ 404.1242(b) (2000) (such backpay
"is allocated to the periods of time in which it should have been paid
if the employer had not violated the statute"), while declining to apply
Nierotko to "[b]ack pay not under a statute," $ 404.1242(c) ("This back pay
cannot be allocated to prior periods of time but must be reported by the
employer for the period in which it is paid.").

Opinion of the Court
equities in taxation and incentives for strategic behaviorthat Congress did not intend. This contention is not without force. Under the Government's rule, an employee whoshould have been paid $100,000 in 1986, but is instead paid
$50,000 in 1986 and $50,000 in backpay in 1994, would owemore tax than if she had been paid the full $100,000 due
in 1986. Conversely, a wrongdoing employer who should
have paid an employee $50,000 in each of five years coveredby a $250,000 backpay award would pay only one year's

worth of employment taxes (limited by the annual ceilingson taxable wages) in the year the award is actually paid.
The Government's rule thus appears to exempt some wages
that should be taxed and to tax some wages that should
be exempt.

Applying the Government's rule to other provisions of the
Code produces similar anomalies. Section 3121(a)(4), for example, exempts disability benefits from FICA tax if paid by
an employer to an employee more than six months after the
employee worked for the employer. 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(a)(4).
Disability benefits included in a backpay award would be
exempt from FICA tax if the employee had not worked for
the employer for six months prior to the backpay award,
even if the benefits should have been paid within six months
after the employee stopped working for the employer. According to the Company, such results amount to tax windfalls and invite employers wrongfully to withhold pay or
benefits in order to reap the advantages of a strategically
timed payment. See Brief for Respondent 33-40 (additional
examples of windfalls and avoidance schemes). These outcomes may be avoided, the Company argues, by construing
the tax provisions to require taxation of back wages according to the year the wages should have been paid.

Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). The Company's examplesleave little doubt that the Government's rule generates a degree of arbitrariness in the operation of the tax statutes.But in Nierotko's context, an inflexible rule allocating backpay to the year it is actually paid would never work to theemployee's advantage; it could inure

only to the detrimentof the employee, counter to the thrust of the benefits eligibility provisions.14 In this case, by contrast, there is nocomparable structural unfairness in taxation. The Government's rule sometimes disadvantages the taxpayer, as inthis case. Other times it works to the disadvantage of the
fisc, as the Company's examples show. The anomalous re-sults to which the Company points must be considered in
light of Congress' evident interest in reducing complexityand minimizing administrative confusion within the FICA
and FUTA tax schemes. See supra, at 214. Given thepractical administrability concerns that underpin the tax
provisions, we cannot say that the Government's rule is in-compatible with the statutory scheme. The most we can say
is that Congress intended the tax provisions to be both effi-ciently administrable and fair, and that this case reveals the
tension that sometimes exists when Congress seeks to meetthose twin aims.

The Internal Revenue Service has long maintained regulations interpreting the FICA and FUTA tax provisions.
In their current form, the regulations specify that the employer tax "attaches at the time that the wages are paid by
the employer," 26 CFR $ 31.3111-3 (2000) (emphasis added),

employer the rate in effect at the time such wages are

consistently interpreted them to require taxation of back

Rul. 78-336, 1978-2 Cum. Bull. 255. We need not decidewhether the Revenue Rulings themselves are entitled to
deference. In this case, the Rulings simply reflect theagency's longstanding interpretation of its own regulations.
Because that interpretation is reasonable, it attracts sub-stantial judicial deference.

Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Sha-lala, 512 U. S. 504, 512 (1994). We do not resist according

such deference in reviewing an agency's steady interpreta-tion of its own 61-year-old regulation implementing a 62-
year-old statute. "Treasury regulations and interpretationslong continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemedto have received congressional approval and have the effect

In line with the text and administrative history of the rele-vant taxation provisions, we hold that, for FICA and FUTA

tax purposes, back wages should be attributed to the year inwhich they are actually paid. Accordingly, the judgment
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
If I believed that the text of the tax statutes addressedthe issue before us, I might well find for the respondent,

giving that text the same meaning the Court found it tohave in the benefits provisions of the Social Security Act.
See Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 370, andn. 25 (1946). The Court's principal reason for assigning the
identical language a different meaning in the present case--

532US1 Unit: $U39 [09-05-02 19:25:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

221Cite as: 532 U. S. 200 (2001)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
leaving aside statements in testimony and Committee Reports that I have no reason to believe Congress was aware
of--is that tax assessments do not present the equitable considerations implicated by the potential arbitrary decrease of
benefits in Nierotko. See ante, at 212-213. But the Court
acknowledges that departing from Nierotko will produce
arbitrary variations in tax liability. See ante, at 216-218.
As between an immediate arbitrary increase in tax liability
and a deferred arbitrary decrease in benefits, I cannot say
the latter is the greater inequity. The difference is at least
not so stark as to cause me to regard the two regulatory
schemes as different in kind, which I would insist upon before giving different meanings to identical statutory texts.

In fact, however, I do not think that the text of the FICA
and FUTA provisions, 26 U. S. C. $$ 3111(a), 3111(b), 3301,
addresses the issue we face today. Those provisions, which
direct that taxes shall be assessed against "wages paid"
during the calendar year, would be controlling if the income
we had before us were "wages" within the normal meaning
of that term; but it is not. The question we face is whether
damages awards compensating an employee for lost wages
should be regarded for tax purposes as wages paid when
the award is received, or rather as wages paid when they
would have been paid but for the employer's unlawful actions. (The parties have stipulated that the damages
awards should be regarded as taxable "wages paid" of some
sort, see also Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, supra, at 364-
370.) The proper treatment of such damages awards is an
issue the statute does not address, and hence it is an issue
left to the reasonable resolution of the administering agency,
here the Internal Revenue Service. In Nierotko, which we
decided at a time when it was common for courts to fill
statutory gaps that would now be left to the agency, we
provided one rule for purposes of the benefits provisions.
The Internal Revenue Service has since provided another

rule for purposes of the tax provisions. Both rules arereasonable; neither is compelled; and neither involves a

direct application of the statutory term "wages paid" whichwould require (or at least strongly suggest) a uniform result.
I therefore concur in the Court's judgment deferring to theGovernment's regulations.

SHAW et al. v. MURPHY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-1613. Argued January 16, 2001--Decided April 18, 2001
While respondent Murphy was incarcerated in state prison, he learned

that a fellow inmate had been charged with assaulting a correctional
officer. Murphy decided to assist the inmate with his defense and sent
him a letter, which was intercepted in accordance with prison policy.
Based on the letter's content, the prison sanctioned Murphy for violating prison rules prohibiting insolence and interfering with due process
hearings. Murphy then sought declaratory and injunctive relief under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that the disciplinary action violated, inter
alia, his First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal
assistance to other inmates. In granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court applied the decision in Turner v. Safley, 482
U. S. 78, 89--that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological
interests--and found a valid, rational connection between the inmate
correspondence policy and the objectives of prison order, security, and
inmate rehabilitation. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that inmates
have a First Amendment right to give legal assistance to other inmates
and that this right affected the Turner analysis.

Held:

1. Inmates do not possess a special First Amendment right to provide legal assistance to fellow inmates that enhances the protections
otherwise available under Turner. Prisoners' constitutional rights are
more limited in scope than the constitutional rights held by individuals
in society at large. For instance, some First Amendment rights are
simply inconsistent with the corrections system's "legitimate penological objectives," Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822, and thus this
Court has sustained restrictions on, e. g., inmate-to-inmate written
correspondence, Turner, supra, at 93. Moreover, because courts are ill
equipped to deal with the complex and intractable problems of prisons,
Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 404-405, this Court has generally
deferred to prison officials' judgment in upholding such regulations
against constitutional challenge. Turner reflects this understanding,
setting a unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' claims
that does not permit an increase in the constitutional protection whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice. To increase

Syllabus
the constitutional protection based upon a communication's content
first requires an assessment of that content's value. But the Turner
test simply does not accommodate valuations of content. On the contrary, it concerns only the relationship between the asserted penological interests and the prison regulation. Moreover, prison officials
are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison
management. 482 U. S., at 89. Seeking to avoid unnecessarily perpetuating federal courts' involvement in prison administration affairs,
the Court rejects an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail
additional federal-court oversight. Even if this Court were to consider
giving special protection to particular kinds of speech based on content,
it would not do so for speech that includes legal advice. Augmenting
First Amendment protection for such advice would undermine prison
officials' ability to address the complex and intractable problems of
prison administration. Id., at 84. The legal text could be an excuse
for making clearly inappropriate comments, which may circulate among
prisoners despite prison measures to screen individual inmates or officers from the remarks. Pp. 228-232.

2. To prevail on remand on the question whether the prison regulations, as applied to Murphy, are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, he must overcome the presumption that the prison
officials acted within their broad discretion. P. 232.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under our decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987),restrictions on prisoners' communications to other inmates

are constitutional if the restrictions are "reasonably relatedto legitimate penological interests."

Id., at 89. In thiscase, we are asked to decide whether prisoners possess a

First Amendment right to provide legal assistance that en-hances the protections otherwise available under Turner.
We hold that they do not. I

While respondent Kevin Murphy was incarcerated at theMontana State Prison, he served as an "inmate law clerk,"
providing legal assistance to fellow prisoners. Upon learn-ing that inmate Pat Tracy had been charged with assaulting
Correctional Officer Glen Galle, Murphy decided to assistTracy with his defense. Prison rules prohibited Murphy's
assignment to the case,1 but he nonetheless investigatedthe assault. After discovering that other inmates had complained about Officer Galle's conduct, Murphy sent Tracy aletter, which included the following:

follows: Bill Pryor of Alabama, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, M. Jane Brady
of Delaware, James E. Ryan of Illinois, Thomas J. Miller of Iowa, Carla
J. Stovall of Kansas, Richard P. Ieyoub of Louisiana, Thomas F. Reilly

New Hampshire, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Betty D. Montgomery
of Ohio, W. A. Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Jan Graham of Utah, William H. Sorrell of Vermont, and Mark L. Earley of Virginia; and for the

L. Hobson.

Winter, David C. Fathi, and Stephen Bright filed a brief for the Legal Aid
Society of the City of New York et al. as amici curiae urging affirmance.

1 Tracy had requested that Murphy be assigned to his case. App. 84.

Prison officials, however, denied that request because prison policy forbade
high-security inmates, such as Murphy, from meeting with maximumsecurity inmates, including Tracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 19. Prison officials offered Tracy another law clerk to assist him. App. 84.

226 SHAW v. MURPHY

Opinion of the Court
"I do want to help you with your case against Galle.It wasn't your fault and I know he provoked whatever happened! Don't plead guilty because we can getat least 100 witnesses to testify that Galle is an over
zealous guard who has a personal agenda to punishand harrass [sic] inmates. He has made homo-sexual
[sic] advances towards certain inmates and that can bebrought up into the record. There are petitions against
him and I have tried to get the Unit Manager to dosomething about what he does in Close II, but all
that happened is that I received two writeups fromhim myself as retaliation. So we must pursue this out
of the prison system. I am filing a suit with everyonein Close I and II named against him. So you can use
that too!"Another poiont

[sic] is that he grabbed you from be-hind. You tell your lawyer to get ahold of me on this.

Don't take a plea bargain unless it's for no more time."App. 50.

In accordance with prison policy, prison officials inter-cepted the letter, and petitioner Robert Shaw, an officer in
the maximum-security unit, reviewed it. Based on the ac-cusations against Officer Galle, Shaw cited Murphy for violations of the prison's rules prohibiting insolence, interfer-ence with due process hearings, and conduct that disrupts
or interferes with the security and orderly operation of theinstitution. After a hearing, Murphy was found guilty of
violating the first two prohibitions. The hearings officersanctioned him by imposing a suspended sentence of 10 days'
detention and issuing demerits that could affect his custodylevel.

In response, Murphy brought this action, seeking declara-tory and injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983. The case was styled as a class action, brought onbehalf of himself, other inmate law clerks, and other prisoners. The complaint alleged that the disciplining of Mur532US1 Unit: $U40 [09-01-01 15:19:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
phy violated due process, the rights of inmates to accessthe courts, and, as relevant here, Murphy's First Amendment rights, including the right to provide legal assistanceto other inmates.

After discovery, the District Court granted petitioners'motion for summary judgment on all of Murphy's claims.
On the First Amendment claim, the court found that Murphy
was not formally acting as an inmate law clerk when hewrote the letter, and that Murphy's claims should therefore

"be analyzed without consideration of any privilege that lawclerk status might provide." App. to Pet. for Cert. 24. The
District Court then applied our decision in Turner v. Safley,
482 U. S. 78 (1987), which held that a prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional rights is valid "if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests," id., at
89. Finding a "valid, rational connection between the prison
inmate correspondence policy and the objectives of prison
order, security, and inmate rehabilitation," the District
Court rejected Murphy's First Amendment claim. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 25.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It
premised its analysis on the proposition that "inmates have
a First Amendment right to assist other inmates with their
legal claims." 195 F. 3d 1121, 1124 (1999). Murphy enjoyed
this right of association, the court concluded, because he
was providing legal advice that potentially was relevant
to Tracy's defense. The Court of Appeals then applied our
decision in Turner, but it did so only against the backdrop of
this First Amendment right, which, the court held, affected
the balance of the prisoner's interests against the government's interests. Concluding that the balance tipped in
favor of Murphy, the Court of Appeals upheld Murphy's First
Amendment claim.

Other Courts of Appeals have rejected similar claims.
See, e. g., Gibbs v. Hopkins, 10 F. 3d 373, 378 (CA6 1993)
(no constitutional right to assist other inmates with legal

claims); Smith v. Maschner, 899 F. 2d 940, 950 (CA10 1990)(same); Gassler v. Rayl, 862 F. 2d 706, 707-708 (CA8 1988)

(same). To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari. 530U. S. 1303 (2000).

II
In this case, we are not asked to decide whether prison-ers have

any First Amendment rights when they send legalcorrespondence to one another. In Turner, we held that

restrictions on inmate-to-inmate communications pass con-stitutional muster only if the restrictions are reasonably related to legitimate and neutral governmental objectives.482 U. S., at 89. We did not limit our holding to nonlegal
correspondence, and petitioners do not ask us to construeit that way. Instead, the question presented here simply
asks whether Murphy possesses a First Amendment rightto provide legal advice that enhances the protections otherwise available under Turner. The effect of such a right, asthe Court of Appeals described it, 195 F. 3d, at 1127, would
be that inmate-to-inmate correspondence that includes legalassistance would receive more First Amendment protection
than correspondence without any legal assistance. We con-clude that there is no such special right.

Traditionally, federal courts did not intervene in the in-ternal affairs of prisons and instead "adopted a broad handsoff attitude toward problems of prison administration."Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 404 (1974). Indeed,
for much of this country's history, the prevailing view wasthat a prisoner was a mere "slave of the State," who "not
only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights exceptthose which the law in its humanity accords him." Jones
v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S.119, 139 (1977) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting Ruffin v.
Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 796 (1871)) (alterations and in-ternal quotation marks omitted). In recent decades, however, this Court has determined that incarceration does notdivest prisoners of all constitutional protections. Inmates

Opinion of the Court
retain, for example, the right to be free from racial discrimi-nation,

Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333 (1968) (per curiam),
the right to due process, Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539(1974), and, as relevant here, certain protections of the First

Amendment, Turner, supra.We nonetheless have maintained that the constitutional
rights that prisoners possess are more limited in scope than
the constitutional rights held by individuals in society atlarge. In the First Amendment context, for instance, some

rights are simply inconsistent with the status of a prisoneror "with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system," Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974).
We have thus sustained proscriptions of media interviews
with individual inmates, see id., at 833-835, prohibitions on
the activities of a prisoners' labor union, see North Carolina
Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., supra, at 133, and restrictions
on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence, see Turner,
supra, at 93. Moreover, because the "problems of prisons in
America are complex and intractable," and because courts
are particularly "ill equipped" to deal with these problems,
Martinez, supra, at 404-405, we generally have deferred to
the judgments of prison officials in upholding these regulations against constitutional challenge.

Reflecting this understanding, in Turner we adopted a
unitary, deferential standard for reviewing prisoners' constitutional claims: "[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on
inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is
reasonably related to legitimate penological interests." 482
U. S., at 89. Under this standard, four factors are relevant.
First and foremost, "there must be a `valid, rational connection' between the prison regulation and the legitimate
[and neutral] governmental interest put forward to justify
it." Ibid. (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586
(1984)). If the connection between the regulation and the
asserted goal is "arbitrary or irrational," then the regulation
fails, irrespective of whether the other factors tilt in its

230 SHAW v. MURPHY

Opinion of the Court
favor. 482 U. S., at 89-90. In addition, courts should con-sider three other factors: the existence of "alternative means

of exercising the right" available to inmates; "the impact ac-commodation of the asserted constitutional right will have
on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prisonresources generally"; and "the absence of ready alternatives"
available to the prison for achieving the governmental objec-tives.

Id., at 90.Because Turner provides the test for evaluating prisoners'

First Amendment challenges, the issue before us is whetherTurner permits an increase in constitutional protection
whenever a prisoner's communication includes legal advice.We conclude that it does not. To increase the constitutional
protection based upon the content of a communication firstrequires an assessment of the value of that content.

2 But

the Turner test, by its terms, simply does not accommodatevaluations of content. On the contrary, the Turner factors

concern only the relationship between the asserted penologi-cal interests and the prison regulation.

Id., at 89.Moreover, under Turner and its predecessors, prison

officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problemsthat arise in prison management. Ibid.; see also Martinez,
supra, at 405 ("[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with theincreasingly urgent problems of prison administration and
reform"). If courts were permitted to enhance constitu-tional protection based on their assessments of the content
of the particular communications, courts would be in a posi-tion to assume a greater role in decisions affecting prison
administration. Seeking to avoid " `unnecessarily perpetu-at[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of
prison administration,' " Turner, 482 U. S., at 89 (quoting
Martinez, supra, at 407) (alteration in original), we reject

2 The Court of Appeals made such an assessment when it " `balance[d]
the importance of the prisoner's infringed right against the importance
of the penological interest served by the rule.' " 195 F. 3d 1121, 1127
(CA9 1999) (quoting Bradley v. Hall, 64 F. 3d 1276, 1280 (CA9 1995)).

Opinion of the Court
an alteration of the Turner analysis that would entail addi-tional federal-court oversight.

Finally, even if we were to consider giving special pro-tection to particular kinds of speech based upon content,
we would not do so for speech that includes legal advice.3Augmenting First Amendment protection for inmate legal
advice would undermine prison officials' ability to addressthe "complex and intractable" problems of prison administration. Turner, supra, at 84. Although supervised inmatelegal assistance programs may serve valuable ends, it is
"indisputable" that inmate law clerks "are sometimes amenace to prison discipline" and that prisoners have an
"acknowledged propensity . . . to abuse both the giving andthe seeking of [legal] assistance."

Johnson v. Avery, 393U. S. 483, 488, 490 (1969). Prisoners have used legal correspondence as a means for passing contraband and communi-cating instructions on how to manufacture drugs or weapons.
See Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 6-8;see also

Turner, supra, at 93 ("[P]risoners could easily writein jargon or codes to prevent detection of their real messages"). The legal text also could be an excuse for makingclearly inappropriate comments, which "may be expected to
circulate among prisoners," Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S.401, 412 (1989), despite prison measures to screen individual
inmates or officers from the remarks.We thus decline to cloak the provision of legal assistance
with any First Amendment protection above and beyondthe protection normally accorded prisoners' speech. In3 Murphy suggests that the right to provide legal advice follows from a
right to receive legal advice. However, even if one right followed from
the other, Murphy is incorrect in his assumption that there is a freestanding right to receive legal advice. Under our right-of-access precedents, inmates have a right to receive legal advice from other inmates
only when it is a necessary "means for ensuring a `reasonably adequate
opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional
rights to the courts.' " Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 350-351 (1996) (quoting Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817, 825 (1977)).

Under Turner, the question remains whether the prisonregulations, as applied to Murphy, are "reasonably related

to legitimate penological interests." 482 U. S., at 89. Toprevail, Murphy must overcome the presumption that the
prison officials acted within their "broad discretion." Ab-bott, supra, at 413. Petitioners ask us to answer, rather
than remand, the question whether Murphy has satisfied thisheavy burden. We decline petitioners' request, however,
because we granted certiorari only to decide whether in-mates possess a special First Amendment right to provide
legal assistance to fellow inmates.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit erred inholding that the First Amendment secures to prisoners a

freestanding right to provide legal assistance to other in-mates. I note, furthermore, that Murphy does not contest
the prison's right to intercept prisoner-to-prisoner corre-spondence. But Murphy's $ 1983 complaint does allege that
the prison rules under which he was disciplined--rules for-bidding insolence and interference with due process hearings--are vague and overbroad as applied to him in thiscase.* The Ninth Circuit passed over that charge when it

no finding that Murphy's letter was "directed to" Officer Galle or that the
letter was "intended to harass" Officer Galle. App. 52. Although Murphy undoubtedly knew that his letter to Tracy would be read by prison
officials, there is no record evidence contesting Murphy's sworn statement that he "did not believe that Officer Galle would read the letter."

EASLEY,* GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et al.

v. CROMARTIE et al.

appeal from the united states district court for theeastern district of north carolina

No. 99-1864. Argued November 27, 2000--Decided April 18, 2001#
After this Court found that North Carolina's Legislature violated the

Constitution by using race as the predominant factor in drawing its
Twelfth Congressional District's 1992 boundaries, Shaw v. Hunt, 517
U. S. 899, the State redrew those boundaries. A three-judge District
Court subsequently granted appellees summary judgment, finding that
the new 1997 boundaries had also been created with racial considerations dominating all others. This Court reversed, finding that there
was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the evidence was
consistent with a race-based objective or the constitutional political
objective of creating a safe Democratic seat. Hunt v. Cromartie, 526
U. S. 541. Among other things, this Court relied on evidence proposed
to be submitted by appellants to conclude that, because the State's
African-American voters overwhelmingly voted Democratic, one could
not easily distinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-minority
district from a legislative effort to create a safely Democratic one;
that data showing voter registration did not indicate how voters would
actually vote; and that data about actual behavior could affect the litigation's outcome. Id., at 547-551. On remand, the District Court again
held, after a 3-day trial, that the legislature had used race driven criteria in drawing the 1997 boundaries. It based that conclusion on
three findings--the district's shape, its splitting of towns and counties,
and its heavily African-American voting population--that this Court
had considered when it found summary judgment inappropriate, and on
the new finding that the legislature had drawn the boundaries to collect
precincts with a high racial, rather than political, identification.

Held: The District Court's conclusion that the State violated the Equal

Protection Clause in drawing the 1997 boundaries is based on clearly
erroneous findings. Pp. 241-258.

*Governor Michael F. Easley is hereby substituted for former Governor
James B. Hunt, Jr., pursuant to this Court's Rule 35.3.

Syllabus
(a) The issue here is evidentiary: whether there is adequate support
for the District Court's finding that race, rather than politics, drove
the legislature's districting decision. Those attacking the district have
the demanding burden of proof to show that a facially neutral law is
unexplainable on grounds other than race. Cromartie, supra, at 546.
Because the underlying districting decision falls within a legislature's
sphere of competence, Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915, courts must
exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims such as this one,
id., at 916, especially where, as here, the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision and the voting
population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly coordinated, see Cromartie, supra, at 551-552. This Court will review the
District Court's findings only for "clear error," asking whether "on the
entire evidence" the Court is "left with the definite and firm conviction
that a mistake has been committed." United States v. United States
Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395. An extensive review of the District
Court's findings is warranted here because there was no intermediate
court review, the trial was not lengthy, the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony, and credibility evaluations
played a minor role. Pp. 241-243.

(b) The critical District Court determination that "race, not politics,"
predominantly explains the 1997 boundaries rests upon the three findings that this Court found insufficient to support summary judgment,
and which cannot in and of themselves, as a matter of law, support the
District Court's judgment here. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 968.
Its determination also rests upon five new subsidiary findings, which
this Court also cannot accept as adequate. First, the District Court
primarily relied on evidence of voting registration, not voting behavior,
which is precisely the kind of evidence that this Court found inadequate
the last time the case was here. White registered Democrats "crossover" to vote Republican more often than do African-Americans, who
register and vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. Thus,
a legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat by placing reliable
Democratic precincts within a district may end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts for political, not racial,
reasons. Second, the evidence to which appellees' expert, Dr. Weber,
pointed--that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is necessary to create a safe Democratic seat, but this district was 63% reliable;
that certain white-Democratic precincts were excluded while AfricanAmerican-Democratic precincts were included; that one precinct was
split between Districts 9 and 12; and that other plans would have created a safely Democratic district with fewer African-American precincts--simply does not provide significant additional support for the

236 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Syllabus
District Court's conclusion. Also, portions of Dr. Weber's testimony
not cited by the District Court undercut his conclusions. Third, the
District Court, while not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants'
expert, Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could
not) reject much of the significant supporting factual information he
provided, which showed that African-American-Democratic voters were
more reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were drawn
to include reliable Democrats. Fourth, a statement about racial balance made by Senator Cooper, the legislative redistricting leader, shows
that the legislature considered race along with other partisan and geographic considerations, but says little about whether race played a predominant role. And an e-mail sent by Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff
member responsible for drafting districting plans, offers some support
for the District Court's conclusion, but is less persuasive than the kinds
of direct evidence that this Court has found significant in other redistricting cases. Fifth, appellees' maps summarizing voting behavior
evidence tend to refute the District Court's "race, not politics," conclusion. Pp. 243-257.

(c) The modicum of evidence supporting the District Court's conclusion--the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's statement, and some aspects
of Dr. Weber's testimony--taken together, does not show that racial
considerations predominated in the boundaries' drawing, because race
in this case correlates closely with political behavior. Where majorityminority districts are at issue and racial identification correlates highly
with political affiliation, the party attacking the boundaries must show
at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with
traditional districting principles and that those alternatives would have
brought about significantly greater racial balance. Because appellees
failed to make any such showing here, the District Court's contrary
findings are clearly erroneous. Pp. 257-258.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this appeal, we review a three-judge District Court'sdetermination that North Carolina's Legislature used race as

the "predominant factor" in drawing its 12th CongressionalDistrict's 1997 boundaries. The court's findings, in our view,
are clearly erroneous. We therefore reverse its conclusionthat the State violated the Equal Protection Clause. U. S.
Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. I

This "racial districting" litigation is before us for thefourth time. Our first two holdings addressed North Carolina's former Congressional District 12, one of two NorthCarolina congressional districts drawn in 1992 that contained a majority of African-American voters. See Shaw v.Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993) (Shaw I); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S.
899 (1996) (Shaw II). A

In Shaw I, the Court considered whether plaintiffs' factualallegation--that the legislature had drawn the former district's boundaries for race-based reasons--if true, could un-derlie a legal holding that the legislature had violated the
Equal Protection Clause. The Court held that it could. Itwrote that a violation may exist where the legislature's

Opinion of the Court
theless can be understood only as an effort to "separate vot-ers into different districts on the basis of race," and where

the "separation lacks sufficient justification." 509 U. S.,at 649.

In Shaw II, the Court reversed a subsequent three-judge District Court's holding that the boundary-drawing
law in question did not violate the Constitution. This Courtfound that the district's "unconventional," snakelike shape,
the way in which its boundaries split towns and counties,its predominately African-American racial makeup, and its
history, together demonstrated a deliberate effort to createa "majority-black" district in which race "could not be
compromised," not simply a district designed to "protec[t]Democratic incumbents." 517 U. S., at 902-903, 905-907.
And the Court concluded that the legislature's use of racialcriteria was not justified.

Id., at 909-918.

B
Our third holding focused on a new District 12, the bound-aries of which the legislature had redrawn in 1997.

Huntv. Cromartie, 526 U. S. 541 (1999). A three-judge District

Court, with one judge dissenting, had granted summaryjudgment in favor of those challenging the district's boundaries. The court found that the legislature again had "usedcriteria . . . that are facially race driven," in violation of

the Equal Protection Clause. App. to Juris. Statement inNo. 99-1864, p. 262a (hereinafter App. to Juris. Statement).
It based this conclusion upon "uncontroverted materialfacts" showing that the boundaries created an unusually
shaped district, split counties and cities, and in particularplaced almost all heavily Democratic-registered, predominantly African-American voting precincts, inside the dis-trict while locating some heavily Democratic-registered,
predominantly white precincts, outside the district. Thislatter circumstance, said the court, showed that the legislature was trying to maximize new District 12's African532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

American voting strength, not the district's Democratic vot-ing strength. Ibid.

This Court reversed. We agreed with the District Courtthat the new district's shape, the way in which it split
towns and counties, and its heavily African-American votingpopulation all helped the plaintiffs' case. 526 U. S., at 547-
549. But neither that evidence by itself, nor when coupledwith the evidence of Democratic registration, was sufficient
to show, on summary judgment, the unconstitutional race-based objective that plaintiffs claimed. That is because
there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether theevidence also was consistent with a constitutional political
objective, namely, the creation of a safe Democratic seat.
Id., at 549-551.We pointed to the affidavit of an expert witness for defendants, Dr. David W. Peterson. Dr. Peterson offered toshow that, because North Carolina's African-American voters are overwhelmingly Democratic voters, one cannot easilydistinguish a legislative effort to create a majority-AfricanAmerican district from a legislative effort to create a safelyDemocratic district.

Id., at 550. And he also provided datashowing that registration did not indicate how voters would

actually vote. Id., at 550-551. We agreed that data show-ing how voters actually behave, not data showing only how
those voters are registered, could affect the outcome of thislitigation. Ibid. We concluded that the case was "not
suited for summary disposition" and we reversed the DistrictCourt. Id., at 554.

C
On remand, the parties undertook additional discovery.The three-judge District Court held a 3-day trial. And the

court again held (over a dissent) that the legislature hadunconstitutionally drawn District 12's new 1997 boundaries. It found that the legislature had tried "(1) [to] cur[e]the [previous district's] constitutional defects" while also
"(2) drawing the plan to maintain the existing partisan bal532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ance in the State's congressional delegation." Cromartie v.Hunt, 133 F. Supp. 2d 407, 413 (EDNC 2000). It added

that to "achieve the second goal," the legislature "drew thenew plan (1) to avoid placing two incumbents in the same
district and (2) to preserve the partisan core of the existingdistricts." Ibid. The court concluded that the "plan as
enacted largely reflects these directives." Ibid. But thecourt also found "as a matter of fact that the General Assembly . . . used criteria . . . that are facially race driven" withoutany compelling justification for doing so.

Id., at 420.The court based its latter, constitutionally critical, conclusion in part upon the district's snakelike shape, the wayin which it split cities and towns, and its heavily AfricanAmerican (47%) voting population, id., at 413-415--allmatters that this Court had considered when it found
summary judgment inappropriate, Cromartie, 526 U. S., at544. The court also based this conclusion upon a specific
finding--absent when we previously considered this litiga-tion--that the legislature had drawn the boundaries in order
"to collect precincts with high racial identification rather
than political identification." 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 420 (em-phasis added).

This last-mentioned finding rested in turn upon five sub-sidiary determinations:

(1) that "the legislators excluded many heavily-Democraticprecincts from District 12, even when those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and would have establisheda far more compact district," id., at 419; see also id.,
at 421 ("more heavily Democratic precincts . . . werebypassed . . . in favor of precincts with a higher AfricanAmerican population");
(2) that "[a]dditionally, Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, showedtime and again how race trumped party affiliation in the

construction of the 12th District and how political expla-nations utterly failed to explain the composition of the
district," id., at 419;

(3) that Dr. Peterson's testimony was " `unreliable' and notrelevant," id., at 420 (citing testimony of Dr. Weber);

(4) that a legislative redistricting leader, Senator Roy Coo-per, had alluded at the time of redistricting "to a need

for `racial and partisan' balance," ibid.; and
(5) that the Senate's redistricting coordinator, Gerry Cohen,had sent Senator Cooper an e-mail reporting that Cooper

had "moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th,and now need[ed] to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th,"

II
The issue in this case is evidentiary. We must determinewhether there is adequate support for the District Court's

key findings, particularly the ultimate finding that the legis-lature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. In
making this determination, we are aware that, under Shaw Iand later cases, the burden of proof on the plaintiffs (who
attack the district) is a "demanding one." Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 928 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurring).The Court has specified that those who claim that a legislature has improperly used race as a criterion, in order,for example, to create a majority-minority district, must
show at a minimum that the "legislature subordinated tradi-tional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations." Id., at 916 (majority opinion). Race mustnot simply have been "

a motivation for the drawing ofa majority-minority district," Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952,

959 (1996) (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (emphasis inoriginal), but "the `predominant factor' motivating the legislature's districting decision," Cromartie, supra, at 547(quoting

Miller, supra, at 916) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
242 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Opinion of the Court
must show that a facially neutral law " `is "unexplainableon grounds other than race." ' "

Cromartie, supra, at 546
(quoting Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 644, in turn quoting Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429
U. S. 252, 266 (1977)).The Court also has made clear that the underlying districting decision is one that ordinarily falls within a legislature's sphere of competence. Miller, 515 U. S., at 915.Hence, the legislature "must have discretion to exercise the

political judgment necessary to balance competing inter-ests,"

ibid., and courts must "exercise extraordinary caution
in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lineson the basis of race,"

id., at 916 (emphasis added). Caution
is especially appropriate in this case, where the State hasarticulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision, and the voting population is one in which raceand political affiliation are highly correlated. See

Cromartie, supra, at 551-552 (noting that "[e]vidence that blacksconstitute even a supermajority in one congressional district

while amounting to less than a plurality in a neighboring
district will not, by itself, suffice to prove that a jurisdictionwas motivated by race in drawing its district lines when the

evidence also shows a high correlation between race and
party preference").

We also are aware that we review the District Court's
findings only for "clear error." In applying this standard, we, like any reviewing court, will not reverse a lower
court's finding of fact simply because we "would have decided the case differently." Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470
U. S. 564, 573 (1985). Rather, a reviewing court must ask
whether, "on the entire evidence," it is "left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."
United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364,
395 (1948).

Where an intermediate court reviews, and affirms, a trial
court's factual findings, this Court will not "lightly overturn"
the concurrent findings of the two lower courts. E. g., Neil

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 193, n. 3 (1972). But in this instance there is no intermediate court, and we are the only
court of review. Moreover, the trial here at issue was not
lengthy and the key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony. Credibility evaluations played
a minor role. Accordingly, we find that an extensive review
of the District Court's findings, for clear error, is warranted.
See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
466 U. S. 485, 500-501 (1984). That review leaves us "with
the definite and firm conviction," United States Gypsum Co.,
supra, at 395, that the District Court's key findings are
mistaken.

III

The critical District Court determination--the matter for
which we remanded this litigation--consists of the finding
that race rather than politics predominantly explains District 12's 1997 boundaries. That determination rests upon
three findings (the district's shape, its splitting of towns and
counties, and its high African-American voting population)
that we previously found insufficient to support summary
judgment. Cromartie, 526 U. S., at 547-549. Given the undisputed evidence that racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation in North Carolina, these facts
in and of themselves cannot, as a matter of law, support
the District Court's judgment. See Vera, 517 U. S., at 968
(O'Connor, J., principal opinion) ("If district lines merely
correlate with race because they are drawn on the basis of
political affiliation, which correlates with race, there is no
racial classification to justify"). The District Court rested,
however, upon five new subsidiary findings to conclude that
District 12's lines are the product of no "mer[e] correlat[ion],"
ibid., but are instead a result of the predominance of race in
the legislature's line-drawing process. See supra, at 240-
241.

In considering each subsidiary finding, we have given
weight to the fact that the District Court was familiar with

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
244 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Opinion of the Court
this litigation, heard the testimony of each witness, and con-sidered all the evidence with care. Nonetheless, we cannot

accept the District Court's findings as adequate for reasonswhich we shall spell out in detail and which we can summarize as follows:First, the primary evidence upon which the District Court
relied for its "race, not politics," conclusion is evidence ofvoting registration, not voting behavior; and that is precisely the kind of evidence that we said was inadequatethe last time this case was before us. See

infra, at 245-246.Second, the additional evidence to which appellees' expert,

Dr. Weber, pointed, and the statements made by SenatorCooper and Gerry Cohen, simply do not provide significant
additional support for the District Court's conclusion. Seeinfra, at 246-250, 253-254. Third, the District Court, while
not accepting the contrary conclusion of appellants' expert,Dr. Peterson, did not (and as far as the record reveals, could
not) reject much of the significant supporting factual infor-mation he provided. See

infra, at 251-253. Fourth, in anyevent, appellees themselves have provided us with charts

summarizing evidence of voting behavior and those chartstend to refute the court's "race, not politics," conclusion.
See infra, at 254-257; Appendixes, infra.

A
The District Court primarily based its "race, not politics,"conclusion upon its finding that "the legislators excluded

many heavily-Democratic precincts from District 12, evenwhen those precincts immediately border the Twelfth and
would have established a far more compact district." 133F. Supp. 2d, at 419; see also

id., at 420 ("[M]ore heavily Dem-ocratic precincts . . . were bypassed . . . in favor of precincts

with a higher African-American population"). This finding,however--insofar as it differs from the remaining four--
rests solely upon evidence that the legislature excludedheavily white precincts with high Democratic Party

registra532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tion, while including heavily African-American precinctswith equivalent, or lower, Democratic Party registration.

See id., at 413-414, 415. Indeed, the District Court cites atlength figures showing that the legislature included "several
precincts with racial compositions of 40 to 100 percentAfrican-American," while excluding certain adjacent precincts "with less than 35 percent African-American population" but which contain between 54% and 76% registeredDemocrats.

Id., at 414.
As we said before, the problem with this evidence is thatit focuses upon party registration, not upon voting behavior.

And we previously found the same evidence, compare ibid.
(District Court's opinion after trial) with App. to Juris.
Statement 249a-250a (District Court's summary judgment
opinion), inadequate because registration figures do not accurately predict preference at the polls. See id., at 174a; see
also Cromartie, supra, at 550-551 (describing Dr. Peterson's
analysis as "more thorough" because in North Carolina,
"party registration and party preference do not always correspond"). In part this is because white voters registered
as Democrats "cross-over" to vote for a Republican candidate
more often than do African-Americans, who register and
vote Democratic between 95% and 97% of the time. See
Record, Deposition of Gerry Cohen 37-42 (discussing data);
App. 304 (stating that white voters cast about 60% to 70% of
their votes for Republican candidates); id., at 139 (Dr. Weber's testimony that 95% to 97% of African-Americans register and vote as Democrats); see also id., at 118 (testimony
by Dr. Weber that registration data were the least reliable
information upon which to predict voter behavior). A legislature trying to secure a safe Democratic seat is interested
in Democratic voting behavior. Hence, a legislature may, by
placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more
heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would
be political rather than racial.

party affiliation in the construction of the 12th District andhow political explanations utterly failed to explain the composition of the district." 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 419. In sup-port of this conclusion, the court relied upon six different
citations to Dr. Weber's trial testimony. We have examinedeach reference.

1
At the first cited pages of the trial transcript, Dr. Webersays that a reliably Democratic voting population of 60% is

sufficient to create a safe Democratic seat. App. 91. Yet,he adds, the legislature created a more-than-60% reliable
Democratic voting population in District 12. Hence (weread Dr. Weber to infer), the legislature likely was driven by
race, not politics. Tr. 163; App. 314-315.The record indicates, however, that, although Dr. Weber is
right that District 12 is more than 60% reliably Democratic,it exceeds that figure by very little. Nor did Dr. Weber ask
whether other districts, unchallenged by appellees, weresignificantly less "safe" than was District 12. Id., at 148.
In fact, the figures the legislature used showed that Dis-trict 12 would be 63% reliably Democratic. App. to Juris.
Statement 80a (Democratic vote over three representativeelections averaged 63%). By the same measures, at least
two Republican districts (Districts 6 and 10) are 61% reliablyRepublican. Ibid. And, as Dr. Weber conceded, incumbents might have urged legislators (trying to maintain a

Opinion of the Court
six/six Democrat/Republican delegation split) to make theirseats, not 60% safe, but as safe as possible. App. 149. In a

field such as voting behavior, where figures are inherentlyuncertain, Dr. Weber's tiny calculated percentage differences
are simply too small to carry significant evidentiary weight.

2
The District Court cited two parts of the transcript whereDr. Weber testified about a table he had prepared listing

all precincts in the six counties, portions of which make upDistrict 12. Tr. 204-205, 262. Dr. Weber said that District 12 contains between 39% and 56% of the precincts(depending on the county) that are more-than-40% reliably
Democratic, but it contains almost every precinct withmore-than-40% African-American voters. Id., at 204-205.
Why, he essentially asks, if the legislature had had politicsprimarily in mind, would its effort to place reliably Democratic precincts within District 12 not have produced agreater racial mixture?

Dr. Weber's own testimony provides an answer to thisquestion. As Dr. Weber agreed, the precincts listed in the
table were at least 40% reliably Democratic, but virtuallyall the African-American precincts included in District 12
were more than 40% reliably Democratic. Moreover, noneof the excluded white precincts were

as reliably Demo-cratic as the African-American precincts that were included

in the district. App. 140. Yet the legislature sought pre-cincts that were reliably Democratic, not precincts that were
40% reliably Democratic, for obvious political reasons.Neither does the table specify whether the excluded
white-reliably-Democratic precincts were located nearenough to District 12's boundaries or each other for the legislature as a practical matter to have drawn District 12'sboundaries to have included them, without sacrificing other
important political goals. The contrary is suggested by the

Opinion of the Court
fact that Dr. Weber's own proposed alternative plan, see id.,at 106-107, would have pitted two incumbents against each

other (Sue Myrick, a Republican from former District 9 andMel Watt, a Democrat from former District 12). Dr. Weber
testified that such a result--"a very competitive race withone of them losing their seat"--was desirable. Id., at 153.
But the legislature, for political, not racial, reasons, believedthe opposite. And it drew its plan to protect incumbents--
a legitimate political goal recognized by the District Court.133 F. Supp. 2d, at 412-413.

For these reasons, Dr. Weber's table offers little insightinto the legislature's true motive.

3
The next part of the transcript the District Court citedcontains Dr. Weber's testimony about a Mecklenburg County

precinct (precinct 77) which the legislature split betweenDistricts 9 and 12. Tr. 221. Dr. Weber apparently thought
that the legislature did not have to split this precinct,placing the more heavily African-American segment within
District 12--unless, of course, its motive was racial ratherthan political. But Dr. Weber simultaneously conceded that
he had not considered whether District 9's incumbent Re-publican would have wanted the whole of precinct 77 left in
her own district where it would have burdened her with asignificant additional number of reliably Democratic voters.
App. 156-157. Nor had Dr. Weber "test[ed]" his conclusionthat this split helped to show a racial (rather than political)
motive, say, by adjusting other boundary lines and deter-mining the political, or other nonracial, consequences of such
adjustments. Id., at 132.The maps in evidence indicate that to have placed all of
precinct 77 within District 12 would have created a Dis-trict 12 peninsula that invaded District 9, neatly dividing
that latter district in two, see id., at 496--a conclusive non-racial reason for the legislature's decision not to do so.

Opinion of the Court

4
The District Court cited Dr. Weber's conclusion that"race is the predominant factor." Tr. 251. But this statement of the conclusion is no stronger than the evidence thatunderlies it.

5
The District Court's final citation is to Dr. Weber's as-sertion that there are other ways in which the legislature

could have created a safely Democratic district without plac-ing so many primarily African-American districts within
District 12. Id., at 288. And we recognize that some suchother ways may exist. But, unless the evidence also shows
that these hypothetical alternative districts would have bet-ter satisfied the legislature's other nonracial political goals
as well as traditional nonracial districting principles, this factalone cannot show an improper legislative motive. After all,
the Constitution does not place an affirmative obligationupon the legislature to avoid creating districts that turn out
to be heavily, even majority, minority. It simply imposesan obligation not to create such districts for predominantly
racial, as opposed to political or traditional, districting moti-vations. And Dr. Weber's testimony does not, at the pages
cited, provide evidence of a politically practical alternativeplan that the legislature failed to adopt predominantly for
racial reasons.

6

In addition, we have read the whole of Dr. Weber's testimony, including portions not cited by the District Court.Some of those portions further undercut Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr. Weber said, for example, that he had developedthose conclusions while under the erroneous impression that
the legislature's computer-based districting program pro-vided information about racial, but not political, balance.
App. 137-138; see also id., at 302 (reflecting Dr. Weber's
erroneous impression in the declaration he submitted to

Opinion of the Court
the District Court). He also said he was not aware of "any-thing about political dynamics going on in the [l]egislature

involving" District 12, id., at 135, sometimes expressing dis-dain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect,
id., at 150-151; Miller, 515 U. S., at 915-916.Other portions support Dr. Weber's conclusions. Dr.
Weber testified, for example, about a different alternative
plan that, in his view, would have provided both greater ra-cial balance and political security, namely, a plan that the

legislature did enact in 1998, and which has been in effectduring the time the courts have been reviewing the constitutionality of the 1997 plan. App. 156-157. The existence of
this alternative plan, however, cannot help appellees significantly. Although it created a somewhat more compact district, it still divides many communities along racial lines,
while providing fewer reliably Democratic District 12 voters
and transferring a group of highly Democratic precincts into
two safely Republican districts, namely, the 5th and 6th Districts, which political result the 1997 plan sought to avoid.
See Tr. 352, 355. Furthermore, the 1997 plan before this
Court, unlike the 1998 plan, joined three major cities in a
manner legislators regarded as reflecting "a real commonality of urban interests, with inner city schools, urban health
care . . . problems, public housing problems." App. 430
(statement of Sen. Winner); see also id., at 421 (statement
of Sen. Martin). Consequently, we cannot tell whether the
existence of the 1998 plan shows that the 1997 plan was
drawn with racial considerations predominant. And, in any
event, the District Court did not rely upon the existence of
the 1998 plan to support its ultimate conclusion. See Kelley
v. Everglades Drainage Dist., 319 U. S. 415, 420-422 (1943)
(per curiam).

We do not see how Dr. Weber's testimony, taken as a
whole, could have provided more than minimal support for
the District Court's conclusion that race predominantly
underlay the legislature's districting decision.

Opinion of the Court

C
The District Court found that the testimony of the State's
primary expert, Dr. Peterson, was " `unreliable' and not relevant." 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 420 (quoting Dr. Weber and citing
Tr. 222-224, 232). Dr. Peterson's testimony was designed to
show that African-American Democratic voters were more
reliably Democratic and that District 12's boundaries were
drawn to include reliable Democrats. Specifically, Dr. Peterson compared precincts immediately within District 12
and those immediately without to determine whether the
boundaries of the district corresponded better with race than
with politics. The principle underlying Dr. Peterson's analysis is that if the district were drawn with race predominantly in mind, one would expect the boundaries of the district to correlate with race more than with politics.

The pages cited in support of the District Court's rejection of Dr. Peterson's conclusions contain testimony by
Dr. Weber, who says that Dr. Peterson's analysis is unreliable
because (1) it "ignor[es] the core" of the district, id., at 223,
and (2) it fails to take account of the fact that different precincts have different populations, id., at 223-224. The first
matter--ignoring the "core"--apparently reflects Dr. Weber's view that in context the fact that District 12's heart
or "core" is heavily African-American by itself shows that
the legislature's motive was predominantly racial, not political. The District Court did not argue that the racial
makeup of a district's "core" is critical. Nor do we see why
"core" makeup alone could help the court discern the relevant legislative motive. Nothing here suggests that only
"core" makeup could answer the "political/racial" question
that this Court previously found critical. Cromartie, 526
U. S., at 551-552.

The second matter--that Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis did not account for differences in population
between precincts--relates to one aspect of Dr. Peterson's

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
252 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Opinion of the Court
testimony. Appellants presented Dr. Peterson's testimony
and data in support of four propositions: first, that registration figures do not accurately reflect actual voting behavior, see App. to Juris. Statement 173a-174a; second, that
African-Americans are more reliable Democrats than whites,
see id., at 159a-160a; third, that political affiliation explains
splitting cities and counties as well as does race, see id., at
189a, 191a-192a, 182a-185a; and fourth, that differences in
the racial and political makeup of the precincts just inside
and outside the boundaries of District 12 show that politics
is as good an explanation as is race for the district's boundaries, see id., at 161a-167a; 181a-182a. The District Court's
criticism of Dr. Peterson's testimony at most affects the reliability of the fourth element of Dr. Peterson's testimony,
his special boundary segment analysis. The District Court's
criticism of Dr. Peterson's boundary segment analysis does
not undermine the data related to the split communities.
The criticism does not undercut Dr. Peterson's presentation
of statistical evidence showing that registration was a poor
indicator of party preference and that African-Americans are
much more reliably Democratic voters, nor have we found in
the record any significant evidence refuting that data.

At the same time, appellees themselves have used the
information available in the record to create maps comparing the district's boundaries with Democratic/Republican
voting behavior. See Appendixes A, B, and C, infra. Because no one challenges the accuracy of these maps, we assume that they are reliable; and we can assume that Dr. Peterson's testimony is reliable insofar as it confirms what the
maps themselves contain and appellees themselves concede.
Those maps, with certain exceptions discussed below, see
infra, at 254-257, further indicate that the legislature drew
boundaries that, in general, placed more-reliably Democratic
voters inside the district, while placing less-reliably Democratic voters outside the district. And that fact, in turn,

Opinion of the Court
supports the State's answers to the questions we previouslyfound critical.

D
The District Court also relied on two pieces of "direct"evidence of discriminatory intent.

1
The court found that a legislative redistricting leader,Senator Roy Cooper, when testifying before a legislative

committee in 1997, had said that the 1997 plan satisfies a"need for `racial and partisan' balance." 133 F. Supp. 2d, at
419. The court concluded that the words "racial balance"referred to a 10-to-2 Caucasian/African-American balance
in the State's 12-member congressional delegation. Ibid.Hence, Senator Cooper had admitted that the legislature had
drawn the plan with race in mind.Senator Cooper's full statement reads as follows:

"Those of you who dealt with Redistricting before real-ize that you cannot solve each problem that you encounter and everyone can find a problem with this Plan.However, I think that overall it provides for a fair, geographic, racial and partisan balance throughout theState of North Carolina. I think in order to come to an
agreement all sides had to give a little bit, but I thinkwe've reached an agreement that we can live with."
App. 460.
We agree that one can read the statement about "racial . . .balance" as the District Court read it--to refer to the current congressional delegation's racial balance. But even asso read, the phrase shows that the legislature considered
race, along with other partisan and geographic considera-tions; and as so read it says little or nothing about whether
race played a predominant role comparatively speaking.See

Vera, 517 U. S., at 958 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion)("Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting

is performed with consciousness of race"); see also Miller,515 U. S., at 916 (legislatures "will . . . almost always be

aware of racial demographics"); Shaw I, 509 U. S., at 646(same).

2
The second piece of "direct" evidence relied upon bythe District Court is a February 10, 1997, e-mail sent from

Gerry Cohen, a legislative staff member responsible fordrafting districting plans, to Senator Cooper and Senator
Leslie Winner. Cohen wrote: "I have moved GreensboroBlack community into the 12th, and now need to take [about]
60,000 out of the 12th. I await your direction on this."App. 369.

The reference to race--i. e., "Black community"--is ob-vious. But the e-mail does not discuss the point of the
reference. It does not discuss why Greensboro's African-American voters were placed in the 12th District; it does
not discuss the political consequences of failing to do so;it is addressed only to two members of the legislature; and
it suggests that the legislature paid less attention to race inrespect to the 12th District than in respect to the 1st District, where the e-mail provides a far more extensive, de-tailed discussion of racial percentages. It is less persuasive
than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significantin other redistricting cases. See

Vera, supra, at 959 (O'Connor, J., principal opinion) (State conceded that one of itsgoals was to create a majority-minority district);

Miller,supra, at 907 (State set out to create majority-minority

district); Shaw II, 517 U. S., at 906 (recounting testimonyby Cohen that creating a majority-minority district was
the "principal reason" for the 1992 version of District 12).Nonetheless, the e-mail offers some support for the District
Court's conclusion. E

As we have said, we assume that the maps appendedto appellees' brief reflect the record insofar as that record

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

255Cite as: 532 U. S. 234 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
describes the relation between District 12's boundaries andreliably Democratic voting behavior. Consequently we shall

consider appellees' related claims, made on appeal, that themaps provide significant support for the District Court, in
that they show how the legislature might have "swapped"several more heavily African-American District 12 precincts
for other less heavily African-American adjacent precincts--
without harming its basic "safely Democratic" political objec-tive. Cf.

supra, at 246-247.
First, appellees suggest, without identifying any specificswap, that the legislature could have brought within District

12 several reliably Democratic, primarily white, precincts in
Forsyth County. See Brief for Appellees 30. None of these
precincts, however, is more reliably Democratic than the precincts immediately adjacent and within District 12. See Appendix A, infra (showing Democratic strength reflected by
Republican victories in each precinct); App. 484 (showing
Democratic strength reflected by Democratic registration).
One of them, the Brown/Douglas Recreation Precinct, is
heavily African-American. See ibid. And the remainder
form a buffer between the home precinct of Fifth District
Representative Richard Burr and the District 12 border,
such that their removal from District 5 would deprive Representative Burr of a large portion of his own hometown,
making him more vulnerable to a challenge from elsewhere
within his district. App. to Juris. Statement 209a; App. 623.
Consequently the Forsyth County precincts do not significantly help appellees' "race, not politics," thesis.

Second, appellees say that the legislature might have
swapped two District 12 Davidson County precincts (Thomasville 1 and Lexington 3) for a District 6 Guilford County
precinct (Greensboro 17). See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25.
Whatever the virtues of such a swap, however, it would have
diminished the size of District 12, geographically producing
an unusually narrow isthmus linking District 12's north with
its south and demographically producing the State's smallest

Opinion of the Court
district, deviating by about 1,300 below the legislatively en-dorsed ideal mean of 552,386 population. Traditional districting considerations consequently militated against anysuch swap. See Record, Deposition of Linwood Lee Jones
122 (stating that legislature's goal was to keep deviationsfrom ideal population to less than 1,000); App. 199 (testimony
of Sen. Cooper to same effect).

Third, appellees suggest that, in Mecklenburg County,two District 12 precincts (Charlotte 81 and LCI-South) be

swapped with two District 9 precincts (Charlotte 10 and 21).See Brief for Appellees 30, n. 25. This suggestion is difficult
to evaluate, as the parties provide no map that specifically
identifies each precinct in Mecklenburg County by name.
Nonetheless, from what we can tell, such a swap would make
the district marginally more white (decreasing the AfricanAmerican population by about 300 persons) while making
the shape more questionable, leaving the precinct immediately to the south of Charlotte 81 jutting out into District 9.
We are not convinced that this proposal materially advances
appellees' claim.

Fourth, appellees argue that the legislature could have
swapped two reliably Democratic Greensboro precincts outside District 12 (11 and 14) for four reliably Republican High
Point precincts (1, 13, 15, and 19) placed within District 12.
See ibid. The swap would not have improved racial balance
significantly, however, for each of the six precincts have an
African-American population of less than 35%. Additionally, it too would have altered the shape of District 12 for
the worse. See Appendix D, infra; see also App. 622 (testimony of Gerry Cohen). And, in any event, the decision to
exclude the two Greensboro precincts seems to reflect the
legislature's decision to draw boundaries that follow main
thoroughfares in Guilford County. App. to Juris. Statement
205a; App. 575.

Even if our judgments in respect to a few of these precincts are wrong, a showing that the legislature might

Opinion of the Court
have "swapped" a handful of precincts out of a total of 154precincts, involving a population of a few hundred out of a

total population of about half a million, cannot significantlystrengthen appellees' case.

IV
We concede the record contains a modicum of evidenceoffering support for the District Court's conclusion. That

evidence includes the Cohen e-mail, Senator Cooper's refer-ence to "racial balance," and to a minor degree, some aspects
of Dr. Weber's testimony. The evidence taken together,however, does not show that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries. Thatis because race in this case correlates closely with political
behavior. The basic question is whether the legislaturedrew District 12's boundaries because of race

rather thanbecause of political behavior (coupled with traditional, nonracial districting considerations). It is not, as the dissentcontends, see post, at 266 (opinion of

Thomas, J.), whether alegislature may defend its districting decisions based on a

"stereotype" about African-American voting behavior. Andgiven the fact that the party attacking the legislature's decision bears the burden of proving that racial considerationsare "dominant and controlling,"

Miller, 515 U. S., at 913,given the "demanding" nature of that burden of proof,

id., at929 (O'C
onnor, J., concurring), and given the sensitivity, the"extraordinary caution," that district courts must show to

avoid treading upon legislative prerogatives, id., at 916 (ma-jority opinion), the attacking party has not successfully
shown that race, rather than politics, predominantly accountsfor the result. The record leaves us with the "definite and
firm conviction," United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S., at 395,that the District Court erred in finding to the contrary.
And we do not believe that providing appellees a furtheropportunity to make their "precinct swapping" arguments in
the District Court could change this result.

532US1 Unit: $U41 [09-20-02 08:38:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
258 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Opinion of the Court
We can put the matter more generally as follows: In a casesuch as this one where majority-minority districts (or the

approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identi-fication correlates highly with political affiliation, the party
attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show atthe least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are com-parably consistent with traditional districting principles.
That party must also show that those districting alterna-tives would have brought about significantly greater racial
balance. Appellees failed to make any such showing here.We conclude that the District Court's contrary findings are
clearly erroneous. Because of this disposition, we need notaddress appellants' alternative grounds for reversal.

The judgment of the District Court is

Reversed.

Thomas, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The issue for the District Court was whether racial con-siderations were predominant in the design of North Carolina's Congressional District 12. The issue for this Courtis simply whether the District Court's factual finding--
that racial considerations did predominate--was clearly erro-neous. Because I do not believe the court below committed
clear error, I respectfully dissent.

I
The District Court's conclusion that race was the pre-dominant factor motivating the North Carolina Legislature

is a factual finding. See Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U. S. 541,549 (1999); Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U. S. 567,
580 (1997); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 905 (1996); Miller v.Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 910 (1995). See also Anderson v.
Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 573 (1985) ("[I]ntentional dis-crimination is a finding of fact . . ."). Accordingly, we should
not overturn the District Court's determination unless it isclearly erroneous. See Lawyer, supra, at 580; Shaw, supra,
at 910; Miller, supra, at 917. We are not permitted to re-verse the court's finding "simply because [we are] convinced
that [we] would have decided the case differently." Anderson, supra, at 573. "Where there are two permissible viewsof the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot

be clearly erroneous." 470 U. S., at 574. We should upsetthe District Court's finding only if we are " `left with the
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been com-mitted.' " Id., at 573 (quoting United States v. United States
Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)).The Court does cite cases that address the correct standard of review, see ante, at 242, and does couch its conclusionin "clearly erroneous" terms, see ante, at 257-258. But
these incantations of the correct standard are empty ges-tures, contradicted by the Court's conclusion that it must

260 EASLEY v. CROMARTIE

Thomas, J., dissenting
engage in "extensive review." See ante, at 243. In severalways, the Court ignores its role as a reviewing court and

engages in its own factfinding enterprise.1 First, the Courtsuggests that there is some significance to the absence of
an intermediate court in this action. See ante, at 242-243.This cannot be a legitimate consideration. If it were legitimate, we would have mentioned it in prior redistricting
cases. After all, in Miller and Shaw, we also did not havethe benefit of intermediate appellate review. See also

United States v. Oregon State Medical Soc., 343 U. S. 326,330, 332 (1952) (engaging in clear error review of factual
findings in a Sherman Act case where there was no interme-diate appellate review). In these cases, we stated that the
standard was simply "clearly erroneous." Moreover, theimplication of the Court's argument is that intermediate
courts, because they are the first reviewers of the factfinder'sconclusions, should engage in a level of review more rigorous
than clear error review. This suggestion is not supportedby law. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) ("Findings of fact,
whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be
set aside unless clearly erroneous . . ."). In fact, the verycase the Court cited to articulate clear error review discussed the standard as it applied to an intermediate appel-late court, which obviously did not have the benefit of another layer of review. See ante, at 242 (citing Anderson,
supra, at 573).

Second, the Court appears to discount clear error reviewhere because the trial was "not lengthy."

Ante, at 243.
Even if considerations such as the length of the trial were
relevant in deciding how to review factual findings, an as1 Despite its citation of Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U. S. 485 (1984), ante, at 243, I do not read the Court's opinion to
suggest that the predominant factor inquiry, like the actual malice inquiry
in Bose, should be reviewed de novo because it is a "constitutional fac[t]."

sumption about which I have my doubts,2 these considera-tions would not counsel against deference in this action.

The trial was not "just a few hours" long, Bose Corp. v. Con-sumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 500
(1984); it lasted for three days in which the court heard thetestimony of 12 witnesses. And quite apart from the total
trial time, the District Court sifted through hundreds ofpages of deposition testimony and expert analysis, including
statistical analysis. It also should not be forgotten that onemember of the panel has reviewed the iterations of District
12 since 1992. If one were to calibrate clear error reviewaccording to the trier of fact's familiarity with the case, there
is simply no question that the court here gained a workingknowledge of the facts of this litigation in myriad ways over
a period far longer than three days.Third, the Court downplays deference to the District
Court's finding by highlighting that the key evidence wasexpert testimony requiring no traditional credibility determinations. See ante, at 243. As a factual matter, the Courtoverlooks the District Court's express assessment of the legislative redistricting leader's credibility. See Cromartie v.Hunt, 133 F. Supp. 2d 407, 419, 420, n. 8 (EDNC 2000).
It is also likely that the court's interpretation of the e-mailwritten by Gerry Cohen, the primary drafter of District 12,
was influenced by its evaluation of Cohen as a witness. Seeid., at 420, n. 8. See also App. 261-268. And, as a legal
matter, the Court's emphasis on the technical nature of the

2 Bose, which the Court cites to support its discounting of clear error
review, ante, at 243, does state that "the likelihood that the appellate court
will rely on the presumption [of correctness of factual findings] tends to
increase when trial judges have lived with the controversy for weeks or
months instead of just a few hours." 466 U. S., at 500. It is unclear,
however, what bearing this statement of fact--that appellate courts will
defer to factual findings more often when the trial was long--had on our
understanding of the scope of clear error review. In Bose, we held that
a lower court's "actual malice" finding must be reviewed de novo, see
id., at 514, not that clear error review must be calibrated to the length
of trial.

evidence misses the mark. Although we have recognizedthat particular weight should be given to a trial court's credibility determinations, we have never held that factual find-ings based on documentary evidence and expert testimony
justify "extensive review," ante, at 243. On the contrary,we explained in Anderson that "[t]he rationale for deference . . . is not limited to the superiority of the trial judge'sposition to make determinations of credibility." 470 U. S.,
at 574. See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a) (specifically re-ferring to oral and documentary evidence). Instead, the rationale for deference extends to all determinations of factbecause of the trial judge's "expertise" in making such determinations. 470 U. S., at 574. Accordingly, deference to thefactfinder "is the rule, not the exception,"

id., at 575, and Isee no reason to depart from this rule in the case before

us now.Finally, perhaps the best evidence that the Court has
emptied clear error review of meaningful content in the re-districting context (and the strongest testament to the fact
that the District Court was dealing with a complex factpattern) is the Court's foray into the minutiae of the record.
I do not doubt this Court's ability to sift through volumes offacts or to argue

its interpretation of those facts persua-sively. But I do doubt the wisdom, efficiency, increased accuracy, and legitimacy of an extensive review that is anymore searching than clear error review. See id., 574-575
("Duplication of the trial judge's efforts . . . would very likelycontribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources"). Thus,I would follow our precedents and simply review the District
Court's finding for clear error.

Reviewing for clear error, I cannot say that the DistrictCourt's view of the evidence was impermissible.

court relied on objective measures of compactness, whichshow that District 12 is the most geographically scattered

district in North Carolina, to support its conclusion that thedistrict's design was not dictated by traditional districting
concerns. 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 419. Although this evidencewas available when we held that summary judgment was
inappropriate, we certainly did not hold that it was irrele-vant in determining whether racial gerrymandering occurred. On the contrary, we determined that there was atriable issue of fact. Moreover, although we acknowledged
"that a district's unusual shape can give rise to an inferenceof political motivation," we "doubt[ed] that a bizarre shape
equally supports a political inference and a racial one."
Hunt, 526 U. S., at 547, n. 3. As we explained, "[s]omedistricts . . . are `so highly irregular that [they] rationally

cannot be understood as anything other than an effort tosegregat[e] . . . voters' on the basis of race." Ibid. (internal
quotation marks omitted).Second, the court relied on the expert opinion of Dr.
Weber, who interpreted statistical data to conclude thatthere were Democratic precincts with low black populations excluded from District 12, which would have createda more compact district had they been included.

4 133

F. Supp. 2d, at 419. And contrary to the Court's assertion,Dr. Weber did not merely examine the registration data in

reaching his conclusions. Dr. Weber explained that he refoby virtue of their election in an unconstitutional racially gerrymandered
district. No doubt this assumption is a questionable proposition. Because the issue was not presented in this action, however, I do not read
the Court's opinion as addressing it.

4 I do not think it necessary to impose a new burden on appellees to

show that districting alternatives would have brought about "significantly
greater racial balance." Ante, at 258. I cannot say that it was impermissible for the court to conclude that race predominated in this action
even if only a slightly better district could be drawn absent racial considerations. The District Court may reasonably have found that racial motivations predominated in selecting one alternative over another even if the
net effect on racial balance was not "significant."

cused his analysis on performance. He did so in response
to our concerns, when we reversed the District Court's summary judgment finding, that voter registration might not be
the best measure of the Democratic nature of a precinct.
See ibid. (citing Trial Tr., which appears at App. 90-92, 105-
107, 156-157). This fact was not lost on the District Court,
which specifically referred to those pages of the record covering Dr. Weber's analysis of performance.

Third, the court credited Dr. Weber's testimony that the
districting decisions could not be explained by political motives.5 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 419. In the first instance, I, like
the Court, ante, at 246-247, might well have concluded that
District 12 was not significantly "safer" than several other
districts in North Carolina merely because its Democratic
reliability exceeded the optimum by only 3 percent. And I
might have concluded that it would make political sense for
incumbents to adopt a "the more reliable the better" policy

5 Dr. Weber admitted that, when he first concluded that race was the
motivating factor, he was under the mistaken impression that the legislature's computer program provided only racial, not political, data. The
Court finds that this admission undercut the validity of Dr. Weber's
conclusions. See ante, at 249-250. Although the District Court could
have found that this impression was a sufficiently significant assumption
in Dr. Weber's analysis that the conclusions drawn from the analysis were
suspect, it was not required to do so as a matter of logic. The court
reasonably could have believed that the false impression had very little
to do with the statistical analysis that was largely responsible for
Dr. Weber's conclusions.

In addition, the Court discounts Dr. Weber's testimony because he "express[ed] disdain for a process that we have cautioned courts to respect,"
ante, at 250. Dr. Weber did openly state that he believes that the best
districts he had seen in the 1990's were those drawn by judges, not by
legislatures. App. 150-151. However, whether Dr. Weber was simply
stating the conclusions he has reached through his experience or was expressing a feeling of contempt toward the legislature is precisely the kind
of tone, demeanor, and bias determination that even the Court acknowledges should be left to the factfinder, cf. ante, at 243.

in districting. However, I certainly cannot say that the
court's inference from the facts was impermissible.6

Fourth, the court discredited the testimony of the State's
witness, Dr. Peterson. 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 420 (explaining
that Dr. Weber testified that Dr. Peterson's analysis "ignor[ed] the core," "ha[d] not been appropriately done," and
was "unreliable"). Again, like the Court, if I were a district
court judge, I might have found that Dr. Weber's insistence
that one could not ignore the core was unpersuasive.7 However, even if the core could be ignored, it seems to me that
Dr. Weber's testimony--that Dr. Peterson had failed to analyze all of the segments and thus that his analysis was incomplete, App. 119-120--reasonably could have supported the
court's conclusion.

Finally, the court found that other evidence demonstrated
that race was foremost on the legislative agenda: an e-mail

6 The Court also criticizes Dr. Weber's testimony that Precinct 77's split
was racially motivated and his proposed alternative that all of Precinct 77
could have been moved into District 9. Apparently the Court believes
that it is obvious that the Republican incumbent in District 9 would not
have wanted the whole of Precinct 77 in her district. See ante, at 248.
But the Court addresses only part of Dr. Weber's alternative of how the
districts could have been drawn in a race-neutral fashion. Dr. Weber
explained that the alternative was not simply to move Precinct 77 into
District 9. The alternative would also include moving other reliably
Democratic precincts out of District 9 and into District 12, which presumably would have satisfied the incumbent. App. 157. This move
would have had the result, not only of keeping Precinct 77 intact, but
also of widening the corridor between the eastern and western portions
of District 9 and thereby increasing the functional contiguity. The
Court's other criticism, that moving all of Precinct 77 into District 12
would not work, is simply a red herring. Dr. Weber talked only of moving
all of Precinct 77 into District 9, not of moving all of Precinct 77 into
District 12.

7 Of course, considering that District 12 has never been constitutionally

drawn, Dr. Weber's criticism--that the problem with the district lies not
just at its edges, but at its core--is not without force.

from the drafter of the 1992 and 1997 plans to senators incharge of legislative redistricting, the computer capability

to draw the district by race, and statements made by Sena-tor Cooper that the legislature was going to be able to avoid
Shaw's majority-minority trigger by ending just short of themajority.

8 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 420. The e-mail, in combination with the indirect evidence, is evidence ample enough to
support the District Court's finding for purposes of clearerror review. The drafter of the redistricting plans reported in the bluntest of terms: "I have moved GreensboroBlack community into the 12th [District], and now need to
take . . . 60,000 out of the 12th [District]." App. 369. Cer-tainly the District Court was entitled to believe that the
drafter was targeting voters and shifting district boundariespurely on the basis of race. The Court tries to belittle the
import of this evidence by noting that the e-mail does notdiscuss

why blacks were being targeted. See ante, at 254.
However, the District Court was assigned the task of determining whether, not why, race predominated. As I see it,
this inquiry is sufficient to answer the constitutional question because racial gerrymandering offends the Constitution
whether the motivation is malicious or benign. It is not a
defense that the legislature merely may have drawn the district based on the stereotype that blacks are reliable Demo8 The court also relied on the statement of legislative redistricting leader
Senator Cooper to the North Carolina Legislature, see 133 F. Supp. 2d, at
419, in which the senator mentioned the goals of geographical, political,
and racial balance, App. 460. In isolation, this statement does appear to
support only the finding that race was a motive. Unlike this Court, however, the District Court had the advantage of listening to and watching
Senator Cooper testify. I therefore am in no position to question the
court's likely analysis that, although Senator Cooper mentioned all three
motives, the predominance of race was apparent. This determination was
made all the more reasonable by the fact that the District Court found
the senator's claim regarding the "happenstance" final composition of the
district to lack credibility in light of the e-mail. 133 F. Supp. 2d, at 420,

cratic voters. And regardless of whether the e-mail tendedto show that the legislature was operating under an even

stronger racial motivation when it was drawing District1 than when it was drawing District 12, cf. ibid., I am
convinced that the District Court permissibly could haveaccorded great weight to this e-mail as direct evidence of
a racial motive. Surely, a decision can be racially motivatedeven if another decision was also racially motivated.

If I were the District Court, I might have reached thesame conclusion that the Court does, that "[t]he evidence
taken together . . . does not show that racial considerationspredominated in the drawing of District 12's boundaries,"
ante, at 257. But I am not the trier of fact, and it is not myrole to weigh evidence in the first instance. The only question that this Court should decide is whether the DistrictCourt's finding of racial predominance was clearly erroneous.
In light of the direct evidence of racial motive and the infer-ences that may be drawn from the circumstantial evidence,
I am satisfied that the District Court's finding was permissi-ble, even if not compelled by the record.

CLARK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT v. BREEDEN

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 00-866. Decided April 23, 2001
At a meeting with respondent and a male employee to review job

applicants' psychological evaluation reports, respondent's male supervisor read aloud a sexually explicit remark that one applicant had
made to a co-worker, looked at respondent, and stated, "I don't know
what that means." The other employee replied, "Well, I'll tell you

later," and both men chuckled. Respondent complained about the
comment to the offending supervisor and other officials of their employer, petitioner Clark County School District. Pursuant to Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, she subsequently filed a 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e-3(a) retaliation claim against petitioner, asserting that she was
punished for these complaints and also for filing charges against petitioner with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and for filing the present suit. The
District Court granted petitioner summary judgment, but the Ninth
Circuit reversed.

Held: Respondent's claims are insufficient to withstand a summary judgment motion. No one could reasonably believe that the incident of
which respondent complained violated Title VII. Sexual harassment is
actionable under Title VII only if it is so severe or pervasive as to alter
the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working
environment. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 786. Simple
teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in employment terms
and conditions. The actions of respondent's supervisor and co-worker
are at worst an isolated incident that cannot remotely be considered
"extremely serious." Regarding respondent's claim that she was punitively transferred for filing charges and the present suit, she failed to
show the requisite causal connection between her protected activities
and the transfer. Petitioner did not implement the transfer until 20
months after respondent filed her charges, and it was contemplating the
transfer before it learned of her suit.

Certiorari granted; 232 F. 3d 893, reversed.

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat.
255, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a), it is unlawful
"for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII],
or because [the employee] has made a charge, testified,
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII]." In 1997, respondent filed a $ 2000e-3(a) retaliation claim against petitioner
Clark County School District. The claim as eventually
amended alleged that petitioner had taken two separate adverse employment actions against her in response to two different protected activities in which she had engaged. The
District Court granted summary judgment to petitioner,
No. CV-S-97-365-DWH(RJJ) (D. Nev., Feb. 9, 1999), but a
panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed

On October 21, 1994, respondent's male supervisor met
with respondent and another male employee to review the
psychological evaluation reports of four job applicants. The
report for one of the applicants disclosed that the applicant
had once commented to a co-worker, "I hear making love
to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon." Brief in
Opposition 3. At the meeting respondent's supervisor read
the comment aloud, looked at respondent and stated, "I don't
know what that means." Ibid. The other employee then
said, "Well, I'll tell you later," and both men chuckled. Ibid.
Respondent later complained about the comment to the offending employee, to Assistant Superintendent George Ann
Rice, the employee's supervisor, and to another assistant

superintendent of petitioner. Her first claim of retaliationasserts that she was punished for these complaints.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has applied$ 2000e-3(a) to protect employee "oppos[ition]" not just to
practices that are actually "made . . . unlawful" by Title VII,but also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe were unlawful. 2000 WL 991821, at *1 (stating that
respondent's opposition was protected "if she had a reason-able, good faith belief that the incident involving the sexually

explicit remark constituted unlawful sexual harassment");
Trent v. Valley Electric Assn. Inc., 41 F. 3d 524, 526 (CA9
1994). We have no occasion to rule on the propriety of this
interpretation, because even assuming it is correct, no one
could reasonably believe that the incident recounted above
violated Title VII.

Title VII forbids actions taken on the basis of sex that
"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment."
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). Just three Terms ago, we reiterated, what was plain from our previous decisions, that sexual
harassment is actionable under Title VII only if it is "so `severe or pervasive' as to `alter the conditions of [the victim's]
employment and create an abusive working environment.' "
Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 786 (1998) (quoting
Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67
(1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). See also

Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998) (Title VII "forbids only
behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the `conditions'

measured in isolation; instead, "whether an environment is
sufficiently hostile or abusive" must be judged "by `looking
at all the circumstances,' including the `frequency of the dis532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

criminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physicallythreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;

and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee'swork performance.' "

Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at
787-788 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S.17, 23 (1993)). Hence, "[a] recurring point in [our] opinions is

that simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents
(unless extremely serious) will not amount to discrimina-tory changes in the `terms and conditions of employment.' "

Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at 788 (citation and internalquotation marks omitted).

No reasonable person could have believed that the single
incident recounted above violated Title VII's standard. The
ordinary terms and conditions of respondent's job required
her to review the sexually explicit statement in the course
of screening job applicants. Her co-workers who participated in the hiring process were subject to the same requirement, and indeed, in the District Court respondent "conceded that it did not bother or upset her" to read the
statement in the file. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15 (District
Court opinion). Her supervisor's comment, made at a meeting to review the application, that he did not know what the
statement meant; her co-worker's responding comment; and
the chuckling of both are at worst an "isolated inciden[t]"
that cannot remotely be considered "extremely serious," as
our cases require, Faragher v. Boca Raton, supra, at 788.
The holding of the Court of Appeals to the contrary must
be reversed.

Besides claiming that she was punished for complaining to
petitioner's personnel about the alleged sexual harassment,
respondent also claimed that she was punished for filing
charges against petitioner with the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and for filing the present suit. Respondent
filed her lawsuit on April 1, 1997; on April 10, 1997, respondent's supervisor, Assistant Superintendent Rice, "mentioned

to Allin Chandler, Executive Director of plaintiff 's union,that she was contemplating transferring plaintiff to the

position of Director of Professional Development Education,"App. to Pet. for Cert. 11-12 (District Court opinion); and
this transfer was "carried through" in May, Brief in Opposi-tion 8. In order to show, as her defense against summary
judgment required, the existence of a causal connection between her protected activities and the transfer, respondent"relie[d] wholly on the temporal proximity of the filing of her

complaint on April 1, 1997 and Rice's statement to plaintiff 'sunion representative on April 10, 1997 that she was considering transferring plaintiff to the [new] position." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 21-22 (District Court opinion). The District
Court, however, found that respondent did not serve petitioner with the summons and complaint until April 11, 1997,
one day after Rice had made the statement, and Rice filed
an affidavit stating that she did not become aware of the
lawsuit until after April 11, a claim that respondent did not
challenge. Hence, the court concluded, respondent "ha[d]
not shown that any causal connection exists between her

protected activities and the adverse employment decision."
Id., at 21.

The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on two facts: The
EEOC had issued a right-to-sue letter to respondent three
months before Rice announced she was contemplating the
transfer, and the actual transfer occurred one month after
Rice learned of respondent's suit. 2000 WL 991821, at *3.
The latter fact is immaterial in light of the fact that petitioner concededly was contemplating the transfer before it
learned of the suit. Employers need not suspend previously
planned transfers upon discovering that a Title VII suit has
been filed, and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality.

As for the right-to-sue letter: Respondent did not rely on
that letter in the District Court and did not mention it in

532US1 Unit: $U42 [09-05-02 19:40:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
her opening brief on appeal. Her demonstration of causalityall along had rested upon the connection between the transfer and the filing of her lawsuit--to which connection theletter was irrelevant. When, however, petitioner's answering brief in the Court of Appeals demonstrated conclusivelythe lack of causation between the filing of respondent's lawsuit and Rice's decision, respondent mentioned the letter for
the first time in her reply brief, Reply Brief in No. 99-15522(CA9) pp. 9-10. The Ninth Circuit's opinion did not adopt

respondent's utterly implausible suggestion that the EEOC'sissuance of a right-to-sue letter--an action in which the employee takes no part--is a protected activity of the employee,
see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a). Rather, the opinion suggests
that the letter provided petitioner with its first notice of
respondent's charge before the EEOC, and hence allowed
the inference that the transfer proposal made three months
later was petitioner's reaction to the charge. See 2000 WL
991821, at *3. This will not do.

First, there is no indication that Rice even knew about the
right-to-sue letter when she proposed transferring respondent. And second, if one presumes she knew about it, one
must also presume that she (or her predecessor) knew almost
two years earlier about the protected action (filing of the
EEOC complaint) that the letter supposedly disclosed. (The
complaint had been filed on August 23, 1995, and both Title
VII and its implementing regulations require that an employer be given notice within 10 days of filing, 42 U. S. C.

$$ 2000e-5(b), (e)(1); 29 CFR $ 1601.14 (2000).) The cases
that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's
knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment
action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima
facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must
be "very close," O'Neal v. Ferguson Constr. Co., 237 F. 3d
1248, 1253 (CA10 2001). See, e. g., Richmond v. Oneok, Inc.,
120 F. 3d 205, 209 (CA10 1997) (3-month period insufficient);
Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F. 2d 1168, 1174-1175 (CA7 1992)

(4-month period insufficient). Action taken (as here) 20months later suggests, by itself, no causality at all.

In short, neither the grounds that respondent presentedto the District Court, nor the ground she added on appeal,
nor even the ground the Court of Appeals developed on itsown, sufficed to establish a dispute substantial enough to
withstand the motion for summary judgment. The DistrictCourt's granting of that motion was correct. The judgment
of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

of that title prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national
origin in covered programs and activities. Section 602 authorizes
federal agencies to effectuate $ 601 by issuing regulations, and the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation forbidding funding recipients to utilize criteria or
administrative methods having the effect of subjecting individuals to
discrimination based on the prohibited grounds. Respondent Sandoval
brought this class action to enjoin the Department's decision to administer state driver's license examinations only in English, arguing that
it violated the DOJ regulation because it had the effect of subjecting
non-English speakers to discrimination based on their national origin.
Agreeing, the District Court enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speakers. The Eleventh Circuit
affirmed. Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that Title VI did
not provide respondents a cause of action to enforce the regulation.

Held: There is no private right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI. Pp. 279-293.

(a) Three aspects of Title VI must be taken as given. First, private
individuals may sue to enforce $ 601. See, e. g., Cannon v. University
of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 694, 696, 699, 703, 710-711. Second, $ 601
prohibits only intentional discrimination. See, e. g., Alexander v.
Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 293. Third, it must be assumed for purposes of
deciding this case that regulations promulgated under $ 602 may validly
proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on racial groups, even
though such activities are permissible under $ 601. Pp. 279-282.

(b) This Court has not, however, held that Title VI disparate-impact
regulations may be enforced through a private right of action. Cannon
was decided on the assumption that the respondent there had inten532US1 Unit: $U43 [09-19-02 20:35:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tionally discriminated against the petitioner, see 441 U. S., at 680. In
Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582,
the Court held that private individuals could not recover compensatory
damages under Title VI except for intentional discrimination. Of the
five Justices who also voted to uphold disparate-impact regulations,
three expressly reserved the question of a direct private right of action
to enforce them, id., at 645, n. 18. Pp. 282-284.

(c) Nor does it follow from the three points taken as given that Congress must have intended such a private right of action. There is no
doubt that regulations applying $ 601's ban on intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. But the
disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply $ 601--since they forbid conduct that $ 601 permits--and thus the private right of action
to enforce $ 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank
of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173. That right must come, if at all,
from the independent force of $ 602. Pp. 284-286.

(d) Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to
enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche Ross & Co.
v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 578. This Court will not revert to the understanding of private causes of action, represented by J. I. Case Co. v.
Borak, 377 U. S. 426, 433, that held sway when Title VI was enacted.
That understanding was abandoned in Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, 78.
Nor does the Court agree with the Government's contention that cases
interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given dispositive
weight to the expectations that the enacting Congress had formed in
light of the contemporary legal context. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378-379; Cannon, supra,
at 698-699; and Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U. S. 174, distinguished.
Pp. 286-288.

(e) The search for Congress's intent in this case begins and ends
with Title VI's text and structure. The "rights-creating" language so
critical to Cannon's $ 601 analysis, 441 U. S., at 690, n. 13, is completely
absent from $ 602. Whereas $ 601 decrees that "[n]o person . . . shall . . .
be subjected to discrimination," $ 602 limits federal agencies to "effectuat[ing]" rights created by $ 601. And $ 602 focuses neither on the
individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated, but on the regulating agencies. Hence, there is far less reason
to infer a private remedy in favor of individual persons, Cannon, supra,
at 690-691. The methods $ 602 expressly provides for enforcing its regulations, which place elaborate restrictions on agency enforcement, also
suggest a congressional intent not to create a private remedy through

$ 602. See, e. g., Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U. S. 527, 533.
Pp. 288-291.

(f) The Court rejects arguments that the regulations at issue contain
rights-creating language and so must be privately enforceable; that
amendments to Title VI in $ 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments
of 1986 and $ 6 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 "ratified"
decisions finding an implied private right of action to enforce the regulations; and that the congressional intent to create a right of action must
be inferred under Curran, supra, at 353, 381-382. Pp. 291-293.

278 ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether private individu-als may sue to enforce disparate-impact regulations promulgated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

I
The Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department),of which petitioner James Alexander is the director, accepted

grants of financial assistance from the United States Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Transportation
(DOT) and so subjected itself to the restrictions of Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000d et seq. Section 601 of that Title providesthat no person shall, "on the ground of race, color, or national
origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the bene-fits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program
or activity" covered by Title VI. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d. Sec-tion 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the provisions of [$ 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or orders ofgeneral applicability," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1, and the DOJ in
an exercise of this authority promulgated a regulation for-bidding funding recipients to "utilize criteria or methods of
administration which have the effect of subjecting individu-als to discrimination because of their race, color, or national
origin . . . ." 28 CFR $ 42.104(b)(2) (2000). See also 49 CFR$ 21.5(b)(2) (2000) (similar DOT regulation).

The State of Alabama amended its Constitution in 1990to declare English "the official language of the state of

Opinion of the Court
Alabama." Amdt. 509. Pursuant to this provision and,petitioners have argued, to advance public safety, the Department decided to administer state driver's license ex-aminations only in English. Respondent Sandoval, as representative of a class, brought suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Middle District of Alabama to enjoin
the English-only policy, arguing that it violated the DOJ reg-ulation because it had the effect of subjecting non-English
speakers to discrimination based on their national origin.The District Court agreed. It enjoined the policy and ordered the Department to accommodate non-English speak-ers.

Sandoval v. Hagan, 7 F. Supp. 2d 1234 (1998). Peti-tioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh

Circuit, which affirmed. Sandoval v. Hagan, 197 F. 3d 484(1999). Both courts rejected petitioners' argument that
Title VI did not provide respondents a cause of action toenforce the regulation.

We do not inquire here whether the DOJ regulation wasauthorized by $ 602, or whether the courts below were correct to hold that the English-only policy had the effect ofdiscriminating on the basis of national origin. The petition
for writ of certiorari raised, and we agreed to review, onlythe question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion:
whether there is a private cause of action to enforce the reg-ulation. 530 U. S. 1305 (2000).

II
Although Title VI has often come to this Court, it is fairto say (indeed, perhaps an understatement) that our opinions

have not eliminated all uncertainty regarding its commands.For purposes of the present case, however, it is clear from
our decisions, from Congress's amendments of Title VI, andfrom the parties' concessions that three aspects of Title VI
must be taken as given. First, private individuals may sueto enforce $ 601 of Title VI and obtain both injunctive relief
and damages. In Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441

280 ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 677 (1979), the Court held that a private right of action
existed to enforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681 et seq. The
reasoning of that decision embraced the existence of a private right to enforce Title VI as well. "Title IX," the Court
noted, "was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964." 441 U. S., at 694. And, "[i]n 1972 when Title IX
was enacted, the [parallel] language in Title VI had already
been construed as creating a private remedy." Id., at 696.
That meant, the Court reasoned, that Congress had intended
Title IX, like Title VI, to provide a private cause of action.
Id., at 699, 703, 710-711. Congress has since ratified Cannon's holding. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act
Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7,
expressly abrogated States' sovereign immunity against
suits brought in federal court to enforce Title VI and provided that in a suit against a State "remedies (including
remedies both at law and in equity) are available . . . to the
same extent as such remedies are available . . . in the suit
against any public or private entity other than a State,"

$ 2000d-7(a)(2). We recognized in Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), that $ 2000d-7
"cannot be read except as a validation of Cannon's holding."
Id., at 72; see also id., at 78 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It is thus beyond dispute that private individuals may sue to enforce $ 601.

Second, it is similarly beyond dispute--and no party disagrees--that $ 601 prohibits only intentional discrimination.
In Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978),
the Court reviewed a decision of the California Supreme
Court that had enjoined the University of California Medical School from "according any consideration to race in its
admissions process." Id., at 272. Essential to the Court's
holding reversing that aspect of the California court's decision was the determination that $ 601 "proscribe[s] only
those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Pro532US1 Unit: $U43 [09-19-02 20:35:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tection Clause or the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 287 (opin-ion of Powell, J.); see also

id., at 325, 328, 352 (opinion of
Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). In Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463
U. S. 582 (1983), the Court made clear that under Bakke onlyintentional discrimination was forbidden by $ 601. 463 U. S.,

at 610-611 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by
Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). What we said in
Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 293 (1985), is true today:
"Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination." 1

Third, we must assume for purposes of deciding this case
that regulations promulgated under $ 602 of Title VI may
validly proscribe activities that have a disparate impact on
racial groups, even though such activities are permissible
under $ 601. Though no opinion of this Court has held that,
five Justices in Guardians voiced that view of the law at

1 Since the parties do not dispute this point, it is puzzling to see Justice
Stevens go out of his way to disparage the decisions in Regents of Univ.
of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), and Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv.
Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983), as "somewhat haphazard,"
post, at 307 (dissenting opinion), particularly since he had already accorded
stare decisis effect to the former 18 years ago, see Guardians, 463 U. S.,
at 639-642 (dissenting opinion), and since he participated in creating
the latter, see ibid. Nor does Justice Stevens's reliance on Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837
(1984), see post, at 309-310, explain his about-face, since he expressly reaffirms, see post, at 309, n. 18, the settled principle that decisions of this
Court declaring the meaning of statutes prior to Chevron need not be
reconsidered after Chevron in light of agency regulations that were already in force when our decisions were issued, Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB,
502 U. S. 527, 536-537 (1992); Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary
Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990); see also Sullivan v. Everhart, 494
U. S. 83, 103-104, n. 6 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("It is, of course, of
no importance that [an opinion] predates Chevron . . . . As we made clear
in Chevron, the interpretive maxims summarized therein were `wellsettled principles' ").

least as alternative grounds for their decisions, see 463 U. S.,at 591-592 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 623, n. 15 (Marshall,

J., dissenting); id., at 643-645 (Stevens, J., joined by Bren-nan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting), and dictum in Alexander
v. Choate is to the same effect, see 469 U. S., at 293, 295,n. 11. These statements are in considerable tension with
the rule of Bakke and Guardians that $ 601 forbids only in-tentional discrimination, see,

e. g., Guardians Assn. v. CivilServ. Comm'n of New York City, supra, at 612-613 (O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment), but petitioners have notchallenged the regulations here. We therefore assume for

the purposes of deciding this case that the DOJ and DOTregulations proscribing activities that have a disparate impact on the basis of race are valid.Respondents assert that the issue in this case, like the first
two described above, has been resolved by our cases. Toreject a private cause of action to enforce the disparateimpact regulations, they say, we would "[have] to ignorethe actual language of

Guardians and Cannon." Brief forRespondents 13. The language in Cannon to which respondents refer does not in fact support their position, as weshall discuss at length below, see infra, at 288-290. But in
any event, this Court is bound by holdings, not language.Cannon was decided on the assumption that the University
of Chicago had intentionally discriminated against petitioner.See 441 U. S., at 680 (noting that respondents "admitted arguendo" that petitioner's "applications for admission to medi-cal school were denied by the respondents because she is a
woman"). It therefore held that Title IX created a privateright of action to enforce its ban on intentional discrimination, but had no occasion to consider whether the rightreached regulations barring disparate-impact discrimination.2 In Guardians, the Court held that private individu2 Although the dissent acknowledges that "the breadth of [Cannon's]
precedent is a matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ," post, at
313, it disagrees with our reading of Cannon's holding because it thinks

Opinion of the Court
als could not recover compensatory damages under Title VI
except for intentional discrimination. Five Justices in addition voted to uphold the disparate-impact regulations (four
would have declared them invalid, see 463 U. S., at 611, n. 5
(Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612-614 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)), but of those five, three
expressly reserved the question of a direct private right
of action to enforce the regulations, saying that "[w]hether
a cause of action against private parties exists directly
under the regulations . . . [is a] questio[n] that [is] not presented by this case." Id., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting).3 Thus, only two Justices had cause to reach the issue

the distinction we draw between disparate-impact and intentional discrimination was "wholly foreign" to that opinion, see post, at 297. Cannon,
however, was decided less than one year after the Court in Bakke had
drawn precisely that distinction with respect to Title VI, see supra, at
280-281, and it is absurd to think that Cannon meant, without discussion,
to ban under Title IX the very disparate-impact discrimination that Bakke
said Title VI permitted. The only discussion in Cannon of Title IX's
scope is found in Justice Powell's dissenting opinion, which simply assumed
that the conclusion that Title IX would be limited to intentional discrimination was "forgone in light of our holding" in Bakke. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 748, n. 19 (1979). The dissent's additional
claim that Cannon provided a private right of action for "all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme contained in Title IX," post,
at 297-298, n. 4 (emphasis added), simply begs the question at the heart
of this case, which is whether a right of action to enforce disparate-impact
regulations must be independently identified, see infra, at 284-286.

3 We of course accept the statement by the author of the dissent that

he "thought" at the time of Guardians that disparate-impact regulations
could be enforced "in an implied action against private parties," post, at
301, n. 6. But we have the better interpretation of what our colleague
wrote in Guardians. In the closing section of his opinion, Justice Stevens concluded that because respondents in that case had "violated the
petitioners' rights under [the] regulations . . . [t]he petitioners were therefore entitled to the compensation they sought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and
were awarded by the District Court." 463 U. S., at 645. The passage
omits any mention of a direct private right of action to enforce the regulations, and the footnote we have quoted in text--which appears immedi532US1 Unit: $U43 [09-19-02 20:35:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN
284 ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL

Opinion of the Court
that respondents say the "actual language" of Guardiansresolves. Neither that case,

4 nor any other in this Court,

has held that the private right of action exists.Nor does it follow straightaway from the three points we

have taken as given that Congress must have intended aprivate right of action to enforce disparate-impact regulations. We do not doubt that regulations applying $ 601's banon intentional discrimination are covered by the cause of action to enforce that section. Such regulations, if valid andreasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, see
NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins.
Co., 513 U. S. 251, 257 (1995); Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844

(1984), and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a sepa-rate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the
statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforcedthrough a private cause of action intends the authoritative
interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well. Themany cases that respondents say have "assumed" that a
cause of action to enforce a statute includes one to enforceits regulations illustrate (to the extent that cases in which
an issue was not presented can illustrate anything) only thispoint; each involved regulations of the type we have just
described, as respondents conceded at oral argument, Tr. ofOral Arg. 33. See

National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 468 (1999) (regulation defining who is a

"recipient" under Title IX); School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Ar-line, 480 U. S. 273, 279-281 (1987) (regulations defining the
terms "physical impairment" and "major life activities" in$ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); Bazemore v. Friday,

ately after this concluding sentence, see id., at 645, n. 18--makes clear
that the omission was not accidental.

compel the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce the
Title VI regulations against private parties . . . ." Post, at 301.

Opinion of the Court
Justices, concurring) (regulation interpreting Title VI to re-quire "affirmative action" remedying effects of intentional

discrimination); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S., at 299, 309(regulations clarifying what sorts of disparate impacts upon
the handicapped were covered by $ 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973, which the Court assumed included some such
impacts). Our decision in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563(1974), falls within the same category. The Title VI regulations at issue in Lau, similar to the ones at issue here, for-bade funding recipients to take actions which had the effect
of discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national ori-gin.

Id., at 568. Unlike our later cases, however, the Courtin Lau interpreted $ 601 itself to proscribe disparate-impact

discrimination, saying that it "rel[ied] solely on $ 601 . . .to reverse the Court of Appeals," id., at 566, and that the
disparate-impact regulations simply "[made] sure that recipi-ents of federal aid . . . conduct[ed] any federally financed
projects consistently with $ 601," id., at 567.5We must face now the question avoided by

Lau, becausewe have since rejected Lau's interpretation of $ 601 as reaching beyond intentional discrimination. See supra, at 280-281. It is clear now that the disparate-impact regulations
do not simply apply $ 601--since they indeed forbid conductthat $ 601 permits--and therefore clear that the private right
of action to enforce $ 601 does not include a private right toenforce these regulations. See Central Bank of Denver,

5 It is true, as the dissent points out, see post, at 296, that three Justices
who concurred in the result in Lau relied on regulations promulgated
under $ 602 to support their position, see 414 U. S., at 570-571 (Stewart,
J., concurring in result). But the five Justices who made up the majority
did not, and their holding is not made coextensive with the concurrence
because their opinion does not expressly preclude (is "consistent with,"
see post, at 296) the concurrence's approach. The Court would be in an
odd predicament if a concurring minority of the Justices could force the
majority to address a point they found it unnecessary (and did not wish)
to address, under compulsion of Justice Stevens's new principle that
silence implies agreement.

286 ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL

Opinion of the Court
N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164,173 (1994) (a "private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based

on a regulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibitedby the text of [the statute]"). That right must come, if at
all, from the independent force of $ 602. As stated earlier,we assume for purposes of this decision that $ 602 confers
the authority to promulgate disparate-impact regulations; 6the question remains whether it confers a private right of
action to enforce them. If not, we must conclude that a fail-ure to comply with regulations promulgated under $ 602 that
is not also a failure to comply with $ 601 is not actionable.Implicit in our discussion thus far has been a particular
understanding of the genesis of private causes of action.Like substantive federal law itself, private rights of action
to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. Touche
Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 578 (1979) (remediesavailable are those "that Congress enacted into law"). The

judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passedto determine whether it displays an intent to create not just

Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15 (1979).Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative. See,

e. g., Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083,1102 (1991); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 812, n. 9 (1986) (collecting cases). With-out it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not

point. We cannot help observing, however, how strange it is to say that
disparate-impact regulations are "inspired by, at the service of, and inseparably intertwined with" $ 601, post, at 307, when $ 601 permits the
very behavior that the regulations forbid. See Guardians, 463 U. S., at
613 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("If, as five Members of the
Court concluded in Bakke, the purpose of Title VI is to proscribe only
purposeful discrimination . . . , regulations that would proscribe conduct
by the recipient having only a discriminatory effect . . . do not simply
`further' the purpose of Title VI; they go well beyond that purpose").

e. g., Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 145,148 (1985);

Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis,

Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350,
365 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment).

Respondents would have us revert in this case to the
understanding of private causes of action that held sway
40 years ago when Title VI was enacted. That understanding is captured by the Court's statement in J. I. Case Co. v.
Borak, 377 U. S. 426, 433 (1964), that "it is the duty of the
courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary
to make effective the congressional purpose" expressed by a
statute. We abandoned that understanding in Cort v. Ash,
422 U. S. 66, 78 (1975)--which itself interpreted a statute
enacted under the ancien regime--and have not returned to
it since. Not even when interpreting the same Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that was at issue in Borak have we
applied Borak's method for discerning and defining causes
of action. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., supra, at 188; Musick, Peeler &
Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 291-293
(1993); Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, supra, at
1102-1103; Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, supra, at 576-
578. Having sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congress's intent, we will not accept respondents' invitation to
have one last drink.

Nor do we agree with the Government that our cases interpreting statutes enacted prior to Cort v. Ash have given
"dispositive weight" to the "expectations" that the enacting
Congress had formed "in light of the `contemporary legal

Opinion of the Court
context.' " Brief for United States 14. Only three of our
legion implied-right-of-action cases have found this sort of
"contemporary legal context" relevant, and two of those involved Congress's enactment (or reenactment) of the verbatim statutory text that courts had previously interpreted
to create a private right of action. See Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378-
379 (1982); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S., at
698-699. In the third case, this sort of "contemporary legal
context" simply buttressed a conclusion independently supported by the text of the statute. See Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U. S. 174 (1988). We have never accorded dispositive weight to context shorn of text. In determining
whether statutes create private rights of action, as in interpreting statutes generally, see Blatchford v. Native Village
of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 784 (1991), legal context matters
only to the extent it clarifies text.

We therefore begin (and find that we can end) our search
for Congress's intent with the text and structure of Title VI.7
Section 602 authorizes federal agencies "to effectuate the
provisions of [$ 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or
orders of general applicability." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1. It is
immediately clear that the "rights-creating" language so
critical to the Court's analysis in Cannon of $ 601, see
441 U. S., at 690, n. 13, is completely absent from $ 602.
Whereas $ 601 decrees that "[n]o person . . . shall . . . be
subjected to discrimination," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d, the text
of $ 602 provides that "[e]ach Federal department and

7 Although the dissent claims that we "adop[t] a methodology that blinds
itself to important evidence of congressional intent," see post, at 313, our
methodology is not novel, but well established in earlier decisions (including one authored by Justice Stevens, see Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.
Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 94, n. 31 (1981)), which explain that the
interpretive inquiry begins with the text and structure of the statute, see
id., at 91, and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide
a cause of action.

Opinion of the Court
agency . . . is authorized and directed to effectuate the provi-sions of [$ 601]," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1. Far from displaying

congressional intent to create new rights, $ 602 limits agen-cies to "effectuat[ing]" rights already created by $ 601. And
the focus of $ 602 is twice removed from the individuals whowill ultimately benefit from Title VI's protection. Statutes
that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create "no implication of an intent to conferrights on a particular class of persons."

California v. Sierra Club, 451 U. S. 287, 294 (1981). Section 602 is yet astep further removed: It focuses neither on the individuals

protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated,
but on the agencies that will do the regulating. Like the
statute found not to create a right of action in Universities
Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U. S. 754 (1981), $ 602 is
"phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the
distribution of public funds," id., at 772. When this is true,
"[t]here [is] far less reason to infer a private remedy in favor
of individual persons," Cannon v. University of Chicago,
supra, at 690-691. So far as we can tell, this authorizing
portion of $ 602 reveals no congressional intent to create a
private right of action.

Nor do the methods that $ 602 goes on to provide for
enforcing its authorized regulations manifest an intent to
create a private remedy; if anything, they suggest the
opposite. Section 602 empowers agencies to enforce their
regulations either by terminating funding to the "particular
program, or part thereof," that has violated the regulation
or "by any other means authorized by law," 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d-1. No enforcement action may be taken, however,
"until the department or agency concerned has advised the
appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with
the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot
be secured by voluntary means." Ibid. And every agency
enforcement action is subject to judicial review. $ 2000d-2.
If an agency attempts to terminate program funding, still

Opinion of the Court
more restrictions apply. The agency head must "file withthe committees of the House and Senate having legislative

jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a fullwritten report of the circumstances and the grounds for such
action." $ 2000d-1. And the termination of funding doesnot "become effective until thirty days have elapsed after
the filing of such report." Ibid. Whatever these elaborate
restrictions on agency enforcement may imply for the pri-vate enforcement of rights created

outside of $ 602, compare Cannon v. University of Chicago, supra, at 706, n. 41,712, n. 49;

Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S., at
419, n. 26 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part), with Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv.
Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S., at 609-610 (Powell, J.,
concurring in judgment); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,
supra, at 382-383 (opinion of White, J.), they tend to contradict a congressional intent to create privately enforceable
rights through $ 602 itself. The express provision of one
method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others. See, e. g., Karahalios v.
Federal Employees, 489 U. S. 527, 533 (1989); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 93-94 (1981);
Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S.,
at 19-20. Sometimes the suggestion is so strong that it
precludes a finding of congressional intent to create a private right of action, even though other aspects of the statute
(such as language making the would-be plaintiff "a member
of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted")
suggest the contrary. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
Russell, 473 U. S., at 145; see id., at 146-147. And as our
Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, cases show, some remedial schemes foreclose a private cause of action to enforce
even those statutes that admittedly create substantive private rights. See, e. g., Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 19-20
(1981). In the present case, the claim of exclusivity for the

532US1 Unit: $U43 [09-19-02 20:35:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

291Cite as: 532 U. S. 275 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
express remedial scheme does not even have to overcomesuch obstacles. The question whether $ 602's remedial

scheme can overbear other evidence of congressional intentis simply not presented, since we have found no evidence
anywhere in the text to suggest that Congress intended tocreate a private right to enforce regulations promulgated
under $ 602.

Both the Government and respondents argue that the regulations contain rights-creating language and so must be
privately enforceable, see Brief for United States 19-20;Brief for Respondents 31, but that argument skips an analytical step. Language in a regulation may invoke a private
right of action that Congress through statutory text created,
but it may not create a right that Congress has not. Touche
Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S., at 577, n. 18 ("[T]he language of the statute and not the rules must control"). Thus,
when a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of regulations, it may perhaps be correct
that the intent displayed in each regulation can determine
whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is most
certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can
conjure up a private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies may play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.

The last string to respondents' and the Government's bow
is their argument that two amendments to Title VI "ratified"
this Court's decisions finding an implied private right of
action to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. See
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, $ 1003, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d-7; Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, $ 6, 102 Stat.
31, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-4a. One problem with this argument
is that, as explained above, none of our decisions establishes
(or even assumes) the private right of action at issue here,
see supra, at 282-285, which is why in Guardians three Justices were able expressly to reserve the question. See 463
U. S., at 645, n. 18 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Incorporating

Opinion of the Court
our cases in the amendments would thus not help respondents. Another problem is that the incorporation claim itself
is flawed. Section 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, on which only respondents rely, by its terms
applies only to suits "for a violation of a statute," 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d-7(a)(2) (emphasis added). It therefore does not
speak to suits for violations of regulations that go beyond
the statutory proscription of $ 601. Section 6 of the Civil
Rights Restoration Act of 1987 is even less on point. That
provision amends Title VI to make the term "program or
activity" cover larger portions of the institutions receiving
federal financial aid than it had previously covered, see
Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555 (1984). It is impossible to understand what this has to do with implied causes
of action--which is why we declared in Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools, 503 U. S., at 73, that $ 6 did not "in
any way alte[r] the existing rights of action and the corresponding remedies permissible under . . . Title VI." Respondents point to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S., at 381-382, which inferred congressional intent to ratify lower court decisions regarding
a particular statutory provision when Congress comprehensively revised the statutory scheme but did not amend
that provision. But we recently criticized Curran's reliance
on congressional inaction, saying that "[a]s a general matter . . . [the] argumen[t] deserve[s] little weight in the interpretive process." Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S., at 187. And
when, as here, Congress has not comprehensively revised a
statutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments,
we have spoken more bluntly: "It is `impossible to assert
with any degree of assurance that congressional failure to
act represents' affirmative congressional approval of the
Court's statutory interpretation." Patterson v. McLean

v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616,671-672 (1987) (

Scalia, J., dissenting)).Neither as originally enacted nor as later amended does

Title VI display an intent to create a freestanding privateright of action to enforce regulations promulgated under

$ 602.8 We therefore hold that no such right of action exists.Since we reach this conclusion applying our standard test
for discerning private causes of action, we do not addresspetitioners' additional argument that implied causes of action
against States (and perhaps nonfederal state actors gener-ally) are inconsistent with the clear statement rule of Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1(1981). See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S.
629, 656-657, 684-685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In 1964, as part of a groundbreaking and comprehensivecivil rights Act, Congress prohibited recipients of federal

funds from discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, ornational origin. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78
Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000d to 2000d-7. Pursuant to pow8 The dissent complains that we "offe[r] little affirmative support" for
this conclusion. Post, at 315. But as Justice Stevens has previously
recognized in an opinion for the Court, "affirmative" evidence of congressional intent must be provided for an implied remedy, not against it, for
without such intent "the essential predicate for implication of a private
remedy simply does not exist," Northwest Airlines, Inc., 451 U. S., at 94.
The dissent's assertion that "respondents have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right of action exists to enforce Title VI
and the regulations validly promulgated thereunder," post, at 316, n. 26
(second emphasis added), once again begs the question whether authorization of a private right of action to enforce a statute constitutes authorization of a private right of action to enforce regulations that go beyond
what the statute itself requires.

ers expressly delegated by that Act, the federal agencies anddepartments responsible for awarding and administering

federal contracts immediately adopted regulations prohibit-ing federal contractees from adopting policies that have the
"effect" of discriminating on those bases. At the time of thepromulgation of these regulations, prevailing principles of
statutory construction assumed that Congress intended a
private right of action whenever such a cause of action wasnecessary to protect individual rights granted by valid federal law. Relying both on this presumption and on inde-pendent analysis of Title VI, this Court has repeatedly and
consistently affirmed the right of private individuals to bring
civil suits to enforce rights guaranteed by Title VI. A fair
reading of those cases, and coherent implementation of the
statutory scheme, requires the same result under Title VI's
implementing regulations.

In separate lawsuits spanning several decades, we have
endorsed an action identical in substance to the one brought
in this case, see Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974); demonstrated that Congress intended a private right of action to
protect the rights guaranteed by Title VI, see Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979); and concluded
that private individuals may seek declaratory and injunctive
relief against state officials for violations of regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI, see Guardians Assn. v. Civil
Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983). Giving fair import to our language and our holdings, every Court
of Appeals to address the question has concluded that a private right of action exists to enforce the rights guaranteed
both by the text of Title VI and by any regulations validly
promulgated pursuant to that Title, and Congress has
adopted several statutes that appear to ratify the status quo.

Today, in a decision unfounded in our precedent and hostile
to decades of settled expectations, a majority of this Court
carves out an important exception to the right of private
action long recognized under Title VI. In so doing, the

Court makes three distinct, albeit interrelated, errors.First, the Court provides a muddled account of both the reasoning and the breadth of our prior decisions endorsing aprivate right of action under Title VI, thereby obscuring the
conflict between those opinions and today's decision. Sec-ond, the Court offers a flawed and unconvincing analysis of
the relationship between $$ 601 and 602 of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, ignoring more plausible and persuasive explanations detailed in our prior opinions. Finally, the Courtbadly misconstrues the theoretical linchpin of our decision
in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979),mistaking that decision's careful contextual analysis for judicial fiat. I

The majority is undoubtedly correct that this Court hasnever said in so many words that a private right of action
exists to enforce the disparate-impact regulations promul-gated under $ 602. However, the failure of our cases to state
this conclusion explicitly does not absolve the Court of theresponsibility to canvass our prior opinions for guidance.
Reviewing these opinions with the care they deserve, I reachthe same conclusion as the Courts of Appeals: This Court
has already considered the question presented today andconcluded that a private right of action exists.

1 Just about every Court of Appeals has either explicitly or implicitly
held that a private right of action exists to enforce all of the regulations
issued pursuant to Title VI, including the disparate-impact regulations.
For decisions holding so most explicitly, see, e. g., Powell v. Ridge, 189 F. 3d

Stevens, J., dissenting
When this Court faced an identical case 27 years ago, allthe Justices believed that private parties could bring lawsuits under Title VI and its implementing regulations toenjoin the provision of governmental services in a manner

that discriminated against non-English speakers. See Lauv. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563 (1974). While five Justices saw
no need to go beyond the command of $ 601, Chief JusticeBurger, Justice Stewart, and Justice Blackmun relied specifically and exclusively on the regulations to support theprivate action, see

id., at 569 (Stewart, J., concurring in re-sult) (citing Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc.,

411 U. S. 356, 369 (1973); Thorpe v. Housing Authority ofDurham, 393 U. S. 268, 280-281 (1969)). There is nothing in
the majority's opinion in Lau, or in earlier opinions of theCourt, that is not fully consistent with the analysis of the
concurring Justices or that would have differentiated be-tween private actions to enforce the text of $ 601 and private
actions to enforce the regulations promulgated pursuant to$ 602. See

Guardians, 463 U. S., at 591 (principal opinion ofWhite, J.) (describing this history and noting that, up to that

point, no Justice had ever expressed disagreement with Jus-tice Stewart's analysis in Lau).

disagreement with the concurring analysis as the concurring Justices
grounded their argument in well-established principles for determining
the availability of remedies under regulations, principles that all but one

Five years later, we more explicitly considered whether aprivate right of action exists to enforce the guarantees of

Title VI and its gender-based twin, Title IX. See Cannonv. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979). In that case,
we examined the text of the statutes, analyzed the purposeof the laws, and canvassed the relevant legislative history.
Our conclusion was unequivocal: "We have no doubt thatCongress intended to create Title IX remedies comparable
to those available under Title VI and that it understood TitleVI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of the prohibited discrimination." Id., at 703.The majority acknowledges that

Cannon is binding prece-dent with regard to both Title VI and Title IX, ante, at

279-280, but seeks to limit the scope of its holding to casesinvolving allegations of intentional discrimination. The distinction the majority attempts to impose is wholly foreignto Cannon's text and reasoning. The opinion in Cannon
consistently treats the question presented in that case aswhether a private right of action exists to enforce "Title IX"
(and by extension "Title VI"),3 and does not draw any dis-tinctions between the various types of discrimination outlawed by the operation of those statutes. Though the opin-ion did not reach out to affirmatively preclude the drawing
of every conceivable distinction, it could hardly have beenmore clear as to the scope of its holding: A private right of
action exists for "victims of the prohibited discrimination."441 U. S., at 703 (emphasis added). Not some of the prohibited discrimination, but all of it.4

4 The majority is undoubtedly correct that Cannon was not a case about

the substance of Title IX but rather about the remedies available under
that statute. Therefore, Cannon cannot stand as a precedent for the
proposition either that Title IX and its implementing regulations reach
intentional discrimination or that they do not do so. What Cannon did
hold is that all the discrimination prohibited by the regulatory scheme

Moreover, Cannon was itself a disparate-impact case. Inthat case, the plaintiff brought suit against two private universities challenging medical school admissions policies thatset age limits for applicants. Plaintiff, a 39-year-old woman,
alleged that these rules had the effect of discriminatingagainst women because the incidence of interrupted higher
education is higher among women than among men. In pro-viding a shorthand description of her claim in the text of the
opinion, we ambiguously stated that she had alleged that shewas denied admission "because she is a woman," but we appended a lengthy footnote setting forth the details of her
disparate-impact claim. Other than the shorthand descrip-tion of her claim, there is not a word in the text of the opinion

even suggesting that she had made the improbable allegationthat the University of Chicago and Northwestern University
had intentionally discriminated against women. In the con-text of the entire opinion (including both its analysis and
its uncontested description of the facts of the case), thatsingle ambiguous phrase provides no basis for limiting the
case's holding to incidents of intentional discrimination.
If anything, the fact that the phrase "because she is awoman" encompasses both intentional and disparate-impact

claims should have made it clear that the reasoning in theopinion was equally applicable to both types of claims. In

contained in Title IX may be the subject of a private lawsuit. As the
Court today concedes that Cannon's holding applies to Title VI claims as
well as Title IX claims, ante, at 279-280, and assumes that the regulations
promulgated pursuant to $ 602 are validly promulgated antidiscrimination
measures, ante, at 281-282, it is clear that today's opinion is in substantial
tension with Cannon's reasoning and holding.

the various opinions in that case took different views as to
the spectrum of relief available to plaintiffs in Title VI cases,
a clear majority of the Court expressly stated that private
parties may seek injunctive relief against governmental
practices that have the effect of discriminating against racial
and ethnic minorities. Id., at 594-595, 607 (White, J.); id.,
at 634 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id., at 638 (Stevens, J.,
joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). As this
case involves just such an action, its result ought to follow
naturally from Guardians.

As I read today's opinion, the majority declines to accord
precedential value to Guardians because the five Justices
in the majority were arguably divided over the mechanism
through which private parties might seek such injunctive relief.5 This argument inspires two responses. First, to the
extent that the majority denies relief to the respondents
merely because they neglected to mention 42 U. S. C. $ 1983

5 None of the relevant opinions was absolutely clear as to whether it
envisioned such suits as being brought directly under the statute or under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983. However, a close reading of the opinions leaves little
doubt that all of the Justices making up the Guardians majority contemplated the availability of private actions brought directly under the statute. Justice White fairly explicitly rested his conclusion on Cannon's
holding that an implied right of action exists to enforce the terms of both
Title VI and Title IX. Guardians, 463 U. S., at 594-595. Given that fact
and the added consideration that his opinion appears to have equally contemplated suits against private and public parties, it is clear that he envisioned the availability of injunctive relief directly under the statute. Justice Marshall's opinion never mentions $ 1983 and refers simply to "Title
VI actions." Id., at 625. In addition, his opinion can only be read as
contemplating suits on equal terms against both public and private grantees, thus also suggesting that he assumed such suits could be brought
directly under the statute. That leaves my opinion. Like Justice White,
I made it quite clear that I believed the right to sue to enforce the
disparate-impact regulations followed directly from Cannon and, hence,
was built directly into the statute. 463 U. S., at 635-636, and n. 1. However, I did also note that, in the alternative, relief would be available in
that particular case under $ 1983.

in framing their Title VI claim, this case is something of asport. Litigants who in the future wish to enforce the Title

VI regulations against state actors in all likelihood must onlyreference $ 1983 to obtain relief; indeed, the plaintiffs in this
case (or other similarly situated individuals) presumably re-tain the option of rechallenging Alabama's English-only policy in a complaint that invokes $ 1983 even after today's
decision.More importantly, the majority's reading of

Guardians is
strained even in reference to the broader question whetherinjunctive relief is available to remedy violations of the Title

VI regulations by nongovernmental grantees. As Guardians involved an action against a governmental entity, making $ 1983 relief available, the Court might have discussedthe availability of judicial relief without addressing the scope

of the implied private right of action available directly underTitle VI. See 463 U. S., at 638 (

Stevens, J.) ("Even if it
were not settled by now that Title VI authorizes appropriaterelief, both prospective and retroactive, to victims of racial

discrimination at the hands of recipients of federal funds, the
same result would follow in this case because the petitionershave sought relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983" (emphasis deleted)). However, the analysis in each of the relevant opin-ions did not do so.

6 Rather than focusing on considerations

6 The Court today cites one sentence in my final footnote in Guardians
that it suggests is to the contrary. Ante, at 283 (citing 463 U. S., at 645,
n. 18). However, the Court misreads that sentence. In his opinion in
Guardians, Justice Powell had stated that he would affirm the judgment
for the reasons stated in his dissent in Cannon, see 463 U. S., at 609-610
(opinion concurring in judgment), and that he would also hold that private
actions asserting violations of Title VI could not be brought under $ 1983,
id., at 610, and n. 3. One reason that he advanced in support of these
conclusions was his view that the standard of proof in a $ 1983 action
against public officials would differ from the standard in an action against
private defendants. Id., at 608, n. 1. In a footnote at the end of my
opinion, id., at 645, n. 18, I responded (perhaps inartfully) to Justice

Stevens, J., dissenting
specific to $ 1983, each of these opinions looked instead to our
opinion in Cannon, to the intent of the Congress that
adopted Title VI and the contemporaneous executive decisionmakers who crafted the disparate-impact regulations,
and to general principles of remediation.7

In summary, there is clear precedent of this Court for the
proposition that the plaintiffs in this case can seek injunctive
relief either through an implied right of action or through

$ 1983. Though the holding in Guardians does not compel
the conclusion that a private right of action exists to enforce
the Title VI regulations against private parties, the rationales of the relevant opinions strongly imply that result.
When that fact is coupled with our holding in Cannon and
our unanimous decision in Lau, the answer to the question
presented in this case is overdetermined.8 Even absent my

Powell. I noted that the fact that $ 1983 authorizes a lawsuit against the
police department based on its violation of the governing administrative
regulations did not mean, as Justice Powell had suggested, "that a similar
action would be unavailable against a similarly situated private party."
Ibid. I added the sentence that the Court quotes today, ante, at 283, not
to reserve a question, but rather to explain that the record did not support
Justice Powell's hypothesis regarding the standard of proof. I thought
then, as I do now, that a violation of regulations adopted pursuant to Title
VI may be established by proof of discriminatory impact in a $ 1983 action
against state actors and also in an implied action against private parties.
See n. 5, supra. Contrary to the Court's partial quotation of my opinion,
see ante, at 283-284, n. 3, what I wrote amply reflected what I thought.
See 463 U. S., at 635 ("a private action against recipients of federal funds");
id., at 636 ("implied caus[e] of action"); id., at 638 ("Title VI authorizes
appropriate relief ").

Justice Powell was quite correct in noting that it would be anomalous
to assume that Congress would have intended to make it easier to recover
from public officials than from private parties. That anomaly, however,
does not seem to trouble the majority today.

continued belief that Congress intended a private right ofaction to enforce both Title VI and its implementing regulations, I would answer the question presented in the affirma-tive and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as a
matter of stare decisis.9

9 The settled expectations the Court undercuts today derive not only
from judicial decisions, but also from the consistent statements and actions
of Congress. Congress' actions over the last two decades reflect a clear
understanding of the existence of a private right of action to enforce Title
VI and its implementing regulations. In addition to numerous other
small-scale amendments, Congress has twice adopted legislation expanding the reach of Title VI. See Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, $ 6,
102 Stat. 31 (codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-4a) (expanding definition of
"program"); Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, $ 1003, 100 Stat. 1845
(codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7) (explicitly abrogating States' Eleventh
Amendment immunity in suits under Title VI).

Both of these bills were adopted after this Court's decisions in Lau,
Cannon, and Guardians, and after most of the Courts of Appeals had
affirmatively acknowledged an implied private right of action to enforce
the disparate-impact regulations. Their legislative histories explicitly reflect the fact that both proponents and opponents of the bills assumed
that the full breadth of Title VI (including the disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to it) would be enforceable in private actions.
See, e. g., Civil Rights Act of 1984: Hearings on S. 2658 before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
98th Cong., 2d Sess., 530 (1984) (memo from the Office of Management and
Budget objecting to the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 because it
would bring more entities within the scope of Title VI, thereby subjecting
them to "private lawsuits" to enforce the disparate-impact regulations);
id., at 532 (same memo warning of a proliferation of "discriminatory effects" suits by "members of the bar" acting as "private Attorneys General"); 134 Cong. Rec. 4257 (1988) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (arguing that
the disparate-impact regulations go too far and noting that that is a particular problem because, "[o]f course, advocacy groups will be able to bring
private lawsuits making the same allegations before federal judges"); see
also Brief for United States 24, n. 16 (collecting testimony of academics
advising Congress that private lawsuits were available to enforce the
disparate-impact regulations under existing precedent).

Thus, this case goes well beyond the normal situation in which, "after a
comprehensive reeaxmination and significant amendment," Congress "left
intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied

Underlying the majority's dismissive treatment of ourprior cases is a flawed understanding of the structure of Title

VI and, more particularly, of the relationship between $$ 601and 602. To some extent, confusion as to the relationship
between the provisions is understandable, as Title VI is adeceptively simple statute. Section 601 of the Act lays out
its straightforward commitment: "No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,

or be subjected to discrimination under any program or ac-tivity receiving Federal financial assistance." 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d. Section 602 "authorize[s] and direct[s]" all federal
departments and agencies empowered to extend federal fi-nancial assistance to issue "rules, regulations, or orders of

general applicability" in order to "effectuate" $ 601's antidis-crimination mandate. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1.

10

On the surface, the relationship between $$ 601 and 602 isunproblematic--$ 601 states a basic principle, $ 602 authorizes agencies to develop detailed plans for defining the con-tours of the principle and ensuring its enforcement. In the
context of federal civil rights law, however, nothing is everso simple. As actions to enforce $ 601's antidiscrimination
principle have worked their way through the courts, we have
developed a body of law giving content to $ 601's broadlyworded commitment.

E. g., United States v. Fordice, 505
U. S. 717, 732, n. 7 (1992); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv.

a private cause of action." Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 381-382 (1982). Here, there is no need to rest
on presumptions of knowledge and ratification, because the direct evidence
of Congress' understanding is plentiful.

10 The remainder of Title VI provides for judicial and administrative

review of agency actions taken pursuant to the statute, 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d-2; imposes certain limitations not at issue in this case, $$ 2000d-3
to 2000d-4; and defines some of the terms found in the other provisions of
the statute, $ 2000d-4a.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Comm'n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983); Regents of
Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978). As the majority
emphasizes today, the Judiciary's understanding of what conduct may be remedied in actions brought directly under $ 601
is, in certain ways, more circumscribed than the conduct prohibited by the regulations. See, e. g., ante, at 280-281.

Given that seeming peculiarity, it is necessary to examine
closely the relationship between $$ 601 and 602, in order to
understand the purpose and import of the regulations at
issue in this case. For the most part, however, the majority
ignores this task, assuming that the judicial decisions interpreting $ 601 provide an authoritative interpretation of its
true meaning and treating the regulations promulgated by
the agencies charged with administering the statute as poor
stepcousins--either parroting the text of $ 601 (in the case
of regulations that prohibit intentional discrimination) or
forwarding an agenda untethered to $ 601's mandate (in the
case of disparate-impact regulations).

The majority's statutory analysis does violence to both the
text and the structure of Title VI. Section 601 does not
stand in isolation, but rather as part of an integrated remedial scheme. Section 602 exists for the sole purpose of
forwarding the antidiscrimination ideals laid out in $ 601.11
The majority's persistent belief that the two sections somehow forward different agendas finds no support in the statute. Nor does Title VI anywhere suggest, let alone state,
that for the purpose of determining their legal effect, the
"rules, regulations, [and] orders of general applicability"
adopted by the agencies are to be bifurcated by the Judiciary
into two categories based on how closely the courts believe
the regulations track the text of $ 601.

11 See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1 ($ 602) ("Each Federal department and
agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance . . . is
authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of [$ 601] . . . by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability").

Stevens, J., dissenting
What makes the Court's analysis even more troubling isthat our cases have already adopted a simpler and more sensible model for understanding the relationship between thetwo sections. For three decades, we have treated $ 602 as
granting the responsible agencies the power to issue broadprophylactic rules aimed at realizing the vision laid out in

$ 601, even if the conduct captured by these rules is at times
broader than that which would otherwise be prohibited.In

Lau, our first Title VI case, the only three Justices
whose understanding of $ 601 required them to reach thequestion explicitly endorsed the power of the agencies to

adopt broad prophylactic rules to enforce the aims of the
statute. As Justice Stewart explained, regulations promulgated pursuant to $ 602 may "go beyond . . . $ 601" as long as
they are "reasonably related" to its antidiscrimination mandate. 414 U. S., at 571 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J.,
and Blackmun, J., concurring in result). In Guardians, at
least three Members of the Court adopted a similar understanding of the statute. See 463 U. S., at 643 (Stevens, J.,
joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting). Finally,
just 16 years ago, our unanimous opinion in Alexander v.
Choate, 469 U. S. 287 (1985), treated this understanding of
Title VI's structure as settled law. Writing for the Court,
Justice Marshall aptly explained the interpretation of $ 602's
grant of regulatory power that necessarily underlies our
prior case law: "In essence, then, we [have] held that Title
VI [has] delegated to the agencies in the first instance the
complex determination of what sorts of disparate impacts
upon minorities constituted sufficiently significant social
problems, and [are] readily enough remediable, to warrant
altering the practices of the federal grantees that [have]
produced those impacts." Id., at 293-294.

This understanding is firmly rooted in the text of Title
VI. As $ 602 explicitly states, the agencies are authorized
to adopt regulations to "effectuate" $ 601's antidiscrimination
mandate. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1. The plain meaning of the

306 ALEXANDER v. SANDOVAL

Stevens, J., dissenting
text reveals Congress' intent to provide the relevant agencies with sufficient authority to transform the statute's broad
aspiration into social reality. So too does a lengthy, consistent, and impassioned legislative history.12

This legislative design reflects a reasonable--indeed inspired--model for attacking the often-intractable problem of
racial and ethnic discrimination. On its own terms, the statute supports an action challenging policies of federal grantees that explicitly or unambiguously violate antidiscrimination norms (such as policies that on their face limit benefits
or services to certain races). With regard to more subtle
forms of discrimination (such as schemes that limit benefits
or services on ostensibly race-neutral grounds but have the
predictable and perhaps intended consequence of materially
benefiting some races at the expense of others), the statute
does not establish a static approach but instead empowers
the relevant agencies to evaluate social circumstances to determine whether there is a need for stronger measures.13

12 See, e. g., 110 Cong. Rec. 6543 (1964) (statement of Sen. Humphrey)
("Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers of
all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination"); id., at 1520
(statement of Rep. Celler) (describing $ 602 as requiring federal agencies
to "reexamine" their programs "to make sure that adequate action has
been taken to preclude . . . discrimination").

13 It is important, in this context, to note that regulations prohibiting

policies that have a disparate impact are not necessarily aimed only--
or even primarily--at unintentional discrimination. Many policies whose
very intent is to discriminate are framed in a race-neutral manner. It
is often difficult to obtain direct evidence of this motivating animus.
Therefore, an agency decision to adopt disparate-impact regulations may
very well reflect a determination by that agency that substantial intentional discrimination pervades the industry it is charged with regulating
but that such discrimination is difficult to prove directly. As I have
stated before: "Frequently the most probative evidence of intent will be
objective evidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the actor." Washington v. Davis,
426 U. S. 229, 253 (1976) (concurring opinion). On this reading, Title VI

Stevens, J., dissenting
Such an approach builds into the law flexibility, an ability tomake nuanced assessments of complex social realities, and

an admirable willingness to credit the possibility of progress.The "effects" regulations at issue in this case represent
the considered judgment of the relevant agencies that dis-crimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin
by federal contractees are significant social problems that
might be remedied, or at least ameliorated, by the applica-tion of a broad prophylactic rule. Given the judgment underlying them, the regulations are inspired by, at the serviceof, and inseparably intertwined with $ 601's antidiscrimination mandate. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, they"appl[y]" $ 601's prohibition on discrimination just as surely
as the intentional discrimination regulations the majorityconcedes are privately enforceable.

Ante, at 284.
To the extent that our prior cases mischaracterize the rela-tionship between $$ 601 and 602, they err on the side of underestimating, not overestimating, the connection between
the two provisions. While our cases have explicitly adopted
an understanding of $ 601's scope that is somewhat narrower
than the reach of the regulations,14 they have done so in an
unorthodox and somewhat haphazard fashion.

Our conclusion that the legislation only encompasses intentional discrimination was never the subject of thorough consideration by a Court focused on that question. In Bakke,
five Members of this Court concluded that $ 601 only prohibits race-based affirmative-action programs in situations
where the Equal Protection Clause would impose a similar
ban. 438 U. S., at 287 (principal opinion of Powell, J.); id., at

simply accords the agencies the power to decide whether or not to credit
such evidence.

14 See, e. g., Alexander v. Choate, 469 U. S. 287, 293 (1985) (stating, in

dicta, "Title VI itself directly reach[es] only instances of intentional discrimination"); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City,
463 U. S. 582 (1983) (in separate opinions, seven Justices indicate that $ 601
on its face bars only intentional discrimination).

Stevens, J., dissenting
325, 328, 352 (Brennan, J., joined by White, Marshall, andBlackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting

in part).15 In Guardians, the majority of the Court heldthat the analysis of those five Justices in Bakke compelled as
a matter of stare decisis the conclusion that $ 601 does noton its own terms reach disparate-impact cases. 463 U. S.,
at 610-611 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 612(O'C

onnor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 642 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).However, the opinions adopting that conclusion did not engage in any independent analysis of the reach of $ 601. In-deed, the only writing on this subject came from two of the
five Members of the Bakke "majority," each of whom wroteseparately to reject the remaining Justices' understanding of
their opinions in Bakke and to insist that $ 601 does in factreach some instances of unintentional discrimination. 463
U. S., at 589-590 (White, J.); id., at 623-624 (Marshall, J., dis-senting).

16 The Court's occasional rote invocation of this

Guardians majority in later cases ought not obscure the factthat the question whether $ 601 applies to disparate-impact

claims has never been analyzed by this Court on the merits.17

15 Of course, those five Justices divided over the application of the Equal
Protection Clause--and by extension Title VI--to affirmative action cases.
Therefore, it is somewhat strange to treat the opinions of those five Justices in Bakke as constituting a majority for any particular substantive
interpretation of Title VI.

16 The fact that Justices Marshall and White both felt that the opinion

they coauthored in Bakke did not resolve the question whether Title VI
on its face reaches disparate-impact claims belies the majority's assertion
that Bakke "had drawn precisely that distinction," ante, at 283, n. 2, much
less its implication that it would have been "absurd" to think otherwise,
ibid.

17 In this context, it is worth noting that in a variety of other settings

the Court has interpreted similarly ambiguous civil rights provisions to
prohibit some policies based on their disparate impact on a protected
group. See, e. g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 432 (1971) (Title
VII); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 172-173 (1980) ($ 5

Stevens, J., dissenting
In addition, these Title VI cases seemingly ignore thewell-established principle of administrative law that is now

most often described as the "Chevron doctrine." See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837 (1984). In most other contexts, when the agen-cies charged with administering a broadly worded statute

offer regulations interpreting that statute or giving concrete guidance as to its implementation, we treat their inter-pretation of the statute's breadth as controlling unless it presents an unreasonable construction of the statutory text.See

ibid. While there may be some dispute as to the boundaries of Chevron deference, see, e. g., Christensen v. Harris
County, 529 U. S. 576 (2000), it is paradigmatically appropriate when Congress has clearly delegated agencies thepower to issue regulations with the force of law and established formal procedures for the promulgation of suchregulations.

18

If we were writing on a blank slate, we might very well
conclude that Chevron and similar cases decided both before
and after Guardians provide the proper framework for
understanding the structure of Title VI. Under such a reading there would be no incongruity between $$ 601 and 602.
Instead, we would read $ 602 as granting the federal agencies responsible for distributing federal funds the authority

(explaining why the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was modeled after

$ 601, might be considered to reach some instances of disparate impact and
then assuming that it does for purposes of deciding the case).

18 In relying on the Chevron doctrine, I do not mean to suggest that

our decision in Chevron stated a new rule that requires the wholesale
reconsideration of our statutory interpretation precedents. Instead,
I continue to adhere to my position in Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U. S. 83,
103-104, n. 6 (1990) (stating that Chevron merely summarized "wellsettled principles"). In suggesting that, with regard to Title VI, we
might reconsider whether our prior decisions gave sufficient deference to
the agencies' interpretation of the statute, I do no more than question
whether in this particular instance we paid sufficient consideration to
those "well-settled principles."

to issue regulations interpreting $ 601 on the assumptionthat their construction will--if reasonable--be incorporated

into our understanding of $ 601's meaning.19To resolve this case, however, it is unnecessary to answer
the question whether our cases interpreting the reach of$ 601 should be reinterpreted in light of Chevron. If one
understands the relationship between $$ 601 and 602 throughthe prism of

either Chevron or our prior Title VI cases, thequestion presented all but answers itself. If the regulations

promulgated pursuant to $ 602 are either an authoritativeconstruction of $ 601's meaning or prophylactic rules necessary to actualize the goals enunciated in $ 601, then it makesno sense to differentiate between private actions to enforce

$ 601 and private actions to enforce $ 602. There is but oneprivate action to enforce Title VI, and we already know that
such an action exists.20 See Cannon, 441 U. S., at 703.

19 The legislative history strongly indicates that the Congress that
adopted Title VI and the administration that proposed the statute intended that the agencies and departments would utilize the authority
granted under $ 602 to shape the substantive contours of $ 601. For example, during the hearings that preceded the passage of the statute, Attorney General Kennedy agreed that the administrators of the various agencies would have the power to define "what constitutes discrimination"
under Title VI and "what acts or omissions are to be forbidden." Civil
Rights--The President's Program, 1963: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 399-400 (1963); see also Civil
Rights: Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 88th
Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 4, p. 2740 (1963) (remarks of Attorney General Kennedy) (only after the agencies "establish the rules" will recipients "understand what they can and cannot do"). It was, in fact, concern for this
broad delegation that inspired Congress to amend the pending bill to ensure that all regulations issued pursuant to Title VI would have to be
approved by the President. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1 (laying out the requirement); 110 Cong. Rec. 2499 (1964) (remarks of Rep. Lindsay introducing the amendment). For further discussion of this legislative history, see

The majority couples its flawed analysis of the structureof Title VI with an uncharitable understanding of the substance of the divide between those on this Court who arereluctant to interpret statutes to allow for private rights of
action and those who are willing to do so if the claim of rightsurvives a rigorous application of the criteria set forth in
Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975). As the majority narratesour implied right of action jurisprudence,

ante, at 286-287,the Court's shift to a more skeptical approach represents the

rejection of a common-law judicial activism in favor of a prin-cipled recognition of the limited role of a contemporary "federal tribuna[l]." Ante, at 287. According to its analysis,the recognition of an implied right of action when the text
and structure of the statute do not absolutely compel such aconclusion is an act of judicial self-indulgence. As much as
we would like to help those disadvantaged by discrimination,we must resist the temptation to pour ourselves "one last
drink." Ibid. To do otherwise would be to "ventur[e] be-yond Congress's intent."

Ibid.Overwrought imagery aside, it is the majority's approach

that blinds itself to congressional intent. While it remainstrue that, if Congress intends a private right of action to
support statutory rights, "the far better course is for it tospecify as much when it creates those rights,"

of action to enforce the regulations validly promulgated pursuant to the
statute. Ante, at 283, n. 2, 293, n. 8. As the above analysis demonstrates, I do no such thing. On the contrary, I demonstrate that the
disparate-impact regulations promulgated pursuant to $ 602 are--and have
always been considered to be--an important part of an integrated remedial scheme intended to promote the statute's antidiscrimination goals.
Given that fact, there is simply no logical or legal justification for differentiating between actions to enforce the regulations and actions to enforce
the statutory text. Furthermore, as my integrated approach reflects the
longstanding practice of this Court, see n. 2, supra, it is the majority's
largely unexplained assumption that a private right of action to enforce
the disparate-impact regulations must be independently established that
"begs the question."

U. S., at 717, its failure to do so does not absolve us of the
responsibility to endeavor to discern its intent. In a series
of cases since Cort v. Ash, we have laid out rules and developed strategies for this task.

The very existence of these rules and strategies assumes
that we will sometimes find manifestations of an implicit intent to create such a right. Our decision in Cannon represents one such occasion. As the Cannon opinion iterated
and reiterated, the question whether the plaintiff had a right
of action that could be asserted in federal court was a "question of statutory construction," 441 U. S., at 688; see also id.,
at 717 (Rehnquist, J., concurring), not a question of policy
for the Court to decide. Applying the Cort v. Ash factors,
we examined the nature of the rights at issue, the text and
structure of the statute, and the relevant legislative history.21 Our conclusion was that Congress unmistakably intended a private right of action to enforce both Title IX and
Title VI. Our reasoning--and, as I have demonstrated, our
holding--was equally applicable to intentional discrimination
and disparate-impact claims.22

Underlying today's opinion is the conviction that Cannon
must be cabined because it exemplifies an "expansive rights21 The text of the statute contained "an unmistakable focus on the benefited class," 441 U. S., at 691; its legislative history "rather plainly indicates
that Congress intended to create such a remedy," id., at 694; the legislators' repeated references to private enforcement of Title VI reflected
"their intent with respect to Title IX," id., at 696-698; and the absence of
legislative action to change the prevailing view with respect to Title VI
left us with "no doubt that Congress intended to create Title IX remedies
comparable to those available under Title VI and that it understood Title
VI as authorizing an implied private cause of action for victims of prohibited discrimination," id., at 703.

22 We should not overlook the fact that Cannon was decided after the

Bakke majority had concluded that the coverage of Title VI was coextensive with the coverage of the Equal Protection Clause.

creating approach." Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 77 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment). But, as I have taken pains to explain, it was
Congress, not the Court, that created the cause of action, and
it was the Congress that later ratified the Cannon holding in
1986 and again in 1988. See 503 U. S., at 72-73.

In order to impose its own preferences as to the availability of judicial remedies, the Court today adopts a methodology that blinds itself to important evidence of congressional
intent. It is one thing for the Court to ignore the import of
our holding in Cannon, as the breadth of that precedent is a
matter upon which reasonable jurists may differ. It is entirely another thing for the majority to ignore the reasoning
of that opinion and the evidence contained therein, as those
arguments and that evidence speak directly to the question
at issue today. As I stated above, see n. 21, supra, Cannon
carefully explained that both Title VI and Title IX were intended to benefit a particular class of individuals, that the
purposes of the statutes would be furthered rather than frustrated by the implication of a private right of action, and
that the legislative histories of the statutes support the conclusion that Congress intended such a right. See also Part
IV, infra. Those conclusions and the evidence supporting
them continue to have force today.

Similarly, if the majority is genuinely committed to deciphering congressional intent, its unwillingness to even consider evidence as to the context in which Congress legislated
is perplexing. Congress does not legislate in a vacuum. As
the respondents and the Government suggest, and as we
have held several times, the objective manifestations of congressional intent to create a private right of action must be
measured in light of the enacting Congress' expectations as
to how the judiciary might evaluate the question. See
Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U. S. 174 (1988); Merrill Lynch,

23

At the time Congress was considering Title VI, it was nor-mal practice for the courts to infer that Congress intended a

private right of action whenever it passed a statute designedto protect a particular class that did not contain enforcement
mechanisms which would be thwarted by a private remedy.See

Merrill Lynch, 456 U. S., at 374-375 (discussing this his-tory). Indeed, the very year Congress adopted Title VI,

this Court specifically stated that "it is the duty of the courtsto be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to
make effective the congressional purpose." J. I. Case Co. v.Borak, 377 U. S. 426, 433 (1964). Assuming, as we must,
that Congress was fully informed as to the state of the law,the contemporary context presents important evidence as to
Congress' intent--evidence the majority declines to consider.Ultimately, respect for Congress' prerogatives is measured
in deeds, not words. Today, the Court coins a new rule,holding that a private cause of action to enforce a statute
does not encompass a substantive regulation issued to effec-tuate that statute unless the regulation does nothing more
than "authoritatively construe the statute itself." Ante, at284.

24 This rule might be proper if we were the kind of

23 Like any other type of evidence, contextual evidence may be trumped
by other more persuasive evidence. Thus, the fact that, when evaluating
older statutes, we have at times reached the conclusion that Congress did
not imply a private right of action does not have the significance the majority suggests. Ante, at 287-288.

24 Only one of this Court's myriad private right of action cases even hints

at such a rule. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate
Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). Even that decision,
however, does not fully support the majority's position for two important
reasons. First, it is not at all clear that the majority opinion in that case
simply held that the regulation in question could not be enforced by private action; the opinion also permits the reading, assumed by the dissent,
that the majority was in effect invalidating the regulation in question.

"common-law court" the majority decries, ante, at 287, in-venting private rights of action never intended by Congress.

For if we are not construing a statute, we certainly may re-fuse to create a remedy for violations of federal regulations.
But if we are faithful to the commitment to discerning con-gressional intent that all Members of this Court profess, the
distinction is untenable. There is simply no reason to as-sume that Congress contemplated, desired, or adopted a distinction between regulations that merely parrot statutorytext and broader regulations that are authorized by statutory text.25 IV

Beyond its flawed structural analysis of Title VI and anevident antipathy toward implied rights of action, the majority offers little affirmative support for its conclusion thatCongress did not intend to create a private remedy for violations of the Title VI regulations.26 The Court offers essenabettors in civil enforcement actions under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5"). Second, that case involved a right of action that the Court has forthrightly
acknowledged was judicially created in exactly the way the majority now
condemns. See, e. g., Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S.
723, 737 (1975) (describing private actions under Rule 10b-5 as "a judicial
oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn"). As the
action in question was in effect a common-law right, the Court was more
within its rights to limit that remedy than it would be in a case, such as
this one, where we have held that Congress clearly intended such a right.

25 See Guardians, 463 U. S., at 636 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("It is one

thing to conclude, as the Court did in Cannon, that the 1964 Congress,
legislating when implied causes of action were the rule rather than the
exception, reasonably assumed that the intended beneficiaries of Title VI
would be able to vindicate their rights in court. It is quite another thing
to believe that the 1964 Congress substantially qualified that assumption
but thought it unnecessary to tell the Judiciary about the qualification").

26 The majority suggests that its failure to offer such support is irrelevant, because the burden is on the party seeking to establish the existence
of an implied right of action. Ante, at 293, n. 8. That response confuses
apples and oranges. Undoubtedly, anyone seeking to bring a lawsuit has
the burden of establishing that private individuals have the right to bring

Stevens, J., dissenting
tially two reasons for its position. First, it attaches signifi-cance to the fact that the "rights-creating" language in $ 601

that defines the classes protected by the statute is not re-peated in $ 602. Ante, at 288-289. But, of course, there
was no reason to put that language in $ 602 because it isperfectly obvious that the regulations authorized by $ 602
must be designed to protect precisely the same people pro-tected by $ 601. Moreover, it is self-evident that, linguistic
niceties notwithstanding, any statutory provision whosestated purpose is to "effectuate" the eradication of racial and
ethnic discrimination has as its "focus" those individuals who,absent such legislation, would be subject to discrimination.

Second, the Court repeats the argument advanced and re-jected in

Cannon that the express provision of a fund cutoffremedy "suggests that Congress intended to preclude others." Ante, at 290. In Cannon, 441 U. S., at 704-708, wecarefully explained why the presence of an explicit mechanism to achieve one of the statute's objectives (ensuring thatfederal funds are not used "to support discriminatory practices") does not preclude a conclusion that a private right ofaction was intended to achieve the statute's other principal
objective ("to provide individual citizens effective protectionagainst those practices"). In support of our analysis, we offered policy arguments, cited evidence from the legislativehistory, and noted the active support of the relevant agencies. Ibid. In today's decision, the Court does not grapple
such a suit. However, once the courts have examined the statutory
scheme under which the individual seeks to bring a suit and determined
that a private right of action does exist, judges who seek to impose heretofore unrecognized limits on that right have a responsibility to offer reasoned arguments drawn from the text, structure, or history of that statute
in order to justify such limitations. Moreover, in this case, the respondents have marshaled substantial affirmative evidence that a private right
of action exists to enforce Title VI and the regulations validly promulgated
thereunder. See supra, at 313. It strikes me that it aids rather than
hinders their case that this evidence is already summarized in an opinion
of this Court. See Cannon, 441 U. S., at 691-703.

with--indeed, barely acknowledges--our rejection of this ar-gument in Cannon.

Like much else in its opinion, the present majority's un-willingness to explain its refusal to find the reasoning in
Cannon persuasive suggests that today's decision is the un-conscious product of the majority's profound distaste for implied causes of action rather than an attempt to discern theintent of the Congress that enacted Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. Its colorful disclaimer of any interestin "venturing beyond Congress's intent,"

ante, at 287, has ahollow ring.

V
The question the Court answers today was only an openquestion in the most technical sense. Given the prevailing

consensus in the Courts of Appeals, the Court should havedeclined to take this case. Having granted certiorari, the
Court should have answered the question differently by sim-ply according respect to our prior decisions. But most importantly, even if it were to ignore all of our post-1964 writ-ing, the Court should have answered the question differently
on the merits.I respectfully dissent.

ATWATER et al. v. CITY OF LAGO VISTA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 99-1408. Argued December 4, 2000--Decided April 24, 2001
Texas law makes it a misdemeanor, punishable only by a fine, either for a

front-seat passenger in a car equipped with safety belts not to wear one
or for the driver to fail to secure any small child riding in front. The
warrantless arrest of anyone violating these provisions is expressly authorized by statute, but the police may issue citations in lieu of arrest.
Petitioner Atwater drove her truck in Lago Vista, Texas, with her small
children in the front seat. None of them was wearing a seatbelt. Respondent Turek, then a Lago Vista policeman, observed the seatbelt
violations, pulled Atwater over, verbally berated her, handcuffed her,
placed her in his squad car, and drove her to the local police station,
where she was made to remove her shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and
empty her pockets. Officers took her "mug shot" and placed her, alone,
in a jail cell for about an hour, after which she was taken before a
magistrate and released on bond. She was charged with, among other
things, violating the seatbelt law. She pleaded no contest to the seatbelt misdemeanors and paid a $50 fine. She and her husband (collectively Atwater) filed suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging, inter alia,
that the actions of respondents (collectively City) had violated her
Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure. Given
her admission that she had violated the law and the absence of any
allegation that she was harmed or detained in any way inconsistent with
the law, the District Court ruled the Fourth Amendment claim meritless
and granted the City summary judgment. Sitting en banc, the Fifth
Circuit affirmed. Relying on Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806,
817-818, the court observed that, although the Fourth Amendment generally requires a balancing of individual and governmental interests, the
result is rarely in doubt where an arrest is based on probable cause.
Because no one disputed that Turek had probable cause to arrest Atwater, and there was no evidence the arrest was conducted in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to Atwater's privacy interests,
the court held the arrest not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment
purposes.

Held: The Fourth Amendment does not forbid a warrantless arrest for a

minor criminal offense, such as a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine. Pp. 326-355.

Syllabus
(a) In reading the Fourth Amendment, the Court is guided by the
traditional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by the common law at the time of the framing. E. g., Wilson
v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 931. Atwater contends that founding-era
common-law rules forbade officers to make warrantless misdemeanor
arrests except in cases of "breach of the peace," a category she claims
was then understood narrowly as covering only those nonfelony offenses
involving or tending toward violence. Although this argument is not
insubstantial, it ultimately fails. Pp. 326-345.

(1) Even after making some allowance for variations in the prefounding English common-law usage of "breach of the peace," the
founding-era common-law rules were not nearly as clear as Atwater
claims. Pp. 327-335.

(i) A review of the relevant English decisions, as well as English
and colonial American legal treatises, legal dictionaries, and procedure
manuals, demonstrates disagreement, not unanimity, with respect to officers' warrantless misdemeanor arrest power. On one side, eminent
authorities support Atwater's position that the common law confined
warrantless misdemeanor arrests to actual breaches of the peace. See,
e. g., Queen v. Tooley, 2 Ld. Raym. 1296, 1301, 92 Eng. Rep. 349,
352. However, there is also considerable evidence of a broader conception of common-law misdemeanor arrest authority unlimited by
any breach-of-the-peace condition. See, e. g., Holyday v. Oxenbridge,
Cro. Car. 234, 79 Eng. Rep. 805, 805-806; 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown
88. Thus, the Court is not convinced that Atwater's is the correct,
or even necessarily the better, reading of the common-law history.
Pp. 328-332.

(ii) A second, and equally serious, problem for Atwater's historical argument is posed by various statutes enacted by Parliament well
before this Republic's founding that authorized peace officers (and even
private persons) to make warrantless arrests for all sorts of relatively
minor offenses unaccompanied by violence, including, among others,
nightwalking, unlawful game playing, profane cursing, and negligent
carriage driving. Pp. 333-335.

(2) An examination of specifically American evidence is to the same
effect. Neither the history of the framing era nor subsequent legal development indicates that the Fourth Amendment was originally understood, or has traditionally been read, to embrace Atwater's position.
Pp. 336-345.

(i) Atwater has cited no particular evidence that those who
framed and ratified the Fourth Amendment sought to limit peace officers' warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority to instances of actual
breach of the peace, and the Court's review of framing-era documentary

Syllabus
history has likewise failed to reveal any such design. Nor is there in
any of the modern historical accounts of the Fourth Amendment's adoption any substantial indication that the Framers intended such a restriction. Indeed, to the extent the modern histories address the issue,
their conclusions are to the contrary. The evidence of actual practice
also counsels against Atwater's position. During the period leading up
to and surrounding the framing of the Bill of Rights, colonial and state
legislatures, like Parliament before them, regularly authorized local officers to make warrantless misdemeanor arrests without a breach of the
peace condition. That the Fourth Amendment did not originally apply
to the States does not make state practice irrelevant in unearthing

the Amendment's original meaning. A number of state constitutional
search-and-seizure provisions served as models for the Fourth Amendment, and the fact that many of the original States with such constitutional limitations continued to grant their officers broad warrantless
misdemeanor arrest authority undermines Atwater's position. Given
the early state practice, it is likewise troublesome for Atwater's view
that one year after the Fourth Amendment's ratification, Congress gave
federal marshals the same powers to execute federal law as sheriffs had
to execute state law. Pp. 336-340.

(ii) Nor is Atwater's argument from tradition aided by the historical record as it has unfolded since the framing, there being no indication
that her claimed rule has ever become "woven . . . into the fabric" of
American law. E. g., Wilson, supra, at 933. The story, in fact, is to
the contrary. First, what little this Court has said about warrantless
misdemeanor arrest authority tends to cut against Atwater's argument.
See, e. g., United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 418. Second, this is
not a case in which early American courts embraced an accepted
common-law rule with anything approaching unanimity. See Wilson,
supra, at 933. None of the 19th-century state-court decisions cited by
Atwater is ultimately availing. More to the point are the numerous
19th-century state decisions expressly sustaining (often against constitutional challenge) state and local laws authorizing peace officers to
make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not involving any breach of
the peace. Finally, legal commentary, for more than a century, has almost uniformly recognized the constitutionality of extending warrantless arrest power to misdemeanors without limitation to breaches of the
peace. Small wonder, then, that today statutes in all 50 States and the
District of Columbia permit such arrests by at least some (if not all)
peace officers, as do a host of congressional enactments. Pp. 340-345.

(b) The Court rejects Atwater's request to mint a new rule of constitutional law forbidding custodial arrest, even upon probable cause, when
conviction could not ultimately carry any jail time and the government

Syllabus
can show no compelling need for immediate detention. She reasons
that, when historical practice fails to speak conclusively to a Fourth
Amendment claim, courts must strike a current balance between individual and societal interests by subjecting particular contemporary circumstances to traditional standards of reasonableness. See, e. g., Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 299-300. Atwater might well prevail
under a rule derived exclusively to address the uncontested facts of her
case, since her claim to live free of pointless indignity and confinement
clearly outweighs anything the City can raise against it specific to her.
However, the Court has traditionally recognized that a responsible
Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards requiring
sensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need, lest every
discretionary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion for
constitutional review. See, e. g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S.
218, 234-235. Complications arise the moment consideration is given
the possible applications of the several criteria Atwater proposes for
drawing a line between minor crimes with limited arrest authority and
others not so restricted. The assertion that these difficulties could be
alleviated simply by requiring police in doubt not to arrest is unavailing
because, first, such a tie breaker would in practice amount to a constitutionally inappropriate least-restrictive-alternative limitation, see, e. g.,
Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 629, n. 9,
and, second, whatever guidance the tie breaker might give would come
at the price of a systematic disincentive to arrest in situations where
even Atwater concedes arresting would serve an important societal interest. That warrantless misdemeanor arrests do not demand the constitutional attention Atwater seeks is indicated by a number of factors,
including that the law has never jelled the way Atwater would have it;
that anyone arrested without formal process is entitled to a magistrate's
review of probable cause within 48 hours, County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 55-58; that many jurisdictions have chosen to
impose more restrictive safeguards through statutes limiting warrantless arrests for minor offenses; that it is in the police's interest to limit
such arrests, which carry costs too great to incur without good reason;
and that, under current doctrine, the preference for categorical treatment of Fourth Amendment claims gives way to individualized review
when a defendant makes a colorable argument that an arrest, with or
without a warrant, was conducted in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to his privacy or physical interests, e. g., Whren, 517 U. S.,
at 818. The upshot of all these influences, combined with the good
sense (and, failing that, the political accountability) of most local lawmakers and peace officers, is a dearth of horribles demanding redress.
Thus, the probable-cause standard applies to all arrests, without the

need to balance the interests and circumstances involved in particular
situations. Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 208. An officer may
arrest an individual without violating the Fourth Amendment if there
is probable cause to believe that the offender has committed even a very
minor criminal offense in the officer's presence. Pp. 345-354.

(c) Atwater's arrest satisfied constitutional requirements. It is undisputed that Turek had probable cause to believe that Atwater committed a crime in his presence. Because she admits that neither she
nor her children were wearing seatbelts, Turek was authorized (though
not required) to make a custodial arrest without balancing costs and
benefits or determining whether Atwater's arrest was in some sense
necessary. Nor was the arrest made in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to her privacy or physical interests. See Whren, 517
U. S., at 818. Whether a search or seizure is "extraordinary" turns,
above all else, on the manner in which it is executed. See, e. g., ibid.
Atwater's arrest and subsequent booking, though surely humiliating,
were no more harmful to her interests than the normal custodial arrest. Pp. 354-355.

324 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
wearing a seatbelt. Respondent Bart Turek, a Lago Vista
police officer at the time, observed the seatbelt violations
and pulled Atwater over. According to Atwater's complaint
(the allegations of which we assume to be true for present
purposes), Turek approached the truck and "yell[ed]" something to the effect of "[w]e've met before" and "[y]ou're going
to jail." App. 20.1 He then called for backup and asked to
see Atwater's driver's license and insurance documentation,
which state law required her to carry. Tex. Transp. Code
Ann. $$ 521.025, 601.053 (1999). When Atwater told Turek
that she did not have the papers because her purse had been
stolen the day before, Turek said that he had "heard that
story two-hundred times." App. 21.

Atwater asked to take her "frightened, upset, and crying"
children to a friend's house nearby, but Turek told her,
"[y]ou're not going anywhere." Ibid. As it turned out, Atwater's friend learned what was going on and soon arrived
to take charge of the children. Turek then handcuffed Atwater, placed her in his squad car, and drove her to the local
police station, where booking officers had her remove her
shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and empty her pockets. Officers took Atwater's "mug shot" and placed her, alone, in a
jail cell for about one hour, after which she was taken before
a magistrate and released on $310 bond.

Atwater was charged with driving without her seatbelt
fastened, failing to secure her children in seatbelts, driving
without a license, and failing to provide proof of insurance.
She ultimately pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor seatbelt offenses and paid a $50 fine; the other charges were
dismissed.

1 Turek had previously stopped Atwater for what he had thought was a
seatbelt violation, but had realized that Atwater's son, although seated on
the vehicle's armrest, was in fact belted in. Atwater acknowledged that
her son's seating position was unsafe, and Turek issued a verbal warning.

Opinion of the Court

B
Atwater and her husband, petitioner Michael Haas, filedsuit in a Texas state court under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against

Turek and respondents City of Lago Vista and Chief of Po-lice Frank Miller. So far as concerns us, petitioners (whom
we will simply call Atwater) alleged that respondents (forsimplicity, the City) had violated Atwater's Fourth Amendment "right to be free from unreasonable seizure," App. 23,and sought compensatory and punitive damages.

The City removed the suit to the United States DistrictCourt for the Western District of Texas. Given Atwater's
admission that she had "violated the law" and the absence ofany allegation "that she was harmed or detained in any way
inconsistent with the law," the District Court ruled theFourth Amendment claim "meritless" and granted the City's
summary judgment motion. No. A-97 CA 679 SS (WD Tex.,Feb. 13, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-63a. A panel of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit re-versed. 165 F. 3d 380 (1999). It concluded that "an arrest
for a first-time seat belt offense" was an unreasonable seizurewithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, id., at 387,
and held that Turek was not entitled to qualified immunity,id., at 389.

Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals vacated the panel'sdecision and affirmed the District Court's summary judgment for the City. 195 F. 3d 242 (CA5 1999). Relying on
Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996), the en banccourt observed that, although the Fourth Amendment generally requires a balancing of individual and governmental in-terests, where "an arrest is based on probable cause then
`with rare exceptions . . . the result of that balancing is notin doubt.' " 195 F. 3d, at 244 (quoting Whren, supra, at 817).
Because "[n]either party dispute[d] that Officer Turek hadprobable cause to arrest Atwater," and because "there [was]
no evidence in the record that Officer Turek conducted thearrest in an `extraordinary manner, unusually harmful' to At532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
water's privacy interests," the en banc court held that thearrest was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. 195 F. 3d, at 245-246 (quoting Whren, supra, at 818).Three judges issued dissenting opinions. On the understanding that citation is the "usual procedure" in a trafficstop situation, Judge Reynaldo Garza thought Atwater's
arrest unreasonable, since there was no particular reasonfor taking her into custody. 195 F. 3d, at 246-247. Judge
Weiner likewise believed that "even with probable cause, [an]officer must have a plausible, articulable reason" for making
a custodial arrest. Id., at 251. Judge Dennis understoodthe Fourth Amendment to have incorporated an earlier,
common-law prohibition on warrantless arrests for misde-meanors that do not amount to or involve a "breach of the
peace." Ibid.We granted certiorari to consider whether the Fourth
Amendment, either by incorporating common-law restric-tions on misdemeanor arrests or otherwise, limits police officers' authority to arrest without warrant for minor criminaloffenses. 530 U. S. 1260 (2000). We now affirm.

II
The Fourth Amendment safeguards "[t]he right of the peo-ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

against unreasonable searches and seizures." In readingthe Amendment, we are guided by "the traditional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded bythe common law at the time of the framing," Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 931 (1995), since "[a]n examination ofthe common-law understanding of an officer's authority to
arrest sheds light on the obviously relevant, if not entirelydispositive, consideration of what the Framers of the Amendment might have thought to be reasonable," Payton v. NewYork, 445 U. S. 573, 591 (1980) (footnote omitted). Thus, the
first step here is to assess Atwater's claim that peace officers'authority to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors was

Opinion of the Court
restricted at common law (whether "common law" is under-stood strictly as law judicially derived or, instead, as the

whole body of law extant at the time of the framing). At-water's specific contention is that "founding-era common-law
rules" forbade peace officers to make warrantless misde-meanor arrests except in cases of "breach of the peace," a
category she claims was then understood narrowly as cov-ering only those nonfelony offenses "involving or tending

toward violence." Brief for Petitioners 13. Although herhistorical argument is by no means insubstantial, it ultimately fails. A

We begin with the state of pre-founding English commonlaw and find that, even after making some allowance for variations in the common-law usage of the term "breach of thepeace,"

2 the "founding-era common-law rules" were not

2 The term apparently meant very different things in different commonlaw contexts. For instance, under a statute enacted during the reign of
Charles II forbidding service of any warrant or other court process on
Sunday "except in cases of treason, felony or breach of the peace," 29 Car.
II, ch. 7, $ 6, 8 Statutes at Large 414 (1676), "it was held that every indictable offense was constructively a breach of the peace," Wilgus, Arrest
Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 541, 574 (1924); see also Ex parte
Whitchurch, 1 Atk. 56, 58, 26 Eng. Rep. 37, 39 (Ch. 1749). The term carried a similarly broad meaning when employed to define the jurisdiction
of justices of the peace, see 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 8,

$ 38, p. 60 (6th ed. 1787) (hereinafter Hawkins), or to delimit the scope of
parliamentary privilege, see Williamson v. United States, 207 U. S. 425,
435-446 (1908) (discussing common-law origins of Arrest Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 6, cl. 1).

Even when used to describe common-law arrest authority, the term's
precise import is not altogether clear. See J. Turner, Kenny's Outlines of
Criminal Law $ 695, p. 537 (17th ed. 1958) ("Strangely enough what constitutes a `breach of the peace' has not been authoritatively laid down"); G.
Williams, Arrest for Breach of the Peace, 1954 Crim. L. Rev. 578, 578-579
("The expression `breach of the peace' seems clearer than it is and there
is a surprising lack of authoritative definition of what one would suppose
to be a fundamental concept in criminal law"); Wilgus, supra, at 573
("What constitutes a breach of peace is not entirely certain"). More often

328 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
nearly as clear as Atwater claims; on the contrary, thecommon-law commentators (as well as the sparsely reported

cases) reached divergent conclusions with respect to officers'warrantless misdemeanor arrest power. Moreover, in the
years leading up to American independence, Parliament re-peatedly extended express warrantless arrest authority to
cover misdemeanor-level offenses not amounting to or involv-ing any violent breach of the peace.

1
Atwater's historical argument begins with our quotationfrom Halsbury in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132

(1925), that

" `[i]n cases of misdemeanor, a peace officer like a pri-vate person has at common law no power of arresting

without a warrant except when a breach of the peacehas been committed in his presence or there is reasonable ground for supposing that a breach of peace is aboutto be committed or renewed in his presence.' " Id., at
157 (quoting 9 Halsbury, Laws of England $ 612, p. 299(1909)).

than not, when used in reference to common-law arrest power, the term
seemed to connote an element of violence. See, e. g., M. Dalton, Country
Justice, ch. 3, p. 9 (1727) ("The Breach of th[e] Peace seemeth to be any
injurious Force or Violence moved against the Person of another, his
Goods, Lands, or other Possessions, whether by threatening words, or by
furious Gesture, or Force of the Body, or any other Force used in terrorem"). On occasion, however, common-law commentators included in
their descriptions of breaches of the peace offenses that do not necessarily
involve violence or a threat thereof. See M. Hale, A Methodical Summary
of the Principal Matters Relating to the Pleas of the Crown *134 (7th ed.
1773) ("Barretries"); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 149 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone) ("[s]preading false news"). For
purposes of this case, it is unnecessary to reach a definitive resolution of
the uncertainty. As stated in the text, we will assume that as used in
the context of common-law arrest, the phrase "breach of the peace" was
understood narrowly, as entailing at least a threat of violence.

Opinion of the Court
But the isolated quotation tends to mislead. In Carroll it-self we spoke of the common-law rule as only "sometimes

expressed" that way, 267 U. S., at 157, and, indeed, in thevery same paragraph, we conspicuously omitted any reference to a breach-of-the-peace limitation in stating that the"usual rule" at common law was that "a police officer [could]
arrest without warrant . . . one guilty of a misdemeanor if
committed in his presence." Id., at 156-157. Thus, what
Carroll illustrates, and what others have recognized, is that
statements about the common law of warrantless misde-meanor arrest simply are not uniform. Rather, "[a]t common law there is a difference of opinion among the authorities as to whether this right to arrest [without a warrant]
extends to all misdemeanors." American Law Institute,
Code of Criminal Procedure, Commentary to $ 21, p. 231
(1930).

On one side of the divide there are certainly eminent authorities supporting Atwater's position. In addition to Lord
Halsbury, quoted in Carroll, James Fitzjames Stephen and
Glanville Williams both seemed to indicate that the common
law confined warrantless misdemeanor arrests to actual
breaches of the peace. See 1 J. Stephen, A History of the
Criminal Law of England 193 (1883) ("The common law did
not authorise the arrest of persons guilty or suspected of
misdemeanours, except in cases of an actual breach of the
peace either by an affray or by violence to an individual");
G. Williams, Arrest for Breach of the Peace, 1954 Crim.
L. Rev. 578, 578 ("Apart from arrest for felony . . . , the only
power of arrest at common law is in respect of breach of the
peace"). See also Queen v. Tooley, 2 Ld. Raym. 1296, 1301,
92 Eng. Rep. 349, 352 (Q. B. 1710) ("[A] constable cannot arrest, but when he sees an actual breach of the peace; and if
the affray be over, he cannot arrest").

Sir William Blackstone and Sir Edward East might also be
counted on Atwater's side, although they spoke only to the
sufficiency of breach of the peace as a condition to warrant532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
330 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
less misdemeanor arrest, not to its necessity. Blackstonerecognized that at common law "[t]he constable . . . hath

great original and inherent authority with regard to ar-rests," but with respect to nonfelony offenses said only that
"[h]e may, without warrant, arrest any one for a breach ofthe peace, and carry him before a justice of the peace." 4
Blackstone 289. Not long after the framing of the Fourth
Amendment, East characterized peace officers' common-lawarrest power in much the same way: "A constable or other

known conservator of the peace may lawfully interpose uponhis own view to prevent a breach of the peace, or to quiet an
affray . . . ." 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown $ 71, p. 303(1803).

The great commentators were not unanimous, however,and there is also considerable evidence of a broader conception of common-law misdemeanor arrest authority unlimitedby any breach-of-the-peace condition. Sir Matthew Hale,
Chief Justice of King's Bench from 1671 to 1676,3 wrote in
his History of the Pleas of the Crown that, by his "original
and inherent power," a constable could arrest without a warrant "for breach of the peace and some misdemeanors, less
than felony." 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 88 (1736).
Hale's view, posthumously published in 1736, reflected an
understanding dating back at least 60 years before the appearance of his Pleas yet sufficiently authoritative to sustain
a momentum extending well beyond the framing era in
this country. See The Compleat Parish-Officer 11 (1744)
("[T]he Constable . . . may for Breach of the Peace, and
some Misdemeanors less than Felony, imprison a Man");
R. Burn, The Justice of the Peace 271 (1837) ("A constable . . .
may at common law, for treason, felony, breach of the peace,
and some misdemeanors less than felony, committed in
his view, apprehend the supposed offender without any
warrant" (italics in original)); 1 J. Chitty, A Practical

Opinion of the Court
Treatise on the Criminal Law 20 (5th ed. 1847) ("[A consta-ble] may for treason, felony, breach of the peace, and some

misdemeanors less than felony, committed in his view, appre-hend the supposed offender virtiute officii, without any warrant"); 1 W. Russell, Crimes and Misdemeanors 725 (7th ed.1909) (officer "may arrest any person who in his presence
commits a misdemeanor or breach of the peace").4As will be seen later, the view of warrantless arrest authority as extending to at least "some misdemeanors" beyondbreaches of the peace was undoubtedly informed by statutory provisions authorizing such arrests, but it reflected com-mon law in the strict, judge-made sense as well, for such was
the holding of at least one case reported before Hale hadeven become a judge but which, like Hale's own commentary,
continued to be cited well after the ratification of the FourthAmendment. In

Holyday v. Oxenbridge, Cro. Car. 234, 79Eng. Rep. 805 (1631), the Court of King's Bench held that

even a private person (and thus a fortiori a peace officer 5)needed no warrant to arrest a "common cheater" whom he
discovered "cozen[ing] with false dice." The court expresslyrejected the contention that warrantless arrests were improper "unless in felony," and said instead that "there wasgood cause [for] staying" the gambler and, more broadly,
that "it is pro bono publico to stay such offenders." Id.,at 805-806. In the edition nearest to the date of the Constitution's framing, Sergeant William Hawkins's widelyread Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown generalized from
Holyday that "from the reason of this case it seems to follow,

4 Cf. E. Trotter, Seventeenth Century Life in the Country Parish: With
Special Reference to Local Government 88 (1919) (describing broad authority of local constables and concluding that, "[i]n short, the constable
must apprehend, take charge of and present for trial all persons who broke
the laws, written or unwritten, against the King's peace or against the
statutes of the realm . . .").

5 See 2 Hawkins, ch. 13, $ 1, at 129 ("[W]herever any [warrantless] arrest

may be justified by a private person, in every such case a` fortiori it may
be justified by any [peace] officer").

532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
332 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
That the [warrantless] arrest of any other offenders . . . for
offences in like manner scandalous and prejudicial to the
public, may be justified." 2 Hawkins, ch. 12, $ 20, at 122. A
number of other common-law commentaries shared Hawkins's broad reading of Holyday. See The Law of Arrests
205 (2d ed. 1753) (In light of Holyday, "an Arrest of an
Offender . . . for any Crime prejudicial to the Publick, seems
to be justifiable"); 1 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete
Law Dictionary (1771) (definition of "arrest") (same); 1 G.
Jacob, The Law Dictionary 129 (1st Am. ed. 1811) (same).
See generally C. Greaves, Law of Arrest Without a Warrant,
in The Criminal Law Consolidation Acts, p. lxiii (1870)
("[Holyday] is rested upon the broad ground that `it is pro
bono publico to stay such offenders,' which is equally applicable to every case of misdemeanor . . . ").6

We thus find disagreement, not unanimity, among both the
common-law jurists and the text writers who sought to pull
the cases together and summarize accepted practice. Having reviewed the relevant English decisions, as well as English and colonial American legal treatises, legal dictionaries,
and procedure manuals, we simply are not convinced that
Atwater's is the correct, or even necessarily the better, reading of the common-law history.

Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 772 (1994), also contain dicta suggesting
a somewhat broader conception of common-law arrest power than the one
Atwater advances. See, e. g., King v. Wilkes, supra, at 158, 95 Eng. Rep.,

commit the criminal upon the spot"); Money v. Leach, supra, at 1766, 97

Opinion of the Court

2
A second, and equally serious, problem for Atwater's his-torical argument is posed by the "divers Statutes," M. Dalton, Country Justice, ch. 170, $ 4, p. 582 (1727), enacted byParliament well before this Republic's founding that authorized warrantless misdemeanor arrests without reference toviolence or turmoil. Quite apart from Hale and Blackstone,
the legal background of any conception of reasonablenessthe Fourth Amendment's Framers might have entertained
would have included English statutes, some centuries old,authorizing peace officers (and even private persons) to make
warrantless arrests for all sorts of relatively minor offensesunaccompanied by violence. The so-called "nightwalker"
statutes are perhaps the most notable examples. From theenactment of the Statute of Winchester in 1285, through its
various readoptions and until its repeal in 1827,7 night watch-men were authorized and charged "as . . . in Times past" to
"watch the Town continually all Night, from the Sun-settingunto the Sun-rising" and were directed that "if any Stranger
do pass by them, he shall be arrested until Morning . . . ."13 Edw. I, ch. 4, $$ 5-6, 1 Statutes at Large 232-233; see also
5 Edw. III, ch. 14, 1 Statutes at Large 448 (1331) (confirmingand extending the powers of watchmen). Hawkins emphasized that the Statute of Winchester "was made" not in dero-gation but rather "in affirmance of the common law," for
"every private person may by the common law arrest anysuspicious night-walker, and detain him till he give good account of himself . . . ." 2 Hawkins, ch. 13, $ 6, at 130. Andaccording to Blackstone, these watchmen had virtually limitless warrantless nighttime arrest power: "Watchmen, eitherthose appointed by the statute of Winchester . . . or such as
are mere assistants to the constable, may virtute officii ar-rest all offenders, and particularly nightwalkers, and commit
them to custody till the morning." 4 Blackstone 289; see

7 7 & 8 Geo. IV, ch. 27, 67 Statutes at Large 153.

334 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
also 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 97 (describing broad arrest powers of watchmen even over and above those conferred by the Statute of Winchester).8 The Statute of Winchester, moreover, empowered peace officers not only to deal
with nightwalkers and other nighttime "offenders," but periodically to "make Inquiry of all Persons being lodged in the
Suburbs, or in foreign Places of the Towns." On that score,
the Statute provided that "if they do find any that have
lodged or received any Strangers or suspicious Person,
against the Peace, the Bailiffs shall do Righttherein," 13
Edw. I, ch. 4, $$ 3-4, 1 Statutes at Large 232-233, which
Hawkins understood "surely" to mean that officers could
"lawfully arrest and detain any such stranger[s]," 2 Hawkins,
ch. 13, $ 12, at 134.

Nor were the nightwalker statutes the only legislative
sources of warrantless arrest authority absent real or threatened violence, as the parties and their amici here seem to
have assumed. On the contrary, following the Edwardian
legislation and throughout the period leading up to the framing, Parliament repeatedly extended warrantless arrest
power to cover misdemeanor-level offenses not involving any
breach of the peace. One 16th-century statute, for instance,
authorized peace officers to arrest persons playing "unlawful
game[s]" like bowling, tennis, dice, and cards, and for good
measure extended the authority beyond players to include
persons "haunting" the "houses, places and alleys where
such games shall be suspected to be holden, exercised, used

8 Atwater seeks to distinguish the nightwalker statutes by arguing that
they "just reflected the reasonable notion that, in an age before lighting,
finding a person walking about in the dead of night equaled probable suspicion that the person was a felon." Reply Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 6.
Hale indicates, however, that nightwalkers and felons were not considered
to be one and the same. 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 97 ("And such a
watchman may apprehend night-walkers and commit them to custody till
the morning, and also felons and persons suspected of felony").

include jugglers, palm readers, and unlicensed play actors),

of Parliament (1723) (cataloguing statutes); S. Welch, An
Essay on the Office of Constable 19-22 (1758) (describing
same).

The significance of these early English statutes lies not
in proving that any common-law rule barring warrantless
misdemeanor arrests that might have existed would have
been subject to statutory override; the sovereign Parliament could of course have wiped away any judge-made rule.
The point is that the statutes riddle Atwater's supposed
common-law rule with enough exceptions to unsettle any
contention that the law of the mother country would have
left the Fourth Amendment's Framers of a view that it
would necessarily have been unreasonable to arrest without
warrant for a misdemeanor unaccompanied by real or threatened violence.

336 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court

B
An examination of specifically American evidence is to thesame effect. Neither the history of the framing era nor subsequent legal development indicates that the Fourth Amend-ment was originally understood, or has traditionally been
read, to embrace Atwater's position.

1
To begin with, Atwater has cited no particular evidencethat those who framed and ratified the Fourth Amendment

sought to limit peace officers' warrantless misdemeanor ar-rest authority to instances of actual breach of the peace, and
our own review of the recent and respected compilations offraming-era documentary history has likewise failed to reveal any such design. See The Complete Bill of Rights 223-263 (N. Cogan ed. 1997) (collecting original sources); 5 The
Founders' Constitution 219-244 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds.1987) (same). Nor have we found in any of the modern historical accounts of the Fourth Amendment's adoption anysubstantial indication that the Framers intended such a restriction. See, e. g., L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights150-179 (1999); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 19-93 (1969); J. Landynski, Search and Seizureand the Supreme Court 19-48 (1966); N. Lasson, History and
Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United StatesConstitution 79-105 (1937); Davies, Recovering the Original
Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 547 (1999); Amar,Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757
(1994); Bradley, Constitutional Theory of the Fourth Amend-ment, 38 DePaul L. Rev. 817 (1989). Indeed, to the extent
these modern histories address the issue, their conclusionsare to the contrary. See Landynski, supra, at 45 (Fourth
Amendment arrest rules are "based on common-law prac-tice," which "dispensed with" a warrant requirement for misdemeanors "committed in the presence of the arresting offi-cer"); Davies,

Opinion of the Court
warrantless intrusions at all in the Fourth Amendment or inthe earlier state provisions; thus, they never anticipated that

`unreasonable' might be read as a standard for warrantlessintrusions").

The evidence of actual practice also counsels against At-water's position. During the period leading up to and surrounding the framing of the Bill of Rights, colonial and state
legislatures, like Parliament before them, supra, at 333-335,regularly authorized local peace officers to make warrantless

misdemeanor arrests without conditioning statutory author-ity on breach of the peace. See,

e. g., First Laws of the State
of Connecticut 214-215 (Cushing ed. 1982) (1784 compilation;
exact date of Act unknown) (authorizing warrantless arrests
of "all Persons unnecessarily travelling on the Sabbath or
Lord's Day"); id., at 23 ("such as are guilty of Drunkenness,
profane Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, also vagrant Persons
[and] unseasonable Night-walkers"); Digest of the Laws of
the State of Georgia 1755-1800, p. 411 (H. Marbury & W.

licensed public house, or other house selling liquors"); Colonial Laws of Massachusetts 139 (1889) (1646 Act) ("such

Lying, vagrant persons, [and] night-walkers"); Laws of the

night-walkers, and common prostitutes," as well as fortunetellers and other practitioners of "crafty science"); Laws of

What we have here, then, is just the opposite of what
we had in Wilson v. Arkansas. There, we emphasized that
during the founding era a number of States had "enacted
statutes specifically embracing" the common-law knock-andannounce rule, 514 U. S., at 933; here, by contrast, those very
same States passed laws extending warrantless arrest authority to a host of nonviolent misdemeanors, and in so doing
acted very much inconsistently with Atwater's claims about
the Fourth Amendment's object. Of course, the Fourth

9 Given these early colonial and state laws, the fact that a number of
States that ratified the Fourth Amendment generally incorporated
common-law principles into their own constitutions or statutes, see Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 934 (1995), cannot aid Atwater here.
Founding-era receptions of common law, whether by state constitution or
state statute, generally provided that common-law rules were subject to
statutory alteration. See, e. g., Del. Const., Art. 25 (1776), 2 W. Swindler,
Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 203 (1973) (hereinafter Swindler) ("The common law of England . . . shall remain in force,
unless [it] shall be altered by a future law of the legislature"); N. J. Const.,

Opinion of the Court
Amendment did not originally apply to the States, see Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), but that does
not make state practice irrelevant in unearthing the Amend-ment's original meaning. A number of state constitutional

search-and-seizure provisions served as models for theFourth Amendment, see,

e. g., N. H. Const. of 1784, pt. I, Art.
XIX; Pa. Const. of 1776 (Declaration of Rights), Art. X, and
the fact that many of the original States with such constitu-tional limitations continued to grant their own peace officers

broad warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority underminesAtwater's contention that the founding generation meant to
bar federal law enforcement officers from exercising thesame authority. Given the early state practice, it is likewise
troublesome for Atwater's view that just one year after theratification of the Fourth Amendment, Congress vested federal marshals with "the same powers in executing the lawsof the United States, as sheriffs and their deputies in the
several states have by law, in executing the laws of their
respective states." Act of May 2, 1792, ch. 28, $ 9, 1 Stat.
265. Thus, as we have said before in only slightly different
circumstances, the Second Congress apparently "saw no inconsistency between the Fourth Amendment and legislation
giving United States marshals the same power as local peace
officers" to make warrantless arrests. United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 420 (1976).10

The record thus supports Justice Powell's observation that
"[t]here is no historical evidence that the Framers or proponents of the Fourth Amendment, outspokenly opposed to the
infamous general warrants and writs of assistance, were at

10 Courts and commentators alike have read the 1792 Act as conferring
broad warrantless arrest authority on federal officers, and, indeed, the
Act's passage "so soon after the adoption of the Fourth Amendment itself
underscores the probability that the constitutional provision was intended
to restrict entirely different practices." Watson, 423 U. S., at 429 (Powell,
J., concurring); see also Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107
Harv. L. Rev., at 764, and n. 14.

all concerned about warrantless arrests by local constablesand other peace officers." Id., at 429 (concurring opinion).

We simply cannot conclude that the Fourth Amendment, asoriginally understood, forbade peace officers to arrest without a warrant for misdemeanors not amounting to or involv-ing breach of the peace.

2
Nor does Atwater's argument from tradition pick up anysteam from the historical record as it has unfolded since the

framing, there being no indication that her claimed rule hasever become "woven . . . into the fabric" of American law.
Wilson, supra, at 933; see also Payton v. New York, 445U. S., at 590 (emphasizing "the clear consensus among the
States adhering to [a] well-settled common-law rule"). Thestory, on the contrary, is of two centuries of uninterrupted
(and largely unchallenged) state and federal practice permit-ting warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not amounting to
or involving breach of the peace.First, there is no support for Atwater's position in this
Court's cases (apart from the isolated sentence in Carroll,already explained). Although the Court has not had much
to say about warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority, whatlittle we have said tends to cut against Atwater's argument.
In discussing this authority, we have focused on the circum-stance that an offense was committed in an officer's presence,
to the omission of any reference to a breach-of-the-peace lim-itation.

11 See, e. g., United States v. Watson, supra, at 418

("The cases construing the Fourth Amendment thus reflectthe ancient common-law rule that a peace officer was permitted to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor or felony

11 We need not, and thus do not, speculate whether the Fourth Amendment entails an "in the presence" requirement for purposes of misdemeanor arrests. Cf. Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 756 (1984) (White,
J., dissenting) ("[T]he requirement that a misdemeanor must have occurred in the officer's presence to justify a warrantless arrest is not
grounded in the Fourth Amendment").

committed in his presence . . ."); Carroll, 267 U. S., at 156-157 ("The usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one . . . guilty of a misdemeanor if committed inhis presence");

Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U. S. 529, 534,
536, n. 1 (1900) (noting common-law pedigree of state statutepermitting warrantless arrest "[f]or a public offense committed or attempted in [officer's] presence"); Kurtz v. Moffitt,
115 U. S. 487, 499 (1885) (common-law presence requirement);cf. also

Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 756 (1984) (White,
J., dissenting) (" `[A]uthority to arrest without a warrant inmisdemeanor cases may be enlarged by statute' ").

Second, and again in contrast with Wilson, it is not the
case here that "[e]arly American courts . . . embraced" an
accepted common-law rule with anything approaching unanimity. Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S., at 933. To be sure,
Atwater has cited several 19th-century decisions that, at
least at first glance, might seem to support her contention
that "warrantless misdemeanor arrest was unlawful when
not [for] a breach of the peace." Brief for Petitioners 17
(citing Pow v. Beckner, 3 Ind. 475, 478 (1852), Commonwealth
v. Carey, 66 Mass. 246, 250 (1853), and Robison v. Miner,
68 Mich. 549, 556-559, 37 N. W. 21, 25 (1888)). But none is
ultimately availing. Pow is fundamentally a "presence"
case; it stands only for the proposition, not at issue here, see
n. 11, supra, that a nonfelony arrest should be made while
the offense is "in [the officer's] view and . . . still continuing"
and not subsequently "upon vague information communicated to him." 3 Ind., at 478. The language Atwater attributes to Carey ("[E]ven if he were a constable, he had no
power to arrest for any misdemeanor without a warrant, except to stay a breach of the peace, or to prevent the commission of such an offense") is taken from the reporter's summary of one of the party's arguments, not from the opinion
of the court. While the court in Carey (through Chief Justice Shaw) said that "the old established rule of the common
law" was that "a constable or other peace officer could not

arrest one without a warrant . . . if such crime were not anoffence amounting in law to felony," it said just as clearly

that the common-law rule could be "altered by the legisla-ture" (notwithstanding Massachusetts's own Fourth Amendment equivalent in its State Constitution). 66 Mass., at 252.
Miner, the third and final case upon which Atwater relies,
was expressly overruled just six years after it was decided.
In Burroughs v. Eastman, 101 Mich. 419, 59 N. W. 817 (1894),the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the language from

Miner upon which the plaintiff there (and presumably At-water here) relied "should not be followed," and then went
on to offer the following: "[T]he question has arisen in many
of our sister states, and the power to authorize arrest on
view for offenses not amounting to breaches of the peace has
been affirmed. Our attention has been called to no case, nor
have we in our research found one, in which the contrary
doctrine has been asserted." 101 Mich., at 425, 59 N. W.,
at 819 (collecting cases from, e. g., Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York,
Ohio, and Texas).

The reports may well contain early American cases more
favorable to Atwater's position than the ones she has herself
invoked. But more to the point, we think, are the numerous
early- and mid-19th-century decisions expressly sustaining
(often against constitutional challenge) state and local laws
authorizing peace officers to make warrantless arrests for
misdemeanors not involving any breach of the peace. See,
e. g., Mayo v. Wilson, 1 N. H. 53 (1817) (upholding statute
authorizing warrantless arrests of those unnecessarily traveling on Sunday against challenge based on state due process
and search-and-seizure provisions); Holcomb v. Cornish, 8
Conn. 375 (1831) (upholding statute permitting warrantless
arrests for "drunkenness, profane swearing, cursing or
sabbath-breaking" against argument that "[t]he power of a

Root, 72 Mass. 435 (1856) (rebuffingconstitutional challenge to statute authorizing officers "without a warrant [to] arrest any person or persons whom theymay find in the act of illegally selling, transporting, or distributing intoxicating liquors"); Main v. McCarty, 15 Ill. 441,442 (1854) (concluding that a law expressly authorizing arrests for city-ordinance violations was "not repugnant to the
constitution or the general provisions of law"); White v. Kent,11 Ohio St. 550 (1860) (upholding municipal ordinance permitting warrantless arrest of any person found violating anycity ordinance or state law);

Davis v. American Soc. for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 75 N. Y. 362 (1878) (upholding
statute permitting warrantless arrest for misdemeanor violation of cruelty-to-animals prohibition). See generally Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 541, 550,
and n. 54 (1924) (collecting cases and observing that "[t]he
states may, by statute, enlarge the common law right to arrest without a warrant, and have quite generally done so or
authorized municipalities to do so, as for example, an officer
may be authorized by statute or ordinance to arrest without
a warrant for various misdemeanors and violations of ordinances, other than breaches of the peace, if committed in his
presence"); id., at 706, nn. 570, 571 (collecting cases); 1 J.

103, n. 5 (4th ed. 1895) (same); W. Clark, Handbook of Criminal Procedure $ 12, p. 50, n. 8 (2d ed. 1918) (same).

Finally, both the legislative tradition of granting warrantless misdemeanor arrest authority and the judicial tradition
of sustaining such statutes against constitutional attack are
buttressed by legal commentary that, for more than a century now, has almost uniformly recognized the constitutionality of extending warrantless arrest power to misdemeanors
without limitation to breaches of the peace. See, e. g., E.
Fisher, Laws of Arrest $ 59, p. 130 (1967) ("[I]t is generally

("In most, if not all, the states there are statutes and cityordinances, which are clearly valid, authorizing officers to

and Practice $ 21, p. 20, and n. 7 (1899) ("By statute thepower of peace officers to arrest without a warrant is often
extended to all misdemeanors committed in their presence.""Such a statute is constitutional"); 1 Bishop,

supra, $ 183, at103 ("[T]he power of arrest extends, possibly, to any indictable wrong in [an officer's] presence. . . . And statutes andordinances widely permit these arrests for violations of municipal by-laws"); J. Bassett, Criminal Pleading and Practice$ 89, p. 104 (2d ed. 1885) ("[A]s to the lesser misdemeanors,
except breaches of the peace, the power extends only so faras some statute gives it"). But cf. H. Vorhees, Law of Arrest $ 131, pp. 78-79 (1904) (acknowledging that "by author-ity of statute, city charter, or ordinance, [an officer] may arrest without a warrant, one who . . . commits a misdemeanorother than a breach of the peace," but suggesting that courts
look with "disfavor" on such legislative enactments "as inter-fering with the constitutional liberties of the subject").

Small wonder, then, that today statutes in all 50 Statesand the District of Columbia permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests by at least some (if not all) peace officerswithout requiring any breach of the peace,

12 as do a host

of congressional enactments.13 The American Law Institute

p. 28 (1930); American Law Institute, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure $ 120.1(1)(c), p. 13 (1975), and the
consensus, as stated in the current literature, is that statutes"remov[ing] the breach of the peace limitation and thereby
permit[ting] arrest without warrant for any misdemeanorcommitted in the arresting officer's presence" have " `never
been successfully challenged and stan[d] as the law of theland.' " 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 5.1(b), pp. 13-14,
and n. 76 (1996) (quoting Higbee v. San Diego, 911 F. 2d 377,379 (CA9 1990)) (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).
This, therefore, simply is not a case in which the claimantcan point to "a clear answer [that] existed in 1791 and has
been generally adhered to by the traditions of our societyever since."

Scalia, J., dissenting).

III
While it is true here that history, if not unequivocal, hasexpressed a decided, majority view that the police need not

obtain an arrest warrant merely because a misdemeanorstopped short of violence or a threat of it, Atwater does not
wager all on history.14 Instead, she asks us to mint a new

agents); $ 3061(a)(2) (same, for postal inspectors); $ 3063(a)(3) (same, for

Administration agents); 25 U. S. C. $ 2803(3)(A) (same, for Bureau of Indian
Affairs officers).

14 And, indeed, the dissent chooses not to deal with history at all. See

post, p. 360 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). As is no doubt clear from the text,
the historical record is not nearly as murky as the dissent suggests. See,
e. g., supra, at 333-335 (parliamentary statutes clearly authorizing warrantless arrests for misdemeanor-level offenses), 337-338 (colonial and
founding-era state statutes clearly authorizing same). History, moreover,
is not just "one of the tools" relevant to a Fourth Amendment inquiry,
post, at 361. Justice O'Connor herself has observed that courts must

Opinion of the Court
rule of constitutional law on the understanding that when
historical practice fails to speak conclusively to a claim
grounded on the Fourth Amendment, courts are left to strike
a current balance between individual and societal interests by subjecting particular contemporary circumstances to
traditional standards of reasonableness. See Wyoming v.
Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 299-300 (1999); Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 652-653 (1995). Atwater
accordingly argues for a modern arrest rule, one not necessarily requiring violent breach of the peace, but nonetheless
forbidding custodial arrest, even upon probable cause, when
conviction could not ultimately carry any jail time and when
the government shows no compelling need for immediate
detention.15

If we were to derive a rule exclusively to address the uncontested facts of this case, Atwater might well prevail.
She was a known and established resident of Lago Vista with
no place to hide and no incentive to flee, and common sense
says she would almost certainly have buckled up as a condition of driving off with a citation. In her case, the physical
incidents of arrest were merely gratuitous humiliations
imposed by a police officer who was (at best) exercising

be "reluctant . . . to conclude that the Fourth Amendment proscribes a
practice that was accepted at the time of adoption of the Bill of Rights
and has continued to receive the support of many state legislatures," Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 26 (1985) (dissenting opinion), as the practice
of making warrantless misdemeanor arrests surely was and has, see supra,
at 337-345. Because here the dissent "claim[s] that [a] practic[e] accepted
when the Fourth Amendment was adopted [is] now constitutionally impermissible," the dissent bears the "heavy burden" of justifying a departure
from the historical understanding. 471 U. S., at 26.

15 Although it is unclear from Atwater's briefs whether the rule she proposes would bar custodial arrests for fine-only offenses even when made
pursuant to a warrant, at oral argument Atwater's counsel "concede[d]
that if a warrant were obtained, this arrest . . . would . . . be reasonable."

Opinion of the Court
extremely poor judgment. Atwater's claim to live free of
pointless indignity and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raise against it specific to her case.

But we have traditionally recognized that a responsible
Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards
requiring sensitive, case-by-case determinations of government need, lest every discretionary judgment in the field be
converted into an occasion for constitutional review. See,
e. g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 234-235 (1973).
Often enough, the Fourth Amendment has to be applied on
the spur (and in the heat) of the moment, and the object
in implementing its command of reasonableness is to draw
standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a
fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months
and years after an arrest or search is made. Courts attempting to strike a reasonable Fourth Amendment balance
thus credit the government's side with an essential interest
in readily administrable rules. See New York v. Belton, 453
U. S. 454, 458 (1981) (Fourth Amendment rules " `ought to be
expressed in terms that are readily applicable by the police
in the context of the law enforcement activities in which they
are necessarily engaged' " and not " `qualified by all sorts of
ifs, ands, and buts' ").16

At first glance, Atwater's argument may seem to respect
the values of clarity and simplicity, so far as she claims that
the Fourth Amendment generally forbids warrantless arrests for minor crimes not accompanied by violence or some

16 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), upon which the dissent relies, see
post, at 366, is not to the contrary. Terry certainly supports a more finely
tuned approach to the Fourth Amendment when police act without the
traditional justification that either a warrant (in the case of a search) or
probable cause (in the case of arrest) provides; but at least in the absence
of "extraordinary" circumstances, Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806,
818 (1996), there is no comparable cause for finicking when police act with
such justification.

Opinion of the Court
demonstrable threat of it (whether "minor crime" be defined
as a fine-only traffic offense, a fine-only offense more generally, or a misdemeanor 17). But the claim is not ultimately
so simple, nor could it be, for complications arise the moment
we begin to think about the possible applications of the several criteria Atwater proposes for drawing a line between
minor crimes with limited arrest authority and others not
so restricted.

One line, she suggests, might be between "jailable" and
"fine-only" offenses, between those for which conviction
could result in commitment and those for which it could not.
The trouble with this distinction, of course, is that an officer
on the street might not be able to tell. It is not merely that
we cannot expect every police officer to know the details of
frequently complex penalty schemes, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 431, n. 13 (1984) ("[O]fficers in the field
frequently `have neither the time nor the competence to determine' the severity of the offense for which they are considering arresting a person"), but that penalties for ostensibly identical conduct can vary on account of facts difficult (if
not impossible) to know at the scene of an arrest. Is this
the first offense or is the suspect a repeat offender? 18 Is
the weight of the marijuana a gram above or a gram below

17 Compare, e. g., Brief for Petitioners 46 ("fine-only") with, e. g., Tr. of
Oral Arg. 11 (misdemeanors). Because the difficulties attendant to any
major crime-minor crime distinction are largely the same, we treat them
together.

18 See, e. g., Welsh, 466 U. S., at 756 (first DUI offense subject to maximum fine of $200; subsequent offense punishable by one year's imprisonment); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 154 (1925) (first offense

Opinion of the Court
the fine-only line? 19 Where conduct could implicate more
than one criminal prohibition, which one will the district

attorney ultimately decide to charge? 20 And so on.

But Atwater's refinements would not end there. She represents that if the line were drawn at nonjailable traffic offenses, her proposed limitation should be qualified by a proviso authorizing warrantless arrests where "necessary for
enforcement of the traffic laws or when [an] offense would
otherwise continue and pose a danger to others on the road."
Brief for Petitioners 46 (internal quotation marks omitted).
(Were the line drawn at misdemeanors generally, a comparable qualification would presumably apply.) The proviso only
compounds the difficulties. Would, for instance, either exception apply to speeding? At oral argument, Atwater's
counsel said that "it would not be reasonable to arrest a
driver for speeding unless the speeding rose to the level of
reckless driving." Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. But is it not fair to
expect that the chronic speeder will speed again despite a
citation in his pocket, and should that not qualify as showing
that the "offense would . . . continue" under Atwater's rule?
And why, as a constitutional matter, should we assume that
only reckless driving will "pose a danger to others on the
road" while speeding will not?

19 See, e. g., 21 U. S. C. $$ 844, 844a (possession of "personal use amount"
of a controlled substance subject to maximum $10,000 fine; possession of
larger amount punishable by one year's imprisonment); Tex. Health &
Safety Code Ann. $ 481.121(b) (Supp. 2001) (possession of four ounces or
less of marijuana a misdemeanor; possession of more than four ounces
a felony). See generally National Survey of State Laws 151-188 (3d
R. Leiter ed. 1999) (surveying state laws concerning drug possession).

20 For instance, the act of allowing a small child to stand unrestrained

in the front seat of a moving vehicle at least arguably constitutes child
endangerment, which under Texas law is a state jail felony. Tex. Penal
Code Ann. $$ 22.041(c), (f) (Supp. 2001). Cf. also 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal
Law $ 28 (1998) ("[S]ome statutory schemes permit courts in their discretion to term certain offenses as felonies or as misdemeanors").

350 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

Opinion of the Court
There is no need for more examples to show that Atwater'sgeneral rule and limiting proviso promise very little in the

way of administrability. It is no answer that the police rou-tinely make judgments on grounds like risk of immediate
repetition; they surely do and should. But there is a worldof difference between making that judgment in choosing between the discretionary leniency of a summons in place of aclearly lawful arrest, and making the same judgment when
the question is the lawfulness of the warrantless arrest itself.It is the difference between no basis for legal action challenging the discretionary judgment, on the one hand, and the
prospect of evidentiary exclusion or (as here) personal $ 1983liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard,

on the other. Atwater's rule therefore would not only placepolice in an almost impossible spot but would guarantee
increased litigation over many of the arrests that wouldoccur.

21 For all these reasons, Atwater's various distinctions between permissible and impermissible arrests for
minor crimes strike us as "very unsatisfactory line[s]" to re-quire police officers to draw on a moment's notice.

Carroll
v. United States, 267 U. S., at 157.One may ask, of course, why these difficulties may not be

answered by a simple tie breaker for the police to follow inthe field: if in doubt, do not arrest. The first answer is that
in practice the tie breaker would boil down to somethingakin to a least-restrictive-alternative limitation, which is
itself one of those "ifs, ands, and buts" rules, New Yorkv.

Belton, 453 U. S., at 458, generally thought inappropriate
in working out Fourth Amendment protection. See, e. g.,
Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602,

21 See United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 423-424 (1976) ("[T]he
judgment of the Nation and Congress has . . . long been to authorize warrantless public arrests on probable cause rather than to encumber criminal
prosecutions with endless litigation with respect to the existence of exigent circumstances, whether it was practicable to get a warrant, whether
the suspect was about to flee, and the like").

629, n. 9 (1989) (collecting cases); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 557-558, n. 12 (1976) ("The logic of such

elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raiseinsuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all searchand-seizure powers"). Beyond that, whatever help the tiebreaker might give would come at the price of a systematic
disincentive to arrest in situations where even Atwaterconcedes that arresting would serve an important societal
interest. An officer not quite sure that the drugs weighedenough to warrant jail time or not quite certain about a suspect's risk of flight would not arrest, even though it couldperfectly well turn out that, in fact, the offense called for
incarceration and the defendant was long gone on the day oftrial. Multiplied many times over, the costs to society of
such underenforcement could easily outweigh the costs todefendants of being needlessly arrested and booked, as Atwater herself acknowledges.22Just how easily the costs could outweigh the benefits may
be shown by asking, as one Member of this Court did at oralargument, "how bad the problem is out there." Tr. of Oral
Arg. 20. The very fact that the law has never jelled theway Atwater would have it leads one to wonder whether
warrantless misdemeanor arrests need constitutional atten22 The doctrine of qualified immunity is not the panacea the dissent believes it to be. See post, at 367-368. As the dissent itself rightly acknowledges, even where personal liability does not ultimately materialize,
the mere "specter of liability" may inhibit public officials in the discharge
of their duties, post, at 368, for even those officers with airtight qualified
immunity defenses are forced to incur "the expenses of litigation" and to
endure the "diversion of [their] official energy from pressing public issues,"
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 814 (1982). Further, and somewhat
perversely, the disincentive to arrest produced by Atwater's opaque standard would be most pronounced in the very situations in which police officers can least afford to hesitate: when acting "on the spur (and in the heat)
of the moment," supra, at 347. We could not seriously expect that when
events were unfolding fast, an officer would be able to tell with much
confidence whether a suspect's conduct qualified, or even "reasonably"
qualified, under one of the exceptions to Atwater's general no-arrests rule.

Opinion of the Court
tion, and there is cause to think the answer is no. So faras such arrests might be thought to pose a threat to the

probable-cause requirement, anyone arrested for a crimewithout formal process, whether for felony or misdemeanor,
is entitled to a magistrate's review of probable cause within48 hours,

County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at
55-58, and there is no reason to think the procedure in this
case atypical in giving the suspect a prompt opportunity torequest release, see Tex. Transp. Code Ann. $ 543.002 (1999)

(persons arrested for traffic offenses to be taken "immedi-ately" before a magistrate). Many jurisdictions, moreover,
have chosen to impose more restrictive safeguards through
statutes limiting warrantless arrests for minor offenses.
See, e. g., Ala. Code $ 32-1-4 (1999); Cal. Veh. Code Ann.

$ 40504 (West 2000); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 431.015(1), (2)
(Michie 1999); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 32:391 (West 1989); Md.
Transp. Code Ann. $ 26-202(a)(2) (1999); S. D. Codified Laws

$ 32-33-2 (1998); Tenn. Code Ann. $ 40-7-118(b)(1) (1997); Va.
Code Ann. $ 46.2-936 (Supp. 2000). It is of course easier to
devise a minor-offense limitation by statute than to derive
one through the Constitution, simply because the statute can
let the arrest power turn on any sort of practical consideration without having to subsume it under a broader principle.
It is, in fact, only natural that States should resort to this
sort of legislative regulation, for, as Atwater's own amici
emphasize, it is in the interest of the police to limit pettyoffense arrests, which carry costs that are simply too great
to incur without good reason. See Brief for Institute on
Criminal Justice at the University of Minnesota Law School
and Eleven Leading Experts on Law Enforcement and Corrections Administration and Policy as Amici Curiae 11 (the
use of custodial arrests for minor offenses "[a]ctually [c]ontradicts [l]aw [e]nforcement [i]nterests"). Finally, and significantly, under current doctrine the preference for categorical treatment of Fourth Amendment claims gives way to
individualized review when a defendant makes a colorable

Opinion of the Court
argument that an arrest, with or without a warrant, was
"conducted in an extraordinary manner, unusually harmful
to [his] privacy or even physical interests." Whren v.
United States, 517 U. S., at 818; see also Graham v. Connor,
490 U. S. 386, 395-396 (1989) (excessive force actionable
under $ 1983).

The upshot of all these influences, combined with the good
sense (and, failing that, the political accountability) of most
local lawmakers and law-enforcement officials, is a dearth
of horribles demanding redress. Indeed, when Atwater's
counsel was asked at oral argument for any indications of
comparably foolish, warrantless misdemeanor arrests, he
could offer only one.23 We are sure that there are others,24
but just as surely the country is not confronting anything
like an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests.25
That fact caps the reasons for rejecting Atwater's request

23 He referred to a newspaper account of a girl taken into custody for
eating french fries in a Washington, D. C., subway station. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 20-21; see also Washington Post, Nov. 16, 2000, p. A1 (describing
incident). Not surprisingly, given the practical and political considerations discussed in text, the Washington Metro Transit Police recently revised their "zero-tolerance" policy to provide for citation in lieu of custodial arrest of subway snackers. Washington Post, Feb. 27, 2001, at B1.

24 One of Atwater's amici described a handful in its brief. Brief for

American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8 (reporting
arrests for littering, riding a bicycle without a bell or gong, operating a
business without a license, and "walking as to create a hazard").

25 The dissent insists that a minor traffic infraction "may often serve as

an excuse" for harassment, and that fine-only misdemeanor prohibitions
"may be enforced" in an arbitrary manner. Post, at 372. Thus, the dissent warns, the rule that we recognize today "has potentially serious consequences for the everyday lives of Americans" and "carries with it grave
potential for abuse." Post, at 371, 372. But the dissent's own language
(e. g., "may," "potentially") betrays the speculative nature of its claims.
Noticeably absent from the parade of horribles is any indication that the
"potential for abuse" has ever ripened into a reality. In fact, as we have
pointed out in text, there simply is no evidence of widespread abuse of
minor-offense arrest authority.

Opinion of the Court
for the development of a new and distinct body of constitu-tional law.

Accordingly, we confirm today what our prior cases haveintimated: the standard of probable cause "applie[s] to all arrests, without the need to `balance' the interests and circum-stances involved in particular situations." Dunaway v. New
York, 442 U. S. 200, 208 (1979). If an officer has probablecause to believe that an individual has committed even a very
minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without vio-lating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.

IV
Atwater's arrest satisfied constitutional requirements.There is no dispute that Officer Turek had probable cause to

believe that Atwater had committed a crime in his presence.She admits that neither she nor her children were wearing
seatbelts, as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. $ 545.413(1999). Turek was accordingly authorized (not required, but
authorized) to make a custodial arrest without balancingcosts and benefits or determining whether or not Atwater's
arrest was in some sense necessary.Nor was the arrest made in an "extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical interests."
Whren v. United States, 517 U. S., at 818. As our citationsin

Whren make clear, the question whether a search or sei-zure is "extraordinary" turns, above all else, on the manner

in which the search or seizure is executed. See ibid. (citingTennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985) ("seizure by means
of deadly force"), Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995)("unannounced entry into a home"), Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466
U. S. 740 (1984) ("entry into a home without a warrant"), andWinston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985) ("physical penetration of
the body")). Atwater's arrest was surely "humiliating," asshe says in her brief, but it was no more "harmful to . . .
privacy or . . . physical interests" than the normal custodialarrest. She was handcuffed, placed in a squad car, and

pockets. They then took her photograph and placed her ina cell, alone, for about an hour, after which she was taken
before a magistrate, and released on $310 bond. The arrestand booking were inconvenient and embarrassing to Atwater, but not so extraordinary as to violate the Fourth

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right to be freefrom "unreasonable searches and seizures." The Court recognizes that the arrest of Gail Atwater was a "pointless in-dignity" that served no discernible state interest,

ante, at347, and yet holds that her arrest was constitutionally permissible. Because the Court's position is inconsistent withthe explicit guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, I dissent.

I
A full custodial arrest, such as the one to which Ms. At-water was subjected, is the quintessential seizure. See

Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 585 (1980). When a fullcustodial arrest is effected without a warrant, the plain
language of the Fourth Amendment requires that the arrestbe reasonable. See

ibid. It is beyond cavil that "[t]hetouchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is

always `the reasonableness in all the circumstances of theparticular governmental invasion of a citizen's personal security.' " Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108-109(1977)

United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S.
1, 9 (1977).We have "often looked to the common law in evaluating

the reasonableness, for Fourth Amendment purposes, of police activity." Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985).But history is just one of the tools we use in conducting the

reasonableness inquiry. See id., at 13-19; see also Wilson v.
Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, 929 (1995); Wyoming v. Houghton,
526 U. S. 295, 307 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring). And
when history is inconclusive, as the majority amply demonstrates it is in this case, see ante, at 326-345, we will
"evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards
of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and,
on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests." Wyoming v.
Houghton, supra, at 300. See also, e. g., Skinner v. Railway
Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 619 (1989); Tennessee
v. Garner, supra, at 8; Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 654
(1979); Pennsylvania v. Mimms, supra, at 109. In other
words, in determining reasonableness, "[e]ach case is to be
decided on its own facts and circumstances." Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 357 (1931).

The majority gives a brief nod to this bedrock principle of
our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and even acknowledges that "Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity
and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can
raise against it specific to her case." Ante, at 347. But instead of remedying this imbalance, the majority allows itself
to be swayed by the worry that "every discretionary judgment in the field [will] be converted into an occasion for constitutional review." Ibid. It therefore mints a new rule
that "[i]f an officer has probable cause to believe that an indi532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

vidual has committed even a very minor criminal offense inhis presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender." Ante, at 354. This rule is notonly unsupported by our precedent, but runs contrary to the
principles that lie at the core of the Fourth Amendment.As the majority tacitly acknowledges, we have never considered the precise question presented here, namely, the constitutionality of a warrantless arrest for an offense punish-able only by fine. Cf.

ibid. Indeed, on the rare occasions
that Members of this Court have contemplated such an ar-rest, they have indicated disapproval. See,

e. g., Gustafson
v. Florida, 414 U. S. 260, 266-267 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) ("[A] persuasive claim might have been made . . . that
the custodial arrest of the petitioner for a minor traffic offense violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments. But no such claim has been made"); United
States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 238, n. 2 (1973) (Powell, J.,
concurring) (the validity of a custodial arrest for a minor
traffic offense is not "self-evident").

To be sure, we have held that the existence of probable
cause is a necessary condition for an arrest. See Dunaway
v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 213-214 (1979). And in the case
of felonies punishable by a term of imprisonment, we have
held that the existence of probable cause is also a sufficient
condition for an arrest. See United States v. Watson, 423
U. S. 411, 416-417 (1976). In Watson, however, there was a
clear and consistently applied common law rule permitting
warrantless felony arrests. See id., at 417-422. Accordingly, our inquiry ended there and we had no need to assess
the reasonableness of such arrests by weighing individual
liberty interests against state interests. Cf. Wyoming v.
Houghton, supra, at 299-300; Tennessee v. Garner, supra, at
26 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (criticizing majority for disregarding undisputed common law rule).

Here, however, we have no such luxury. The Court's thorough exegesis makes it abundantly clear that warrantless

363Cite as: 532 U. S. 318 (2001)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
misdemeanor arrests were not the subject of a clear and con-sistently applied rule at common law. See,

e. g., ante, at 332
(finding "disagreement, not unanimity, among both thecommon-law jurists and the text writers");

ante, at 335 (acknowledging that certain early English statutes serve onlyto "riddle Atwater's supposed common-law rule with enough

exceptions to unsettle any contention [that there was a clear
common-law rule barring warrantless arrests for misde-meanors that were not breaches of the peace]"). We therefore must engage in the balancing test required by theFourth Amendment. See

Wyoming v. Houghton, supra, at
299-300. While probable cause is surely a necessary condition for warrantless arrests for fine-only offenses, see Dunaway v. New York, supra, at 213-214, any realistic assessment
of the interests implicated by such arrests demonstrates that
probable cause alone is not a sufficient condition. See infra,
at 364-366.

Our decision in Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806
(1996), is not to the contrary. The specific question presented there was whether, in evaluating the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of a traffic stop, the subjective intent
of the police officer is a relevant consideration. Id., at 808,
814. We held that it is not, and stated that "[t]he making of
a traffic stop . . . is governed by the usual rule that probable
cause to believe the law has been broken `outbalances' private interest in avoiding police contact." Id., at 818.

We of course did not have occasion in Whren to consider
the constitutional preconditions for warrantless arrests for
fine-only offenses. Nor should our words be taken beyond
their context. There are significant qualitative differences
between a traffic stop and a full custodial arrest. While
both are seizures that fall within the ambit of the Fourth
Amendment, the latter entails a much greater intrusion on
an individual's liberty and privacy interests. As we have
said, "[a] motorist's expectations, when he sees a policeman's
light flashing behind him, are that he will be obliged to spend

a short period of time answering questions and waiting while
the officer checks his license and registration, that he may
be given a citation, but that in the end he most likely will be
allowed to continue on his way." Berkemer v. McCarty, 468
U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, when there is probable cause to
believe that a person has violated a minor traffic law, there
can be little question that the state interest in law enforcement will justify the relatively limited intrusion of a traffic
stop. It is by no means certain, however, that where the
offense is punishable only by fine, "probable cause to believe
the law has been broken [will] `outbalanc[e]' private interest
in avoiding" a full custodial arrest. Whren v. United States,
supra, at 818. Justifying a full arrest by the same quantum
of evidence that justifies a traffic stop--even though the offender cannot ultimately be imprisoned for her conduct--defies any sense of proportionality and is in serious tension
with the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable
seizures.

A custodial arrest exacts an obvious toll on an individual's
liberty and privacy, even when the period of custody is relatively brief. The arrestee is subject to a full search of her
person and confiscation of her possessions. United States v.
Robinson, supra. If the arrestee is the occupant of a car,
the entire passenger compartment of the car, including packages therein, is subject to search as well. See New York v.
Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981). The arrestee may be detained
for up to 48 hours without having a magistrate determine
whether there in fact was probable cause for the arrest.
See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991).
Because people arrested for all types of violent and nonviolent offenses may be housed together awaiting such review,
this detention period is potentially dangerous. Rosazza &
Cook, Jail Intake: Managing A Critical Function--Part One:
Resources, 13 American Jails 35 (Mar. /Apr. 1999). And once
the period of custody is over, the fact of the arrest is a per532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., dissenting
manent part of the public record. Cf. Paul v. Davis, 424U. S. 693 (1976).

We have said that "the penalty that may attach to anyparticular offense seems to provide the clearest and most
consistent indication of the State's interest in arresting indi-viduals suspected of committing that offense."

Welsh v.
Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 754, n. 14 (1984). If the State has
decided that a fine, and not imprisonment, is the appropriatepunishment for an offense, the State's interest in taking a

person suspected of committing that offense into custody issurely limited, at best. This is not to say that the State will
never have such an interest. A full custodial arrest may on
occasion vindicate legitimate state interests, even if the
crime is punishable only by fine. Arrest is the surest way
to abate criminal conduct. It may also allow the police to
verify the offender's identity and, if the offender poses a
flight risk, to ensure her appearance at trial. But when such
considerations are not present, a citation or summons may
serve the State's remaining law enforcement interests every
bit as effectively as an arrest. Cf. Lodging for State of
Texas et al. as Amici Curiae (Texas Department of Public
Safety, Student Handout, Traffic Law Enforcement 1 (1999))
("Citations. . . . Definition--a means of getting violators to
court without physical arrest. A citation should be used
when it will serve this purpose except when by issuing a
citation and releasing the violator, the safety of the public
and/or the violator might be imperiled as in the case of
D. W. I.").

Because a full custodial arrest is such a severe intrusion
on an individual's liberty, its reasonableness hinges on "the
degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate
governmental interests." Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S.,
at 300. In light of the availability of citations to promote a
State's interests when a fine-only offense has been committed, I cannot concur in a rule which deems a full custodial
arrest to be reasonable in every circumstance. Giving police

O'Connor, J., dissenting
officers constitutional carte blanche to effect an arrest when-ever there is probable cause to believe a fine-only misdemeanor has been committed is irreconcilable with the FourthAmendment's command that seizures be reasonable. Instead, I would require that when there is probable cause tobelieve that a fine-only offense has been committed, the police officer should issue a citation unless the officer is "able
to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken to-gether with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably

warrant [the additional] intrusion" of a full custodial arrest.
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S., at 21.

The majority insists that a bright-line rule focused on
probable cause is necessary to vindicate the State's interest
in easily administrable law enforcement rules. See ante, at
347-351. Probable cause itself, however, is not a model of
precision. "The quantum of information which constitutes
probable cause--evidence which would `warrant a man of
reasonable caution in the belief ' that a [crime] has been committed--must be measured by the facts of the particular
case." Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 479 (1963)
(citation omitted). The rule I propose--which merely requires a legitimate reason for the decision to escalate the
seizure into a full custodial arrest--thus does not undermine
an otherwise "clear and simple" rule. Cf. ante, at 347.

While clarity is certainly a value worthy of consideration
in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, it by no means
trumps the values of liberty and privacy at the heart of the
Amendment's protections. What the Terry rule lacks in
precision it makes up for in fidelity to the Fourth Amendment's command of reasonableness and sensitivity to the
competing values protected by that Amendment. Over the
past 30 years, it appears that the Terry rule has been workable and easily applied by officers on the street.

At bottom, the majority offers two related reasons why a
bright-line rule is necessary: the fear that officers who arrest
for fine-only offenses will be subject to "personal [42 U. S. C.]

O'Connor, J., dissenting

$ 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutionalstandard,"

ante, at 350, and the resulting "systematic disincentive to arrest . . . where . . . arresting would serve animportant societal interest,"

ante, at 351. These concerns
are certainly valid, but they are more than adequately re-solved by the doctrine of qualified immunity.

Qualified immunity was created to shield government officials from civil liability for the performance of discretionaryfunctions so long as their conduct does not violate clearly

established statutory or constitutional rights of which a rea-sonable person would have known. See

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). This doctrine is "the best
attainable accommodation of competing values," namely, the
obligation to enforce constitutional guarantees and the need
to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion. Id., at 814.

In Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635 (1987), we made
clear that the standard of reasonableness for a search or
seizure under the Fourth Amendment is distinct from the
standard of reasonableness for qualified immunity purposes.
Id., at 641. If a law enforcement officer "reasonably but mistakenly conclude[s]" that the constitutional predicate for a
search or seizure is present, he "should not be held personally liable." Ibid.

This doctrine thus allays any concerns about liability or
disincentives to arrest. If, for example, an officer reasonably thinks that a suspect poses a flight risk or might be a
danger to the community if released, cf. ante, at 351, he may
arrest without fear of the legal consequences. Similarly, if
an officer reasonably concludes that a suspect may possess
more than four ounces of marijuana and thus might be guilty
of a felony, cf. ante, at 348-349, and n. 19, 351, the officer will
be insulated from liability for arresting the suspect even if
the initial assessment turns out to be factually incorrect.
As we have said, "officials will not be liable for mere mistakes in judgment." Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 507

(1978). Of course, even the specter of liability can entailsubstantial social costs, such as inhibiting public officials in

the discharge of their duties. See, e. g., Harlow v. Fitzger-ald, supra, at 814. We may not ignore the central command
of the Fourth Amendment, however, to avoid these costs.

II
The record in this case makes it abundantly clear that Ms.Atwater's arrest was constitutionally unreasonable. Atwater readily admits--as she did when Officer Turek pulledher over--that she violated Texas' seatbelt law. Brief for
Petitioners 2-3; Record 381, 384. While Turek was justifiedin stopping Atwater, see Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.,
at 819, neither law nor reason supports his decision to arresther instead of simply giving her a citation. The officer's actions cannot sensibly be viewed as a permissible means ofbalancing Atwater's Fourth Amendment interests with the
State's own legitimate interests.There is no question that Officer Turek's actions severely
infringed Atwater's liberty and privacy. Turek was loudand accusatory from the moment he approached Atwater's
car. Atwater's young children were terrified and hysterical.Yet when Atwater asked Turek to lower his voice because
he was scaring the children, he responded by jabbing hisfinger in Atwater's face and saying, "You're going to jail."
Record 382, 384. Having made the decision to arrest, Turekdid not inform Atwater of her right to remain silent.

Id., at390, 704. He instead asked for her license and insurance

information. Id., at 382. But cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384U. S. 436 (1966).

Atwater asked if she could at least take her children toa friend's house down the street before going to the police
station. Record 384. But Turek--who had just castigatedAtwater for not caring for her children--refused and said
he would take the children into custody as well. Id., at384, 427, 704-705. Only the intervention of neighborhood

O'Connor, J., dissenting
children who had witnessed the scene and summoned one ofAtwater's friends saved the children from being hauled to

jail with their mother. Id., at 382, 385-386.With the children gone, Officer Turek handcuffed Ms. Atwater with her hands behind her back, placed her in the po-lice car, and drove her to the police station.

Id., at 386-387.
Ironically, Turek did not secure Atwater in a seatbelt for the
drive. Id., at 386. At the station, Atwater was forced toremove her shoes, relinquish her possessions, and wait in a

holding cell for about an hour. Id., at 387, 706. A judgefinally informed Atwater of her rights and the charges
against her, and released her when she posted bond. Id., at
387-388, 706. Atwater returned to the scene of the arrest,
only to find that her car had been towed. Id., at 389.

Ms. Atwater ultimately pleaded no contest to violating the
seatbelt law and was fined $50. Id., at 403. Even though
that fine was the maximum penalty for her crime, Tex.
Transp. Code Ann. $ 545.413(d) (1999), and even though Officer Turek has never articulated any justification for his
actions, the city contends that arresting Atwater was constitutionally reasonable because it advanced two legitimate interests: "the enforcement of child safety laws and encouraging [Atwater] to appear for trial." Brief for Respondents 15.

It is difficult to see how arresting Atwater served either
of these goals any more effectively than the issuance of a
citation. With respect to the goal of law enforcement generally, Atwater did not pose a great danger to the community.
She had been driving very slowly--approximately 15 miles
per hour--in broad daylight on a residential street that had
no other traffic. Record 380. Nor was she a repeat offender; until that day, she had received one traffic citation in
her life--a ticket, more than 10 years earlier, for failure to
signal a lane change. Id., at 378. Although Officer Turek
had stopped Atwater approximately three months earlier because he thought that Atwater's son was not wearing a seatbelt, id., at 420, Turek had been mistaken, id., at 379, 703.

532US1 Unit: $U44 [09-19-02 20:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
370 ATWATER v. LAGO VISTA

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Moreover, Atwater immediately accepted responsibility andapologized for her conduct.

Id., at 381, 384, 420. Thus,
there was every indication that Atwater would have buckledherself and her children in had she been cited and allowed

to leave.With respect to the related goal of child welfare, the decision to arrest Atwater was nothing short of counterproductive. Atwater's children witnessed Officer Turek yell attheir mother and threaten to take them all into custody. Ultimately, they were forced to leave her behind with Turek,knowing that she was being taken to jail. Understandably,
the 3-year-old boy was "very, very, very traumatized." Id.,
at 393. After the incident, he had to see a child psychologist
regularly, who reported that the boy "felt very guilty that
he couldn't stop this horrible thing . . . he was powerless to
help his mother or sister." Id., at 396. Both of Atwater's
children are now terrified at the sight of any police car. Id.,
at 393, 395. According to Atwater, the arrest "just never
leaves us. It's a conversation we have every other day, once
a week, and it's--it raises its head constantly in our lives."
Id., at 395.

Citing Atwater surely would have served the children's
interests well. It would have taught Atwater to ensure that
her children were buckled up in the future. It also would
have taught the children an important lesson in accepting
responsibility and obeying the law. Arresting Atwater,
though, taught the children an entirely different lesson: that
"the bad person could just as easily be the policeman as it
could be the most horrible person they could imagine."
Ibid.

Respondents also contend that the arrest was necessary to
ensure Atwater's appearance in court. Atwater, however,
was far from a flight risk. A 16-year resident of Lago Vista,
population 2,486, Atwater was not likely to abscond. See
Record 376; Texas State Data Center, 1997 Total Population
Estimates for Texas Places 15 (Sept. 1998). Although she

O'Connor, J., dissenting
was unable to produce her driver's license because it hadbeen stolen, she gave Officer Turek her license number and

address. Record 386. In addition, Officer Turek knewfrom their previous encounter that Atwater was a local
resident.The city's justifications fall far short of rationalizing the
extraordinary intrusion on Gail Atwater and her children.Measuring "the degree to which [Atwater's custodial arrest
was] needed for the promotion of legitimate governmentalinterests," against "the degree to which it intrud[ed] upon
[her] privacy," Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S., at 300, itcan hardly be doubted that Turek's actions were disproportionate to Atwater's crime. The majority's assessment that"Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity and confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raiseagainst it specific to her case,"

ante, at 347, is quite correct.In my view, the Fourth Amendment inquiry ends there.

III
The Court's error, however, does not merely affect the dis-position of this case. The per se rule that the Court creates

has potentially serious consequences for the everyday livesof Americans. A broad range of conduct falls into the category of fine-only misdemeanors. In Texas alone, for exam-ple, disobeying any sort of traffic warning sign is a misdemeanor punishable only by fine, see Tex. Transp. Code Ann.$ 472.022 (1999 and Supp. 2000-2001), as is failing to pay a
highway toll, see $ 284.070, and driving with expired licenseplates, see $ 502.407. Nor are fine-only crimes limited to the
traffic context. In several States, for example, littering is acriminal offense punishable only by fine. See,

e. g., Cal.Penal Code Ann. $ 374.7 (West 1999); Ga. Code Ann. $ 16-

7-43 (1996); Iowa Code $$ 321.369, 805.8(2)(af ) (Supp. 2001).To be sure, such laws are valid and wise exercises of the
States' power to protect the public health and welfare. Myconcern lies not with the decision to enact or enforce these

O'Connor, J., dissenting
laws, but rather with the manner in which they may be en-forced. Under today's holding, when a police officer has

probable cause to believe that a fine-only misdemeanor of-fense has occurred, that officer may stop the suspect, issue a
citation, and let the person continue on her way. Cf. Whrenv.

United States, 517 U. S., at 806. Or, if a traffic violation,
the officer may stop the car, arrest the driver, see ante, at
354, search the driver, see United States v. Robinson, 414U. S., at 235, search the entire passenger compartment of the

car including any purse or package inside, see New York v.
Belton, 453 U. S., at 460, and impound the car and inventory
all of its contents, see Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U. S. 367, 374
(1987); Florida v. Wells, 495 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1990). Although
the Fourth Amendment expressly requires that the latter
course be a reasonable and proportional response to the circumstances of the offense, the majority gives officers unfettered discretion to choose that course without articulating a
single reason why such action is appropriate.

Such unbounded discretion carries with it grave potential
for abuse. The majority takes comfort in the lack of evidence of "an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests."
Ante, at 353, and n. 25. But the relatively small number of
published cases dealing with such arrests proves little and
should provide little solace. Indeed, as the recent debate
over racial profiling demonstrates all too clearly, a relatively
minor traffic infraction may often serve as an excuse for
stopping and harassing an individual. After today, the arsenal available to any officer extends to a full arrest and the
searches permissible concomitant to that arrest. An officer's subjective motivations for making a traffic stop are not
relevant considerations in determining the reasonableness of
the stop. See Whren v. United States, supra, at 813. But
it is precisely because these motivations are beyond our purview that we must vigilantly ensure that officers' poststop
actions--which are properly within our reach--comport with
the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of reasonableness.

violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1), and his sentence was enhanced under
the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e),
which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on anyone who violates

$ 922(g)(1) and has three previous convictions for, inter alia, a violent
felony. Petitioner had four such prior state convictions. After an unsuccessful direct appeal, petitioner filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or
correct his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2255. He asserted
that his sentence violated the Constitution because it was based in part
on two prior convictions that were themselves unconstitutional. Both
prior convictions, he claimed, were based on inadequate guilty pleas and
one was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. The District
Court denied the motion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
195 F. 3d 501, affirmed.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court in part, concluding that petitioner, having failed to pursue remedies that were otherwise available to him to challenge his prior convictions while he was
in custody on those convictions, may not now use a $ 2255 motion directed at his federal sentence to collaterally attack those convictions.
Pp. 378-383, 384.

(a) In Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485, 490-497, this Court held
that with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the
right to counsel, a defendant has no right under the ACCA or the Constitution to collaterally attack prior convictions at his federal sentencing
proceeding. The considerations supporting that conclusion--ease of administration and the interest in promoting the finality of judgments--
are also present in the $ 2255 context. A district court evaluating a

$ 2255 motion is as unlikely as a district court engaged in sentencing
to have the documents necessary to evaluate claims arising from longpast proceedings in a different jurisdiction. Moreover, States retain a
strong interest in preserving convictions they have obtained, as they
impose a wide range of disabilities on those who have been convicted,
even after their release. Pp. 378-380.

Syllabus
(b) Although defendants may challenge their convictions for constitutional infirmity, it does not necessarily follow that a $ 2255 motion is an
appropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used to
enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained. A defendant convicted in state court has numerous opportunities to challenge the
constitutionality of that conviction, but those vehicles for review are not
available indefinitely and without limitation. Procedural barriers limit
access to review on the merits of constitutional claims, vindicating the
presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments, even when
the question is waiver of constitutional rights. Parke v. Raley, 506
U. S. 20, 29. Thus, if, by the time of sentencing under the ACCA, a
prior conviction has not been set aside on direct or collateral review, it
is presumptively valid and may be used to enhance the federal sentence,
with the exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to
counsel. Custis, supra, at 496-497. After an enhanced federal sentence has been imposed under the ACCA, the person sentenced may
pursue any channels of direct or collateral review still available to challenge his prior conviction. If, however, a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to attack in its own right
because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were
available (or because he did so unsuccessfully), then he is without recourse. The defendant may not collaterally attack his prior conviction
through a motion under $ 2255, unless he claims that conviction was
obtained in violation of the right to counsel and he raised that claim at
his federal sentencing proceeding. A contrary rule would effectively
permit challenges far too stale to be brought in their own right, and
sanction an end run around statutes of limitation and other procedural
barriers that would preclude the movant from attacking the prior conviction directly. Nothing in the Constitution or this Court's precedent
requires such a result. Pp. 380-383.

O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in part, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia,

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court inpart.
In Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we ad-dressed whether a defendant sentenced under the Armed
Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e),could collaterally attack the validity of previous state convictions used to enhance his federal sentence. We held that,with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation
of the right to counsel, a defendant has no right to bring sucha challenge in his federal sentencing proceeding. 511 U. S.,
at 487. We now consider whether, after the sentencing pro-ceeding has concluded, the individual who was sentenced
may challenge his federal sentence through a motion under28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) on the ground that his
prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained. We holdthat, as a general rule, he may not. There may be rare circumstances in which $ 2255 would be available, but we neednot address the issue here.

I
In 1994, petitioner Earthy D. Daniels, Jr., was tried andconvicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). The Government then soughtto enhance his sentence under the ACCA. App. 4-5. The
ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence onanyone who violates $ 922(g)(1) and who has three previous
convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.$ 924(e)(1). Petitioner had been convicted in California in
1978 and 1981 for robbery, and in 1977 and 1979 for firstdegree burglary.

Id., at 14. The District Court found petitioner to be an armed career criminal within the meaning of

Opinion of the Court
the ACCA and, after granting a downward departure, theDistrict Court sentenced petitioner to 176 months.

Id., at
14, 18. Had petitioner not been adjudged an armed careercriminal, he would have received at most a 120-month sentence. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(2). On direct appeal, petitionerargued unsuccessfully that his two burglary convictions did
not qualify as predicate offenses under the ACCA. See 86
F. 3d 1164 (CA9 1996) (table).Petitioner then filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 in the UnitedStates District Court for the Central District of California.
Section 2255, a postconviction remedy for federal prisoners,
permits "[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal]
court" to "move the court which imposed the sentence to
vacate, set aside or correct the sentence" upon the ground
that "the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States." Petitioner asserted that
his current federal sentence was imposed in violation of the
Constitution because it was based in part on his 1978 and
1981 robbery convictions. Those prior convictions, he alleged, were themselves unconstitutional because they both
were based on guilty pleas that were not knowing and voluntary, and because the 1981 conviction was also the product
of ineffective assistance of counsel. App. 51-52. He did
not contend that $ 2255 relief was appropriate because his
current sentence was imposed in violation of the ACCA.
Cf. Brief for Petitioner 13.

The District Court denied the $ 2255 motion, App. 58-67,
and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,
195 F. 3d 501 (1999). The court held that our decision in
Custis "bar[s] federal habeas review of the validity of a prior
conviction used for federal sentencing enhancement unless
the petitioner raises a . . . claim [under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)]." 195 F. 3d, at 503 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the Courts
of Appeals are divided as to whether Custis bars relief under

Opinion of the Court

$ 2255 as well as in federal sentencing proceedings, wegranted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1299 (2000).

II
The petitioner in Custis attempted, during his federal sen-tencing proceeding, to attack prior state convictions used to

enhance his sentence under the ACCA. Like petitionerhere, Custis challenged his prior convictions as the product
of allegedly faulty guilty pleas and ineffective assistance ofcounsel. 511 U. S., at 488. We held that with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right tocounsel, Custis had no right under the ACCA or the Constitution "to collaterally attack prior convictions" in the courseof his federal sentencing proceeding.

Id., at 490-497.While the "failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect" that justified theexception for challenges concerning Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335 (1963), 511 U. S., at 496, challenges of the typeCustis sought to bring did not "ris[e] to the level of a jurisdictional defect," ibid.Two considerations supported our constitutional conclusion in Custis: ease of administration and the interest inpromoting the finality of judgments. With respect to the
former, we noted that resolving non-Gideon-type constitu-tional attacks on prior convictions "would require sentencing
courts to rummage through frequently nonexistent or diffi-cult to obtain state-court transcripts or records." 511 U. S.,
at 496. With respect to the latter, we observed that allow-ing collateral attacks would "inevitably delay and impair the
orderly administration of justice" and "deprive the state-court judgment of its normal force and effect."

Id., at 497(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

A
Petitioner contends that the Custis rule should not extendto $ 2255 proceedings because the concerns we articulated

379Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
in Custis are not present in the $ 2255 context. Brief forPetitioner 22-26. We disagree. First, a district court

evaluating a $ 2255 motion is as unlikely as a district courtengaged in sentencing to have the documents necessary to
evaluate claims arising from long-past proceedings in a dif-ferent jurisdiction. While petitioner is quite right that federal district courts are capable of evaluating fact-intensive
constitutional claims raised by way of a habeas petition, id.,at 22-23, institutional competence does not make decades-old

state court records and transcripts any easier to locate.The facts of this case only reinforce our concern. For example, petitioner contends that he entered his 1978 and 1981
guilty pleas without a full understanding of the essential elements of the crimes with which he was charged, and therefore the resulting convictions violated due process. App.
40-42, 50-51. These claims by their nature require close
scrutiny of the record below. Yet petitioner has not placed
the transcript from either plea colloquy in the record. In
fact, he has admitted that the 1978 transcript is missing from
the state court file. Cf. id., at 38, n. 3. Under these circumstances, it would be an almost futile exercise for a district
court to attempt to determine accurately what was communicated to petitioner more than two decades ago.

With respect to the concern for finality, petitioner argues
that because he has served the complete sentences for his
1978 and 1981 convictions, the State would suffer little, if
any, prejudice if those convictions were invalidated through
a collateral challenge under $ 2255. Brief for Petitioner 24-
26. To the contrary, even after a defendant has served the
full measure of his sentence, a State retains a strong interest
in preserving the convictions it has obtained. States impose
a wide range of disabilities on those who have been convicted
of crimes, even after their release. For example, in California, where petitioner committed his crimes, persons convicted of a felony may be disqualified from holding public
office, subjected to restrictions on professional licensing, and

Opinion of the Court
barred from possessing firearms. See U. S. Dept. of Justice,Office of the Pardon Attorney, Civil Disabilities of Convicted

Felons: A State-By-State Survey 29-32 (Oct. 1996). Fur-ther, each of the 50 States has a statute authorizing enhanced
sentences for recidivist offenders. E. g., Cal. Penal CodeAnn. $ 667 (West 1999). See also Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.
20, 26-27 (1992).At oral argument, petitioner suggested that invalidating a
prior conviction on constitutional grounds for purposes of itsuse under the ACCA would have no effect beyond the federal
proceeding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-10. Although that questionis not squarely presented here, if a state conviction were
determined to be sufficiently unreliable that it could not beused to enhance a federal sentence, the State's ability to use
that judgment subsequently for its own purposes would be,at the very least, greatly undermined. Thus, the State does
have a real and continuing interest in the integrity of itsjudgments.

B
On the most fundamental level, petitioner attempts to dis-tinguish Custis as a decision only about the appropriate

forum in which a defendant may challenge prior convictionsused to enhance a federal sentence. The issue in Custis, according to petitioner, was " `where, not whether, the defend-ant could attack a prior conviction for constitutional infirmity.' " Brief for Petitioner 14 (quoting Nichols v. United
States, 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)(original emphasis deleted)). The appropriate forum for

such a challenge, petitioner argues, at least where no otherforum is available, is a federal proceeding under $ 2255.
Brief for Petitioner 16.The premise underlying petitioner's argument--that defendants may challenge their convictions for constitutionalinfirmity--is quite correct. It is beyond dispute that convictions must be obtained in a manner that comports with theFederal Constitution. But it does not necessarily follow

Opinion of the Court
that a $ 2255 motion is an appropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained.

Our system affords a defendant convicted in state court
numerous opportunities to challenge the constitutionality of
his conviction. He may raise constitutional claims on direct
appeal, in postconviction proceedings available under state
law, and in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). See
generally 1 J. Liebman & R. Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus
Practice and Procedure $ 5.1.a (3d ed. 1998).1 These vehicles
for review, however, are not available indefinitely and without limitation. Procedural barriers, such as statutes of
limitations and rules concerning procedural default and exhaustion of remedies, operate to limit access to review on
the merits of a constitutional claim. See, e. g., United States
v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731 (1993) (" `No procedural principle
is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional
right . . . may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases
by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a
tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it' " (quoting Yakus
v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). One of the principles vindicated by these limitations is a "presumption
deeply rooted in our jurisprudence: the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments, even when the question is waiver of constitutional rights." Parke, supra, at 29.

1 Justice Souter is concerned that a defendant may forgo "direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and . . .
collateral attack because he had no counsel to speak for him." Post, at
391 (dissenting opinion). Whatever incentives may exist at the time of
conviction, the fact remains that avenues of redress are generally available
if sought in a timely manner. If a person chooses not to pursue those
remedies, he does so with the knowledge that the conviction will stay on
his record. This knowledge should serve as an incentive not to commit a
subsequent crime and risk having the sentence for that crime enhanced
under a recidivist sentencing statute.

382 DANIELS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Thus, we have held that if, by the time of sentencing underthe ACCA, a prior conviction has not been set aside on direct

or collateral review, that conviction is presumptively validand may be used to enhance the federal sentence. See

Custis, 511 U. S., at 497. This rule is subject to only one excep-tion: If an enhanced federal sentence will be based in part

on a prior conviction obtained in violation of the right to
counsel, the defendant may challenge the validity of his priorconviction during his federal sentencing proceedings.

Id.,
at 496. No other constitutional challenge to a prior convic-tion may be raised in the sentencing forum.

Id., at 497.
After an enhanced federal sentence has been imposed pursuant to the ACCA, the person sentenced may pursue any
channels of direct or collateral review still available to challenge his prior conviction. In Custis, we noted the possibility that the petitioner there, who was still in custody on his
prior convictions, could "attack his state sentences [in state
court] or through federal habeas review." Ibid. If any
such challenge to the underlying conviction is successful, the
defendant may then apply for reopening of his federal sentence. As in Custis, we express no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an application. Cf. ibid.

If, however, a prior conviction used to enhance a federal
sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in
its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those
remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant is without
recourse. The presumption of validity that attached to the
prior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive, and
the defendant may not collaterally attack his prior conviction
through a motion under $ 2255. A defendant may challenge
a prior conviction as the product of a Gideon violation in a

$ 2255 motion, but generally only if he raised that claim at
his federal sentencing proceeding. See United States v.
Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 167-168 (1982) (holding that procedural
default rules developed in the habeas corpus context apply

532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

383Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
in $ 2255 cases); see also Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339, 354-355 (1994).

Justice Souter says that our holding here "rul[es] outthe application of $ 2255 when the choice is relief under $ 2255
or no relief at all." Post, at 390 (dissenting opinion). Thisall-or-nothing characterization of the problem misses the
point. As we have said, a defendant generally has ampleopportunity to obtain constitutional review of a state conviction. Supra, at 381. But once the "door" to such review"has been closed,"

post, at 388, by the defendant himself--either because he failed to pursue otherwise available remedies or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation--the conviction becomes final and the defendant is not entitled
to another bite at the apple simply because that convictionis later used to enhance another sentence.

To be sure, the text of $ 2255 is broad enough to cover aclaim that an enhanced federal sentence violates due process.
See ibid. See also n. 2, infra. But when such a due processclaim is predicated on the consideration at sentencing of a
fully expired prior conviction, we think that the goals of easyadministration and finality have ample "horsepower" to justify foreclosing relief under $ 2255. Were we to allow de-fendants sentenced under the ACCA to collaterally attack
prior convictions through a $ 2255 motion, we would effec-tively permit challenges far too stale to be brought in their
own right, and sanction an end run around statutes of limita-tions and other procedural barriers that would preclude the
movant from attacking the prior conviction directly. Noth-ing in the Constitution or our precedent requires such a
result. C

We recognize that there may be rare cases in which nochannel of review was actually available to a defendant with
respect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own. Thecircumstances of this case do not require us to determine
whether a defendant could use a motion under $ 2255 to chal532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
384 DANIELS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
lenge a federal sentence based on such a conviction.2 Cf.,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing a second

or successive $ 2255 motion if there is "newly discovered evi-dence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as
a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convinc-ing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found
the movant guilty of the offense"); ibid. (tolling 1-year limita-tion period while movant is prevented from making a $ 2255
motion by an "impediment . . . created by governmental ac-tion in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
States"). III

No such claim is made here. The sole basis on which peti-tioner Daniels challenges his current federal sentence is that
two of his prior state convictions were the products of in-adequate guilty pleas and ineffective assistance of counsel.
Petitioner could have pursued his claims while he was in cus-tody on those convictions. As his counsel conceded at oral
argument, there is no indication that petitioner did so or thathe was prevented from doing so by some external force.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 6.Petitioner's federal sentence was properly enhanced pursuant to the ACCA based on his four facially valid prior stateconvictions. Because petitioner failed to pursue remedies
that were otherwise available to him to challenge his 1978and 1981 convictions, he may not now use a $ 2255 motion to
collaterally attack those convictions. The judgment of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
therefore affirmed. It is so ordered.

2 After comparing the text of $$ 2254 and 2255, Justice Scalia concludes that "Congress did not expect challenges to state convictions (used
to enhance federal convictions) to be brought under $ 2255." Post, at 386
(opinion concurring in part). This is, of course, true. But it is also beside
the point, as the subject of the $ 2255 motion in this circumstance is the
enhanced federal sentence, not the prior state conviction.

Scalia, J., concurring in part
Justice Scalia, concurring in part.
I agree with the Court that 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.,Supp. V) does not (with the

Gideon exception, see Gideonv. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)) permit inquiry into

whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentencewas unconstitutionally obtained, and I agree with the Court's
reasoning so far as it goes. I have another reason for reach-ing that result, however, and one that prevents me from joining that portion of the Court's opinion which speculates that"[t]here may be rare circumstances in which $ 2255 would be
available," such as when "no channel of review was actuallyavailable to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction,
due to no fault of his own," ante, at 376, 383. Simply put,"the text of $ 2255 is"

not "broad enough to cover a claim thatan enhanced federal sentence violates due process," ante, at

383, if the enhancement is based on prior convictions.In addition to the practical reasons

Justice O'Connoridentifies as counseling against petitioner's interpretation of

$ 2255, there stands the very text of that provision. "[W]ehave long recognized that `the power to award the writ [of
habeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States,must be given by written law,' " Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.
651, 664 (1996), quoting Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94(1807). Section 2255 authorizes a challenge by "[a] prisoner
in custody under sentence of a court established by Act ofCongress claiming the right to be released upon the ground
that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitu-tion or laws of the United States." (Emphases added.) We
have already determined, in Custis v. United States, 511U. S. 485 (1994), that a sentencing court does not violate the
Due Process Clause by imposing a sentence enhanced byprior, purportedly tainted, convictions, unless the taint is the
result of a Gideon violation.* It follows ineluctably that

*Justice Souter asserts that Custis "merely held (with [the] exception
[of Gideon violations]) that neither the ACCA nor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying

386 DANIELS v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., concurring in part

$ 2255 does not establish any right to challenge federal sentences based on their enhancement by stale, non-Gideontainted, convictions.

This conclusion is reinforced (if reinforcement is possible)
by comparing the text of $ 2255 with that of $ 2254. The
latter, governing habeas challenges to state convictions, provides that "[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel
during Federal or State collateral postconviction proceedings
shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under

$ 2254." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V). There is
no conceivable reason why this bar would be placed upon
challenges to state convictions under $ 2254, but not upon
challenges to state convictions under $ 2255. Congress did
not expect challenges to state convictions (used to enhance
federal convictions) to be brought under $ 2255.

Perhaps precepts of fundamental fairness inherent in "due
process" suggest that a forum to litigate challenges like petitioner's must be made available somewhere for the odd case
in which the challenge could not have been brought earlier.
But it would not follow from this that federal sentencing
must provide the remedy; much less that federal sentencing
need not provide the remedy but $ 2255 (which is entirely
dependent upon the impropriety of prior federal sentencing)

conviction." Post, at 388, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). But the Constitution
would "provide a forum" at the sentencing hearing if it were unconstitutional to sentence on the basis of invalid but nonetheless outstanding prior
convictions. (Assuredly the Constitution does not permit unconstitutional acts.) Custis necessarily held, therefore, that it is not unconstitutional (with the Gideon exception) to sentence on the basis of invalid but
nonetheless outstanding prior convictions. Justice Souter apparently
understood this at the time Custis was decided. His dissent began: "The
Court answers a difficult constitutional question that I believe the underlying statute does not pose," 511 U. S., at 498, which question turns out
to be "whether the Constitution permits courts to enhance a defendant's
sentence on the basis of a prior conviction the defendant can show was
obtained in violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel," id.,
at 505.

Souter, J., dissenting
must do so. Fundamental fairness could be achieved just aswell--indeed, better--by holding that the rendering jurisdiction must provide a means for challenge when enhancementis threatened or has been imposed. Such a constitutional
rule, combined with a rule that any sentence already im-posed must be adjusted accordingly, would prevent sentencing hearings from being routinely complicated by inquiries
into prior convictions, and would locate those inquirieswhere they can best be conducted: in the rendering jurisdiction. It would also avoid a possible gap in protection thatwould result from using $ 2255 (and in state-court cases,

$ 2254) for this inappropriate purpose--arising from the factthat, as discussed above, $ 2254

cannot be used to remedy
ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. (We have
left open the question whether such ineffective assistance
can establish a constitutional violation, see Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 755 (1991).) But $ 2255 cannot possibly be the means of relief.

For these reasons, I join the opinion of the Court only
in part.

Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we held
that a federal defendant facing an enhanced sentence on the
basis of prior state convictions under the Armed Career
Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e), could not,
with one exception, challenge the constitutionality of the underlying state convictions at his federal sentencing proceeding. Custis was thus a precursor of the case before us now;
Custis is not, however, compelling authority for today's disposition. Although the Court's opinion in Custis struck me
as portending more than it strictly held, a reading of the case
free of portent was in fact the understanding of one Member
of the Custis majority: "Custis presented a forum question.
The issue was where, not whether, the defendant could attack

a prior conviction for constitutional infirmity." Nichols v.United States, 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (

Ginsburg, J., dis-senting) (emphasis in original). The door in

Custis re-mained open to an attack on the prior state convictions,

through a state or federal habeas challenge to the underlyingconvictions themselves. See

Custis, supra, at 497 (Custis
"was still `in custody' for purposes of his state convictions at
the time of his federal sentencing under $ 924(e)," and couldthus "attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas review"). This case presents the distinct ques-tion of what happens when that door has been closed.

The Court's reasons for reading 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.,Supp. V) as restrictively as it read the ACCA sentencing
provisions have nothing to do either with the text of $ 2255or with any extension of rules governing habeas review of
state convictions under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp.V). The language of $ 2255 providing a federal prisoner
with the right to relief because a sentence "was imposed inviolation of the Constitution or laws of the United States" is
obviously broad enough to include a claim that a prior conviction used anew to mandate sentence enhancement under theACCA was obtained unconstitutionally, so that the new sentence itself violates the terms of the ACCA or the Constitu-tion.

1 Nor does the Court rest its exclusion of such claims

1 The Government argues, citing Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485
(1994), that 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) does not provide a remedy
here because "the Constitution is not violated when a conviction that is
facially valid is used to enhance a sentence for committing another crime."
Brief for United States 12. This misstates the holding of Custis, which
merely held (with one exception discussed below) that neither the ACCA
nor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying conviction. 511 U. S., at 487. The constitutional
holding was necessarily limited to the statutory scheme considered. And,
in any event, $ 2255 provides an explicit remedy for a sentence that violates federal law, not solely the Constitution. Cf. Hill v. United States,
368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962) (describing types of fundamental errors that are

from $ 2255 review on the theory that a $ 2255 petitioner who
challenges underlying state convictions should be required,
like a $ 2254 petitioner, to exhaust state remedies and to comply with state procedural rules. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $$ 2254(b)-(c)
(1994 ed. and Supp. V); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982);
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). It is not clear,
after all, that such requirements, premised largely on comity
concerns and the State's interest in the finality of its own
judgments, see, e. g., id., at 731-732, 750, should be imported
into this context of a federal sentence imposed when a petitioner who has completed his state sentence seeks only to
avoid a sentence enhancement under federal law. In any
event, the Court does not purport to apply these specific requirements (which in the $ 2254 setting can be waived by the
State, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V); Gray v.
Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 165-166 (1996), and which are subject to explicit exceptions). Instead it imposes a flat ban on

$ 2255 relief (subject, maybe, to narrow exceptions).2

Having no textual basis or related precedent in habeas law,
the Court rules out challenges to ACCA sentencing predicates under $ 2255 on the same grounds invoked earlier to
bar such challenges under the sentencing provisions of the

cognizable under $ 2255). Neither the Custis Court nor today's Court
takes the position that the ACCA properly applies, as a statutory matter,
to underlying sentences that are in fact invalid. See Custis, supra, at
497; ante, at 382. The language of $ 2255 invites a petitioner to establish
such a statutory violation.

2 The Court continues to leave the door open (but with no promises) to

a motion to revise an ACCA sentence if a defendant has first obtained an
order vacating the predicate conviction through a state collateral proceeding or federal habeas review of the state judgment under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254
(1994 ed. and Supp. V). See ante, at 382; Custis, supra, at 497. The
plurality adds the possibility of an exception to today's rule if a petitioner
can show newly discovered evidence or legal disability during the period
of state custody. See ante, at 383-384. These exceptions will not eclipse
the rule.

390 DANIELS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., dissenting
ACCA itself: the ACCA ought to be easy to administer and
state convictions ought to carry finality, ante, at 378-380.
But whatever force these reasons might have if alternative
avenues of challenge were open, they do not even come close
to the horsepower needed to rule out the application of $ 2255
when the choice is relief under $ 2255 or no relief at all.
Why should it be easy to subject a person to a higher sentencing range and commit him for nearly nine extra years
(as here) when the prisoner has a colorable claim that the
extended commitment rests on a conviction the Constitution
would condemn? If the answer is the value of finality in
state convictions, why is finality valuable when state law itself does not demand it, and why is finality a one-way street?
Why should a prisoner like Daniels suddenly be barred from
returning to challenge the validity of a conviction, when the
Government is free to reach back to it to impose extended
imprisonment under a sentence enhancement law unheard of
at the time of the earlier convictions (1978 and 1981 in this
case)? Daniels could not have been expected in 1978 to anticipate the federal enhancement statute enacted in 1984; and
even if he had been blessed with statutory clairvoyance, the
practice in 1978 would have told him he could challenge the
convictions when and if the Government sought to rely on
them under the future enhancement statute. The ACCA
was enacted against the backdrop of a pervasive federal
practice of entertaining constitutional challenges to prior
convictions when used anew for sentence enhancement, a
practice on which Congress threw no cold water when it
enacted the ACCA. See Custis, 511 U. S., at 499-501 (Souter, J., dissenting). Indeed, even the Court seems to find
something disquieting in the historical practice, as it shows
by recognizing a textually untethered exception to its own
rule, one allowing for collateral attacks on prior convictions
if based on violations of the right to counsel under Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See ante, at 382. I sup532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
pose I should not begrudge the Court's concession, but the
Gideon exception, first announced in Custis, is inexplicable
here. One might have argued in Custis that a Gideon violation was egregious enough to excuse the defendant's failure
to resort to other forums still open; but there is no excuse
for picking and choosing among constitutional violations
here, when other forums are closed. The need to address
Gideon is no reason to ignore Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S.
86 (1923), or Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935) (per
curiam), or Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936), or
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), or Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), or Brady v. Maryland, 373
U. S. 83 (1963), or any other recognized violations of the
Constitution.

None of this is to say that the Court is wrong to recognize
that collateral review of old state convictions can be very
cumbersome. See ante, at 379. But that is not the only
practical consideration in the real world we confront (or
ought to confront) here. A defendant under the ACCA has
generally paid whatever penalty the old conviction entailed;
he may well have forgone direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and may well
have passed up collateral attack because he had no counsel
to speak for him. But when faced with the ACCA's 15-year
mandatory minimum the old conviction is suddenly well
worth challenging and counsel may be available under 18
U. S. C. $ 3006A(a)(2)(B). In denying him any right to attack
convictions later when attacks are worth the trouble, the
Court adopts a policy of promoting challenges earlier when
they may not justify the effort and perhaps never will. That
is a very odd incentive for a court to create, and the eccentricity is hardly softened by the likelihood that most defendants will not notice before it is too late.

Today's decision is devoid of support in either statutory
language or congressional intention. I respectfully dissent.

392 DANIELS v. UNITED STATES

Breyer, J., dissenting
Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I believe that Congress intended courts to read the si-lences in federal sentencing statutes as permitting defendants to challenge the validity of an earlier sentence-enhancing conviction

at the time of sentencing. See UnitedStates v. Paleo, 967 F. 2d 7, 11-13 (CA1 1992), implicitly overruled by Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994). Thatwas the practice typically followed in the lower courts before
Custis. See id., at 498-499, and n. 2, 511 (Souter, J., dis-senting). The courts now follow a comparable practice
in respect to other sentence-enhancing factors. See, e. g.,
United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87, 95-97 (1993) (per-jured testimony enhancement). And, given appropriate

burden of proof rules, see, e. g., United States v. Gilbert, 20F. 3d 94, 100 (CA3 1994); United States v. Wicks, 995 F. 2d
964, 978 (CA10), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 982 (1993); Paleo,supra, at 13 (citing United States v. Henry, 933 F. 2d 553,
559 (CA7 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 997 (1992); UnitedStates v. Gallman, 907 F. 2d 639, 643 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 908 (1991); and United States v. Taylor, 882F. 2d 1018, 1031 (CA6 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 907
(1990)), that practice need not prove unusually burdensome,
see Custis, supra, at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting).Having rejected that procedural approach in

Custis,
supra, at 496-497, the Court now must face the alternative--a later challenge to the earlier convictions in a collateral proceeding that attacks the present conviction or sentence. Toresolve that challenge the plurality has devised a broad rule
immunizing the earlier conviction with a possible exceptionfor "rare" circumstances. See

ante, at 383. The rule may
well prove unduly "restrictiv[e]," ante, at 388 (Souter, J.,dissenting). Or, through exceptions, it may well bring about

additional delay, still greater litigation complexity, and (inso-far as the plurality ties Congress' hands by resting its exception upon constitutional grounds) legal inflexibility. And,
given the restrictions Custis placed on sentencing courts, the

inclination to grant a 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V)hearing in the rare circumstances hypothesized by the majority is subject to Justice Scalia's criticism that $ 2255may be an inappropriate forum for such a challenge. See
ante, at 387 (opinion concurring in part).The legal problem lies at the source. While we do not
often overturn a recently decided case, in this instance theCourt's earlier decision will lead to ever-increasing complexity, for it blocks the simpler procedural approach that Con-gress intended.

Consequently, I believe this is one of those rare instancesin which the Court should reconsider an earlier case, namely,
Custis, and adopt the dissenters' views. For that reason,I dissent.

LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY

et al. v. COSS

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 99-1884. Argued February 20, 2001--Decided April 25, 2001
In 1986, respondent Coss was convicted in Pennsylvania state court of

simple assault, institutional vandalism, and criminal mischief. Coss
filed a petition for state postconviction relief with respect to these convictions, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, but the Pennsylvania
courts have never ruled on the petition. In 1990, after Coss had served
the full sentences for his 1986 convictions, he was convicted in state
court of aggravated assault. He successfully challenged his 6 to 12 year
sentence on direct appeal. On remand, the court did not consider Coss'
1986 convictions in determining his eligible sentencing range. In choosing a sentence within the applicable range, the court considered several
factors including Coss' extensive criminal record, and reimposed a 6 to
12 year sentence. Coss filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
claiming that his 1986 convictions were constitutionally invalid, and that
he was "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of
the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The Federal District Court
held that it could properly exercise $ 2254 jurisdiction because, in sentencing Coss for his 1990 conviction, the sentencing judge made reference to the 1986 convictions. The District Court denied the petition
because Coss had not been prejudiced by his 1986 counsel's ineffectiveness. The Third Circuit remanded, agreeing that the District Court
had jurisdiction, but finding a "reasonable probability" that but for his
counsel's ineffectiveness, Coss would not have been convicted in 1986.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
204 F. 3d 453, reversed and remanded.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, III-A, and IV, concluding that $ 2254 does not provide
a remedy when a state prisoner challenges a current sentence on
the ground that it was enhanced based on an allegedly unconstitutional
prior conviction for which the petitioner is no longer in custody.
Pp. 401-405, 408.

(a) A $ 2254 petitioner must first show that he is "in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court." $ 2254(a). Because Coss is no
longer serving the sentences for his 1986 convictions, he cannot bring a
federal habeas action directed solely at those convictions. However, his

Syllabus

$ 2254 petition can be (and has been) construed as asserting a challenge
to the 1990 sentence he is currently serving, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid 1986 convictions. See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 493.
Thus, he satisfies $ 2254's "in custody" requirement. Pp. 401-402.

(b) The more important question here is the one left unanswered in
Maleng: the extent to which a prior expired conviction may be subject
to challenge in an attack upon a current sentence it was used to enhance.
In Daniels v. United States, ante, p. 374, this Court held that a federal
prisoner who has failed to pursue available remedies to challenge a prior
conviction (or has done so unsuccessfully) may not collaterally attack
that conviction through a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 directed at the
enhanced federal sentence. That holding is now extended to cover

$ 2254 petitions directed at enhanced state sentences. The considerations on which the Daniels holding was grounded--finality of convictions and ease of administration--are equally present in the $ 2254 context. See Daniels, ante, at 379-380. Pp. 402-404.

(c) As in Daniels, an exception exists to the general rule for $ 2254
petitions that challenge an enhanced sentence on the basis that the prior
conviction used to enhance the sentence was obtained where there was
a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as set
forth in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335. The failure to appoint
counsel is a unique constitutional defect, rising to the level of a jurisdictional defect, which therefore warrants special treatment among alleged
constitutional violations. Moreover, an exception for Gideon claims
does not implicate this Court's concerns about administrative ease. As
with any $ 2254 petition, a petitioner making a Gideon challenge must
satisfy the procedural prerequisites for relief, including exhaustion of
remedies. Pp. 404-405.

O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts
I, II, III-A, and IV, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy,

I
Respondent Edward R. Coss, Jr., has an extensive criminalrecord. By the age of 16, he had been adjudged a juvenile

delinquent on five separate occasions for offenses includingtheft, disorderly conduct, assault, and burglary. See Record
Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 5, pp. 4-6). By the time he turned23, Coss had been convicted in adult court of assault, institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, andpossession of a controlled substance. See

id., at 6-7. Hisrecord also reveals arrests for assault, making terroristic

threats, delivery of controlled substances, reckless endanger-ment, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, retail theft, and
criminal conspiracy, although each of those charges was laterdropped. See

ibid. A report generated by the Lacka-wanna County Adult Probation Office sums up the "one consistent factor in this defendant's life: criminal behavior, muchof it being aggressive." Id., at 8.

This case revolves around two of the many entries on Coss'criminal record. In October 1986, Coss was convicted in
Pennsylvania state court of simple assault, institutional van-dalism, and criminal mischief. He was then sentenced to
two consecutive prison terms of six months to one year. Hedid not file a direct appeal. See App. 54a; see also Tr. of
Oral Arg. 28-29.In June 1987, Coss filed a petition for relief from the 1986
convictions under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction ReliefAct, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9541

et seq. (1998), alleging that histrial attorney had been constitutionally ineffective. See

App. 50a-53a. The Lackawanna County Court of CommonPleas promptly appointed counsel for Coss, id., at 57a, and
the district attorney filed an answer to the petition, id., at59a. The court, however, took no further action on the petition for the remainder of Coss' time in custody. Indeed, itappears that Coss' state postconviction petition has now

been pending for almost 14 years, and has never been thesubject of a judicial ruling. Neither petitioners nor respondent is able to explain this lapse. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 29.In 1990, after he had served the full sentences for his 1986
convictions, Coss was again convicted in Pennsylvania statecourt, this time of aggravated assault. He was sentenced to
6 to 12 years in prison, but successfully challenged this sentence on direct appeal because of a possible inaccuracy in thepresentence report. App. 62a.

On remand, the court's first task was to determine therange of sentences for which Coss was eligible. In calculating Coss' "prior record score"--one of two determinants of
the applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9721
(1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code $ 303.9(a) (1998))--the new
presentence report took account of Coss' most serious juvenile adjudication and Coss' 1986 misdemeanor convictions,
counting the latter as separate offenses. See Record Doc.
No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 10). Coss objected, claiming that his
1986 convictions should be counted as one misdemeanor offense because they arose from the same transaction. See
ibid. (Pl. Exh. 5, at 3-4). The trial court sustained Coss'
objection, finding that the convictions should be "view[ed] . . .
as being one transaction, one incident, one conviction." Id.,
at 5. Under the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, one
prior misdemeanor does not affect the prior record score.
See id., at 10 (displaying grid for calculating prior record
score). Thus, the practical effect of the court's decision was
to eliminate the 1986 convictions from Coss' prior record
score entirely. See ibid.; see also 204 F. 3d 453, 467-468
(CA3 2000) (en banc) (Nygaard, J., dissenting). Consequently, Coss' 1986 convictions played no part in determining
the range of sentences to which Coss was exposed.

The court's next task was to choose a sentence within that
range. In doing so, the trial court considered a number of
factors, including "the seriousness and nature of the crime
involved here, the well being and protection of the people

who live in our community, your criminal disposition, your
prior criminal record, the possibility of your rehabilitation,
and the testimony that I've heard." Record Doc. No. 101
(Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). The court concluded that "it's indicative
that from your actions that you will continue to break the
law unless given a period of incarceration." Ibid. The
court then reimposed a 6 to 12 year sentence. Because
Coss' 1986 convictions are a part of his prior criminal record,
the Court of Appeals concluded that the state court took
those convictions "into consideration" in sentencing Coss.
See 204 F. 3d, at 459.

In September 1994, Coss filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. That
provision, a postconviction remedy in federal court for state
prisoners, provides that a writ of habeas corpus is available
to "a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State
court" if that person "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." $ 2254(a).
In his petition, Coss contended that his 1986 assault conviction was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel.
App. 73a-74a.

In answer to Coss' $ 2254 petition, the Lackawanna County
District Attorney argued that the District Court could not
review the constitutionality of Coss' 1986 convictions because Coss was no longer in custody on those convictions.
Record Doc. No. 55, p. 2. The district attorney, however,
indicated his understanding that the crux of Coss' claim was
that his 1986 convictions "may have impact [sic] upon the
sentences which have been imposed . . . upon [Coss] for criminal convictions rendered against him" for his 1990 convictions. Ibid. See also Brief for Petitioners 4 ("[R]espondent
argues that the sentence for his 1990 conviction was adversely and unconstitutionally affected by the 1986 simple
assault conviction").

Opinion of the Court
The District Court stated that Coss was arguing "that hiscurrent sentence [for the 1990 conviction] was adversely affected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing judgeconsidered these allegedly unconstitutional convictions in
computing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. for Cert.105a-106a. Finding that "the sentencing judge . . . did make
reference to the 1986 convictions in sentencing Coss," id., at
107a, the court held that it could properly exercise jurisdic-tion under $ 2254,

id., at 108a; see also Record Doc. No. 87,
p. 3, n. 2. After an evidentiary hearing, the court deniedthe petition, holding that Coss' 1986 trial counsel had been

ineffective, but that Coss had not been prejudiced by the
ineffectiveness. App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a, 116a, 120a.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc,
agreed that "the sentencing court for the 1990 conviction
took into consideration [Coss' 1986] conviction[s]," and therefore that the District Court had jurisdiction over Coss' $ 2254
petition. 204 F. 3d, at 459. Citing Circuit precedent and
our decisions in Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989) (per
curiam), and United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972),
the court concluded that $ 2254 provided a remedy for "an
allegedly unconstitutional conviction, even if [the $ 2254 petitioner] has served in entirety the sentence resulting from
the conviction, if that conviction had an effect on a present
sentence." 204 F. 3d, at 459-460.

The court then found that Coss had received ineffective
assistance during his 1986 trial, and that there was "a reasonable probability" that but for the ineffective assistance,
Coss "would not have been found guilty of assau[lt]." Id.,
at 462. The court remanded the case to the District Court,
ordering that the Commonwealth be allowed either to retry
Coss for the 1986 assault or to resentence him for the 1990
assault without consideration of the 1986 conviction. Id.,
at 467.

Opinion of the Court
in Coss' favor: whether $ 2254 provides a remedy where acurrent sentence was enhanced on the basis of an allegedly

unconstitutional prior conviction for which the sentence hasfully expired. 531 U. S. 923 (2000).

II

A

The first showing a $ 2254 petitioner must make is that heis "in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court."

28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). In Maleng v. Cook, supra, we consid-ered a situation quite similar to the one presented here. In
that case, the respondent had filed a $ 2254 petition listing asthe " `conviction under attack' " a 1958 state conviction for
which he had already served the entirety of his sentence.490 U. S., at 489-490. He also alleged that the 1958 conviction had been "used illegally to enhance his 1978 state sen-tences" which he had not yet begun to serve because he was
at that time in federal custody on an unrelated matter. Ibid.We determined that the respondent was "in custody" on his
1978 sentences because the State had lodged a detaineragainst him with the federal authorities. Id., at 493.

We held that the respondent was not "in custody" on his1958 conviction merely because that conviction had been
used to enhance a subsequent sentence. Id., at 492. Weacknowledged, however, that because his $ 2254 petition
"[could] be read as asserting a challenge to the 1978 sen-tences, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior conviction,
. . . respondent . . . satisfied the `in custody' requirement forfederal habeas jurisdiction."

Id., at 493-494.Similarly, Coss is no longer serving the sentences imposed

pursuant to his 1986 convictions, and therefore cannot bringa federal habeas petition directed solely at those convictions.
Coss is, however, currently serving the sentence for his 1990conviction. Like the respondent in Maleng, Coss' $ 2254
petition can be (and has been) construed as "asserting achallenge to the [1990] senten[ce], as enhanced by the alleg532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
edly invalid prior [1986] conviction." Id., at 493. See alsosupra, at 399-400. Accordingly, Coss satisfies $ 2254's "in

custody" requirement. Cf. Daniels, ante, at 383, 384, n. 2(stating that the text of $ 2255, which also contains an "in
custody" requirement, is broad enough to cover a claim thata current sentence enhanced by an allegedly unconstitutional
prior conviction violates due process).

B
More important for our purposes here is the question weexplicitly left unanswered in

Maleng: "the extent to whichthe [prior expired] conviction itself may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the [current] senten[ce] which it wasused to enhance." 490 U. S., at 494. We encountered this
same question in the $ 2255 context in Daniels v. United
States, ante, p. 374. We held there that "[i]f . . . a priorconviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer

open to direct or collateral attack in its own right becausethe defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they
were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccess-fully), then that defendant . . . may not collaterally attack his
prior conviction through a motion under $ 2255." Ante, at382. We now extend this holding to cover $ 2254 petitions
directed at enhanced state sentences.We grounded our holding in

Daniels on considerationsrelating to the need for finality of convictions and ease of

administration. Those concerns are equally present in the$ 2254 context. The first and most compelling interest is
in the finality of convictions. Once a judgment of convictionis entered in state court, it is subject to review in multiple
forums. Specifically, each State has created mechanismsfor both direct appeal and state postconviction review,
see L. Yackle, Postconviction Remedies $$ 1, 13 (1981 andSupp. 2000), even though there is no constitutional mandate
that they do so, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551,557 (1987) (no constitutional right to state postconviction

532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
review); Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977)(no constitutional right to direct appeal). Moreover, $ 2254

makes federal courts available to review state criminalproceedings for compliance with federal constitutional
mandates.As we said in

Daniels, "[t]hese vehicles for review . . . are
not available indefinitely and without limitation." Ante, at
381. A defendant may choose not to seek review of his con-viction within the prescribed time. Or he may seek review

and not prevail, either because he did not comply with proce-dural rules or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation. In each of these situations, the defendant's conviction becomes final and the State that secured the conviction
obtains a strong interest in preserving the integrity of the
judgment. See ante, at 379-380. Other jurisdictions acquire an interest as well, as they may then use that conviction for their own recidivist sentencing purposes, relying on
"the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments." Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29 (1992); see also
Daniels, ante, at 380.

An additional concern is ease of administration of challenges to expired state convictions. Federal courts sitting
in habeas jurisdiction must consult state court records and
transcripts to ensure that challenged convictions were obtained in a manner consistent with constitutional demands.
As time passes, and certainly once a state sentence has been
served to completion, the likelihood that trial records will be
retained by the local courts and will be accessible for review
diminishes substantially. See Daniels, ante, at 379.

Accordingly, as in Daniels, we hold that once a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its
own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did
so unsuccessfully), the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid. See Daniels, ante, at 382. If that conviction
is later used to enhance a criminal sentence, the defendant

532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSS

Opinion of the Court
generally may not challenge the enhanced sentence througha petition under $ 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.

III

A

As in Daniels, we recognize an exception to the generalrule for $ 2254 petitions that challenge an enhanced sentence

on the basis that the prior conviction used to enhance thesentence was obtained where there was a failure to appoint
counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as set forth in
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). The special sta-tus of Gideon claims in this context is well established in our

case law. See, e. g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,496-497 (1994); United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S., at 449;
Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, 115 (1967). Cf. Daniels,ante, at 382.

As we recognized in Custis, the "failure to appoint counselfor an indigent [is] a unique constitutional defect . . . ris[ing]
to the level of a jurisdictional defect," which thereforewarrants special treatment among alleged constitutional
violations. See 511 U. S., at 496. Moreover, allowing anexception for Gideon challenges does not implicate our concern about administrative ease, as the "failure to appointcounsel . . . will generally appear from the judgment roll
itself, or from an accompanying minute order." 511 U. S.,at 496.

As with any $ 2254 petition, the petitioner must satisfy theprocedural prerequisites for relief including, for example,
exhaustion of remedies. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) (1994 ed.,Supp. V). When an otherwise qualified $ 2254 petitioner can
demonstrate that his current sentence was enhanced on thebasis of a prior conviction that was obtained where there
was a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the SixthAmendment, the current sentence cannot stand and habeas
relief is appropriate. Cf. United States v. Tucker, supra, at

532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

405Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
449 (affirming vacatur of sentence that was based in part onprior uncounseled state convictions).

B
We stated in Daniels that another exception to the generalrule precluding habeas relief might be available, although

the circumstances of that case did not require us to resolvethe issue. See ante, at 383-384. We note a similar situation here.The general rule we have adopted here and in Daniels
reflects the notion that a defendant properly bears the conse-quences of either forgoing otherwise available review of a
conviction or failing to successfully demonstrate constitu-tional error. See

supra, at 403-404; Daniels, ante, at 381-383. It is not always the case, however, that a defendant

can be faulted for failing to obtain timely review of a consti-tutional claim. For example, a state court may, without justification, refuse to rule on a constitutional claim that hasbeen properly presented to it. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1)(B)
(1994 ed., Supp. V) (tolling 1-year limitations period whilepetitioner is prevented from filing application by an "impediment . . . created by State action in violation of the Constitu-tion or laws of the United States"). Alternatively, after the
time for direct or collateral review has expired, a defendantmay obtain compelling evidence that he is actually innocent
of the crime for which he was convicted, and which he couldnot have uncovered in a timely manner. Cf.

Brady v. Mary-land, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(B) (1994 ed.,

Supp. V) (allowing a second or successive habeas corpus ap-plication if "the factual predicate for the claim could not
have been discovered previously through the exercise of duediligence; and . . . the facts underlying the claim, if proven
and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would besufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,
but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder wouldhave found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense").

406 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
In such situations, a habeas petition directed at the en-hanced sentence may effectively be the first and only forum

available for review of the prior conviction. As in Daniels,this case does not require us to determine whether, or under
what precise circumstances, a petitioner might be able to usea $ 2254 petition in this manner.

Whatever such a petitioner must show to be eligible forreview, the challenged prior conviction must have adversely
affected the sentence that is the subject of the habeas peti-tion. This question was adequately raised and considered
below. As the District Court stated, Coss contended "thathis current sentence [for the 1990 conviction] was

adverselyaffected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing

judge considered these allegedly unconstitutional convictionsin computing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 105a-106a (emphasis added). The District Court andmajority of the Court of Appeals agreed with Coss on this
point. See id., at 107a; 204 F. 3d, at 459. Judge Nygaard,joined by Judge Roth, dissented to dispute the conclusion
that the 1986 convictions had any effect whatsoever on Coss'sentence for the 1990 conviction.

Id., at 467-469.

C
After a careful examination of the record here, we are sat-isfied that the findings of the lower courts on this threshold

factual point are clearly erroneous. Cf. Neil v. Biggers, 409U. S. 188, 193, n. 3 (1972). We therefore conclude that respondent Coss does not qualify to have his $ 2254 petitionreviewed, even assuming the existence of a limited exception
to the general rule barring review of an expired prior convic-tion. Specifically, it is clear that any "consideration" the
trial court may have given to Coss' 1986 convictions in reim-posing sentence for his 1990 conviction did not actually affect
that sentence.As we explain above, see

supra, at 398-399, when Cosswas resentenced on his 1990 conviction, he objected to the

532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

407Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
presentence report's calculation of his prior record score.The court sustained that objection and, in effect, eliminated

Coss' 1986 convictions from the prior record score entirely.Because the prior record score is one of two determinants of
the applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9721(1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code $ 303.9(a) (1998)), it is clear
that Coss' 1986 convictions had no role in determining the
range of sentences to which Coss was exposed.In choosing a sentence for Coss within that range, the trial

court considered several factors, including "the seriousnessand nature of the crime involved here, the well being and
protection of the people who live in our community, your
criminal disposition, your prior criminal record, the possibility of your rehabilitation, and the testimony that I've heard."
Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). Coss' 1986 convictions are, of course, a portion of his criminal record. Thus,
it is technically correct to say that the court "considered"
those convictions before sentencing Coss. Cf. 204 F. 3d,
at 459.

But it is a different thing entirely to say that the 1986
convictions actually increased the length of the sentence the
court ultimately imposed. As the sentencing court told
Coss, "I think that it's indicative that from your actions that
you will continue to break the law unless given a period of
incarceration." Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26).
The "actions" to which the judge referred were obviously
not limited to Coss' criminal conduct in 1986, but Coss' extensive and violent criminal record as a whole. We conclude, as Judge Nygaard did below, that the 1986 convictions
are "such a minor component of [Coss'] record that there is
no question that the sentencing court, given its concerns,
would have imposed exactly the same sentence" had those
convictions been omitted from Coss' record. 204 F. 3d, at
468 (dissenting opinion).

We note that the record does not explain why Coss' ineffective assistance claim did not receive a timely adjudication

in the Pennsylvania courts. While the reason might have
been that Coss' petition "slipped through the cracks," due to
no fault of his own, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, it might also have
been that Coss was responsible for "request[ing] that the
matter be brought up for a hearing," id., at 5. But even if
Coss cannot be faulted for that lapse, he would not qualify
to have his current $ 2254 petition reviewed because the 1990
sentence he is challenging was not actually affected by the
1986 convictions.

IV

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The error of Daniels v. United States, ante, p. 374, is repeated once more, and I respectfully dissent for reasons set
out in my dissenting opinion in that case. There is a further
reason to disagree with the majority here.

Although state law theoretically provided a procedure for
respondent Coss to challenge his 1986 convictions, the provision has proven to be a mirage; Coss's challenge was filed
and answered by the district attorney, only to disappear in
the state-court system for almost 14 years, so far. This failure of state process leads the plurality to qualify its general
rule against attacking predicates to enhanced sentences, by
raising the possibility of such a challenge when the opportunity for attack under provisions of state law, timely invoked,
has proven to be imaginary. Ante, at 405. The plurality
then goes on to deny Coss the benefit of this exception on
the ground that he cannot demonstrate that "the challenged
prior conviction . . . adversely affected the sentence that is

Souter, J., dissenting
the subject of the habeas petition." Ante, at 406. This con-clusion is premature.

The issue of adverse effect was by no means adequatelyraised and considered by the Court of Appeals. The earlier
convictions could have affected the later sentence in eitherof two ways: by subjecting Coss to a higher sentencing range
or by being considered as a reason to give him a higher sen-tence than he would otherwise have received within a given
range. It appears that the sentencing court did not treatthe convictions as subjecting Coss to a higher range of potential sentence, but the District Court expressly found thatthe sentencing court considered the challenged convictions
in sentencing Coss to the maximum sentence within the ap-plicable range. App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a ("The sentencing
judge, however, did make reference to the 1986 convictions
in sentencing Coss to the top of the standard range for his1990 aggravated assault conviction"). This finding was

never challenged in the Court of Appeals,* which appearedto accept the District Court's finding as a matter of course.
Id., at 11a ("We are satisfied that the sentencing judge . . .
took into consideration [Coss's 1986 conviction]").In holding the District Court's finding to be clearly erroneous, the majority is thus ruling on a matter in the first in-stance in derogation of this Court's proper role as a court of
review. E. g., Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198 (2001);

*The district attorney made no mention of the causal connection between the 1986 conviction and the 1990 sentence either in his brief before
the Third Circuit panel, or in his petition for rehearing. That petition
claimed only that the panel had improperly applied the principle of United
States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972), to the facts of this case.

Even the so-called "Epilogue" included in the district attorney's brief
before the en banc Court of Appeals argued only that the 1986 conviction
did not subject Coss to a higher sentencing range in 1990. Supplemental
Brief [on Rehearing] for Appellee in No. 98-7416 (CA3), pp. 15-18. It did
not challenge the District Court's finding that the 1990 sentencing court
considered the challenged convictions in sentencing Coss to the maximum
sentence within the applicable range.

National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459(1999); United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 72-73 (1998).

The only responsible course for the majority would be toremand to the Court of Appeals, which could determine
whether the district attorney may challenge the DistrictCourt's finding of a causal link between the unconstitutional
convictions and the later, maximum sentence, or whetherthis issue has already been waived.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
Because the Commonwealth has failed to argue in thisCourt that the trial court's consideration of respondent's

1986 convictions was harmless, and consequently, the issuehas not been briefed, I would not overturn the Court of Appeals' finding that respondent's sentence was enhanced basedon the purportedly defective 1986 convictions. The Court
of Appeals, however, operated under the belief that the Con-stitution generally requires 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed., Supp.
V) petitioners to be able to attack prior convictions that en-hanced their sentences. It did not focus on whether the

$ 2254 proceeding was "the first and only forum available forreview of [respondent's] prior conviction[s]."

Ante, at 406.Accordingly, I would vacate the decision below and remand

for consideration of that issue. As respondent has not yetshown that he was denied a forum in which to raise his
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, any discussion of aconstitutionally based exception is premature.

C & L ENTERPRISES, INC. v. CITIZEN BAND POTAWATOMI INDIAN TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA

certiorari to the court of civil appeals of oklahoma

No. 00-292. Argued March 19, 2001--Decided April 30, 2001
Respondent, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, proposed and entered

into a standard form construction contract with petitioner C & L Enterprises, Inc. (C & L), for the installation of a roof on a Tribe-owned
commercial building in Oklahoma. The property in question lies outside the Tribe's reservation and is not held by the Federal Government
in trust for the Tribe. The contract contains two key provisions.
First, a clause provides that "[a]ll . . . disputes . . . arising out of . . . the
Contract . . . shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the
Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association . . . . The award rendered by the arbitrator . . . shall be
final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof." The referenced
American Arbitration Association Rules provide: "Parties to these rules
shall be deemed to have consented that judgment upon the arbitration
award may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction
thereof." Second, the contract includes a choice-of-law clause that
reads: "The contract shall be governed by the law of the place where
the Project is located." Oklahoma has adopted a Uniform Arbitration
Act, which instructs that "[t]he making of an agreement . . . providing
for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the court to enforce
the agreement under this act and to enter judgment on an award thereunder." The Act defines "court" as "any court of competent jurisdiction
of this state." After execution of the contract but before C & L commenced performance, the Tribe decided to change the roofing material
specified in the contract. The Tribe solicited new bids and retained
another company to install the roof. C & L, claiming that the Tribe had
dishonored the contract, submitted an arbitration demand. The Tribe
asserted sovereign immunity and declined to participate in the arbitration proceeding. It notified the arbitrator, however, that it had several
substantive defenses to C & L's claim. The arbitrator received evidence and rendered an award in favor of C & L. The contractor filed
suit to enforce the award in the District Court of Oklahoma County, a
state court of general, first instance, jurisdiction. The Tribe appeared
in court for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss the action on the
ground that, as a sovereign, it was immune from suit. The District

Court denied the motion and entered a judgment confirming the award.
The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. While the Tribe's certiorari petition was pending here, this Court decided Kiowa Tribe of
Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751, holding that
an Indian tribe is not subject to suit in a state court--even for breach
of contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct--unless "Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity," id.,
at 754, 760. On remand for reconsideration in light of Kiowa, the Court
of Civil Appeals held that the Tribe here was immune from suit on its
contract with C & L. Although noting that the arbitration agreement
and the contract language as to judicial enforcement seem to indicate
the Tribe's willingness to expose itself to suit on the contract, the court
concluded that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity with the
requisite clarity. The court therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.

Held: By the clear import of the arbitration clause, the Tribe is amenable

to a state-court suit to enforce an arbitral award in favor of C & L.
Like Kiowa, this case arises out of the breach of a commercial, offreservation contract by a federally recognized Indian Tribe. C & L
does not contend that Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in this
setting. The question presented is whether the Tribe has waived its
immunity. To relinquish its immunity, a tribe's waiver must be "clear."
Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,
498 U. S. 505, 509. The construction contract's arbitration provision
and related prescriptions lead to the conclusion that the Tribe in this
case has waived its immunity with the requisite clarity. The arbitration
clause requires resolution of all contract-related disputes between the
parties by binding arbitration; ensuing arbitral awards may be reduced
to judgment "in accordance with applicable law in any court having
jurisdiction thereof." For governance of arbitral proceedings, the
clause specifies American Arbitration Association Rules, under which
"the arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court
having jurisdiction thereof." The contract's choice-of-law clause makes
it plain enough that a "court having jurisdiction" to enforce the award
in question is the Oklahoma state court in which C & L filed suit. By
selecting Oklahoma law ("the law of the place where the Project is located") to govern the contract, the parties have effectively consented to
confirmation of the award "in accordance with" the Oklahoma Uniform
Arbitration Act, which prescribes that, when "an agreement . . . provid[es] for arbitration in" Oklahoma, jurisdiction to enforce the agreement vests in "any court of competent jurisdiction of this state." On
any sensible reading of the Act, the District Court of Oklahoma County,

Syllabus
a local court of general jurisdiction, fits that statutory description.
This Court rejects the Tribe's contention that an arbitration clause is
not a waiver of immunity from suit, but simply a waiver of the parties'
rights to a court trial of contractual disputes. Under the clause, the
Tribe recognizes, the parties must arbitrate. The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute
resolution regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not
designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And
to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration. Also rejected is the Tribe's assertion that a form contract, designed principally
for private parties who have no immunity to waive, cannot establish a
clear waiver of tribal suit immunity. In appropriate cases, this Court
applies the common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court
should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party
that drafted it. That rule is inapposite here for two evident reasons.
First, the contract is not ambiguous. Second, the Tribe did not find
itself holding the short end of an adhesion contract stick: The Tribe
proposed and prepared the contract; C & L foisted no form on the
Tribe. Pp. 418-423.

the brief were Solicitor General Waxman, Assistant At-torney General Schiffer, and Deputy Solicitor General

Kneedler.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies,
Inc., 523 U. S. 751 (1998), this Court held that an Indian tribeis not subject to suit in a state court--even for breach of

contract involving off-reservation commercial conduct--un-less "Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has
waived its immunity." Id., at 754. This case concerns theimpact of an arbitration agreement on a tribe's plea of suit
immunity. The document on which the case centers is astandard form construction contract signed by the parties to
govern the installation of a foam roof on a building, the FirstOklahoma Bank, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The building and
land are owned by an Indian Tribe, the Citizen PotawatomiNation (Tribe). The building is commercial, and the land
is off-reservation, nontrust property. The form contract,which was proposed by the Tribe and accepted by the contractor, C & L Enterprises, Inc. (C & L), contains an arbitra-tion clause.

The question presented is whether the Tribe waived itsimmunity from suit in state court when it expressly agreed
to arbitrate disputes with C & L relating to the contract, tothe governance of Oklahoma law, and to the enforcement of
arbitral awards "in any court having jurisdiction thereof."We hold that, by the clear import of the arbitration clause,
the Tribe is amenable to a state-court suit to enforce an arbi-tral award in favor of contractor C & L.

Respondent Citizen Potawatomi Nation is a federally rec-ognized Indian Tribe. In 1993, it entered into a contract

with petitioner C & L for the installation of a roof on a Shaw-nee, Oklahoma, building owned by the Tribe. The building,

Opinion of the Court
which housed the First Oklahoma Bank, is not on the Tribe'sreservation or on land held by the Federal Government in

trust for the Tribe.The contract at issue is a standard form agreement copyrighted by the American Institute of Architects. The Tribeproposed the contract; details not set out in the form were
inserted by the Tribe and its architect. Two provisions of
the contract are key to this case. First, the contract con-tains an arbitration clause:

"All claims or disputes between the Contractor
[C & L] and the Owner [the Tribe] arising out of or relat-ing to the Contract, or the breach thereof, shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction
[I]ndustry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitra-tion Association currently in effect unless the parties

mutually agree otherwise . . . . The award rendered bythe arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final, and judgment
may be entered upon it in accordance with applicablelaw in any court having jurisdiction thereof." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 46.
The American Arbitration Association Rules to which the
clause refers provide: "Parties to these rules shall be deemedto have consented that judgment upon the arbitration award

may be entered in any federal or state court having jurisdic-tion thereof." American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept.1, 2000).

Second, the contract includes a choice-of-law clause thatreads: "The contract shall be governed by the law of the
place where the Project is located." App. to Pet. for Cert.
56. Oklahoma has adopted a Uniform Arbitration Act,
which instructs that "[t]he making of an agreement . . . providing for arbitration in this state confers jurisdiction on the
court to enforce the agreement under this act and to enter
judgment on an award thereunder." Okla. Stat., Tit. 15,

Opinion of the Court

$ 802.B (1993). The Act defines "court" as "any court ofcompetent jurisdiction of this state."

Ibid.
After execution of the contract but before C & L com-menced performance, the Tribe decided to change the roofing

material from foam (the material specified in the contract) torubber guard. The Tribe solicited new bids and retained
another company to install the roof. C & L, claiming that
the Tribe had dishonored the contract, submitted an arbitra-tion demand. The Tribe asserted sovereign immunity and

declined to participate in the arbitration proceeding. It no-tified the arbitrator, however, that it had several substantive
defenses to C & L's claim. On consideration of C & L's evidence, the arbitrator rendered an award in favor of C & L
for $25,400 in damages (close to 30% of the contract price),
plus attorney's fees and costs.

Several weeks later, C & L filed suit to enforce the arbitration award in the District Court of Oklahoma County, a state
court of general, first instance, jurisdiction. The Tribe appeared specially for the limited purpose of moving to dismiss
the action on the ground that the Tribe was immune from
suit. The District Court denied the motion and entered a
judgment confirming the award.

The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding
that the Tribe lacked immunity because the contract giving
rise to the suit was "between an Indian tribe and a nonIndian" and was "executed outside of Indian Country."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 14 (citation omitted). The Oklahoma
Supreme Court denied review, and the Tribe petitioned for
certiorari in this Court.

While the Tribe's petition was pending here, the Court
decided Kiowa, holding: "Tribes enjoy immunity from suits
on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental
or commercial activities and whether they were made on or
off a reservation." 523 U. S., at 760. Kiowa reconfirmed:
"[A]n Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has
authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity."

Id., at 754. Thereafter, we granted the Tribe's petition in
this case, vacated the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Kiowa.
524 U. S. 901 (1998).

On remand, the Court of Civil Appeals changed course.
It held that, under Kiowa, the Tribe here was immune from
suit on its contract with C & L, despite the contract's offreservation subject matter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 4-5.
The court then addressed whether the Tribe had waived its
immunity. "The agreement of [the] Tribe to arbitration, and
the contract language regarding enforcement in courts having jurisdiction," the court observed, "seem to indicate a
willingness on [the] Tribe's part to expose itself to suit on
the contract." Id., at 7. But, the court quickly added, "the
leap from that willingness to a waiver of immunity is one
based on implication, not an unequivocal expression." Ibid.
Concluding that the Tribe had not waived its suit immunity
with the requisite clarity, the appeals court instructed the
trial court to dismiss the case. The Oklahoma Supreme
Court denied C & L's petition for review.

Conflicting with the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals' current decision, several state and federal courts have held that
an arbitration clause, kin to the one now before us, expressly
waives tribal immunity from a suit arising out of the contract. See Sokaogon Gaming Enterprise Corp. v. TushieMontgomery Associates, Inc., 86 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 1996)
(clause requiring arbitration of contractual disputes and authorizing entry of judgment upon arbitral award "in any
court having jurisdiction thereof " expressly waived Tribe's
immunity); Native Village of Eyak v. GC Contractors, 658
P. 2d 756 (Alaska 1983) (same); Val/Del, Inc. v. Superior
Court, 145 Ariz. 558, 703 P. 2d 502 (Ct. App. 1985) (same).
But cf. Pan American Co. v. Sycuan Band of Mission Indians, 884 F. 2d 416 (CA9 1989) (clause requiring arbitration of
contractual disputes did not expressly waive Tribe's immu532US2 Unit: $U47 [09-06-02 13:18:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nity). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 531U. S. 956 (2000), and now reverse.

II
Kiowa, in which we reaffirmed the doctrine of tribal im-munity, involved an off-reservation, commercial agreement (a

stock purchase) by a federally recognized Tribe. The Tribesigned a promissory note agreeing to pay the seller $285,000
plus interest. The note recited: "Nothing in this Notesubjects or limits the sovereign rights of the Kiowa Tribe
of Oklahoma." 523 U. S., at 753-754. The Tribe defaulted,the seller sued on the note in state court, and the Tribe asserted sovereign immunity. We upheld the plea. Tribalimmunity, we ruled in

Kiowa, extends to suits on off-reservation commercial contracts. Id., at 754-760. The

Kiowa Tribe was immune from suit for defaulting on thepromissory note, we held, because "Congress ha[d] not abrogated [the Tribe's] immunity, nor ha[d] petitioner waived it."Id., at 760.

Like Kiowa, this case arises out of the breach of a commer-cial, off-reservation contract by a federally recognized Indian
Tribe. The petitioning contractor, C & L, does not contendthat Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in this setting.
The question presented is whether the Tribe has waived itsimmunity.

To abrogate tribal immunity, Congress must "unequivo-cally" express that purpose.

Santa Clara Pueblo v. Marti-nez, 436 U. S. 49, 58 (1978) (citing United States v. Testan,

424 U. S. 392, 399 (1976)). Similarly, to relinquish its im-munity, a tribe's waiver must be "clear." Oklahoma Tax
Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498U. S. 505, 509 (1991). We are satisfied that the Tribe in this
case has waived, with the requisite clarity, immunity fromthe suit C & L brought to enforce its arbitration award.

The construction contract's provision for arbitration andrelated prescriptions lead us to this conclusion. The arbitra532US2 Unit: $U47 [09-06-02 13:18:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

419Cite as: 532 U. S. 411 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
tion clause requires resolution of all contract-related dis-putes between C & L and the Tribe by binding arbitration;

ensuing arbitral awards may be reduced to judgment "in ac-cordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction
thereof." App. to Pet. for Cert. 46. For governance of ar-bitral proceedings, the arbitration clause specifies American
Arbitration Association Rules for the construction industry,
ibid., and under those Rules, "the arbitration award may beentered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction

thereof," American Arbitration Association, ConstructionIndustry Dispute Resolution Procedures, R-48(c) (Sept. 1,
2000).The contract's choice-of-law clause makes it plain enough
that a "court having jurisdiction" to enforce the award inquestion is the Oklahoma state court in which C & L filed
suit. By selecting Oklahoma law ("the law of the placewhere the Project is located") to govern the contract, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 56, the parties have effectively consented to
confirmation of the award "in accordance with" the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act, id., at 46 ("judgment may
be entered upon [the arbitration award] in accordance with
applicable law"); Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, $ 802.A (1993) ("This act
shall apply to . . . a provision in a written contract to submit
to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between
the parties.").1

The Uniform Act in force in Oklahoma prescribes that,
when "an agreement . . . provid[es] for arbitration in this
state," i. e., in Oklahoma, jurisdiction to enforce the agreement vests in "any court of competent jurisdiction of this

1 The United States, as amicus supporting the Tribe, urges us to remain
within the "four corners of the contract" and refrain from reliance on "secondary sources." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, and n. 7.
The American Arbitration Association Rules and the Uniform Arbitration
Act, however, are not secondary interpretive aides that supplement our
reading of the contract; they are prescriptions incorporated by the express
terms of the agreement itself.

Opinion of the Court

state." $ 802.B. On any sensible reading of the Act, the
District Court of Oklahoma County, a local court of general
jurisdiction, fits that statutory description.2

In sum, the Tribe agreed, by express contract, to adhere
to certain dispute resolution procedures. In fact, the Tribe
itself tendered the contract calling for those procedures.
The regime to which the Tribe subscribed includes entry of
judgment upon an arbitration award in accordance with the
Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act. That Act concerns
arbitration in Oklahoma and correspondingly designates as
enforcement forums "court[s] of competent jurisdiction of
[Oklahoma]." Ibid. C & L selected for its enforcement suit
just such a forum. In a case involving an arbitration clause
essentially indistinguishable from the one to which the Tribe
and C & L agreed, the Seventh Circuit stated:

"There is nothing ambiguous about th[e] language [of the
arbitration clause]. The tribe agrees to submit disputes
arising under the contract to arbitration, to be bound by
the arbitration award, and to have its submission and
the award enforced in a court of law.. . . . .

. . . "The [tribal immunity] waiver . . . is implicit rather
than explicit only if a waiver of sovereign immunity, to
be deemed explicit, must use the words `sovereign immunity.' No case has ever held that." Sokaogon, 86
F. 3d, at 659-660.

2 The United States argues that the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act
is inapplicable in this case because it does not reach all arbitrations properly held in Oklahoma, but only those in which the agreement explicitly
"provide[s] for arbitration in [Oklahoma]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48 (referring to $ 802.B). No Oklahoma authority is cited for this constricted reading of an Act that expressly "appl[ies] to . . . a provision in a written
contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties." $ 802.A. We decline to attribute to the Oklahoma
lawmakers and interpreters a construction that so severely shrinks the
Act's domain.

Opinion of the Court
That cogent observation holds as well for the case weconfront.

The Tribe strenuously urges, however, that an arbitrationclause simply "is not a waiver of immunity from suit." Brief

for Respondent 13. The phrase in the clause providing forenforcement of arbitration awards "in any court having jurisdiction thereof," the Tribe maintains, "begs the questionof what court has jurisdiction."

Id., at 22. As counsel forthe Tribe clarified at oral argument, the Tribe's answer is

"no court," on earth or even on the moon. Tr. of Oral Arg.32-33. No court--federal, state, or even tribal--has jurisdiction over C & L's suit, the Tribe insists, because it hasnot expressly waived its sovereign immunity in any judicial
forum. Ibid.; cf. Sokaogon, 86 F. 3d, at 660 (facing a similarargument, Seventh Circuit gleaned that counsel meant only
a statement to this effect will do: "The tribe will not assertthe defense of sovereign immunity if sued for breach of
contract.").4

3 Instructive here is the law governing waivers of immunity by foreign
sovereigns. Cf. Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies,
Inc., 523 U. S. 751, 759 (1998) ("In considering Congress' role in reforming tribal immunity, we find instructive the problems of sovereign immunity for foreign countries."). "Under the law of the United States . . .
an agreement to arbitrate is a waiver of immunity from jurisdiction in
. . . an action to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant to the
agreement . . . ." Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of
the United States $ 456(2)(b)(ii) (1987).

4 Relying on our state sovereign immunity jurisprudence, the United

States maintains that "courts must be especially reluctant to construe
ambiguous expressions as consent by a Tribe to be sued in state court."
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23; see also id., at 25 (arguing
that a State's generalized consent to suit, without an express selection of
the forum in which suit may proceed, "should be construed narrowly as
the State's consent to be sued in its own courts of competent jurisdiction,
and not its consent to be subjected to suits in another sovereign's courts")
(citing, e. g., Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573
(1946) (State statute authorizing suits against State in "any court of competent jurisdiction" did not waive State's immunity from suit in federal
court)). But in this case, as we explained supra, at 419-420, the Tribe
has plainly consented to suit in Oklahoma state court. We therefore have

POTAWATOMI TRIBE OF OKLA.

Opinion of the Court

Instead of waiving suit immunity in any court, the Tribe
argues, the arbitration clause waives simply and only the
parties' rights to a court trial of contractual disputes; under
the clause, the Tribe recognizes, the parties must instead
arbitrate. Brief for Respondent 21 ("An arbitration clause
is what it is: a clause submitting contractual disputes to arbitration."). The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's
commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute resolution
regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not
designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration. See Eyak, 658 P. 2d, at 760
("[W]e believe it is clear that any dispute arising from a contract cannot be resolved by arbitration, as specified in the
contract, if one of the parties intends to assert the defense
of sovereign immunity. . . . The arbitration clause . . . would
be meaningless if it did not constitute a waiver of whatever
immunity [the Tribe] possessed."); Val/Del, 145 Ariz., at 565,
703 P. 2d, at 509 (because the Tribe has "agree[d] that any
dispute would be arbitrated and the result entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, we find that there
was an express waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity");
cf. Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Val-U Constr. Co., 50 F. 3d 560,
562 (CA8 1995) (agreement to arbitrate contractual disputes
did not contain provision for court enforcement; court nonetheless observed that "disputes could not be resolved by arbitration if one party intended to assert sovereign immunity
as a defense").5

no occasion to decide whether parallel principles govern state and tribal
waivers of immunity.

5 The Tribe's apparent concession--that the arbitration clause embodies

the parties' agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration--is not altogether consistent with the Tribe's refusal to participate in the arbitration
proceedings.

423Cite as: 532 U. S. 411 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
The Tribe also asserts that a form contract, designed prin-cipally for private parties who have no immunity to waive,

cannot establish a clear waiver of tribal suit immunity.Brief for Respondent 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28. In appropriate cases, we apply "the common-law rule of contract in-terpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it."
Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.52, 62 (1995) (construing form contract containing arbitration

clause). That rule, however, is inapposite here. The con-tract, as we have explained, is not ambiguous. Nor did the
Tribe find itself holding the short end of an adhesion contractstick: The Tribe proposed and prepared the contract; C & L
foisted no form on a quiescent Tribe. Cf. United States v.Bankers Ins. Co., 245 F. 3d 315, 319-320 (CA4 2001) (where
federal agency prepared agreement, including its arbitrationprovision, sovereign immunity does not shield the agency
from engaging in the arbitration process).6

* * *
For the reasons stated, we conclude that under the agree-ment the Tribe proposed and signed, the Tribe clearly consented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitralawards in Oklahoma state court; the Tribe thereby waived
its sovereign immunity from C & L's suit. The judgment ofthe Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals is therefore reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

6 The Tribe alternatively urges affirmance on the grounds that the contract is void under 25 U. S. C. $ 81 and that the members of the Tribe who
executed the contract lacked the authority to do so on the Tribe's behalf.
These issues were not aired in the Oklahoma courts and are not within
the scope of the questions on which we granted review. We therefore
decline to address them.

COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMAN TOOLGROUP, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 99-2035. Argued February 26, 2001--Decided May 14, 2001
Respondent Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., manufactures a multifunction

tool which improves on the classic Swiss army knife. When petitioner
Cooper Industries, Inc., used photographs of a modified version of
Leatherman's tool in posters, packaging, and advertising materials
introducing a competing tool, Leatherman filed this action asserting,
inter alia, violations of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act).
Ultimately, a trial jury awarded Leatherman $50,000 in compensatory
damages and $4.5 million in punitive damages. Rejecting Cooper's arguments that the punitive damages were grossly excessive under BMW
of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, the District Court entered
judgment. As relevant here, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the punitive
damages award, concluding that the District Court did not abuse its
discretion in declining to reduce that award.

Held: Courts of Appeals should apply a de novo standard when reviewing

district court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. The Ninth Circuit erred in applying the less demanding
abuse-of-discretion standard in this case. Pp. 432-443.

(a) Compensatory damages redress the concrete loss that a plaintiff
has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct, but punitive
damages are private fines intended to punish the defendant and deter
future wrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the former is essentially a
factual determination, but its imposition of the latter is an expression
of its moral condemnation. States have broad discretion in imposing
criminal penalties and punitive damages. Thus, when no constitutional
issue is raised, a federal appellate court reviews the trial court's determination under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279. However, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause imposes
substantive limits on the States' discretion, making the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and
prohibiting States from imposing "grossly excessive" punishments on
tortfeasors, e. g., Gore, 517 U. S., at 562. The cases in which such limits

532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

425Cite as: 532 U. S. 424 (2001)
Syllabus
were enforced involved constitutional violations predicated on judicial
determinations that the punishments were grossly disproportional to
the gravity of the offense. E. g., United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S.
321, 334. The relevant constitutional line is inherently imprecise, id.,
at 336, but, in deciding whether that line has been crossed, this Court
has focused on the same three criteria: (1) the degree of the defendant's
reprehensibility or culpability; (2) the relationship between the penalty
and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant's actions; and (3) the
sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct. See, e. g.,
Gore, 517 U. S., at 575-585; Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 337, 339, 340-343.
Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the instant issue, in each case
the Court has engaged in an independent examination of the relevant
criteria. See, e. g., id., at 337-344; Gore, 517 U. S., at 575-586. The
reasons supporting the Court's holding in Ornelas v. United States, 517
U. S. 690, that trial judges' reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations should be reviewed de novo--that "reasonable suspicion"
and "probable cause" are fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are being expressed; that, because such concepts acquire content only through caseby-case application, independent review is necessary if appellate courts
are to maintain control of, and clarify, legal principles; and that de novo
review tends to unify precedent and stabilize the law--are equally applicable when passing on district court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Pp. 432-436.

(b) Because a jury's award of punitive damages is not a finding
of "fact," appellate review of the District Court's determination
that an award is consistent with due process does not implicate the
Seventh Amendment concerns raised by Leatherman and its amici.
Pp. 437-440.

(c) It seems likely in this case that a thorough, independent review
of the District Court's rejection of Cooper's due process objections to
the punitive damages award might have led the Ninth Circuit to reach
a different result. In fact, this Court's own consideration of the three
Gore factors reveals questionable conclusions by the District Court that
may not survive de novo review and illustrates why the Ninth Circuit's
answer to the constitutional question may depend on the standard of
review. Pp. 441-443.

A jury found petitioner guilty of unfair competition andawarded respondent $50,000 in compensatory damages and

the amount of punitive damages." App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.The issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of review in considering the con-stitutionality of the punitive damages award.

Opinion of the Court

I
The parties are competing tool manufacturers. In the1980's, Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. (Leatherman or respondent), introduced its Pocket Survival Tool (PST). TheCourt of Appeals described the PST as an

"ingenious multi-function pocket tool which improveson the classic `Swiss army knife' in a number of respects.
Not the least of the improvements was the inclusionof pliers, which, when unfolded, are nearly equivalent
to regular full-sized pliers. . . . Leatherman apparentlylargely created and undisputedly now dominates the
market for multi-function pocket tools which generallyresemble the PST."

In 1995, Cooper Industries, Inc. (Cooper or petitioner),decided to design and market a competing multifunction tool.
Cooper planned to copy the basic features of the PST, add afew features of its own, and sell the new tool under the name
"ToolZall." Cooper hoped to capture about 5% of the multi-function tool market. The first ToolZall was designed to be
virtually identical to the PST,1 but the design was ultimatelymodified in response to this litigation. The controversy to
be resolved in this case involves Cooper's improper advertis-ing of its original ToolZall design.

Cooper introduced the original ToolZall in August 1996at the National Hardware Show in Chicago. At that show,
it used photographs in its posters, packaging, and adver-tising materials that purported to be of a ToolZall but were
actually of a modified PST. When those materials were pre-pared, the first of the ToolZalls had not yet been manufac1 The ToolZall was marked with a different name than the PST, was
held together with different fasteners, and, in the words of the Court
of Appeals, "included a serrated blade and certain other small but not
particularly visible differences." Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper
Industries, 199 F. 3d 1009, 1010 (CA9 1999).

tured. A Cooper employee created a ToolZall "mock-up" bygrinding the Leatherman trademark from handles and pliers

of a PST and substituting the unique fastenings that were tobe used on the ToolZall. At least one of the photographs
was retouched to remove a curved indentation where theLeatherman trademark had been. The photographs were
used, not only at the trade show, which normally drawsan audience of over 70,000 people, but also in the marketing materials and catalogs used by Cooper's sales forcethroughout the United States. Cooper also distributed a
touched-up line drawing of a PST to its international salesrepresentatives.

Shortly after the trade show, Leatherman filed this actionasserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising under $ 43(a) of the TrademarkAct of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441, as amended, 15
U. S. C. $ 1125(a) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and a common-lawclaim of unfair competition for advertising and selling an
"imitation" of the PST. In December 1996, the DistrictCourt entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Cooper
from marketing the ToolZall and from using pictures of themodified PST in its advertising. Cooper withdrew the original ToolZall from the market and developed a new modelwith plastic coated handles that differed from the PST. In
November 1996, it had anticipatorily sent a notice to itssales personnel ordering a recall of all promotional materials
containing pictures of the PST, but it did not attempt to re-trieve the materials it had sent to its customers until the
following April. As a result, the offending promotional ma-terials continued to appear in catalogs and advertisements
well into 1997.After a trial conducted in October 1997, the jury returned a verdict that answered several special interrogato2 To "create" the drawing, a Cooper manager photocopied a line-art

Opinion of the Court
ries. With respect to the Lanham Act infringement claims,the jury found that Leatherman had trademark rights in the

overall appearance of the PST and that the original Tool-Zall infringed those rights but that the infringement had
not damaged Leatherman. It then found that the modifiedToolZall did not infringe Leatherman's trademark rights in
the PST. With respect to the advertising claims, it found
Cooper guilty of passing off, false advertising, and unfaircompetition and assessed aggregate damages of $50,000 on

those claims. It then answered "Yes" to the followinginterrogatory:

"Has Leatherman shown by clear and convincing evidence that by engaging in false advertising or passing
off, Cooper acted with malice, or showed a reckless andoutrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk

of harm and has acted with a conscious indifference toLeatherman's rights?" App. 18.

Because it answered this question in the affirmative, the
jury was instructed to determine the "amount of punitivedamages [that] should be awarded to Leatherman."

Ibid.
The jury awarded $4.5 million. Ibid.

After the jury returned its verdict, the District Courtconsidered, and rejected, arguments that the punitive damages were "grossly excessive" under our decision in BMW
of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996). See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. It then entered its judgment,which provided that 60% of the punitive damages would be

paid to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account of theState of Oregon. The judgment also permanently enjoined
Cooper from marketing its original ToolZall in the United
States or in 22 designated foreign countries.

On appeal, Cooper challenged both the District Court's
injunction against copying the PST and the punitive damages award. The Court of Appeals issued two opinions. In
its published opinion it set aside the injunction. Leather532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

man Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper Industries, Inc., supra. Itheld that the overall appearance of the PST was not protected under the trademark laws because its distinguishingfeatures, and the combination of those features, were functional. Accordingly, even though Cooper had deliberatelycopied the PST, it acted lawfully in doing so.

In its unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmedthe punitive damages award. It first rejected Cooper's argument that the Oregon Constitution, which has been in-terpreted to prohibit awards of punitive damages for torts
that impose liability for speech, precluded the jury's awardof such damages in this case. It then reviewed the District
Court's finding that the award "was proportional and fair,given the nature of the conduct, the evidence of intentional
passing off, and the size of an award necessary to create de-terrence to an entity of Cooper's size" and concluded "that
the award did not violate Cooper's due process rights" underthe Federal Constitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, judgt.
order reported at 205 F. 3d 1351 (CA9 1999). It noted thatthe "passing off " in this case was "very unusual" because
"even assuming PST is a superior product," no superiorfeatures of the PST were perceivable in the photographs.

under the Lanham Act, see n. 2, supra, the Court of Appeals set aside that
award and directed the District Court, on remand, to consider whether
the evidence of passing off, standing alone, was sufficient to warrant a fee
award. The Court of Appeals noted that the jury verdict form did not
distinguish between passing off as a Lanham Act claim and passing off as
a matter of state law. Although a fee award under $ 35(a) could not be
supported unless the federal statute was violated, there is no reason to
believe that any possible difference between federal and state passing off
would affect the constitutionality of the punitive damages award.

same sort of potential harm to Leatherman or to customers
as that which may arise from traditional passing off." Id.,
at 4a. The Court of Appeals made clear, however, that it
did not condone the passing off. "[A]t a minimum," it observed, "[the passing off] gave Cooper an unfair advantage"
by allowing it to use Leatherman's work product "to obtain a `mock-up' more cheaply, easily, and quickly" than if it
had waited until its own product was ready. Ibid. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded, "the district court
did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the amount
of punitive damages." Ibid.

Cooper's petition for a writ of certiorari asked us to decide
whether the Court of Appeals reviewed the constitutionality
of the punitive damages award under the correct standard
and also whether the award violated the criteria we articulated in Gore. We granted the petition to resolve confusion
among the Courts of Appeals on the first question.4 531
U. S. 923 (2000). We now conclude that the constitutional
issue merits de novo review. Because the Court of Appeals
applied an "abuse of discretion" standard, we remand the
case for determination of the second question under the
proper standard.

4 Respondent and its amicus at times appear to conflate the question
of the proper standard for reviewing the District Court's due process
determination with the question of the substantive standard for determining the jury award's conformity with due process in the first instance.
See Brief for Arthur F. McEvoy as Amicus Curiae 13 ("[O]n appeal the
litigant's objection to the substance of the jury's holding--whether on
liability or damages--should be evaluated under a `rational factfinder'
standard . . ."); Brief for Respondent 13. The former is the question we
agreed to review. The latter question has already been answered in
BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996). Thus, our
rejection in TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S.
443 (1993), of "heightened scrutiny" of punitive damages awards, see id.,
at 456, is not only wholly consistent with our decision today, it is irrelevant
to our resolution of the question presented.

Opinion of the Court

II
Although compensatory damages and punitive damages
are typically awarded at the same time by the same decision-maker, they serve distinct purposes. The former are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff hassuffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct.
See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 903, pp. 453-454 (1979);
Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 54 (1991)
(O'Connor, J., dissenting). The latter, which have been de-scribed as "quasi-criminal,"

id., at 19, operate as "private
fines" intended to punish the defendant and to deter future
wrongdoing. A jury's assessment of the extent of a plaintiff 's injury is essentially a factual determination, whereas
its imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its
moral condemnation. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418
U. S. 323, 350 (1974) ("[Punitive damages] are not compensation for injury. Instead, they are private fines levied by
civil juries to punish reprehensible conduct and to deter its
future occurrence"); Haslip, 499 U. S., at 54 (O'Connor, J.,
dissenting) ("[P]unitive damages are specifically designed to
exact punishment in excess of actual harm to make clear that
the defendant's misconduct was especially reprehensible").5

Legislatures have extremely broad discretion in defining
criminal offenses, Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 268-269,
n. 18 (1984), and in setting the range of permissible punishments for each offense, ibid.; Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277,
290 (1983). Judicial decisions that operate within these legislatively enacted guidelines are typically reviewed for abuse
of discretion. See, e. g., Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81,
96, 99-100 (1996); cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466,
481 (2000) (it is permissible "for judges to exercise dis5 See also Sunstein, Kahneman, & Schkade, Assessing Punitive Damages
(With Notes on Cognition and Valuation in Law), 107 Yale L. J. 2071, 2074
(1998) ("[P]unitive damages may have a retributive or expressive function,
designed to embody social outrage at the action of serious wrongdoers").

cretion . . . in imposing a judgment within the range pre-scribed by statute").

As in the criminal sentencing context, legislatures enjoybroad discretion in authorizing and limiting permissible punitive damages awards. Cf. Gore, 517 U. S., at 568 ("Statesnecessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the
level of punitive damages that they will allow in differentclasses of cases and in any particular case"). A good many
States have enacted statutes that place limits on the permis-sible size of punitive damages awards.

6 When juries make

particular awards within those limits, the role of the trialjudge is "to determine whether the jury's verdict is within

the confines set by state law, and to determine, by referenceto federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new
trial or remittitur should be ordered." Browning-Ferris
Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257,279 (1989). If no constitutional issue is raised, the role of

the appellate court, at least in the federal system, is merelyto review the trial court's "determination under an abuse-ofdiscretion standard." Ibid.7Despite the broad discretion that States possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitivedamages, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limitson that discretion. That Clause makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and

6 See Gore, 517 U. S., at 614-619 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Since our
decision in Gore, four additional States have added punitive damages caps:
Alabama, Alaska, North Carolina, and Ohio. See Ala. Code $ 6-11-21
(Supp. 2000); Alaska Stat. Ann. $ 09.17.020 (2000); N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 1D-25
(1999); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2315.21 (Supp. 2000).

7 In Browning-Ferris, the petitioner did argue that the award violated

the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, but we held the
Clause inapplicable to punitive damages. The petitioner's reliance on
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was unavailing
because that argument had not been raised in the District Court, the
Court of Appeals, or the certiorari petition. See 492 U. S., at 276-277.

Gore, 517 U. S., at 582. But
in deciding whether that line has been crossed, we have fo-cused on the same general criteria: the degree of the defendant's reprehensibility or culpability, see, e. g., Bajakajian,524 U. S., at 337;

U. S., at 798; Coker, 433 U. S., at 598 (opinion of White, J.);
and the sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct, see, e. g., Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 340-343; Gore,

U. S., at 789-796; Coker, 433 U. S., at 593-597 (opinion of
White, J.). Moreover, and of greatest relevance for the issue
we address today, in each of these cases we have engaged
in an independent examination of the relevant criteria. See,
e. g., Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 337-344; Gore, 517 U. S., at
575-586; Solem, 463 U. S., at 295-300; Enmund, 458 U. S.,
at 788-801; Coker, 433 U. S., at 592-600 (opinion of White, J.).

In Bajakajian, we expressly noted that the courts of
appeals must review the proportionality determination "de
novo" and specifically rejected the suggestion of the respondent, who had prevailed in the District Court, that the
trial judge's determination of excessiveness should be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. "The factual findings made by the district courts in conducting the excessiveness inquiry, of course, must be accepted unless clearly
erroneous. . . . But the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive calls for the application of a constitutional
standard to the facts of a particular case, and in this context
de novo review of that question is appropriate." 524 U. S.,

436 COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. LEATHERMAN

TOOL GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

Likewise, in Ornelas, we held that trial judges' determi-nations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should

be reviewed de novo on appeal. The reasons we gave insupport of that holding are equally applicable in this case.
First, as we observed in Ornelas, the precise meaning of con-cepts like "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause" cannot
be articulated with precision; they are "fluid concepts thattake their substantive content from the particular contexts
in which the standards are being assessed." Id., at 696.That is, of course, also a characteristic of the concept of
"gross excessiveness." Second, "the legal rules for probablecause and reasonable suspicion acquire content only through
application. Independent review is therefore necessary ifappellate courts are to maintain control of, and to clarify,
the legal principles." Id., at 697. Again, this is also trueof the general criteria set forth in

Gore; they will acquiremore meaningful content through case-by-case application

at the appellate level. "Finally, de novo review tends tounify precedent" and " `stabilize the law.' " 517 U. S., at 697-
698. Justice Breyer made a similar point in his concur-ring opinion in

Gore:

"Requiring the application of law, rather than a decision-maker's caprice, does more than simply provide citizens

notice of what actions may subject them to punishment;it also helps to assure the uniform general treatment of
similarly situated persons that is the essence of law it-self." 517 U. S., at 587.

Our decisions in analogous cases, together with the reason-ing that produced those decisions, thus convince us that
courts of appeals should apply a de novo standard of re-view when passing on district courts' determinations of the
constitutionality of punitive damages awards.9

9 Contrary to respondent's assertion, Brief for Respondent 12-13, our
decision today is supported by our reasoning in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.
v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 20-21 (1991). In that case, we emphasized the

"Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, whichpresents a question of historical or predictive fact, see,

e. g.,[St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648 (1915)],

the level of punitive damages is not really a `fact' `tried'by the jury." Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,
518 U. S. 415, 459 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Becausethe jury's award of punitive damages does not constitute a
finding of "fact," appellate review of the district court's de-termination that an award is consistent with due process
does not implicate the Seventh Amendment concerns raisedby respondent and its

amicus.10 See Brief for Respondent18-24; Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of America

as Amicus Curiae 17-20. Our decisions in Gasperini andHetzel v. Prince William County, 523 U. S. 208 (1998) (per

importance of appellate review to ensuring that a jury's award of punitive
damages comports with due process. See id., at 20-21 ("[A]ppellate review makes certain that the punitive damages are reasonable in their
amount and rational in light of their purpose to punish what has occurred
and to deter its repetition").

10 Respondent argues that our decision in Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,

512 U. S. 415 (1994), rests upon the assumption that punitive damages
awards are findings of fact. In that case, we held that the Oregon Constitution, which prohibits the reexamination of any "fact tried by a jury,"
Ore. Const., Art. VII, $ 3, violated due process because it did not allow
for any review of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards. Respondent claims that, because we considered this provision of the Oregon
Constitution to cover punitive damages, we implicitly held that punitive
damages are a "fact tried by a jury." Brief for Respondent 27-28. It
was the Oregon Supreme Court's interpretation of that provision, however, and not our own, that compelled the treatment of punitive damages
as covered. See Oberg, 512 U. S., at 427; see also Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 93, 210 P. 2d 461, 462 (1949) (construing the Oregon
Constitution).

11 Nor does the historical material upon which respondent relies so

extensively, see Brief for Respondent 19-24, conflict with our decision to
require de novo review. Most of the sources respondent cites merely

TOOL GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

It might be argued that the deterrent function of punitivedamages suggests that the amount of such damages awarded

is indeed a "fact" found by the jury and that, as a result, theSeventh Amendment is implicated in appellate review of that
award. Some scholars, for example, assert that punitivedamages should be used to compensate for the underdeterrence of unlawful behavior that will result from a defendant'sevasion of liability. See Polinsky & Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 890-891
stand for the proposition that, perhaps because it is a fact-sensitive undertaking, determining the amount of punitive damages should be left to the
discretion of the jury. See, e. g., Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565
(1886) ("[I]t is the peculiar function of the jury" to set the amount of
punitive damages); Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852) (punitive
damages should be "left to the discretion of the jury"). They do not,
however, indicate that the amount of punitive damages imposed by the
jury is itself a "fact" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment's
Reexamination Clause. See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,
518 U. S. 415, 432 (1996) (distinguishing between the "Trial by Jury"
Clause, which "bears . . . on the allocation of trial functions between judge
and jury," and the "Reexamination" Clause, which "controls the allocation
of authority to review verdicts"); see also id., at 447-448 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (same).

In any event, punitive damages have evolved somewhat since the time
of respondent's sources. Until well into the 19th century, punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries, compensation which was not otherwise available under the narrow conception
of compensatory damages prevalent at the time. See Haslip, 499 U. S.,
at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see also Note, Exemplary Damages in
the Law of Torts, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 517, 520 (1957) (observing a "vacillation"
in the 19th-century cases between "compensatory" and "punitive" theories
of "exemplary damages"). As the types of compensatory damages available to plaintiffs have broadened, see, e. g., 1 J. Nates, C. Kimball, D. Axelrod, & R. Goldstein, Damages in Tort Actions $ 3.01[3][a] (2000) (pain and
suffering are generally available as species of compensatory damages),
the theory behind punitive damages has shifted toward a more purely
punitive (and therefore less factual) understanding. Cf. Note, 70 Harv.
L. Rev., at 520 (noting a historical shift away from a compensatory--and
toward a more purely punitive--conception of punitive damages).

(1998) (in order to obtain optimal deterrence, "punitive dam-ages should equal the harm multiplied by . . . the ratio of the

injurer's chance of escaping liability to his chance of beingfound liable"); see also Ciraolo v. New York, 216 F. 3d 236,
244-245 (CA2 2000) (Calabresi, J., concurring). "The effi-cient deterrence theory thus regards punitive damages as
merely an augmentation of compensatory damages designedto achieve economic efficiency." Galanter & Luban, Poetic
Justice: Punitive Damages and Legal Pluralism, 42 Am. U.L. Rev. 1393, 1449 (1993).

However attractive such an approach to punitive dam-ages might be as an abstract policy matter, it is clear that
juries do not normally engage in such a finely tuned exerciseof deterrence calibration when awarding punitive damages.
See Sunstein, Schkade, & Kahneman, Do People Want Opti-mal Deterrence?, 29 J. Legal Studies 237, 240 (2000). After
all, deterrence is not the only purpose served by punitivedamages. See

supra, at 432. And there is no dispute that,in this case, deterrence was but one of four concerns the

jury was instructed to consider when setting the amount ofpunitive damages.

12 Moreover, it is not at all obvious that

even the deterrent function of punitive damages can beserved

only by economically "optimal deterrence." "[C]iti-zens and legislators may rightly insist that they are willing

to tolerate some loss in economic efficiency in order to deterwhat they consider morally offensive conduct, albeit cost12 The jury was instructed to consider the following factors: (1) "The
character of the defendant's conduct that is the subject of Leatherman's
unfair competition claims"; (2) "The defendant's motive"; (3) "The sum of
money that would be required to discourage the defendant and others from
engaging in such conduct in the future"; and (4) "The defendant's income
and assets." App. 14. Although the jury's application of these instructions may have depended on specific findings of fact, nothing in our decision today suggests that the Seventh Amendment would permit a court,
in reviewing a punitive damages award, to disregard such jury findings.
See, e. g., Gore, 517 U. S., at 579-580.

beneficial morally offensive conduct; efficiency is just oneconsideration among many." Galanter & Luban, 42 Am. U.

L. Rev., at 1450.13Differences in the institutional competence of trial judges
and appellate judges are consistent with our conclusion. In
Gore, we instructed courts evaluating a punitive damages
award's consistency with due process to consider three criteria: (1) the degree or reprehensibility of the defendant's
misconduct, (2) the disparity between the harm (or potential
harm) suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages
award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages
awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or
imposed in comparable cases. 517 U. S., at 574-575. Only
with respect to the first Gore inquiry do the district courts
have a somewhat superior vantage over courts of appeals,
and even then the advantage exists primarily with respect to
issues turning on witness credibility and demeanor.14 Trial
courts and appellate courts seem equally capable of analyzing the second factor. And the third Gore criterion, which
calls for a broad legal comparison, seems more suited to
the expertise of appellate courts. Considerations of institutional competence therefore fail to tip the balance in favor
of deferential appellate review.

13 We express no opinion on the question whether Gasperini would
govern--and de novo review would be inappropriate--if a State were to
adopt a scheme that tied the award of punitive damages more tightly
to the jury's finding of compensatory damages. This might be the case,
for example, if the State's scheme constrained a jury to award only the
exact amount of punitive damages it determined was necessary to obtain
economically optimal deterrence or if it defined punitive damages as a
multiple of compensatory damages (e. g., treble damages).

14 While we have determined that the Court of Appeals must review the

District Court's application of the Gore test de novo, it of course remains
true that the Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings
of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998).

Opinion of the Court

IV
It is possible that the standard of review applied by theCourt of Appeals will affect the result of the

Gore analysisin only a relatively small number of cases. See Brief for

Respondent 46-48; Brief for Association of American Rail-roads as Amicus Curiae 18; see also Gasperini, 518 U. S.,
at 448 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, it does seemlikely that in this case a thorough, independent review of the
District Court's rejection of petitioner's due process ob-jections to the punitive damages award might well have led
the Court of Appeals to reach a different result. Indeed,our own consideration of each of the three

Gore factors re-veals a series of questionable conclusions by the District

Court that may not survive de novo review.When the jury assessed the reprehensibility of Cooper's
misconduct, it was guided by instructions that characterizedthe deliberate copying of the PST as wrongful. The jury's
selection of a penalty to deter wrongful conduct may, there-fore, have been influenced by an intent to deter Cooper from
engaging in such copying in the future. Similarly, the Dis-trict Court's belief that Cooper acted unlawfully in deliberately copying the PST design might have influenced itsconsideration of the first Gore factor. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 23a. But, as the Court of Appeals correctly held, suchcopying of the functional features of an unpatented product
is lawful. See TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,
Inc., ante, p. 23. The Court of Appeals recognized that theDistrict Court's award of attorney's fees could not be supported if based on the premise that the copying was unlaw-ful, but it did not consider whether that improper predicate
might also have undermined the basis for the jury's largepunitive damages award.

In evaluating the second Gore factor, the ratio betweenthe size of the award of punitive damages and the harm
caused by Cooper's tortious conduct, the District Court

TOOL GROUP, INC.

Opinion of the Court

might have been influenced by respondent's submission thatit was not the actual injury--which the jury assessed at

$50,000--that was relevant, but rather "the potential harmLeatherman would have suffered had Cooper succeeded in
its wrongful conduct." See Brief for Respondent 7; seealso Record Doc. No. 323, p. 23. Respondent calculated that
"potential harm" by referring to the fact that Cooper had
anticipated "gross profits of approximately $3 million duringthe first five years of sales." Brief for Respondent 7; see

also Record Doc. No. 323, at 23. Even if that estimate werecorrect, however, it would be unrealistic to assume that all
of Cooper's sales of the ToolZall would have been attributable to its misconduct in using a photograph of a modified
PST in its initial advertising materials. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the picture of the PST did not misrepresent the features of the original ToolZall and could not have
deceived potential customers in any significant way. Its use
was wrongful because it enabled Cooper to expedite the promotion of its tool, but that wrongdoing surely could not be
treated as the principal cause of Cooper's entire sales volume
for a 5-year period.

With respect to the third Gore factor, respondent argues
that Cooper would have been subject to a comparable sanction under Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. Brief
for Respondent 49. In a suit brought by a State under that
Act, a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation may be
assessed. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 646.642(3) (1997). In respondent's view, each of the thousands of pieces of promotional
material containing a picture of the PST that Cooper distributed warranted the maximum fine. Brief for Respondent 49. Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that its preparation of a single "mock-up" for use in a single distribution
would have been viewed as a single violation under the state
statute. Reply Brief for Petitioner 2-3. The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on this dispute. It did, however,
observe that the unfairness in Cooper's use of the picture

532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
apparently had nothing to do with misleading customersbut was related to its inability to obtain a "mock-up" quickly

and cheaply. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. This observationis more consistent with the single-violation theory than
with the notion that the statutory violation would have beensanctioned with a multimillion dollar fine.

We have made these comments on issues raised by appli-cation of the three

Gore guidelines to the facts of this case,not to prejudge the answer to the constitutional question,

but rather to illustrate why we are persuaded that the Courtof Appeals' answer to that question may depend upon the
standard of review. The de novo standard should governits decision. Because the Court of Appeals applied a less
demanding standard in this case, we vacate the judgmentand remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
I continue to believe that the Constitution does notconstrain the size of punitive damages awards. See

BMWof North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 599 (1996)

(Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting). For this rea-son, given the opportunity, I would vote to overrule BMW.
This case, however, does not present such an opportunity.The only issue before us today is what standard should be
used to review a trial court's ruling on a BMW challenge.Because I agree with the Court's resolution of that issue,
I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
I was (and remain) of the view that excessive punitive
damages do not violate the Due Process Clause; but theCourt held otherwise. See

BMW of North America, Inc. v.
Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996); id., at 598 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

of discretion (rather than de novo) fact-bound constitutionalissues which, in their resistance to meaningful generalization, resemble the question of excessiveness of punitivedamages--namely, whether there exists reasonable suspicion
for a stop and probable cause for a search; but the Courtheld otherwise. See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690
(1996); id., at 700 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Finally, in a casein which I joined a dissent that made it unnecessary for
me to reach the issue, the Court categorically stated that"the question whether a fine is constitutionally excessive
calls for . . . de novo review." United States v. Bajakajian,524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998); see

id., at 344 (Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and
Scalia, JJ., dissenting). Given these precedents, I agreethat de novo review of the question of excessive punitive

damages best accords with our jurisprudence. Accordingly,I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
In Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415(1996), we held that appellate review of a federal trial court's

refusal to set aside a jury verdict as excessive is reconcilable
with the Seventh Amendment if "appellate control [is] lim-ited to review for `abuse of discretion.' "

Id., at 419. Gasperini was a diversity action in which the defendant hadchallenged a compensatory damages award as excessive

under New York law. The reasoning of that case appliesas well to an action challenging a punitive damages award
as excessive under the Constitution. I would hold, there-fore, that the proper standard of appellate oversight is not
de novo review, as the Court today concludes, but review forabuse of discretion.

"An essential characteristic of [the federal court] systemis the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury and, under
the influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amend532US2 Unit: $U48 [09-09-02 12:44:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
ment, assigns the decisions of disputed questions of fact tothe jury."

Id., at 432 (citing Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec.
Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958)). The SeventhAmendment provides: "In Suits at common law . . . the right

of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by ajury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the
United States, than according to the rules of the common
law." In Gasperini, we observed that although trial courtstraditionally had broad authority at common law to set aside

jury verdicts and to grant new trials, 518 U. S., at 432-433,"appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion
to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late,
and less secure, development," id., at 434. We ultimately
concluded that the Seventh Amendment does not preclude
such appellate review, id., at 436, but explained that "[w]ithin
the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh
Amendment constraints to lodge in the district court, not
the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application
of [an excessiveness standard]," id., at 438. "Trial judges
have the unique opportunity to consider the evidence in the
living courtroom context," we said, "while appellate judges
see only the cold paper record." Ibid. (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). "If [courts of appeals] reverse,
it must be because of an abuse of discretion. . . . The very
nature of the problem counsels restraint. . . . [Appellate
courts] must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment
of the trial judge." Id., at 438-439 (internal quotation
marks omitted) (citing Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289
F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961)).

Although Gasperini involved compensatory damages, I see
no reason why its logic should be abandoned when punitive
damages are alleged to be excessive. At common law, as our
longstanding decisions reiterate, the task of determining the
amount of punitive damages "has [always been] left to the
discretion of the jury." Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371
(1852); see Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886)

TOOL GROUP, INC.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

("[N]othing is better settled than that . . . it is the peculiarfunction of the jury to determine the amount [of punitive

damages] by their verdict."). The commitment of this func-tion to the jury, we have explained, reflects the historical
understanding that "the degree of punishment to be thusinflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each
case." Day, 13 How., at 371. The relevant factors include
"the conduct and motives of the defendant" and whether,"in committing the wrong complained of, he acted recklessly,

or wilfully and maliciously, with a design to oppress and in-jure the plaintiff." 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 720
(1882). Such inquiry, the Court acknowledges, "is a factsensitive undertaking." Ante, at 438, n. 11.

The Court nevertheless today asserts that a "jury's award
of punitive damages does not constitute a finding of `fact' "
within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. Ante, at
437. An ultimate award of punitive damages, it is true, involves more than the resolution of matters of historical or
predictive fact. See ibid. (citing Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 459
(Scalia, J., dissenting)). But there can be no question that
a jury's verdict on punitive damages is fundamentally dependent on determinations we characterize as factfindings--
e. g., the extent of harm or potential harm caused by the
defendant's misconduct, whether the defendant acted in
good faith, whether the misconduct was an individual instance or part of a broader pattern, whether the defendant behaved negligently, recklessly, or maliciously. Punitive
damages are thus not "[u]nlike the measure of actual damages suffered," ante, at 437 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted), in cases of intangible, noneconomic injury.
One million dollars' worth of pain and suffering does not
exist as a "fact" in the world any more or less than one
million dollars' worth of moral outrage. Both derive their
meaning from a set of underlying facts as determined by a
jury. If one exercise in quantification is properly regarded
as factfinding, see St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
U. S. 648, 661 (1915) (compensation for pain and suffering"involves only a question of fact"), it seems to me the other

should be so regarded as well.In

Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), we approved applicationof an abuse-of-discretion standard for appellate review of a

district court's ruling on a motion to set aside a punitive
damages award as excessive. See id., at 279. BrowningFerris reserved the question whether even such deferential
appellate review might run afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment. At that time (

i. e., pre-Gasperini), the Court "ha[d]
never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allows
appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to
set aside an award as excessive." 492 U. S., at 279, n. 25.
We found it unnecessary to reach the Seventh Amendment
question in Browning-Ferris because the jury verdict there
survived lower court review intact. Id., at 279, n. 25, 280.
Browning-Ferris, in short, signaled our recognition that
appellate review of punitive damages, if permissible at all,
would involve at most abuse-of-discretion review. "[P]articularly . . . because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," we were "reluctant to
stray too far from traditional common-law standards, or to
take steps which ultimately might interfere with the proper
role of the jury." Id., at 280, n. 26.

The Court finds no incompatibility between this case
and Browning-Ferris, observing that Browning-Ferris presented for our review an excessiveness challenge resting
solely on state law, not on the Constitution. See ante, at
433, and n. 7. It is unclear to me why this distinction should
make a difference. Of the three guideposts BMW of North
America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559 (1996), established for
assessing constitutional excessiveness, two were derived
from common-law standards that typically inform state law.
See id., at 575, n. 24 ("The principle that punishment should
fit the crime is deeply rooted and frequently repeated in

common-law jurisprudence." (citation and internal quota-tion marks omitted));

id., at 580 ("The principle that exemplary damages must bear a `reasonable relationship' tocompensatory damages has a long pedigree."). The third

guidepost--comparability of sanctions for comparable misconduct--is not similarly rooted in common law, nor is it
similarly factbound. As the Court states, "the third Gore
criterion . . . calls for a broad legal comparison." Ante, at
440. But to the extent the inquiry is "legal" in character,
there is little difference between review de novo and review for abuse of discretion. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 448
(Stevens, J., dissenting) ("[I]t is a familiar . . . maxim that
deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.").1

Apart from "Seventh Amendment constraints," an abuseof-discretion standard also makes sense for "practical reasons." Id., at 438. With respect to the first Gore inquiry
(i. e., reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct), district
courts have an undeniably superior vantage over courts of
appeals. As earlier noted, supra, at 445, district courts
view the evidence not on a "cold paper record," but "in the
living courtroom context," Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 438.
They can assess from the best seats the vital matter of witness credibility. And "it of course remains true that [a]

1 Appellate courts, following our instruction, apply de novo review to
trial court determinations of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, and excessiveness of fines. See ante, at 435-436 (citing United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 336-337, n. 10 (1998), and Ornelas v. United States,
517 U. S. 690, 696-698 (1996)). But such determinations typically are
made without jury involvement, see, e. g., Bajakajian, 524 U. S., at 325-
326; Ornelas, 517 U. S., at 694, and surely do not implicate the Seventh
Amendment. Moreover, although Bajakajian said "the question whether
a [criminal] fine is constitutionally excessive calls for . . . de novo review,"
524 U. S., at 336-337, n. 10, Bajakajian did not disturb our holding in
Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S.
257 (1989), that the "Excessive Fines Clause does not apply to awards of
punitive damages in [civil] cases between private parties," id., at 260.

Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's find-ings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous." Ante, at

440, n. 14.2The Court recognizes that district courts have the edge
on the first Gore factor, ante, at 440, but goes on to saythat "[t]rial courts and appellate courts seem equally capable
of analyzing the second [Gore] factor" (i. e., whether punitivedamages bear a reasonable relationship to the actual harm
inflicted), ibid. Only "the third Gore criterion [i. e., intra-jurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons] . . . seems
more suited to the expertise of appellate courts." Ibid.To the extent the second factor requires a determination
of "the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff," Gore, 517 U. S.,at 580, district courts may be better positioned to conduct
the inquiry, especially in cases of intangible injury. I candemur to the Court's assessment of relative institutional
strengths, however, for even accepting that assessment,I would disagree with the Court's conclusion that "[c]onsiderations of institutional competence . . . fail to tip the balancein favor of deferential appellate review," ante, at 440. Gore
itself assigned particular importance to the first inquiry,characterizing "degree of reprehensibility" as "[p]erhaps the
most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitivedamages award." 517 U. S., at 575. District courts, as just
noted, supra, at 448 and this page, have a superior vantageover courts of appeals in conducting that fact-intensive inquiry. Therefore, in the typical case envisioned by Gore,where reasonableness is primarily tied to reprehensibility, an
appellate court should have infrequent occasion to reverse.This observation, I readily acknowledge, suggests that
the practical difference between the Court's approach and

my own is not large. An abuse-of-discretion standard, asI see it, hews more closely to "the strictures of the Seventh Amendment," Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 280, n. 26.The Court's de novo standard is more complex. It requires
lower courts to distinguish between ordinary common-lawexcessiveness and constitutional excessiveness, ante, at 433,
and to separate out factfindings that qualify for "clearly erro-neous" review,

ante, at 440, n. 14. See also ante, at 440, n. 13(suggesting abuse-of-discretion review might be in order

"if a State were to adopt a scheme that tied the award ofpunitive damages more tightly to the jury's finding of compensatory damages"). The Court's approach will be chal-lenging to administer. Complex as it is, I suspect that approach and mine will yield different outcomes in few cases.The Ninth Circuit, I conclude, properly identified abuse
of discretion as the appropriate standard in reviewing theDistrict Court's determination that the punitive damages
awarded against Cooper were not grossly excessive. Forthe Seventh Amendment and practical reasons stated, I
would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

ROGERS v. TENNESSEE
certiorari to the supreme court of tennessee

No. 99-6218. Argued November 1, 2000--Decided May 14, 2001
Following James Bowdery's death some 15 months after petitioner

stabbed him, petitioner was convicted in Tennessee state court of second
degree murder under the State's criminal homicide statute. Although
that statute makes no mention of the common law "year and a day
rule"--under which no defendant could be convicted of murder unless
his victim died by the defendant's act within a year and a day of the
act, see, e. g., Louisville, E. & St. L. R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U. S. 230, 239--
petitioner argued on appeal that the rule persisted as part of the State's
common law and, as such, precluded his conviction. The Tennessee
Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed and affirmed the conviction. In
affirming, the State Supreme Court abolished the rule, finding that the
reasons for recognizing the rule at common law no longer existed. The
court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would violate the Ex Post Facto
Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, observing that those
provisions refer only to legislative Acts. The court also concluded that
application of its decision to petitioner would not run afoul of Bouie v.
City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354, in which this Court held that due
process prohibits retroactive application of any judicial construction of
a criminal statute that is unexpected and indefensible by reference to
the law which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.

Held: The Tennessee Supreme Court's retroactive application to petitioner of its decision abolishing the year and a day rule did not deny
petitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 456-467.

(a) To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause, he misreads Bouie. Bouie contains some dicta suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues, see, e. g., 378 U. S., at 353-354,
but the decision was rooted firmly in well established notions of due
process. Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice,
foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to
what previously had been innocent conduct, see, e. g., id., at 351, 352,
354-355. Subsequent decisions have not interpreted Bouie as extending so far as petitioner suggests, but have uniformly viewed Bouie

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
452 ROGERS v. TENNESSEE

Syllabus
as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so, they have
applied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but, rather, in accordance with the more basic and general principle of fair warning that
Bouie so clearly articulated. See, e. g., United States v. Lanier, 520
U. S. 259, 266. While petitioner's assertion that the two Clauses safeguard common interests is undoubtedly correct, he is mistaken to suggest that these considerations compel extending the Ex Post Facto
Clause's strictures to the context of common law judging through the
rubric of due process. Such an extension would circumvent the Ex Post
Facto Clause's clear text, which expressly applies only to legislatures;
would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating and common law decisionmaking;
would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks
any evolving legal system; and would unduly impair the incremental and
reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common
law system. It was on account of such concerns that Bouie restricted
due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the
conduct in issue. See 378 U. S., at 354. That restriction adequately
serves the common law context as well. Pp. 456-462.

(b) The Tennessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was not
unexpected and indefensible. Advances in medical and related science
have so undermined the rule's usefulness as to render it without question obsolete, and it has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the
vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. Despite petitioner's argument to the contrary, the fact that a vast number
of jurisdictions outside Tennessee have abolished the rule is surely relevant to whether its abolition in his case, which involves the continuing
viability of a common law rule, can be said to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law as it then existed. Bouie, supra, at
359-360, distinguished. Perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the rule had only the most tenuous foothold as part of
Tennessee's criminal law. It did not exist as part of the State's statutory criminal code, and while the Tennessee Supreme Court concluded
that the rule persisted at common law, it also pointedly observed that
the rule had never once served as a ground of decision in any murder
prosecution in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases,
the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time in dicta.
These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was "unexpected and indefensible" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated in Bouie and its progeny. There is noth532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing to indicate that abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented
an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against
which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far from a marked and

a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking that brought the law
into conformity with reason and common sense. Pp. 462-467.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the constitutionality of the retroactiveapplication of a judicial decision abolishing the common law

"year and a day rule." At common law, the year and a dayrule provided that no defendant could be convicted of murder
unless his victim had died by the defendant's act within ayear and a day of the act. See,

e. g., Louisville, E. & St. L.
R. Co. v. Clarke, 152 U. S. 230, 239 (1894); 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries on the Laws of England 197-198 (1769). The

Supreme Court of Tennessee abolished the rule as it hadexisted at common law in Tennessee and applied its decision
to petitioner to uphold his conviction. The question beforeus is whether, in doing so, the court denied petitioner due
process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

454 ROGERS v. TENNESSEE

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner Wilbert K. Rogers was convicted in Tennesseestate court of second degree murder. According to the undisputed facts, petitioner stabbed his victim, James Bow-dery, with a butcher knife on May 6, 1994. One of the stab
wounds penetrated Bowdery's heart. During surgery to re-pair the wound to his heart, Bowdery went into cardiac arrest, but was resuscitated and survived the procedure. Asa result, however, he had developed a condition known as
"cerebral hypoxia," which results from a loss of oxygen tothe brain. Bowdery's higher brain functions had ceased,
and he slipped into and remained in a coma until August7, 1995, when he died from a kidney infection (a common
complication experienced by comatose patients). Approxi-mately 15 months had passed between the stabbing and
Bowdery's death which, according to the undisputed testi-mony of the county medical examiner, was caused by cerebral hypoxia " `secondary to a stab wound to the heart.' "992 S. W. 2d 393, 395 (Tenn. 1999).

Based on this evidence, the jury found petitioner guiltyunder Tennessee's criminal homicide statute. The statute,
which makes no mention of the year and a day rule, definescriminal homicide simply as "the unlawful killing of another
person which may be first degree murder, second degreemurder, voluntary manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide." Tenn. Code Ann. $ 39-13-201(1997). Petitioner appealed his conviction to the Tennessee
Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that, despite its absencefrom the statute, the year and a day rule persisted as part
of the common law of Tennessee and, as such, precluded hisconviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed the conviction. The court held thatTennessee's Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (1989
Act), which abolished all common law defenses in criminalactions in Tennessee, had abolished the rule. See Tenn.
Code Ann. $ 39-11-203(e)(2) (1997). The court also rejected

Opinion of the Court
petitioner's further contention that the legislative abolition
of the rule constituted an ex post facto violation, noting that
the 1989 Act had taken effect five years before petitioner
committed his crime. No. 02C01-9611-CR-00418 (Tenn.
Crim. App., Oct. 17, 1997), App. 7.

The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed on different
grounds. The court observed that it had recognized the viability of the year and a day rule in Tennessee in Percer v.
State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780 (1907), and that, "[d]espite
the paucity of case law" on the rule in Tennessee, "both
parties . . . agree that the . . . rule was a part of the common
law of this State." 992 S. W. 2d, at 396. Turning to the
rule's present status, the court noted that the rule has been
legislatively or judicially abolished by the "vast majority" of
jurisdictions recently to have considered the issue. Id., at
397. The court concluded that, contrary to the conclusion of
the Court of Criminal Appeals, the 1989 Act had not abolished the rule. After reviewing the justifications for the
rule at common law, however, the court found that the original reasons for recognizing the rule no longer exist. Accordingly, the court abolished the rule as it had existed at
common law in Tennessee. Id., at 399-401.

The court disagreed with petitioner's contention that application of its decision abolishing the rule to his case would
violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the State and Federal
Constitutions. Those constitutional provisions, the court
observed, refer only to legislative Acts. The court then
noted that in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964),
this Court held that due process prohibits retroactive application of any " `judicial construction of a criminal statute
[that] is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law
which has been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.' "
992 S. W. 2d, at 402 (quoting Bouie v. City of Columbia,
supra, at 354) (alteration in original). The court concluded,
however, that application of its decision to petitioner would

Opinion of the Court
not offend this principle. 992 S. W. 2d, at 402. We grantedcertiorari, 529 U. S. 1129 (2000), and we now affirm.

II
Although petitioner's claim is one of due process, the Con-stitution's Ex Post Facto Clause figures prominently in his

argument. The Clause provides simply that "[n]o Stateshall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law." Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1.
The most well-known and oft-repeated explanation of thescope of the Clause's protection was given by Justice Chase,
who long ago identified, in dictum, four types of laws towhich the Clause extends:

"1st. Every law that makes an action done before thepassing of the law, and which was innocent when done,
criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every lawthat aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was,
when committed. 3d. Every law that changes thepunishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than
the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th.Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and
receives less, or different, testimony, than the law re-quired at the time of the commission of the offense, in
order to convict the offender." Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.386, 390 (1798) (

seriatim opinion of Chase, J.) (empha-sis deleted).

Accord, Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 521-525 (2000); Col-lins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41-42, 46 (1990). As the
text of the Clause makes clear, it "is a limitation upon thepowers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply
to the Judicial Branch of government." Marks v. UnitedStates, 430 U. S. 188, 191 (1977) (citation omitted).

We have observed, however, that limitations on ex postfacto judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notion of
due process. In Bouie v. City of Columbia, we consideredthe South Carolina Supreme Court's retroactive application

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

457Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
of its construction of the State's criminal trespass statute tothe petitioners in that case. The statute prohibited "entry

upon the lands of another . . . after notice from the owner ortenant prohibiting such entry . . . ." 378 U. S., at 349, n. 1
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The SouthCarolina court construed the statute to extend to patrons of
a drug store who had received no notice prohibiting their
entry into the store, but had refused to leave the store whenasked. Prior to the court's decision, South Carolina cases

construing the statute had uniformly held that convictionunder the statute required proof of notice before entry.
None of those cases, moreover, had given the "slightest indication that that requirement could be satisfied by proof of
the different act of remaining on the land after being told to
leave." Id., at 357.

We held that the South Carolina court's retroactive application of its construction to the store patrons violated due
process. Reviewing decisions in which we had held criminal
statutes "void for vagueness" under the Due Process Clause,
we noted that this Court has often recognized the "basic
principle that a criminal statute must give fair warning of
the conduct that it makes a crime." Id., at 350; see id., at
350-352 (discussing, inter alia, United States v. Harriss, 347
U. S. 612 (1954), Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451 (1939),
and Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385 (1926)).
Deprivation of the right to fair warning, we continued, can
result both from vague statutory language and from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of statutory
language that appears narrow and precise on its face.
Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S., at 352. For that reason, we concluded that "[i]f a judicial construction of a criminal statute is `unexpected and indefensible by reference to
the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in
issue,' [the construction] must not be given retroactive effect." Id., at 354 (quoting J. Hall, General Principles of
Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960)). We found that the South

458 ROGERS v. TENNESSEE

Opinion of the Court
Carolina court's construction of the statute violated this
principle because it was so clearly at odds with the statute's
plain language and had no support in prior South Carolina
decisions. 378 U. S., at 356.

Relying largely upon Bouie, petitioner argues that the
Tennessee court erred in rejecting his claim that the retroactive application of its decision to his case violates due process. Petitioner contends that the Ex Post Facto Clause
would prohibit the retroactive application of a decision abolishing the year and a day rule if accomplished by the Tennessee Legislature. He claims that the purposes behind the
Clause are so fundamental that due process should prevent
the Supreme Court of Tennessee from accomplishing the
same result by judicial decree. Brief for Petitioner 8-18.
In support of this claim, petitioner takes Bouie to stand for
the proposition that "[i]n evaluating whether the retroactive
application of a judicial decree violates Due Process, a critical question is whether the Constitution would prohibit the
same result attained by the exercise of the state's legislative
power." Brief for Petitioner 12.

To the extent petitioner argues that the Due Process
Clause incorporates the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post
Facto Clause as identified in Calder, petitioner misreads
Bouie. To be sure, our opinion in Bouie does contain some
expansive language that is suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues. Most prominent is our
statement that "[i]f a state legislature is barred by the
Ex Post Facto Clause from passing . . . a law, it must follow
that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process
Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial
construction." 378 U. S., at 353-354; see also id., at 353
("[A]n unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post
facto law"); id., at 362 ("The Due Process Clause compels the
same result" as would the constitutional proscription against
ex post facto laws "where the State has sought to achieve

Opinion of the Court
precisely the same [impermissible] effect by judicial con-struction of the statute"). This language, however, was

dicta. Our decision in Bouie was rooted firmly in well es-tablished notions of

due process. See supra, at 457-458.
Its rationale rested on core due process concepts of notice,foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning

as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching
criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent con-duct. See,

e. g., 378 U. S., at 351, 352, 354-355. And we
couched its holding squarely in terms of that establisheddue process right, and not in terms of the

ex post factorelated dicta to which petitioner points. Id., at 355 (conclud-ing that "the South Carolina Code did not give [the petitioners] fair warning, at the time of their conduct . . . , thatthe act for which they now stand convicted was rendered
criminal by the statute"). Contrary to petitioner's sugges-tion, nowhere in the opinion did we go so far as to incorporate jot-for-jot the specific categories of Calder into dueprocess limitations on the retroactive application of judicial
decisions.

Nor have any of our subsequent decisions addressing
Bouie-type claims interpreted Bouie as extending so far.
Those decisions instead have uniformly viewed Bouie as restricted to its traditional due process roots. In doing so,
they have applied Bouie's check on retroactive judicial decisionmaking not by reference to the ex post facto categories
set out in Calder, but, rather, in accordance with the more
basic and general principle of fair warning that Bouie so
clearly articulated. See, e. g., United States v. Lanier, 520
U. S. 259, 266 (1997) ("[D]ue process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that
neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly
disclosed to be within its scope"); Marks v. United States,
430 U. S., at 191-192 (Due process protects against judicial
infringement of the "right to fair warning" that certain conduct will give rise to criminal penalties); Rose v. Locke, 423
U. S. 48, 53 (1975) (per curiam) (upholding defendant's con532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

viction under statute prohibiting "crimes against nature" be-cause, unlike in

Bouie, the defendant "[could] make no claim
that [the statute] afforded no notice that his conduct mightbe within its scope");

Douglas v. Buder, 412 U. S. 430, 432
(1973) (per curiam) (trial court's construction of the term"arrest" as including a traffic citation, and application of that

construction to defendant to revoke his probation, was unforeseeable and thus violated due process); Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313, 316 (1972) (per curiam) (reversing conviction under state obscenity law because it did "not giv[e] fairnotice" that the location of the allegedly obscene exhibition

was a vital element of the offense).

Petitioner observes that the Due Process and Ex Post
Facto Clauses safeguard common interests--in particular,
the interests in fundamental fairness (through notice and fair
warning) and the prevention of the arbitrary and vindictive
use of the laws. Brief for Petitioner 12-18. While this is
undoubtedly correct, see, e. g., Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433,
439-440, and n. 12 (1997), petitioner is mistaken to suggest
that these considerations compel extending the strictures of
the Ex Post Facto Clause to the context of common law judging. The Ex Post Facto Clause, by its own terms, does not
apply to courts. Extending the Clause to courts through
the rubric of due process thus would circumvent the clear
constitutional text. It also would evince too little regard for
the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating, on the one hand, and common law decisionmaking, on the other.

Petitioner contends that state courts acting in their common law capacity act much like legislatures in the exercise
of their lawmaking function, and indeed may in some cases
even be subject to the same kinds of political influences and
pressures that justify ex post facto limitations upon legislatures. Brief for Petitioner 12-18; Reply Brief for Petitioner

in construing existing law in actual litigation." James v.
United States, 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, "[g]iventhe divergent pulls of flexibility and precedent in our case

law system," ibid., incorporation of the Calder categoriesinto due process limitations on judicial decisionmaking would
place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal
judicial processes and would be incompatible with the resolu-tion of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system.

That is particularly so where, as here, the allegedly imper-missible judicial application of a rule of law involves not the
interpretation of a statute but an act of common law judging.
In the context of common law doctrines (such as the year
and a day rule), there often arises a need to clarify or even
to reevaluate prior opinions as new circumstances and fact
patterns present themselves. Such judicial acts, whether
they be characterized as "making" or "finding" the law, are
a necessary part of the judicial business in States in which
the criminal law retains some of its common law elements.
Strict application of ex post facto principles in that context
would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law
system. The common law, in short, presupposes a measure
of evolution that is incompatible with stringent application
of ex post facto principles. It was on account of concerns
such as these that Bouie restricted due process limitations
on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of
criminal statutes to those that are "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior
to the conduct in issue." Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378
U. S., at 354 (internal quotation marks omitted).

We believe this limitation adequately serves the common
law context as well. It accords common law courts the substantial leeway they must enjoy as they engage in the daily
task of formulating and passing upon criminal defenses and
interpreting such doctrines as causation and intent, reevalu532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
462 ROGERS v. TENNESSEE

Opinion of the Court
ating and refining them as may be necessary to bring thecommon law into conformity with logic and common sense.

It also adequately respects the due process concern with fun-damental fairness and protects against vindictive or arbitrary judicial lawmaking by safeguarding defendants againstunjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law. Accordingly, we conclude that a judicial alteration of a commonlaw doctrine of criminal law violates the principle of fair
warning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, onlywhere it is "unexpected and indefensible by reference to
the law which had been expressed prior to the conductin issue."

Ibid.
Justice Scalia makes much of the fact that, at the timeof the framing of the Constitution, it was widely accepted

that courts could not "change" the law, see post, at 472-473,477-478 (dissenting opinion), and that (according to

Justice
Scalia) there is no doubt that the Ex Post Facto Clausewould have prohibited a legislative decision identical to the

Tennessee court's decision here, see post, at 469-471, 478.This latter argument seeks at bottom merely to reopen what
has long been settled by the constitutional text and our owndecisions: that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to
judicial decisionmaking. The former argument is beside thepoint. Common law courts at the time of the framing undoubtedly believed that they were finding rather than mak-ing law. But, however one characterizes their actions, the
fact of the matter is that common law courts then, as now,were deciding cases, and in doing so were fashioning and
refining the law as it then existed in light of reason and expe-rience. Due process clearly did not prohibit this process of
judicial evolution at the time of the framing, and it does notdo so today.

III
Turning to the particular facts of the instant case, the Ten-nessee court's abolition of the year and a day rule was not

unexpected and indefensible. The year and a day rule iswidely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law. Peti532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tioner does not even so much as hint that good reasons existfor retaining the rule, and so we need not delve too deeply

into the rule and its history here. Suffice it to say that therule is generally believed to date back to the 13th century,
when it served as a statute of limitations governing the timein which an individual might initiate a private action for murder known as an "appeal of death"; that by the 18th century
the rule had been extended to the law governing publicprosecutions for murder; that the primary and most frequently cited justification for the rule is that 13th centurymedical science was incapable of establishing causation beyond a reasonable doubt when a great deal of time hadelapsed between the injury to the victim and his death; and
that, as practically every court recently to have consideredthe rule has noted, advances in medical and related science
have so undermined the usefulness of the rule as to renderit without question obsolete. See,

e. g., People v. Carrillo,
164 Ill. 2d 144, 150, 646 N. E. 2d 582, 585 (1995); Commonwealth v. Lewis, 381 Mass. 411, 414-415, 409 N. E. 2d 771,
772-773 (1980); People v. Stevenson, 416 Mich. 383, 391-392,
331 N. W. 2d 143, 146 (1982); State v. Hefler, 310 N. C. 135,138-140, 310 S. E. 2d 310, 313 (1984); see generally Comment,

59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1337 (1992) (tracing the history of the
rule).

For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. See 992 S. W. 2d,
at 397, n. 4 (reviewing cases and statutes). Citing Bouie,
petitioner contends that the judicial abolition of the rule in
other jurisdictions is irrelevant to whether he had fair warning that the rule in Tennessee might similarly be abolished
and, hence, to whether the Tennessee court's decision was
unexpected and indefensible as applied to him. Brief for
Petitioner 28-30. In discussing the apparent meaning of the
South Carolina statute in Bouie, we noted that "[i]t would be
a rare situation in which the meaning of a statute of another
State sufficed to afford a person `fair warning' that his own

Opinion of the Court
State's statute meant something quite different from whatits words said." 378 U. S., at 359-360. This case, however,

involves not the precise meaning of the words of a particularstatute, but rather the continuing viability of a common law
rule. Common law courts frequently look to the decisionsof other jurisdictions in determining whether to alter or
modify a common law rule in light of changed circumstances,
increased knowledge, and general logic and experience.Due process, of course, does not require a person to apprise

himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guaran-tee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in
light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet madeits way to his State. At the same time, however, the fact
that a vast number of jurisdictions have abolished a rule thathas so clearly outlived its purpose is surely relevant to
whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can besaid to be unexpected and indefensible by reference to the
law as it then existed.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, at the time of petitioner's crime the year and a day rule had only the most
tenuous foothold as part of the criminal law of the State ofTennessee. The rule did not exist as part of Tennessee's

statutory criminal code. And while the Supreme Court of
Tennessee concluded that the rule persisted at common law,
it also pointedly observed that the rule had never once
served as a ground of decision in any prosecution for murder
in the State. Indeed, in all the reported Tennessee cases,
the rule has been mentioned only three times, and each time
in dicta.

The first mention of the rule in Tennessee, and the only
mention of it by the Supreme Court of that State, was in
1907 in Percer v. State, 118 Tenn. 765, 103 S. W. 780. In
Percer, the court reversed the defendant's conviction for second degree murder because the defendant was not present
in court when the verdict was announced and because the
proof failed to show that the murder occurred prior to the
finding of the indictment. In discussing the latter ground

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

465Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
for its decision, the court quoted the rule that " `it is . . . forthe State to show that the crime was committed before the

indictment was found, and, where it fails to do so, a convic-tion will be reversed.' "

Id., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783 (quoting 12 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 382 (1904)). Thecourt then also quoted the rule that " `[i]n murder, the death

must be proven to have taken place within a year and a day
from the date of the injury received.' " 118 Tenn., at 777,103 S. W., at 783 (quoting F. Wharton, Law of Homicide $ 18

(3d ed. 1907)).While petitioner relies on this case for the proposition that
the year and a day rule was firmly entrenched in the commonlaw of Tennessee, we agree with the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the case cannot establish nearly so much. Afterreciting the rules just mentioned, the court in

Percer went
on to point out that the indictment was found on July 6, 1906;that it charged that the murder was committed sometime in

May 1906; and that the only evidence of when the victim diedwas testimony from a witness stating that he thought the
death occurred sometime in July, but specifying neither a
date nor a year. From this, the court concluded that it did"not affirmatively appear" from the evidence "whether the

death occurred before or after the finding of the indictment."
118 Tenn., at 777, 103 S. W., at 783. The court made no
mention of the year and a day rule anywhere in its legal
analysis or, for that matter, anywhere else in its opinion.
Thus, whatever the import of the court's earlier quoting of
the rule, it is clear that the rule did not serve as the basis
for the Percer court's decision.

The next two references to the rule both were by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals in cases in which the date
of the victim's death was not even in issue. Sixty-seven
years after Percer, the court in Cole v. State, 512 S. W. 2d
598 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974), noted the existence of the rule
in rejecting the defendants' contentions that insufficient evidence existed to support the jury's conclusion that they had
caused the victim's death in a drag-racing crash. Id., at 601.

in arguing that the operative cause of his victim's death wasremoval of life support rather than a gunshot wound at the
defendant's hand. The victim had died within 10 days ofreceiving the wound. The Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the defendant's argument, concluding, as it had in this
case, that the year and a day rule had been abolished by the1989 Act. It went on to hold that the evidence of causation

was sufficient to support the conviction. Id., at 773-777.
Ruane, of course, was decided after petitioner committed his
crime, and it concluded that the year and a day rule no longer
existed in Tennessee for a reason that the high court of that
State ultimately rejected. But we note the case nonetheless
to complete our account of the few appearances of the common law rule in the decisions of the Tennessee courts.

These cases hardly suggest that the Tennessee court's decision was "unexpected and indefensible" such that it offended the due process principle of fair warning articulated
in Bouie and its progeny. This is so despite the fact that,
as Justice Scalia correctly points out, the court viewed the
year and a day rule as a "substantive principle" of the common law of Tennessee. See post, at 480. As such, however,
it was a principle in name only, having never once been
enforced in the State. The Supreme Court of Tennessee
also emphasized this fact in its opinion, see 992 S. W. 2d, at
402, and rightly so, for it is surely relevant to whether the
court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case violated due
process limitations on retroactive judicial decisionmaking.
And while we readily agree with Justice Scalia that fundamental due process prohibits the punishment of conduct that
cannot fairly be said to have been criminal at the time the
conduct occurred, see, e. g., post, at 470, 478, 480, nothing
suggests that is what took place here.

There is, in short, nothing to indicate that the Tennessee
court's abolition of the rule in petitioner's case represented

an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial actionagainst which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. Far

from a marked and unpredictable departure from prior prec-edent, the court's decision was a routine exercise of common
law decisionmaking in which the court brought the law intoconformity with reason and common sense. It did so by laying to rest an archaic and outdated rule that had never been
relied upon as a ground of decision in any reported Tennes-see case.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee isaccordingly affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
While I have joined Justice Scalia's entire dissent,
I must add this brief caveat. The perception that commonlaw judges had no power to change the law was unquestionably an important aspect of our judicial heritage in the 17th
century but, as he has explained, that perception has played
a role of diminishing importance in later years. Whether
the most significant changes in that perception occurred before the end of the 18th century or early in the 19th century
is, in my judgment, a tangential question that need not be
resolved in order to decide this case correctly. For me, far
more important than the historical issue is the fact that the
majority has undervalued the threat to liberty that is posed
whenever the criminal law is changed retroactively.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Thomas join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as
to Part II, dissenting.

The Court today approves the conviction of a man for a
murder that was not murder (but only manslaughter) when
the offense was committed. It thus violates a principle--
encapsulated in the maxim nulla poena sine lege--which
"dates from the ancient Greeks" and has been described as

Scalia, J., dissenting
one of the most "widely held value-judgment[s] in the entire
history of human thought." J. Hall, General Principles of
Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960). Today's opinion produces,
moreover, a curious constitution that only a judge could love.
One in which (by virtue of the Ex Post Facto Clause) the
elected representatives of all the people cannot retroactively
make murder what was not murder when the act was committed; but in which unelected judges can do precisely that.
One in which the predictability of parliamentary lawmaking
cannot validate the retroactive creation of crimes, but the
predictability of judicial lawmaking can do so. I do not believe this is the system that the Framers envisioned--or, for
that matter, that any reasonable person would imagine.

I
A

To begin with, let us be clear that the law here was altered
after the fact. Petitioner, whatever else he was guilty of,
was innocent of murder under the law as it stood at the time
of the stabbing, because the victim did not die until after a
year and a day had passed. The requisite condition subsequent of the murder victim's death within a year and a day
is no different from the requisite condition subsequent of the
rape victim's raising a "hue and cry" which we held could
not retroactively be eliminated in Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S.
513 (2000). Here, as there, it operates to bar conviction.
Indeed, if the present condition differs at all from the one
involved in Carmell it is in the fact that it does not merely
pertain to the "quantum of evidence" necessary to corroborate a charge, id., at 530, but is an actual element of the
crime--a "substantive principle of law," 992 S. W. 2d 393, 399
(Tenn. 1999), the failure to establish which "entirely precludes a murder prosecution," id., at 400. Though the Court
spends some time questioning whether the year-and-a-day
rule was ever truly established in Tennessee, see ante, at

464-466, the Supreme Court of Tennessee said it was, see992 S. W. 2d, at 396, 400, and this reasonable reading of state

law by the State's highest court is binding upon us.Petitioner's claim is that his conviction violated the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar asthat Clause contains the principle applied against the legislature by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I. We first discussed the relationship between these two Clauses in Bouiev.

City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964). There, we considered Justice Chase to have spoken for the Court in Calder v.
Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), when he defined an ex post facto
law as, inter alia, one that "aggravates a crime, or makes
it greater than it was, when committed." 378 U. S., at 353
(emphasis deleted). We concluded that, "[i]f a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing
such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is
barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely
the same result by judicial construction." Id., at 353-354.
The Court seeks to avoid the obvious import of this language
by characterizing it as mere dicta. See ante, at 459. Only
a concept of dictum that includes the very reasoning of the
opinion could support this characterization. The ratio decidendi of Bouie was that the principle applied to the legislature though the Ex Post Facto Clause was contained in the
Due Process Clause insofar as judicial action is concerned.
I cannot understand why the Court derives such comfort
from the fact that later opinions applying Bouie have referred to the Due Process Clause rather than the Ex Post
Facto Clause, see ante, at 459-460; that is entirely in accord
with the rationale of the case, which I follow and which the
Court discards.

The Court attempts to cabin Bouie by reading it to prohibit only " `unexpected and indefensible' " judicial law revision, and to permit retroactive judicial changes so long as
the defendant has had "fair warning" that the changes might
occur. Ante, at 462. This reading seems plausible because

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
470 ROGERS v. TENNESSEE

Scalia, J., dissenting
Bouie does indeed use those quoted terms; but they havebeen wrenched entirely out of context. The "fair warning"

to which Bouie and subsequent cases referred was not "fairwarning that the law might be changed," but fair warning

of
what constituted the crime at the time of the offense. And
Bouie did not express disapproval of "unexpected and indefensible changes in the law" (and thus implicitly approve "expected or defensible changes"). It expressed disapproval of"

judicial construction of a criminal statute" that is "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had
been expressed prior to the conduct in issue." 378 U. S., at
354 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). It
thus implicitly approved only a judicial construction that was
an expected or defensible application of prior cases interpreting the statute. Extending this principle from statutory crimes to common-law crimes would result in the approval of retroactive holdings that accord with prior cases
expounding the common law, and the disapproval of retroactive holdings that clearly depart from prior cases expounding
the common law. According to Bouie, not just "unexpected
and indefensible" retroactive changes in the common law of
crimes are bad, but all retroactive changes.

Bouie rested squarely upon "[t]he fundamental principle
that `the required criminal law must have existed when the
conduct in issue occurred,' " ibid. (Nulla poena sine lege.)
Proceeding from that principle, Bouie said that "a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from
achieving precisely the same result [prohibited by the Ex
Post Facto Clause] by judicial construction." Id., at 353-
354. There is no doubt that "fair warning" of the legislature's intent to change the law does not insulate retroactive
legislative criminalization. Such a statute violates the Ex
Post Facto Clause, no matter that, at the time the offense
was committed, the bill enacting the change was pending and
assured of passage--or indeed, had already been passed but
not yet signed by the President whose administration had

Scalia, J., dissenting
proposed it. It follows from the analysis of Bouie that "fairwarning" of impending change cannot insulate retroactive

judicial criminalization either.Nor is there any reason in the nature of things why it
should. According to the Court, the exception is neces-sary because prohibiting retroactive judicial criminalization
would "place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on
normal judicial processes," would be "incompatible with theresolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system," and would "unduly impair the incremental and rea-soned development of precedent that is the foundation of the
common law system." Ante, at 461. That assessment ignores the crucial difference between simply applying a law
to a new set of circumstances and changing the law that has
previously been applied to the very circumstances before the
court. Many criminal cases present some factual nuance
that arguably distinguishes them from cases that have come
before; a court applying the penal statute to the new fact
pattern does not purport to change the law. That, however,
is not the action before us here, but rather, a square, head-on
overruling of prior law--or, more accurately, something
even more extreme than that: a judicial opinion acknowledging that under prior law, for reasons that used to be valid,
the accused could not be convicted, but decreeing that, because of changed circumstances, "we hereby abolish the common law rule," 992 S. W. 2d, at 401, and upholding the conviction by applying the new rule to conduct that occurred
before the change in law was announced. Even in civil
cases, and even in modern times, such retroactive revision of
a concededly valid legal rule is extremely rare. With regard
to criminal cases, I have no hesitation in affirming that it
was unheard of at the time the original Due Process Clause
was adopted. As I discuss in detail in the following section,
proceeding in that fashion would have been regarded as contrary to the judicial traditions embraced within the concept
of due process of law.

The Court's opinion considers the judgment at issue here
"a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking," whereby
the Tennessee court "brought the law into conformity with
reason and common sense," by "laying to rest an archaic and
outdated rule." Ante, at 467. This is an accurate enough
description of what modern "common law decisionmaking"
consists of--but it is not an accurate description of the theoretical model of common-law decisionmaking accepted by
those who adopted the Due Process Clause. At the time of
the framing, common-law jurists believed (in the words of
Sir Francis Bacon) that the judge's "office is jus dicere, and
not jus dare; to interpret law, and not to make law, or give
law." Bacon, Essays, Civil and Moral, in 3 Harvard Classics
130 (C. Eliot ed. 1909) (1625). Or as described by Blackstone, whose Commentaries were widely read and "accepted
[by the framing generation] as the most satisfactory exposition of the common law of England," see Schick v. United
States, 195 U. S. 65, 69 (1904), "judicial decisions are the principal and most authoritative evidence, that can be given, of
the existence of such a custom as shall form a part of the
common law," 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *69 (hereinafter Blackstone) (emphasis added).

Blackstone acknowledged that the courts' exposition of
what the law was could change. Stare decisis, he said, "admits of exception, where the former determination is most
evidently contrary to reason . . . ." Ibid. But "in such
cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new
law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation."
Id., at *70. To fit within this category of bad law, a law
must be "manifestly absurd or unjust." It would not suffice,
he said, that "the particular reason [for the law] can at this
distance of time [not be] precisely assigned." "[F]or though
[its] reason be not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a
deference to former times as not to suppose they acted

wholly without consideration." Ibid.1 By way of example,Blackstone pointed to the seemingly unreasonable rule that

one cannot inherit the estate of one's half brother. Thoughhe accepted that the feudal reason behind the law was
no longer obvious, he wrote "yet it is not in [a commonlaw judge's] power to alter it." Id., at *70-*71 (emphasis
added).2 Moreover, "the unreasonableness of a custom inmodern circumstances will not affect its validity if the Court
is satisfied of a reasonable origin." Allen 140-141. "A cus-tome once reasonable and tolerable, if after it become grievous, and not answerable to the reason, whereupon it wasgrounded, yet is to be . . . taken away by act of parliament."
2 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England *664 (herein-after Institutes); see also

id., at *97 ("No law, or custome ofEngland can be taken away, abrogated, or adnulled, but by

authority of parliament"); Of Oaths before an EcclesiasticalJudge Ex Officio, 12 Co. Rep. *26, *29 (1655) ("[T]he law and
custom of England is the inheritance of the subject, whichhe cannot be deprived of without his assent in Parliament").

There are, of course, stray statements and doctrines foundin the historical record that--read out of context--could be
thought to support the modern-day proposition that the com1 Inquiring into a law's original reasonableness was perhaps tantamount
to questioning whether it existed at all. "In holding the origin to have
been unreasonable, the Court nearly always doubts or denies the actual
origin and continuance of the custom in fact." C. Allen, Law in the Making 140 (3d ed. 1939) (hereinafter Allen).

2 The near-dispositive strength Blackstone accorded stare decisis was

not some mere personal predilection. Chancellor Kent was of the same
view: "If a decision has been made upon solemn argument and mature
deliberation, the presumption is in favor of its correctness; and the community have a right to regard it as a just declaration or exposition of the law,
and to regulate their actions and contracts by it." 1 J. Kent, Commentaries *475-*476 (emphasis added). See also Hamilton's statement in The
Federalist: "To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which
serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes
before them." The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

Scalia, J., dissenting
mon law was always meant to evolve. Take, for instance,Lord Coke's statement in the Institutes that "the reason of

the law ceasing, the law itself ceases." This maxim is oftencited by modern devotees of a turbulently changing common
law--often in its Latin form (cessante ratione legis, cessat
ipse lex) to create the impression of great venerability. In
its original context, however, it had nothing to do with the
power of common-law courts to change the law. At thepoint at which it appears in the Institutes, Coke was discussing the exception granted abbots and mayors from the obli-gation of military service to the King which attached to land
ownership. Such service would be impracticable for a man
of the cloth or a mayor. But, said Coke, "if they convey over
the lands to any naturall man and his heires," the immunity
"by the conveyance over ceaseth." 1 Institutes *70. In
other words, the service which attached to the land would
apply to any subsequent owner not cloaked in a similar immunity. It was in describing this change that Coke employed the Latin maxim cessante ratione legis, cessat ipse
lex. It had to do, not with a changing of the common-law
rule, but with a change of circumstances that rendered the
common-law rule no longer applicable to the case.

The same is true of the similar quotation from Coke:
"[R]atio legis est anima legis, et mutata legis ratione, mutatur et lex"--reason is the soul of the law; the reason of the
law being changed, the law is also changed. This is taken
from Coke's report of Milborn's Case, 7 Co. Rep. 6b, 7a
(1587), a suit involving a town's responsibility for a murder
committed within its precincts. The common-law rule had
been that a town could be amerced for failure to apprehend
a murderer who committed his crime on its streets during
the day, but not a murderer who struck after nightfall, when
its citizens were presumably asleep. Parliament, however,
enacted a statute requiring towns to close their gates at
night, and the court reasoned that thereafter a town that left
its gates open could be amerced for the nocturnal homicide

475Cite as: 532 U. S. 451 (2001)
Scalia, J., dissenting
as well, since the town's violation of the Act was negligencethat facilitated the escape. This perhaps partakes more of

a new right of action implied from legislation than of anycommon-law rule. But to the extent it involved the common
law, it assuredly did not change the prior rule: A town notin violation of the statute would continue to be immune.
Milborn's Case simply held that the rule would not be ex-tended to towns that wrongfully failed to close their gates--
which involves no overruling, but nothing more than normal,case-by-case common-law adjudication.

It is true that framing-era judges in this country considered themselves authorized to reject English common-lawprecedent they found "barbarous" and "ignorant," see 1 Z.

Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 46(1795) (hereinafter Swift); N. Chipman, A Dissertation on
the Act Adopting the Common and Statute Laws of England,in Reports and Dissertations 117, 128 (1793) (hereinafter
Chipman). That, however, was not an assertion of judges'power to

change the common law. For, as Blackstone wrote,
the common law was a law for England, and did not automatically transfer to the American Colonies; rather, it had to beadopted. See 1 Blackstone *107-*108 (observing that "the

common law of England, as such, has no allowance or author-ity" in "[o]ur American plantations"); see also 1 Swift 46
("The English common law is not in itself binding in thisstate");

id., at 44-45 ("The English common law has never
been considered to be more obligatory here, than the Romanlaw has been in England"). In short, the colonial courts felt

themselves perfectly free to pick and choose which parts ofthe English common law they would adopt.

3 As stated by

3 In fact, however, "most of the basic departures [from English common
law] were accomplished not by judicial decision but by local statute, so
that by the time of the American Revolution one hears less and less about
the unsuitability of common law principles to the American environment."

Chipman 128: "If no reason can be assigned, in support ofrules, or precedents,

not already adopted in practice, to
adopt such rules, is certainly contrary to the principles ofour government." (Emphasis added.) This discretion not

to adopt would not presuppose, or even support, the powerof colonial courts subsequently to change the accumulated
colonial common law. The absence of belief in that power is
demonstrated by the following passage from 1 Horwitz 5:"Massachusetts Chief Justice Hutchison could declare in 1767

that `laws should be established, else Judges and Juries mustgo according to their Reason, that is, their Will.' It was also
imperative `that the Judge should never be the Legislator:
Because, then the Will of the Judge would be the Law: and
this tends to a State of Slavery.' " Or, as Judge Swift put
it, courts "ought never to be allowed to depart from the well
known boundaries of express law, into the wide fields of discretion." 2 Swift 366.

Nor is the framing era's acceptance of common-law crimes
support for the proposition that the Framers accepted an
evolving common law. The acknowledgment of a new crime,
not thitherto rejected by judicial decision, was not a changing of the common law, but an application of it. At the time
of the framing, common-law crimes were considered unobjectionable, for " `a law founded on the law of nature may be
retrospective, because it always existed,' " 1 Horwitz 7, quoting Blackwell v. Wilkinson, Jefferson's Rep. 73, 77 (Va. 1768)
(argument of then-Attorney General John Randolph). Of
course, the notion of a common-law crime is utterly anathema today, which leads one to wonder why that is so. The
obvious answer is that we now agree with the perceptive
chief justice of Connecticut, who wrote in 1796 that
common-law crimes "partak[e] of the odious nature of an
ex post facto law." 2 Swift 365-366. But, as Horwitz
makes clear, a widespread sharing of Swift's "preoccupation
with the unfairness of administering a system of judge-made
criminal law was a distinctly post-revolutionary phenome532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
non, reflecting a profound change in sensibility. For the in-articulate premise that lay behind Swift's warnings against

the danger of judicial discretion was a growing perception that judges no longer merely discovered law; they also
made it." 1 Horwitz 14-15 (emphases added). In otherwords, the connection between

ex post facto lawmaking and
common-law judging would not have become widely apparent until common-law judging became lawmaking, not (as ithad been) law declaring. This did not happen, see

id., at
1-4, until the 19th century, after the framing.What occurred in the present case, then, is precisely what

Blackstone said--and the Framers believed--would not suffice. The Tennessee Supreme Court made no pretense that
the year-and-a-day rule was "bad" law from the outset;
rather, it asserted, the need for the rule, as a means of assuring causality of the death, had disappeared with time.
Blackstone--and the Framers who were formed by Blackstone--would clearly have regarded that change in law as a
matter for the legislature, beyond the power of the court.
It may well be that some common-law decisions of the era in
fact changed the law while purporting not to. But that is
beside the point. What is important here is that it was an
undoubted point of principle, at the time the Due Process
Clause was adopted, that courts could not "change" the law.
That explains why the Constitution restricted only the legislature from enacting ex post facto laws. Under accepted
norms of judicial process, an ex post facto law (in the sense
of a judicial holding, not that a prior decision was erroneous,
but that the prior valid law is hereby retroactively changed)
was simply not an option for the courts. This attitude subsisted, I may note, well beyond the founding era, and beyond
the time when due process guarantees were extended
against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. In an
1886 admiralty case, for example, this Court said the following: "The rights of persons in this particular under the maritime law of this country are not different from those under

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
the common law, and as it is the duty of courts to declarethe law, not to make it, we cannot change this rule." The

Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, 213-214 (1886), overruled byMoragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375 (1970).

It is not a matter, therefore, of "[e]xtending the [Ex PostFacto] Clause to courts through the rubric of due process,"
and thereby "circumvent[ing] the clear constitutional text,"
ante, at 460. It is simply a matter of determining what duejudicial process consists of--and it does not consist of retroactive creation of crimes. The Ex Post Facto Clause isrelevant only because it demonstrates beyond doubt that,
however much the acknowledged and accepted role ofcommon-law courts could evolve (as it has) in other respects,
retroactive revision of the criminal law was regarded as sofundamentally unfair that an alteration of the judicial role
which permits that will be a denial of due process. Madisonwrote that "ex-post-facto laws . . . are contrary to the first
principles of the social compact, and to every principle ofsocial legislation." The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961). I find it impossible to believe, as the Court does,that this strong sentiment attached only to retroactive laws
passed by the legislature, and would not apply equally (orindeed with even greater force) to a court's production of the
same result through disregard of the traditional limits uponjudicial power. Insofar as the "first principles of the social
compact" are concerned, what possible difference does itmake that "[a] court's opportunity for discrimination" by retroactively changing a law "is more limited than a legisla-ture's, in that it can only act in construing existing law in
actual litigation"? Ante, at 460-461 (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). The injustice to the individuals affected is no less. II

Even if I agreed with the Court that the Due ProcessClause is violated only when there is lack of "fair warning"
of the impending retroactive change, I would not find suchfair warning here. It is not clear to me, in fact, what the

532US2 Unit: $U49 [09-06-02 13:46:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
Court believes the fair warning consisted of. Was it themere fact that "[t]he year and a day rule is widely viewed as

an outdated relic of the common law"? Ante, at 462. Soare many of the elements of common-law crimes, such as
"breaking the close" as an element of burglary, or "asporta-tion" as an element of larceny. See W. LaFave & A. Scott,
Criminal Law 631-633, 708-710 (1972). Are all of these
"outdated relics" subject to retroactive judicial rescission?Or perhaps the fair warning consisted of the fact that "the

year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abol-ished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have
addressed the issue." Ante, at 463. But why not count inpetitioner's favor (as giving him no reason to expect a change
in law) those even more numerous jurisdictions that havechosen

not "recently to have addressed the issue"? And
why not also count in petitioner's favor (rather than againsthim) those jurisdictions that have abolished the rule

legislatively, and those jurisdictions that have abolished it through
prospective rather than retroactive judicial rulings (together,
a large majority of the abolitions, see 992 S. W. 2d, at 397,
n. 4, 402 (listing statutes and cases))? That is to say, evenif it was predictable that the rule would be changed, it was

not predictable that it would be changed retroactively,
rather than in the prospective manner to which legislatures
are restricted by the Ex Post Facto Clause, or in the prospective manner that most other courts have employed.

In any event, as the Court itself acknowledges, "[d]ue
process . . . does not require a person to apprise himself of
the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that
his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a
developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to
his State." Ante, at 464. The Court tries to counter this
self-evident point with the statement that "[a]t the same
time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions
have abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose

by reference to the law as it then existed," ibid. This retortrests upon the fallacy that I discussed earlier: that "expected

or defensible" "abolition" of prior law was approved byBouie. It was not--and according such conclusive effect to
the "defensibility" (by which I presume the Court means the"reasonableness") of the change in law will validate the retroactive creation of many new crimes.Finally, the Court seeks to establish fair warning by discussing at great length, ante, at 464-466, how unclear it wasthat the year-and-a-day rule was ever the law in Tennessee.
As I have already observed, the Supreme Court of Tennes-see is the authoritative expositor of Tennessee law, and has
said categorically that the year-and-a-day rule was the law.Does the Court mean to establish the principle that fair
warning of impending change exists--or perhaps fair warn-ing can be dispensed with--when the prior law is not crystal
clear? Yet another boon for retroactively created crimes.I reiterate that the only "fair warning" discussed in our
precedents, and the only "fair warning" relevant to the issuebefore us here, is fair warning of what the law is. That
warning, unlike the new one that today's opinion invents,goes well beyond merely "safeguarding defendants against
unjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law," ante,at 462 (emphasis added). It safeguards them against
changes in the law after the fact. But even accepting theCourt's novel substitute, the opinion's conclusion that this
watered-down standard has been met seems to me to pro-ceed on the principle that a large number of almost-valid
arguments makes a solid case. As far as I can tell, peti-tioner had nothing that could fairly be called a "warning"
that the Supreme Court of Tennessee would retroactivelyeliminate one of the elements of the crime of murder.

To decide this case, we need only conclude that due processprevents a court from (1) acknowledging the validity, when

they were rendered, of prior decisions establishing a particu-lar element of a crime; (2) changing the prior law so as to

eliminate that element; and (3) applying that change to con-duct that occurred under the prior regime. A court would
remain free to apply common-law criminal rules to new factpatterns, see ante, at 461-462, so long as that application is
consistent with a fair reading of prior cases. It would re-main free to conclude that a prior decision or series of decisions establishing a particular element of a crime was inerror, and to apply that conclusion retroactively (so long as
the "fair notice" requirement of Bouie is satisfied). It wouldeven remain free, insofar as the

ex post facto element of theDue Process Clause is concerned, to "reevaluat[e] and refin[e]" the elements of common-law crimes to its heart's con-tent, so long as it does so prospectively. (The majority of
state courts that have abolished the year-and-a-day rulehave done so in this fashion.) And, of course (as Blackstone
and the Framers envisioned), legislatures would be free toeliminate outmoded elements of common-law crimes for the
future by law. But what a court cannot do, consistent withdue process, is what the Tennessee Supreme Court did here:
avowedly change (to the defendant's disadvantage) the criminal law governing past acts.For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the

Supreme Court of Tennessee.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I agree with the Court's basic approach. Justice Cardozo
pointed out that retroactivity should be determined "notby metaphysical conceptions of the nature of judge-made

law, . . . but by considerations of convenience, of utility, andof the deepest sentiments of justice." The Nature of the
Judicial Process 148-149 (1921). Similarly, the Due ProcessClause asks us to consider the basic fairness or unfairness of
retroactive application of the Tennessee court's change in the
law. That Clause provides protection against after-the-fact

Breyer, J., dissenting
changes in criminal law that deprive defendants of fair warn-ing of the nature and consequences of their actions. It does

not enshrine Blackstone's "ancient dogma that the law de-clared by . . . courts had a Platonic or ideal existence before
the act of declaration," Great Northern R. Co. v. SunburstOil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932) (Cardozo, J.).
Cf. ante, at 473-474 (Scalia, J., dissenting).I also agree with the Court that, in applying the Due Process Clause, we must ask whether the judicial ruling in ques-tion was "unexpected and indefensible by reference to the
law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue."
Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354 (1964) (quotingJ. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 61 (2d ed. 1960)

(internal quotation marks omitted)).I cannot agree, however, with the majority's application of
that due process principle to this case. As Justice Scaliawell explains, Rogers did not have fair warning that the
Tennessee courts would abolish the year and a day rule orthat they would retroactively apply the new law to the circumstances of his case, thereby upgrading the crime thosecircumstances revealed from attempted murder to murder.
I therefore join Part II of Justice Scalia's dissentingopinion.

UNITED STATES v. OAKLAND CANNABIS BUYERS'COOPERATIVE

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-151. Argued March 28, 2001--Decided May 14, 2001
Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative was organized to distribute marijuana to qualified patients for medical purposes. The
United States sued to enjoin the Cooperative and its executive director,
also a respondent (together, the Cooperative), under the Controlled Substances Act. The United States argued that the Cooperative's activities violated the Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and
possessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. The District Court enjoined the Cooperative's activities, but
the Cooperative continued to distribute marijuana. The District Court
found the Cooperative in contempt, rejecting its defense that any distributions were medically necessary. The court later rejected the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction to permit medically necessary
distributions. The Cooperative appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded the ruling on the motion to modify the injunction.
According to the Ninth Circuit, medical necessity is a legally cognizable
defense likely applicable in the circumstances, the District Court mistakenly believed it had no discretion to issue an injunction more limited
in scope than the Controlled Substances Act, and the District Court
should have weighed the public interest and considered factors such as
the serious harm in depriving patients of marijuana in deciding whether
to modify the injunction.

Held:

1. There is no medical necessity exception to the Controlled Substances Act's prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing marijuana. Pp. 489-495.

(a) Because that Act classifies marijuana as a schedule I controlled
substance, it provides only one express exception to the prohibitions on
manufacturing and distributing the drug: Government-approved research projects. The Cooperative's contention that a common-law medical necessity defense should be written into the Act is rejected. There
is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute. But that question
need not be answered to resolve the issue presented here, for the terms

Syllabus

of the Controlled Substances Act leave no doubt that the medical necessity defense is unavailable. Pp. 489-491.

(b) Under any conception of legal necessity, the defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made a determination of values.
Here, the Act reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical
benefits worthy of an exception (other than Government-approved research). Whereas other drugs can be dispensed and prescribed for
medical use, see 21 U. S. C. $ 829, the same is not true for marijuana,
which has "no currently accepted medical use" at all, $ 812. This conclusion is supported by the structure of the Act, which divides drugs into
five schedules, depending in part on whether a drug has a currently
accepted medical use, and then imposes restrictions according to the
schedule in which it has been placed. The Attorney General is authorized to include a drug in schedule I, the most restrictive schedule, only
if the drug has no currently accepted medical use. The Cooperative
errs in arguing that, because Congress, instead of the Attorney General,
placed marijuana into that schedule, marijuana can be distributed when
medically necessary. The statute treats all schedule I drugs alike, and
there is no reason why drugs that Congress placed there should be subject to fewer controls than those that the Attorney General placed there.
Also rejected is the Cooperative's argument that a drug may be found
medically necessary for a particular patient or class even when it has
not achieved general acceptance as a medical treatment. It is clear
from the text of the Act that Congress determined that marijuana has
no medical benefits worthy of an exception granted to other drugs. The
statute expressly contemplates that many drugs have a useful medical
purpose, see $ 801(1), but it includes no exception at all for any medical
use of marijuana. This Court is unwilling to view that omission as an
accident and is unable, in any event, to override a legislative determination manifest in the statute. Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application here, because there is no statutory ambiguity.
Pp. 491-495.

2. The discretion that courts of equity traditionally possess in fashioning relief does not serve as a basis for affirming the Ninth Circuit in
this case. To be sure, district courts properly acting as courts of equity
have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise. But the
mere fact that the District Court had discretion does not suggest that
the court, when evaluating the motion, could consider any and all factors
that might relate to the public interest or the parties' conveniences,
including medical needs. Equity courts cannot ignore Congress' judgment expressed in legislation. Their choice is whether a particular
means of enforcement should be chosen over another permissible means,

Syllabus
not whether enforcement is preferable to no enforcement at all. To the
extent a district court considers the public interest and parties' conveniences, the court is limited to evaluating how those factors are affected
by the selection of an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms.
Because the Controlled Substances Act covers even those who have
what could be termed a medical necessity, it precludes consideration of
the evidence that the Ninth Circuit deemed relevant. Pp. 495-499.

BUYERS' COOPERATIVE

Opinion of the Court

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C.$ 801

et seq., prohibits the manufacture and distribution ofvarious drugs, including marijuana. In this case, we must

decide whether there is a medical necessity exception tothese prohibitions. We hold that there is not.

I
In November 1996, California voters enacted an initiativemeasure entitled the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. Attempting "[t]o ensure that seriously ill Californians have theright to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes," Cal.
Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11362.5 (West Supp. 2001), thestatute creates an exception to California laws prohibiting
the possession and cultivation of marijuana. These prohibi-tions no longer apply to a patient or his primary caregiver
who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the patient's medi-cal purposes upon the recommendation or approval of a physician. Ibid. In the wake of this voter initiative, severalgroups organized "medical cannabis dispensaries" to meet
the needs of qualified patients. United States v. Cannabis
Cultivators Club, 5 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1092 (ND Cal. 1998).Respondent Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative is one of

these groups.The Cooperative is a not-for-profit organization that operates in downtown Oakland. A physician serves as medicaldirector, and registered nurses staff the Cooperative during
business hours. To become a member, a patient must pro-vide a written statement from a treating physician assenting
to marijuana therapy and must submit to a screening inter-view. If accepted as a member, the patient receives an identification card entitling him to obtain marijuana from theCooperative.

In January 1998, the United States sued the Cooperativeand its executive director, respondent Jeffrey Jones (to532US2 Unit: $U50 [09-06-02 13:56:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
gether, the Cooperative), in the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of California. Seeking to enjoin

the Cooperative from distributing and manufacturing mari-juana,

1 the United States argued that, whether or not the

Cooperative's activities are legal under California law, theyviolate federal law. Specifically, the Government argued

that the Cooperative violated the Controlled Substances
Act's prohibitions on distributing, manufacturing, and pos-sessing with the intent to distribute or manufacture a controlled substance. 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a). Concluding that theGovernment had established a probability of success on the
merits, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction.App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a-40a; 5 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105.

The Cooperative did not appeal the injunction but insteadopenly violated it by distributing marijuana to numerous
persons, App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a-23a. To terminate theseviolations, the Government initiated contempt proceedings.
In defense, the Cooperative contended that any distributionswere medically necessary. Marijuana is the only drug, according to the Cooperative, that can alleviate the severe pain
and other debilitating symptoms of the Cooperative's pa-tients.

Id., at 29a. The District Court rejected this defense, however, after determining there was insufficient evi-dence that each recipient of marijuana was in actual danger

of imminent harm without the drug. Id., at 29a-32a. TheDistrict Court found the Cooperative in contempt and, at the
Government's request, modified the preliminary injunction
to empower the United States Marshal to seize the Cooperative's premises. Id., at 37a. Although recognizing that

1 The Government requested, and the District Court granted, an injunction that prohibited the possession of marijuana with the intent to manufacture and distribute, as well as the distribution and manufacture of
marijuana. For simplicity, in this opinion, we refer to these activities collectively as distributing and manufacturing marijuana. The legal issues
are the same for all of these activities.

BUYERS' COOPERATIVE

Opinion of the Court

"human suffering" could result, the District Court reasoned
that a court's "equitable powers [do] not permit it to ignore
federal law." Ibid. Three days later, the District Court
summarily rejected a motion by the Cooperative to modify
the injunction to permit distributions that are medically
necessary.

The Cooperative appealed both the contempt order and
the denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify. Before the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided the case, however, the Cooperative voluntarily purged its contempt by
promising the District Court that it would comply with the
initial preliminary injunction. Consequently, the Court of
Appeals determined that the appeal of the contempt order
was moot. 190 F. 3d 1109, 1112-1113 (1999).

The denial of the Cooperative's motion to modify the injunction, however, presented a live controversy that was appealable under 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(a)(1). Reaching the merits
of this issue, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
According to the Court of Appeals, the medical necessity defense was a "legally cognizable defense" that likely would
apply in the circumstances. 190 F. 3d, at 1114. Moreover,
the Court of Appeals reasoned, the District Court erroneously "believed that it had no discretion to issue an injunction that was more limited in scope than the Controlled
Substances Act itself." Id., at 1114-1115. Because, according to the Court of Appeals, district courts retain "broad
equitable discretion" to fashion injunctive relief, the District
Court could have, and should have, weighed the "public interest" and considered factors such as the serious harm
in depriving patients of marijuana. Ibid. Remanding the
case, the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to
consider "the criteria for a medical necessity exemption, and,
should it modify the injunction, to set forth those criteria
in the modification order." Id., at 1115. Following these
instructions, the District Court granted the Cooperative's

Opinion of the Court
motion to modify the injunction to incorporate a medicalnecessity defense.

2

The United States petitioned for certiorari to review theCourt of Appeals' decision that medical necessity is a legally

cognizable defense to violations of the Controlled SubstancesAct. Because the decision raises significant questions as to
the ability of the United States to enforce the Nation's druglaws, we granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1010 (2000).

II
The Controlled Substances Act provides that, "[e]xcept asauthorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any

person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture, dis-tribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture,
distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance." 21 U. S. C.$ 841(a)(1). The subchapter, in turn, establishes exceptions.

2 The amended preliminary injunction reaffirmed that the Cooperative
is generally enjoined from manufacturing, distributing, and possessing
with the intent to manufacture or distribute marijuana, but it carved out
an exception for cases of medical necessity. Specifically, the District
Court ordered that "[t]he foregoing injunction does not apply to the distribution of cannabis by [the Cooperative] to patient-members who (1) suffer
from a serious medical condition, (2) will suffer imminent harm if the
patient-member does not have access to cannabis, (3) need cannabis for
the treatment of the patient-member's medical condition, or need cannabis
to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical
condition, and (4) have no reasonable legal alternative to cannabis for the
effective treatment or alleviation of the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition because the
patient-member has tried all other legal alternatives to cannabis and the
alternatives have been ineffective in treating or alleviating the patientmember's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition, or the alternatives result in side effects which the patient-member
cannot reasonably tolerate." App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.

The United States appealed the District Court's order amending the
preliminary injunction. At the Government's request, we stayed the
order pending the appeal. 530 U. S. 1298 (2000). The Court of Appeals
has postponed oral argument pending our decision in this case.

490 UNITED STATES v. OAKLAND CANNABIS

BUYERS' COOPERATIVE

Opinion of the Court

For marijuana (and other drugs that have been classified as"schedule I" controlled substances), there is but one express

exception, and it is available only for Government-approvedresearch projects, $ 823(f). Not conducting such a project,
the Cooperative cannot, and indeed does not, claim this stat-utory exemption.

The Cooperative contends, however, that notwithstandingthe apparently absolute language of $ 841(a), the statute is
subject to additional, implied exceptions, one of which ismedical necessity. According to the Cooperative, because
necessity was a defense at common law, medical necessityshould be read into the Controlled Substances Act. We
disagree.As an initial matter, we note that it is an open question
whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize anecessity defense not provided by statute. A necessity defense "traditionally covered the situation where physicalforces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the
lesser of two evils." United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394,410 (1980). Even at common law, the defense of necessity
was somewhat controversial. See, e. g., Queen v. Dudley &Stephens, 14 Q. B. 273 (1884). And under our constitutional
system, in which federal crimes are defined by statute ratherthan by common law, see United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch
32, 34 (1812), it is especially so. As we have stated:"Whether, as a policy matter, an exemption should be
created is a question for legislative judgment, not judicialinference." United States v. Rutherford, 442 U. S. 544,
559 (1979). Nonetheless, we recognize that this Court hasdiscussed the possibility of a necessity defense without

altogether rejecting it. See, e. g., Bailey, supra, at 415.3

3 The Cooperative is incorrect to suggest that Bailey has settled the
question whether federal courts have authority to recognize a necessity
defense not provided by statute. There, the Court rejected the necessity
defense of a prisoner who contended that adverse prison conditions justified his prison escape. The Court held that the necessity defense is un532US2 Unit: $U50 [09-06-02 13:56:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

491Cite as: 532 U. S. 483 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
We need not decide, however, whether necessity can everbe a defense when the federal statute does not expressly

provide for it. In this case, to resolve the question pre-sented, we need only recognize that a medical necessity exception for marijuana is at odds with the terms of the Con-trolled Substances Act. The statute, to be sure, does not
explicitly abrogate the defense.4 But its provisions leave nodoubt that the defense is unavailable.

Under any conception of legal necessity, one principle isclear: The defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself
has made a "determination of values." 1 W. LaFave & A.Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 5.4, p. 629 (1986). In the
case of the Controlled Substances Act, the statute reflects adetermination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy
of an exception (outside the confines of a Government-approved research project). Whereas some other drugs can
be dispensed and prescribed for medical use, see 21 U. S. C.$ 829, the same is not true for marijuana. Indeed, for purposes of the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana has "nocurrently accepted medical use" at all. $ 812.

The structure of the Act supports this conclusion. Thestatute divides drugs into five schedules, depending in part
on whether the particular drug has a currently accepted
available to prisoners, like Bailey, who fail to present evidence of a bona
fide effort to surrender as soon as the claimed necessity had lost its coercive force. 444 U. S., at 415. It was not argued, and so there was no
occasion to consider, whether the statute might be unable to bear any
necessity defense at all. And although the Court noted that Congress
"legislates against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law" and thus
"may" have contemplated a necessity defense, the Court refused to "balanc[e] [the] harms," explaining that "we are construing an Act of Congress,
not drafting it." Id., at 415-416, n. 11.

4 We reject the Cooperative's intimation that elimination of the defense

requires an "explici[t]" statement. Brief for Respondents 21. Considering that we have never held necessity to be a viable justification for violating a federal statute, see supra, at 490, and n. 3, and that such a defense
would entail a social balancing that is better left to Congress, we decline
to set the bar so high.

Opinion of the Court

medical use. The Act then imposes restrictions on the man-ufacture and distribution of the substance according to the

schedule in which it has been placed. Schedule I is the mostrestrictive schedule.

5 The Attorney General can include a

drug in schedule I only if the drug "has no currently ac-cepted medical use in treatment in the United States," "has

a high potential for abuse," and has "a lack of accepted safetyfor use . . . under medical supervision." $$ 812(b)(1)(A)-(C).
Under the statute, the Attorney General could not put mari-juana into schedule I if marijuana had any accepted medical
use.The Cooperative points out, however, that the Attorney
General did not place marijuana into schedule I. Congressput it there, and Congress was not required to find that a
drug lacks an accepted medical use before including the drugin schedule I. We are not persuaded that this distinction
has any significance to our inquiry. Under the Cooperative'slogic, drugs that Congress places in schedule I could be distributed when medically necessary whereas drugs that theAttorney General places in schedule I could not. Nothing
in the statute, however, suggests that there are two tiersof schedule I narcotics, with drugs in one tier more readily
available than drugs in the other. On the contrary, the stat-ute consistently treats all schedule I drugs alike. See, e. g.,

$ 823(a) (providing criteria for Attorney General to considerwhen determining whether to register an applicant to manufacture schedule I controlled substances), $ 823(b) (providingcriteria for Attorney General to consider when determining
whether to register an applicant to distribute schedule I con-trolled substances), $ 823(f ) (providing procedures for becoming a government-approved research project), $ 826 (estab-lishing production quotas for schedule I drugs). Moreover,

5 As noted, supra, at 490, the only express exception for schedule I drugs
is the Government-approved research project, see 21 U. S. C. $ 823(f).
Unlike drugs in other schedules, see $ 829, schedule I drugs cannot be
dispensed under a prescription.

493Cite as: 532 U. S. 483 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
the Cooperative offers no convincing explanation for whydrugs that Congress placed on schedule I should be subject

to fewer controls than the drugs that the Attorney Generalplaced on the schedule. Indeed, the Cooperative argues
that, in placing marijuana and other drugs on schedule I,Congress "wishe[d] to assert the most restrictive level of
controls created by the [Controlled Substances Act]." Brieffor Respondents 24. If marijuana should be subject to the
most restrictive level of controls, it should not be treated anyless restrictively than other schedule I drugs.

The Cooperative further argues that use of schedule Idrugs generally--whether placed in schedule I by Congress
or the Attorney General--can be medically necessary, not-withstanding that they have "no currently accepted medical
use." According to the Cooperative, a drug may not yethave achieved general acceptance as a medical treatment but
may nonetheless have medical benefits to a particular patientor class of patients. We decline to parse the statute in this
manner. It is clear from the text of the Act that Congresshas made a determination that marijuana has no medical
benefits worthy of an exception. The statute expressly con-templates that many drugs "have a useful and legitimate
medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the healthand general welfare of the American people," $ 801(1), but it
includes no exception at all for any medical use of marijuana.Unwilling to view this omission as an accident, and unable
in any event to override a legislative determination manifestin a statute, we reject the Cooperative's argument.

6

6 The Government argues that the 1998 "sense of the Congress" resolution, 112 Stat. 2681-760 to 2681-761, supports its position that Congress
has foreclosed the medical necessity defense. Entitled "Not Legalizing
Marijuana for Medicinal Use," the resolution declares that "Congress continues to support the existing Federal legal process for determining the
safety and efficacy of drugs and opposes efforts to circumvent this process
by legalizing marijuana, and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use
without valid scientific evidence and the approval of the Food and Drug
Administration." Because we conclude that the Controlled Substances

494 UNITED STATES v. OAKLAND CANNABIS

BUYERS' COOPERATIVE

Opinion of the Court

Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construethe Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity

defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficultconstitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statuteexceeds Congress' Commerce Clause powers, violates the
substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the
fundamental liberties of the people under the Fifth, Ninth,and Tenth Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges,

however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no appli-cation in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we
have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannotbear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle.Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues
today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address theseclaims, we decline to do so in the first instance.

For these reasons, we hold that medical necessity is not a
defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana.7 The

Act cannot sustain the medical necessity defense, we need not consider
whether the 1998 "sense of the Congress resolution" is additional evidence
of a legislative determination to eliminate the defense.

7 Lest there be any confusion, we clarify that nothing in our analysis,

or the statute, suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the
prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions
in the Controlled Substances Act. Furthermore, the very point of our
holding is that there is no medical necessity exception to the prohibitions
at issue, even when the patient is "seriously ill" and lacks alternative avenues for relief. Indeed, it is the Cooperative's argument that its patients
are "seriously ill," see, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11, 13, 17, and lacking
"alternatives," see, e. g., id., at 13. We reject the argument that these
factors warrant a medical necessity exception. If we did not, we would
be affirming instead of reversing the Court of Appeals.

Finally, we share Justice Stevens' concern for "showing respect for
the sovereign States that comprise our Federal Union." Post, at 502
(opinion concurring in judgment). However, we are "construing an Act
of Congress, not drafting it." United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 415,
n. 11 (1980). Because federal courts interpret, rather than author, the

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals erred when it held that medical necessityis a "legally cognizable defense." 190 F. 3d, at 1114. It further erred when it instructed the District Court on remandto consider "the criteria for a medical necessity exemption,
and, should it modify the injunction, to set forth those crite-ria in the modification order." Id., at 1115.

III
The Cooperative contends that, even if the Controlled Sub-stances Act forecloses the medical necessity defense, there

is an alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals.This case, the Cooperative reminds us, arises from a motion
to modify an injunction to permit distributions that are medi-cally necessary. According to the Cooperative, the Court of
Appeals was correct that the District Court had "broad equi-table discretion" to tailor the injunctive relief to account for
medical necessity, irrespective of whether there is a legaldefense of necessity in the statute.

Id., at 1114. To sustainthe judgment below, the argument goes, we need only reaffirm that federal courts, in the exercise of their equity juris-diction, have discretion to modify an injunction based upon
a weighing of the public interest.8We disagree. Although district courts whose equity powers have been properly invoked indeed have discretion infashioning injunctive relief (in the absence of a statutory restriction), the Court of Appeals erred concerning the factorsthat the district courts may consider in exercising such
discretion.
federal criminal code, we are not at liberty to rewrite it. Nor are we
passing today on a constitutional question, such as whether the Controlled
Substances Act exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.

8 Notwithstanding Justice Stevens' concerns, post, at 502-503, it is

appropriate for us to address this issue because this case arises from a
motion to modify the injunction, because the Court of Appeals held that
the District Court misconstrued its equitable discretion, and because the
Cooperative offers this conclusion as an alternative ground for affirmance.

BUYERS' COOPERATIVE

Opinion of the Court

A
As an initial matter, the Cooperative is correct that, whendistrict courts are properly acting as courts of equity, they

have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise.For "several hundred years," courts of equity have enjoyed
"sound discretion" to consider the "necessities of the publicinterest" when fashioning injunctive relief.

Hecht Co. v.Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329-330 (1944). See also id., at 329

("The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power ofthe Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the
necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than ri-gidity has distinguished it");

Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982) ("In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for thepublic consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy
of injunction"). Such discretion is displaced only by a "clearand valid legislative command." Porter v. Warner Holding
Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946). See also Romero-Barcelo,supra, at 313 ("Of course, Congress may intervene and guide
or control the exercise of the courts' discretion, but we do notlightly assume that Congress has intended to depart from
established principles").The Cooperative is also correct that the District Court in
this case had discretion. The Controlled Substances Actvests district courts with jurisdiction to enjoin violations of
the Act, 21 U. S. C. $ 882(a). But a "grant of jurisdiction toissue [equitable relief] hardly suggests an absolute duty to
do so under any and all circumstances," Hecht, supra, at 329(emphasis deleted). Because the District Court's use of equitable power is not textually required by any "clear andvalid legislative command," the court did not have to issue
an injunction.

TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978), does not support theGovernment's contention that the District Court lacked discretion in fashioning injunctive relief. In Hill, the Courtheld that the Endangered Species Act of 1973 required the

532US2 Unit: $U50 [09-06-02 13:56:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
District Court to enjoin completion of a dam, whose opera-tion would either eradicate the known population of the snail

darter or destroy its critical habitat. Id., at 193-195. TheDistrict Court lacked discretion because an injunction was
the "only means of ensuring compliance." Romero-Barcelo,supra, at 314 (explaining why the District Court in Hill
lacked discretion). Congress' "order of priorities," as ex-pressed in the statute, would be deprived of effect if the
District Court could choose to deny injunctive relief. Hill,
supra, at 194. In effect, the District Court had only a Hob-son's choice. By contrast, with respect to the Controlled

Substances Act, criminal enforcement is an alternative, andindeed the customary, means of ensuring compliance with the
statute. Congress' resolution of the policy issues can be(and usually is) upheld without an injunction.

B
But the mere fact that the District Court had discretiondoes not suggest that the District Court, when evaluating

the motion to modify the injunction, could consider any andall factors that might relate to the public interest or the conveniences of the parties, including the medical needs of theCooperative's patients. On the contrary, a court sitting in
equity cannot "ignore the judgment of Congress, deliber-ately expressed in legislation."

Virginian R. Co. v. RailwayEmployees, 300 U. S. 515, 551 (1937). A district court cannot, for example, override Congress' policy choice, articu-lated in a statute, as to what behavior should be prohibited.
"Once Congress, exercising its delegated powers, has decidedthe order of priorities in a given area, it is . . . for the courts
to enforce them when enforcement is sought." Hill, 437U. S., at 194. Courts of equity cannot, in their discretion,
reject the balance that Congress has struck in a statute.Id., at 194-195. Their choice (unless there is statutory language to the contrary) is simply whether a particular meansof enforcing the statute should be chosen over another per532US2 Unit: $U50 [09-06-02 13:56:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

missible means; their choice is not whether enforcement ispreferable to no enforcement at all.

9 Consequently, when a

court of equity exercises its discretion, it may not considerthe advantages and disadvantages of nonenforcement of the

statute, but only the advantages and disadvantages of "em-ploying the extraordinary remedy of injunction," RomeroBarcelo, 456 U. S., at 312, over the other available methodsof enforcement. Cf.

id., at 316 (referring to "discretion torely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction"). To the extent the district court considers the publicinterest and the conveniences of the parties, the court is limited to evaluating how such interest and conveniences areaffected by the selection of an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms. C

In this case, the Court of Appeals erred by consideringrelevant the evidence that some people have "serious medical
conditions for whom the use of cannabis is necessary in orderto treat or alleviate those conditions or their symptoms,"
that these people "will suffer serious harm if they are deniedcannabis," and that "there is no legal alternative to cannabis

9 Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321 (1944), for example, held that the
District Court was not required to issue an injunction to restrain violations of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 and regulations thereunder when "some `other order' might be more appropriate, or at least so
appear to the court." Id., at 328 (quoting statutory provision that enabled
district court to issue an injunction, a restraining order, "or other order").
Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305 (1982), held that a District
Court had discretion not to issue an injunction precluding the United
States Navy from releasing ordnance into water, but to rely on other
means of ensuring compliance, including ordering the Navy to obtain a
permit. Id., at 314-318. See also Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480
U. S. 531, 544-546 (1987) (holding that a District Court did not err in declining to issue an injunction to bar exploratory drilling on Alaskan public
lands, because the District Court's decision "did not undermine" the policy
of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 16 U. S. C. $ 3120,
and because the Secretary of the Interior had other means of meaningfully
complying with the statute).

for the effective treatment of their medical conditions." 190F. 3d, at 1115. As explained above, in the Controlled Substances Act, the balance already has been struck against amedical necessity exception. Because the statutory prohibitions cover even those who have what could be termed amedical necessity, the Act precludes consideration of this evidence. It was thus error for the Court of Appeals to instruct the District Court on remand to consider "the criteriafor a medical necessity exemption, and, should it modify the

injunction, to set forth those criteria in the modificationorder."

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in the judgment.

Lest the Court's narrow holding be lost in its broad dicta,let me restate it here: "[W]e hold that medical necessity is

not a defense to manufacturing and distributing mari-juana."

Ante, at 494 (emphasis added). This confined holding is consistent with our grant of certiorari, which was lim-ited to the question "[w]hether the Controlled Substances

Act, 21 U. S. C. 801 et seq., forecloses a medical necessity de-fense to the Act's prohibition against

manufacturing and
distributing marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance."Pet. for Cert. (I) (emphasis added). And, at least with respect to distribution, this holding is consistent with how the
issue was raised and litigated below. As stated by the District Court, the question before it was "whether [respondents'] admitted distribution of marijuana for use by seri532US2 Unit: $U50 [09-06-02 13:56:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ously ill persons upon a physician's recommendation violatesfederal law," and if so, whether such distribution "should be

enjoined pursuant to the injunctive relief provisions of thefederal Controlled Substances Act." United States v. Cannabis Cultivators Club, 5 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1091 (ND Cal.1998) (emphasis added).

Accordingly, in the lower courts as well as here, respondents have raised the medical necessity defense as a justifica-tion for distributing marijuana to cooperative members, and

it was in that context that the Ninth Circuit determined thatrespondents had "a legally cognizable defense." 190 F. 3d
1109, 1114 (1999). The Court is surely correct to reversethat determination. Congress' classification of marijuana as
a schedule I controlled substance--that is, one that cannotbe distributed outside of approved research projects, see 21
U. S. C. $$ 812, 823(f ), 829--makes it clear that "the Con-trolled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana," ante, at 494 (emphasisadded).

1

Apart from its limited holding, the Court takes two unwarranted and unfortunate excursions that prevent me fromjoining its opinion. First, the Court reaches beyond its

holding, and beyond the facts of the case, by suggesting thatthe defense of necessity is unavailable for anyone under the

1 In any event, respondents do not fit the paradigm of a defendant who
may assert necessity. The defense "traditionally covered the situation
where physical forces beyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct
the lesser of two evils." United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980);
see generally 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 5.4,
pp. 627-640 (1986). Respondents, on the other hand, have not been forced
to confront a choice of evils--violating federal law by distributing marijuana to seriously ill patients or letting those individuals suffer--but have
thrust that choice upon themselves by electing to become distributors for
such patients. Of course, respondents also cannot claim necessity based
upon the choice of evils facing seriously ill patients, as that is not the same
choice respondents face.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Controlled Substances Act. Ante, at 491-493, 494-495, n. 7,499. Because necessity was raised in this case as a defense

to distribution, the Court need not venture an opinion onwhether the defense is available to anyone other than distributors. Most notably, whether the defense might beavailable to a seriously ill patient for whom there is no alternative means of avoiding starvation or extraordinary suffer-ing is a difficult issue that is not presented here.

2

Second, the Court gratuitously casts doubt on "whethernecessity can ever be a defense" to

any federal statute thatdoes not explicitly provide for it, calling such a defense into

question by a misleading reference to its existence as an"open question." Ante, at 490, 491. By contrast, our precedent has expressed no doubt about the viability of thecommon-law defense, even in the context of federal criminal
statutes that do not provide for it in so many words. See,e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 415 (1980) ("We
therefore hold that, where a criminal defendant is chargedwith escape and claims that he is entitled to an instruction
on the theory of duress or necessity, he must proffer evidence
of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soonas the claimed duress or necessity had lost its coercive

force"); id., at 416, n. 11 ("Our principal difference with thedissent, therefore, is not as to the

existence of such a defense
but as to the importance of surrender as an element of it"(emphasis added)). Indeed, the Court's comment on the

general availability of the necessity defense is completely un-necessary because the Government has made no such suggestion. Cf. Brief for United States 17-18 (narrowly ar-guing that necessity defense cannot succeed if legislature has

2 As a result, perhaps the most glaring example of the Court's dicta is
its footnote 7, where it opines that "nothing in our analysis, or the statute,
suggests that a distinction should be drawn between the prohibitions on
manufacturing and distributing and the other prohibitions in the Controlled Substances Act." Ante, at 494, n. 7.

already "canvassed the issue" and precluded it for a particu-lar statute (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court's

opinion on this point is pure dictum.The overbroad language of the Court's opinion is especially
unfortunate given the importance of showing respect for thesovereign States that comprise our Federal Union. That respect imposes a duty on federal courts, whenever possible,to avoid or minimize conflict between federal and state law,
particularly in situations in which the citizens of a State havechosen to "serve as a laboratory" in the trial of "novel social
and economic experiments without risk to the rest of thecountry."

New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311(1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). In my view, this is such a

case.3 By passing Proposition 215, California voters havedecided that seriously ill patients and their primary caregivers should be exempt from prosecution under state laws forcultivating and possessing marijuana if the patient's physician recommends using the drug for treatment.4 This case
does not call upon the Court to deprive all such patients ofthe benefit of the necessity defense to federal prosecution,

when the case itself does not involve any such patients.An additional point deserves emphasis. This case does
not require us to rule on the scope of the District Court'sdiscretion to enjoin, or to refuse to enjoin, the possession
of marijuana or other potential violations of the Controlled

cases such as Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321 (1944), and

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERSASSOCIATION

v. GARVEY

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 00-1210. Decided May 14, 2001
After arbitrators found that the Major League Baseball Clubs (Clubs) colluded in the market for free-agent services after the 1985, 1986, and
1987 baseball seasons, the Clubs and petitioner agreed that the Clubs
would establish a fund to be distributed to injured players. The
"Framework" that petitioner designed to evaluate individual claims provided, inter alia, that players could seek an arbitrator's review of a
distribution plan, but the arbitrator could determine only whether the
Framework and its criteria were properly applied. Respondent Garvey
sought arbitration after his damages claim was rejected. At his hearing, he produced a letter from San Diego Padres president and CEO
Smith, stating that Smith had offered to extend Garvey's contract, but
the Padres refused to negotiate thereafter due to collusion. The arbitrator denied the claim because the letter contradicted Smith's testimony denying collusion in earlier arbitration proceedings. The Federal
District Court denied Garvey's motion to vacate the arbitrator's award.
In Garvey I, the Ninth Circuit reversed. It found that review of the
award's merits was warranted because the arbitrator's refusal to credit
Smith's letter was inexplicable and bordered on irrational since arbitrators had previously concluded that the owners' testimony denying collusion was false, and that there was strong support for the letter's truthfulness. On remand, the District Court remanded the case for further
arbitration, and Garvey appealed. Finding that Garvey I left only one
possible result, the Ninth Circuit in Garvey II reversed and directed
the District Court to remand the case to arbitration with instructions
to enter an award for Garvey.

Held: The Ninth Circuit's decision to resolve the dispute and bar further

proceedings is at odds with governing law. Judicial review of a laborarbitration decision pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement is
very limited. Courts are not authorized to review an arbitrator's decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties' agreement. Paperworkers v.
Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 36. Only when the arbitrator effectively dispenses his own brand of industrial justice may his decision be unenforceable. Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597.

Per Curiam
When the judiciary weighs a particular claim's merits, it usurps a function entrusted to the arbitrator. As a rule a court must not foreclose
further proceedings by settling the merits according to its own judgment of the appropriate result. It should simply vacate the award,
leaving open the possibility of further proceedings if the agreement permits them. The Ninth Circuit recited these principles but erred in
applying them. In Garvey I, it overturned the arbitrator's decision because it disagreed with his factual findings with respect to credibility,
but even serious error on the arbitrator's part does not justify overturning his decision where, as here, he is construing a contract and acting
within the scope of his authority, Misco, supra, at 38. And in Garvey
II, the court resolved the dispute's merits based on its assessment of
the record before the arbitrator, which it ordinarily cannot do, no matter
how erroneous the arbitrator's decision, Misco, supra, at 40, n. 10.
Even when the arbitrator's award may properly be vacated, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case for further arbitration proceedings.

Certiorari granted; 243 F. 3d 547, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit here rejectedan arbitrator's factual findings and then resolved the merits

of the parties' dispute instead of remanding the case for fur-ther arbitration proceedings. Because the court's determination conflicts with our cases limiting review of an arbitra-tor's award entered pursuant to an agreement between an
employer and a labor organization and prescribing the appro-priate remedy where vacation of the award is warranted, we
grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse. Themotions for leave to file briefs amicus curiae of the National
Academy of Arbitrators and the Office of the Commissionerof Baseball are granted.

In the late 1980's, petitioner Major League Baseball Play-ers Association (Association) filed grievances against the
Major League Baseball Clubs (Clubs), claiming the Clubs hadcolluded in the market for free-agent services after the 1985,
1986, and 1987 baseball seasons, in violation of the industry'scollective-bargaining agreement. A free agent is a player
who may contract with any Club, rather than one whoseright to contract is restricted to a particular Club. In a

Per Curiam
series of decisions, arbitrators found collusion by the Clubsand damage to the players. The Association and Clubs

subsequently entered into a Global Settlement Agreement(Agreement), pursuant to which the Clubs established a $280
million fund to be distributed to injured players. The Asso-ciation also designed a "Framework" to evaluate the individual player's claims, and, applying that Framework, recommended distribution plans for claims relating to a particularseason or seasons.

The Framework provided that players could seek an ar-bitrator's review of the distribution plan. The arbitrator
would determine " `only whether the approved Framework
and the criteria set forth therein have been properly applied
in the proposed Distribution Plan.' " Garvey v. Roberts, 203
F. 3d 580, 583 (CA9 2000) (Garvey I). The Framework set
forth factors to be considered in evaluating players' claims,
as well as specific requirements for lost contract-extension
claims. Such claims were cognizable " `only in those cases
where evidence exists that a specific offer of an extension
was made by a club prior to collusion only to thereafter be
withdrawn when the collusion scheme was initiated.' " Id.,
at 584.

Respondent Steve Garvey, a retired, highly regarded first
baseman, submitted a claim for damages of approximately $3
million. He alleged that his contract with the San Diego
Padres was not extended to the 1988 and 1989 seasons due
to collusion. The Association rejected Garvey's claim in
February 1996, because he presented no evidence that the
Padres actually offered to extend his contract. Garvey objected, and an arbitration hearing was held. He testified
that the Padres offered to extend his contract for the 1988
and 1989 seasons and then withdrew the offer after they
began colluding with other teams. He presented a June
1996 letter from Ballard Smith, Padres' President and CEO
from 1979 to 1987, stating that, before the end of the 1985
season, Smith offered to extend Garvey's contract through

Per Curiam
the 1989 season, but that the Padres refused to negotiatewith Garvey thereafter due to collusion.

The arbitrator denied Garvey's claim, after seeking addi-tional documentation from the parties. In his award, he explained that " `[t]here exists . . . substantial doubt as to thecredibility of the statements in the Smith letter.' "

Id., at
586. He noted the "stark contradictions" between the 1996
letter and Smith's testimony in the earlier arbitration pro-ceedings regarding collusion, where Smith, like other owners, denied collusion and stated that the Padres simply werenot interested in extending Garvey's contract.

Ibid. The
arbitrator determined that, due to these contradictions, he" `must reject [Smith's] more recent assertion that Garvey

did not receive [a contract] extension' " due to collusion, andfound that Garvey had not shown a specific offer of extension. Ibid. He concluded:

" `The shadow cast over the credibility of the Smith testimony coupled with the absence of any other corrobora-tion of the claim submitted by Garvey compels a finding

that the Padres declined to extend his contract not be-cause of the constraints of the collusion effort of the
clubs but rather as a baseball judgment founded upon[Garvey's] age and recent injury history.' "

Ibid.

Garvey moved in Federal District Court to vacate the ar-bitrator's award, alleging that the arbitrator violated the

Framework by denying his claim. The District Court de-nied the motion. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversed by a divided vote. The court acknowledged thatjudicial review of an arbitrator's decision in a labor dispute
is extremely limited. But it held that review of the merits
of the arbitrator's award was warranted in this case, because
the arbitrator " `dispensed his own brand of industrial justice.' " Id., at 589. The court recognized that Smith's prior
testimony with respect to collusion conflicted with the statements in his 1996 letter. But in the court's view, the arbitra532US2 Unit: $U51 [10-05-01 13:30:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
tor's refusal to credit Smith's letter was "inexplicable" and"border[ed] on the irrational," because a panel of arbitrators,

chaired by the arbitrator involved here, had previously con-cluded that the owners' prior testimony was false. Id., at
590. The court rejected the arbitrator's reliance on the ab-sence of other corroborating evidence, attributing that fact
to Smith and Garvey's direct negotiations. The court alsofound that the record provided "strong support" for the
truthfulness of Smith's 1996 letter. Id., at 591-592. TheCourt of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to
vacate the award.The District Court then remanded the case to the arbitration panel for further hearings, and Garvey appealed. TheCourt of Appeals, again by a divided vote, explained that
Garvey I established that "the conclusion that Smith madeGarvey an offer and subsequently withdrew it because of
the collusion scheme was the only conclusion that the arbi-trator could draw from the record in the proceedings."

result--the result our holding contemplated--an award inGarvey's favor." 2000 WL 1801383, at *1. The Court of
Appeals reversed the District Court and directed that itremand the case to the arbitration panel with instructions
to enter an award for Garvey in the amount he claimed.1

1 Garvey contends that, because the Association's petition was filed more
than 90 days after Garvey I, we cannot consider a challenge raising issues
resolved in that decision. But there is no question that the Association's
petition was filed in sufficient time for us to review Garvey II, and we
have authority to consider questions determined in earlier stages of the
litigation where certiorari is sought from the most recent of the judgments
of the Court of Appeals. Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U. S. 152 (1964) (per

The parties do not dispute that this case arises under $ 301
of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 156,
29 U. S. C. $ 185(a), as the controversy involves an assertion
of rights under an agreement between an employer and a
labor organization. Although Garvey's specific allegation is
that the arbitrator violated the Framework for resolving
players' claims for damages, that Framework was designed
to facilitate payments to remedy the Clubs' breach of the
collective-bargaining agreement. Garvey's right to be made
whole is founded on that agreement.

Judicial review of a labor-arbitration decision pursuant to
such an agreement is very limited. Courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator's decision on the merits despite
allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties' agreement. Paperworkers v. Misco,
Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 36 (1987). We recently reiterated that if
an " `arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the
contract and acting within the scope of his authority,' the
fact that `a court is convinced he committed serious error
does not suffice to overturn his decision.' " Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000)
(quoting Misco, supra, at 38). It is only when the arbitrator
strays from interpretation and application of the agreement
and effectively "dispense[s] his own brand of industrial justice" that his decision may be unenforceable. Steelworkers
v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960).
When an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract, and no dishonesty is alleged, the arbitrator's "improvident, even silly, factfinding" does not provide
a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award.
Misco, 484 U. S., at 39.

In discussing the courts' limited role in reviewing the merits of arbitration awards, we have stated that " `courts . . .
have no business weighing the merits of the grievance [or]
considering whether there is equity in a particular claim.' "

Id., at 37 (quoting Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., 363
U. S. 564, 568 (1960)). When the judiciary does so, "it usurps
a function which . . . is entrusted to the arbitration tribunal."
Id., at 569; see also Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., supra, at
599 ("It is the arbitrator's construction [of the agreement]
which was bargained for . . ."). Consistent with this limited
role, we said in Misco that "[e]ven in the very rare instances
when an arbitrator's procedural aberrations rise to the level
of affirmative misconduct, as a rule the court must not foreclose further proceedings by settling the merits according to
its own judgment of the appropriate result." 484 U. S., at
40-41, n. 10. That step, we explained, "would improperly
substitute a judicial determination for the arbitrator's decision that the parties bargained for" in their agreement.
Ibid. Instead, the court should "simply vacate the award,
thus leaving open the possibility of further proceedings
if they are permitted under the terms of the agreement."
Ibid.

To be sure, the Court of Appeals here recited these principles, but its application of them is nothing short of baffling.
The substance of the court's discussion reveals that it overturned the arbitrator's decision because it disagreed with the
arbitrator's factual findings, particularly those with respect
to credibility. The Court of Appeals, it appears, would have
credited Smith's 1996 letter, and found the arbitrator's refusal to do so at worst "irrational" and at best "bizarre."
Garvey I, 203 F. 3d, at 590-591. But even "serious error"
on the arbitrator's part does not justify overturning his decision, where, as here, he is construing a contract and acting
within the scope of his authority. Misco, supra, at 38.

In Garvey II, the court clarified that Garvey I both rejected the arbitrator's findings and went further, resolving
the merits of the parties' dispute based on the court's assessment of the record before the arbitrator. For that reason,
the court found further arbitration proceedings inappropri532US2 Unit: $U51 [10-05-01 13:30:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ate. But again, established law ordinarily precludes a courtfrom resolving the merits of the parties' dispute on the basis

of its own factual determinations, no matter how erroneousthe arbitrator's decision. Misco, supra, at 40, n. 10; see also
American Mfg. Co., supra, at 568. Even when the arbitra-tor's award may properly be vacated, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case for further arbitration proceedings.
Misco, supra, at 40, n. 10. The dissent suggests that theremedy described in Misco is limited to cases where the

arbitrator's errors are procedural. Post, at 512 (opinion of
Stevens, J.). Misco did involve procedural issues, but ourdiscussion regarding the appropriate remedy was not so

limited. If a remand is appropriate even when the arbitra-tor's award has been set aside for "procedural aberrations"
that constitute "affirmative misconduct," it follows that a re-mand ordinarily will be appropriate when the arbitrator simply made factual findings that the reviewing court perceivesas "irrational." The Court of Appeals usurped the arbitrator's role by resolving the dispute and barring further pro-ceedings, a result at odds with this governing law.

2

For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals erred inreversing the order of the District Court denying the motion

to vacate the arbitrator's award, and it erred further in di-recting that judgment be entered in Garvey's favor. The
petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of

2 In any event, no serious error on the arbitrator's part is apparent in
this case. The fact that an earlier panel of arbitrators rejected the owners' testimony as a whole does not compel the conclusion that the panel
found Smith's specific statements with respect to Garvey to be false. The
arbitrator's explanation for his decision indicates that he simply found
Smith an unreliable witness and that, in the absence of corroborating evidence, he could only conclude that Garvey failed to show that the Padres
had offered to extend his contract. The arbitrator's analysis may have
been unpersuasive to the Court of Appeals, but his decision hardly qualifies as serious error, let alone irrational or inexplicable error. And, as we
have said, any such error would not justify the actions taken by the court.

the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I agree with the Court that in Garvey v. Roberts, 203 F. 3d580 (CA9 2000), the Ninth Circuit should not have disturbed
the arbitrator's award. Correction of that error sets thiscase straight. I see no need to say more.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
It is well settled that an arbitrator "does not sit to dis-pense his own brand of industrial justice." Steelworkers v.

Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960).We have also said fairly definitively, albeit in dicta, that a
court should remedy an arbitrator's "procedural aberrations"by vacating the award and remanding for further proceedings. Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 40-41, n. 10(1987). Our cases, however, do not provide significant guidance as to what standards a federal court should use in as-sessing whether an arbitrator's behavior is so untethered to
either the agreement of the parties or the factual record soas to constitute an attempt to "dispense his own brand of
industrial justice." Nor, more importantly, do they tell ushow, having made such a finding, courts should deal with
"the extraordinary circumstance in which the arbitrator'sown rulings make clear that, more than being simply erroneous, his finding is completely inexplicable and borders on theirrational."

Garvey v. Roberts, 203 F. 3d 580, 590 (CA92000) (case below). Because our case law is not sufficiently

clear to allow me to conclude that the case below waswrongly decided--let alone to conclude that the decision was
so wrong as to require the extraordinary remedy of a sum532US2 Unit: $U51 [10-05-01 13:30:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
mary reversal--I dissent from the Court's disposition ofthis petition.

Without the benefit of briefing or argument, today theCourt resolves two difficult questions. First, it decides that
even if the Court of Appeals' appraisal of the merits is cor-rect--that is to say, even if the arbitrator did dispense his
own brand of justice untethered to the agreement of the par-ties, and even if the correct disposition of the matter is perfectly clear--the only course open to a reviewing court is toremand the matter for another arbitration. That conclusion
is not compelled by any of our cases, nor by any analysisoffered by the Court. As the issue is subject to serious arguments on both sides, the Court should have set this casefor argument if it wanted to answer this remedial question.

Second, without reviewing the record or soliciting briefing,the Court concludes that, in any event, "no serious error on
the arbitrator's part is apparent in this case." Ante, at 511,n. 2. At this stage in the proceedings, I simply cannot endorse that conclusion. After examining the record, obtain-ing briefing, and hearing oral argument, the Court of Appeals offered a reasoned explanation of its conclusion. See203 F. 3d, at 589-592; see also id., at 593-594 (Hawkins, J.,
concurring). Whether or not I would ultimately agree withthe Ninth Circuit's analysis, I find the Court's willingness to
reverse a factbound determination of the Court of Appealswithout engaging that court's reasoning a troubling departure from our normal practice.*Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

*The Court's opinion is somewhat ambiguous as to its reasons for overturning the portion of the Court of Appeals' decision setting aside the
arbitration. It is unclear whether the majority is saying that a court may
never set aside an arbitration because of a factual error, no matter how
perverse, or whether the Court merely holds that the error in this case
was not sufficiently severe to allow a court to take that step. If it is the
latter, the Court offers no explanation of what standards it is using or of
its reasons for reaching that conclusion.

BARTNICKI et al. v. VOPPER, aka WILLIAMS, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 99-1687. Argued December 5, 2000--Decided May 21, 2001*
During contentious collective-bargaining negotiations between a union

representing teachers at a Pennsylvania high school and the local school
board, an unidentified person intercepted and recorded a cell phone conversation between the chief union negotiator and the union president
(hereinafter petitioners). After the parties accepted a nonbinding arbitration proposal generally favorable to the teachers, respondent Vopper,
a radio commentator, played a tape of the intercepted conversation
on his public affairs talk show in connection with news reports about
the settlement. Petitioners filed this damages suit under both federal
and state wiretapping laws, alleging, among other things, that their conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted by an unknown person;
that respondent Yocum, the head of a local organization opposed to the
union's demands, had obtained the tape and intentionally disclosed it to,
inter alios, media representatives; and that they had repeatedly published the conversation even though they knew or had reason to know
that it had been illegally intercepted. In ruling on cross-motions for
summary judgment, the District Court concluded that, under the statutory language, an individual violates the federal Act by intentionally
disclosing the contents of an electronic communication when he or
she knows or has reason to know that the information was obtained
through an illegal interception, even if the individual was not involved
in that interception; found that the question whether the interception
was intentional raised a genuine issue of material fact; and rejected
respondents' defense that they were protected by the First Amendment
even if the disclosures violated the statutes, finding that the statutes
were content-neutral laws of general applicability containing no indicia
of prior restraint or the chilling of free speech. The Third Circuit accepted an interlocutory appeal, and the United States, also a petitioner,
intervened to defend the federal Act's constitutionality. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found the statutes invalid because they
deterred significantly more speech than necessary to protect the private

interests at stake, and remanded the case with instructions to enter
summary judgment for respondents.

Held: The First Amendment protects the disclosures made by respondents in this suit. Pp. 522-535.

(a) Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968, as amended, generally prohibits the interception of wire, electronic, and oral communications. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 2511(1)(a) applies to
the person who willfully intercepts such communications and subsection
(c) to any person who, knowing or having reason to know that the communication was obtained through an illegal interception, willfully discloses its contents. Pp. 522-524.

(b) Because of this suit's procedural posture, the Court accepts that
the interception was unlawful and that respondents had reason to know
that. Accordingly, the disclosures violated the statutes. In answering
the remaining question whether the statutes' application in such circumstances violates the First Amendment, the Court accepts respondents'
submissions that they played no part in the illegal interception, that
their access to the information was obtained lawfully, and that the conversations dealt with a matter of public concern. Pp. 524-525.

(c) Section 2511(1)(c) is a content-neutral law of general applicability.
The statute's purpose is to protect the privacy of wire, electronic, and
oral communications, and it singles out such communications by virtue
of the fact that they were illegally intercepted--by virtue of the source
rather than the subject matter. Cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491
U. S. 781, 791. On the other hand, the prohibition against disclosures
is fairly characterized as a regulation of speech. Pp. 526-527.

(d) In New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713, this Court
upheld the press' right to publish information of great public concern
obtained from documents stolen by a third party. In so doing, this
Court focused on the stolen documents' character and the consequences
of public disclosure, not on the fact that the documents were stolen.
Ibid. It also left open the question whether, in cases where information
has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by a source, government may punish not only the unlawful acquisition, but also the ensuing
publication. Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 535, n. 8. The issue
here is a narrower version of that question: Where the publisher has
lawfully obtained information from a source who obtained it unlawfully,
may the government punish the ensuing publication based on the defect
in a chain? The Court's refusal to construe the issue more broadly is
consistent with its repeated refusal to answer categorically whether
the publication of truthful information may ever be punished consistent
with the First Amendment. Accordingly, the Court considers whether,

516 BARTNICKI v. VOPPER

Syllabus
given the facts here, the interests served by $ 2511(1)(c) justify its restrictions on speech. Pp. 527-529.

(e) The first interest identified by the Government--removing an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations--does not justify
applying $ 2511(1)(c) to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information. The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to
punish the person engaging in it. It would be remarkable to hold that
speech by a law-abiding possessor of information can be suppressed in
order to deter conduct by a non-law-abiding third party. In virtually
all $ 2511(1)(a), (c), or (d) violations, the interceptor's identity has been
known. There is no evidence that Congress thought that the prohibition against disclosures would deter illegal interceptions, and no evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition reduces the number of such interceptions. Pp. 529-532.

(f) The Government's second interest--minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations have been illegally intercepted--is considerably stronger. Privacy of communication is an important interest.
However, in this suit, privacy concerns give way when balanced against
the interest in publishing matters of public importance. One of the
costs associated with participation in public affairs is an attendant
loss of privacy. The profound national commitment to the principle that
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open
supported this Court's holding in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U. S. 254, that neither factual error nor defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment shield
from criticism of official conduct. Parallel reasoning requires the conclusion that a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the
First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases raise an important question concerning whatdegree of protection, if any, the First Amendment provides

to speech that discloses the contents of an illegally inter-cepted communication. That question is both novel and narrow. Despite the fact that federal law has prohibited suchdisclosures since 1934,

1 this is the first time that we have

confronted such an issue.The suit at hand involves the repeated intentional disclosure of an illegally intercepted cellular telephone conver-sation about a public issue.

ception was unlawful. Accordingly, these cases present aconflict between interests of the highest order--on the one

hand, the interest in the full and free dissemination of in-formation concerning public issues, and, on the other hand,
the interest in individual privacy and, more specifically, infostering private speech. The Framers of the First Amendment surely did not foresee the advances in science thatproduced the conversation, the interception, or the conflict
that gave rise to this action. It is therefore not surprisingthat Circuit judges, as well as the Members of this Court,
have come to differing conclusions about the First Amend-ment's application to this issue. Nevertheless, having considered the interests at stake, we are firmly convinced thatthe disclosures made by respondents in this suit are protected by the First Amendment.

I
During 1992 and most of 1993, the Pennsylvania State Ed-ucation Association, a union representing the teachers at the

Wyoming Valley West High School, engaged in collective-bargaining negotiations with the school board. Petitioner
Kane, then the president of the local union, testified thatthe negotiations were " `contentious' " and received "a lot of
media attention." App. 79, 92. In May 1993, petitionerBartnicki, who was acting as the union's "chief negotiator,"
used the cellular phone in her car to call Kane and engagein a lengthy conversation about the status of the negotiations. An unidentified person intercepted and recorded thatcall.

In their conversation, Kane and Bartnicki discussed thetiming of a proposed strike,

id., at 41-45, difficulties cre-ated by public comment on the negotiations,

id., at 46, and
the need for a dramatic response to the board's intransi-gence. At one point, Kane said: " `If they're not gonna move

for three percent, we're gonna have to go to their, their

homes . . . . To blow off their front porches, we'll have todo some work on some of those guys. (PAUSES). Really,

uh, really and truthfully because this is, you know, this isbad news. (UNDECIPHERABLE).' " Ibid.

In the early fall of 1993, the parties accepted a nonbindingarbitration proposal that was generally favorable to the
teachers. In connection with news reports about the set-tlement, respondent Vopper, a radio commentator who had
been critical of the union in the past, played a tape of theintercepted conversation on his public affairs talk show.
Another station also broadcast the tape, and local news-papers published its contents. After filing suit against
Vopper and other representatives of the media, Bartnickiand Kane (hereinafter petitioners) learned through discovery that Vopper had obtained the tape from respondentJack Yocum, the head of a local taxpayers' organization that
had opposed the union's demands throughout the negotia-tions. Yocum, who was added as a defendant, testified that
he had found the tape in his mailbox shortly after the inter-ception and recognized the voices of Bartnicki and Kane.
Yocum played the tape for some members of the schoolboard, and later delivered the tape itself to Vopper.

II
In their amended complaint, petitioners alleged that theirtelephone conversation had been surreptitiously intercepted

by an unknown person using an electronic device, that Yocumhad obtained a tape of that conversation, and that he intentionally disclosed it to Vopper, as well as other individ-uals and media representatives. Thereafter, Vopper and
other members of the media repeatedly published the con-tents of that conversation. The amended complaint alleged
that each of the defendants "knew or had reason to know"that the recording of the private telephone conversation had
been obtained by means of an illegal interception. Id.,

Opinion of the Court
at 27. Relying on both federal and Pennsylvania statu-tory provisions, petitioners sought actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees andcosts.

2

After the parties completed their discovery, they filedcross-motions for summary judgment. Respondents contended that they had not violated the statute because
(a) they had nothing to do with the interception, and (b) inany event, their actions were not unlawful since the conversation might have been intercepted inadvertently. More-over, even if they had violated the statute by disclosing the
intercepted conversation, respondents argued, those disclo-sures were protected by the First Amendment. The District Court rejected the first statutory argument because,under the plain statutory language, an individual violates the
federal Act by intentionally disclosing the contents of anelectronic communication when he or she "know[s] or ha[s]
reason to know that the information was obtained" through
an illegal interception.3 App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-
1687, pp. 53a-54a (emphasis deleted). Accordingly, actual
involvement in the illegal interception is not necessary in
order to establish a violation of that statute. With respect
to the second statutory argument, the District Court agreed
that petitioners had to prove that the interception in ques2 Either actual damages or "statutory damages of whichever is the
greater of $100 a day for each day of violation or $10,000" may be recovered under 18 U. S. C. $ 2520(c)(2); under the Pennsylvania Act, the
amount is the greater of $100 a day or $1,000, but the plaintiff may also
recover punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees. 18 Pa. Cons.
Stat. $ 5725(a) (2000).

3 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 2511(1)(c) provides that any person who "intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having
reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception
of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection;
. . . shall be punished . . . ." The Pennsylvania Act contains a similar
provision.

tion was intentional,4 but concluded that the text of the inter-ception raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to

intent. That issue of fact was also the basis for the DistrictCourt's denial of petitioners' motion. Finally, the District
Court rejected respondents' First Amendment defense be-cause the statutes were content-neutral laws of general applicability that contained "no indicia of prior restraint or thechilling of free speech."

Id., at 55a-56a.Thereafter, the District Court granted a motion for an

interlocutory appeal, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b). Itcertified as controlling questions of law: "(1) whether the
imposition of liability on the media Defendants under the[wiretapping statutes] solely for broadcasting the newsworthy tape on the Defendant [Vopper's] radio news/publicaffairs program, when the tape was illegally intercepted and
recorded by unknown persons who were not agents of [the]Defendants, violates the First Amendment; and (2) whether
imposition of liability under the aforesaid [wiretapping] stat-utes on Defendant Jack Yocum solely for providing the anonymously intercepted and recorded tape to the media Defendants violates the First Amendment." App. to Pet. for Cert.in No. 99-1728, p. 76a. The Court of Appeals accepted the

appeal, and the United States, also a petitioner, intervenedpursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403 in order to defend the constitutionality of the federal statute.All three members of the panel agreed with petitioners
and the Government that the federal and Pennsylvania wire-tapping statutes are "content-neutral" and therefore subject
to "intermediate scrutiny." 200 F. 3d 109, 121 (CA3 1999).Applying that standard, the majority concluded that the

statutes were invalid because they deterred significantlymore speech than necessary to protect the privacy interests

at stake. The court remanded the case with instructionsto enter summary judgment for respondents. In dissent,
Senior Judge Pollak expressed the view that the prohibi-tion against disclosures was necessary in order to remove
the incentive for illegal interceptions and to preclude com-pounding the harm caused by such interceptions through
wider dissemination. In so doing, he agreed with the major-ity opinion in a similar case decided by the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia, Boehner v. McDermott, 191 F.3d 463 (1999). See also

Peavy v. WFAA-TV, Inc., 221 F. 3d158 (CA5 2000).

As we pointed out in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41,45-49 (1967), sophisticated (and not so sophisticated) methods of eavesdropping on oral conversations and interceptingtelephone calls have been practiced for decades, primarily by
law enforcement authorities.6 In Berger, we held that New

5 In the Boehner case, as in this suit, a conversation over a car cell
phone was intercepted, but in that case the defendant knew both
who was responsible for intercepting the conversation and how they had
done it. 191 F. 3d, at 465. In the opinion of the majority, the defendant
acted unlawfully in accepting the tape in order to provide it to the media.
Id., at 476. Apparently because the couple responsible for the interception did not eavesdrop "for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain," they were fined only $500. See Department of Justice Press Release, Apr. 23, 1997. In another similar case
involving a claim for damages under $ 2511(1)(c), Peavy v. WFAA-TV, Inc.,
221 F. 3d 158 (CA5 2000), the media defendant in fact participated in the
interceptions at issue.

6 In particular, calls placed on cellular and cordless telephones can be

intercepted more easily than those placed on traditional phones. See
Shubert v. Metrophone, Inc., 898 F. 2d 401, 404-405 (CA3 1990). Although
calls placed on cell and cordless phones can be easily intercepted, it is not
clear how often intentional interceptions take place. From 1992 through

York's broadly written statute authorizing the police to con-duct wiretaps violated the Fourth Amendment. Largely in

response to that decision, and to our holding in Katz v.United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), that the attachment of a
listening and recording device to the outside of a telephonebooth constituted a search, "Congress undertook to draft
comprehensive legislation both authorizing the use of evi-dence obtained by electronic surveillance on specified conditions, and prohibiting its use otherwise. S. Rep. No. 1097,90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968)."

Gelbard v. United States,408 U. S. 41, 78 (1972) (
Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The ulti-mate result of those efforts was Title III of the Omnibus

Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 211,entitled Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance.

One of the stated purposes of that title was "to protecteffectively the privacy of wire and oral communications."
Ibid. In addition to authorizing and regulating electronicsurveillance for law enforcement purposes, Title III also
regulated private conduct. One part of those regulations,$ 2511(1), defined five offenses punishable by a fine of not
more than $10,000, by imprisonment for not more than fiveyears, or by both. Subsection (a) applied to any person who
"willfully intercepts . . . any wire or oral communication."Subsection (b) applied to the intentional use of devices designed to intercept oral conversations; subsection (d) appliedto the use of the contents of illegally intercepted wire or

off the shelf and minimally modified, was used to intercept phone calls

oral communications; and subsection (e) prohibited the un-authorized disclosure of the contents of interceptions that

were authorized for law enforcement purposes. Subsec-tion (c), the original version of the provision most directly
at issue in this suit, applied to any person who "willfullydiscloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the
contents of any wire or oral communication, knowing orhaving reason to know that the information was obtained
through the interception of a wire or oral communicationin violation of this subsection." The oral communications
protected by the Act were only those "uttered by a personexhibiting an expectation that such communication is not
subject to interception under circumstances justifying suchexpectation." $ 2510(2).

As enacted in 1968, Title III did not apply to the moni-toring of radio transmissions. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 1848, however, Con-gress enlarged the coverage of Title III to prohibit the
interception of "electronic" as well as oral and wire commu-nications. By reason of that amendment, as well as a 1994
amendment which applied to cordless telephone communi-cations, 108 Stat. 4279, Title III now applies to the interception of conversations over both cellular and cordless phones.7Although a lesser criminal penalty may apply to the interception of such transmissions, the same civil remedies areavailable whether the communication was "oral," "wire," or
"electronic," as defined by 18 U. S. C. $ 2510 (1994 ed. andSupp. V).

Opinion of the Court
facts. We accept petitioners' submission that the intercep-tion was intentional, and therefore unlawful, and that, at a

minimum, respondents "had reason to know" that it wasunlawful. Accordingly, the disclosure of the contents of the
intercepted conversation by Yocum to school board membersand to representatives of the media, as well as the subsequent disclosures by the media defendants to the public,violated the federal and state statutes. Under the provisions of the federal statute, as well as its Pennsylvaniaanalogue, petitioners are thus entitled to recover damages
from each of the respondents. The only question is whetherthe application of these statutes in such circumstances violates the First Amendment.8In answering that question, we accept respondents' submission on three factual matters that serve to distinguishmost of the cases that have arisen under $ 2511. First,
respondents played no part in the illegal interception.Rather, they found out about the interception only after it
occurred, and in fact never learned the identity of the personor persons who made the interception. Second, their access
to the information on the tapes was obtained lawfully, eventhough the information itself was intercepted unlawfully by
someone else. Cf. Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 536(1989) ("Even assuming the Constitution permitted a State
to proscribe receipt of information, Florida has not takenthis step"). Third, the subject matter of the conversation
was a matter of public concern. If the statements about thelabor negotiations had been made in a public arena--during
a bargaining session, for example--they would have beennewsworthy. This would also be true if a third party had
inadvertently overheard Bartnicki making the same state-ments to Kane when the two thought they were alone.

8 In answering this question, we draw no distinction between the media
respondents and Yocum. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U. S. 254, 265-266 (1964); First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.

526 BARTNICKI v. VOPPER

Opinion of the Court

V
We agree with petitioners that $ 2511(1)(c), as well as
its Pennsylvania analog, is in fact a content-neutral law of
general applicability. "Deciding whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral is not always a
simple task. . . . As a general rule, laws that by their terms
distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the
basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based."
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,
642-643 (1994). In determining whether a regulation is
content based or content neutral, we look to the purpose
behind the regulation; typically, "[g]overnment regulation
of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is
`justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791
(1989).9

In this suit, the basic purpose of the statute at issue is to
"protec[t] the privacy of wire[, electronic,] and oral communications." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968).
The statute does not distinguish based on the content of the
intercepted conversations, nor is it justified by reference to
the content of those conversations. Rather, the communications at issue are singled out by virtue of the fact that they
were illegally intercepted--by virtue of the source, rather
than the subject matter.

On the other hand, the naked prohibition against disclosures is fairly characterized as a regulation of pure speech.
Unlike the prohibition against the "use" of the contents of

9 "But while a content-based purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances to show that a regulation is content based, it is not necessary
to such a showing in all cases. . . . Nor will the mere assertion of a contentneutral purpose be enough to save a law which, on its face, discriminates
based on content." Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S.
622, 642-643 (1994).

Opinion of the Court
an illegal interception in $ 2511(1)(d),10 subsection (c) is not aregulation of conduct. It is true that the delivery of a tape

recording might be regarded as conduct, but given that thepurpose of such a delivery is to provide the recipient with
the text of recorded statements, it is like the delivery of ahandbill or a pamphlet, and as such, it is the kind of "speech"
that the First Amendment protects.11 As the majoritybelow put it, "[i]f the acts of `disclosing' and `publishing' information do not constitute speech, it is hard to imagine whatdoes fall within that category, as distinct from the category
of expressive conduct." 200 F. 3d, at 120.

As a general matter, "state action to punish the publicationof truthful information seldom can satisfy constitutional

standards." Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U. S.97, 102 (1979). More specifically, this Court has repeatedly

10 The Solicitor General has cataloged some of the cases that fall under
subsection (d): "[I]t is unlawful for a company to use an illegally intercepted communication about a business rival in order to create a competing product; it is unlawful for an investor to use illegally intercepted communications in trading in securities; it is unlawful for a union to use an
illegally intercepted communication about management (or vice versa) to
prepare strategy for contract negotiations; it is unlawful for a supervisor
to use information in an illegally recorded conversation to discipline a subordinate; and it is unlawful for a blackmailer to use an illegally intercepted
communication for purposes of extortion. See, e. g., 1968 Senate Report
67 (corporate and labor-management uses); Fultz v. Gilliam, 942 F. 2d 396,
400 n. 4 (6th Cir. 1991) (extortion); Dorris v. Absher, 959 F. Supp. 813,
815-817 (M. D. Tenn. 1997) (workplace discipline), aff'd in part, rev'd in
part, 179 F. 3d 420 (6th Cir. 1999). The statute has also been held to bar
the use of illegally intercepted communications for important and socially
valuable purposes. See In re Grand Jury, 111 F. 3d 1066, 1077-1079
(3d Cir. 1997)." Brief for United States 24.

11 Put another way, what gave rise to statutory liability in this suit was

the information communicated on the tapes. See Boehner v. McDermott,
191 F. 3d 463, 484 (CADC 1999) (Sentelle, J., dissenting) ("What . . . is
being punished . . . here is not conduct dependent upon the nature or origin
of the tapes; it is speech dependent upon the nature of the contents").

Opinion of the Court
held that "if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful informa-tion about a matter of public significance then state officials

may not constitutionally punish publication of the informa-tion, absent a need . . . of the highest order." Id., at 103; see
also Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524 (1989); LandmarkCommunications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829 (1978).

Accordingly, in New York Times Co. v. United States, 403U. S. 713 (1971)

(per curiam), the Court upheld the rightof the press to publish information of great public concern

obtained from documents stolen by a third party. In sodoing, that decision resolved a conflict between the basic
rule against prior restraints on publication and the interestin preserving the secrecy of information that, if disclosed,
might seriously impair the security of the Nation. In re-solving that conflict, the attention of every Member of this
Court was focused on the character of the stolen docu-ments' contents and the consequences of public disclosure.
Although the undisputed fact that the newspaper intendedto publish information obtained from stolen documents was
noted in Justice Harlan's dissent, id., at 754, neither the ma-jority nor the dissenters placed any weight on that fact.

However, New York Times v. United States raised, but didnot resolve, the question "whether, in cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaper or by asource, government may ever punish not only the unlawful
acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well." 12 Florida
Star, 491 U. S., at 535, n. 8. The question here, however, isa narrower version of that still-open question. Simply put,

the issue here is this: "Where the punished publisher of in-formation has obtained the information in question in a manner lawful in itself but from a source who has obtained itunlawfully, may the government punish the ensuing publication of that information based on the defect in a chain?"
Boehner, 191 F. 3d, at 484-485 (Sentelle, J., dissenting).

12 That question was subsequently reserved in Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 837 (1978).

Opinion of the Court
Our refusal to construe the issue presented more broadlyis consistent with this Court's repeated refusal to answer

categorically whether truthful publication may ever be pun-ished consistent with the First Amendment. Rather,

"[o]ur cases have carefully eschewed reaching this ulti-mate question, mindful that the future may bring scenarios which prudence counsels our not resolving antici-patorily. . . . We continue to believe that the sensitivity
and significance of the interests presented in clashes be-tween [the] First Amendment and privacy rights counsel
relying on limited principles that sweep no more broadlythan the appropriate context of the instant case."

Florida Star, 491 U. S., at 532-533.

See also Landmark Communications, 435 U. S., at 838. Accordingly, we consider whether, given the facts of thesecases, the interests served by $ 2511(1)(c) can justify its restrictions on speech.The Government identifies two interests served by the
statute--first, the interest in removing an incentive for par-ties to intercept private conversations, and second, the interest in minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations have been illegally intercepted. We assume that thoseinterests adequately justify the prohibition in $ 2511(1)(d)

against the interceptor's own use of information that heor she acquired by violating $ 2511(1)(a), but it by no means
follows that punishing disclosures of lawfully obtained infor-mation of public interest by one not involved in the initial
illegality is an acceptable means of serving those ends.The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an appropriate punishment on the person who engages
in it. If the sanctions that presently attach to a violation of

$ 2511(1)(a) do not provide sufficient deterrence, perhaps
those sanctions should be made more severe. But it would
be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a law-abiding
possessor of information can be suppressed in order to deter

Opinion of the Court
conduct by a non-law-abiding third party. Although thereare some rare occasions in which a law suppressing one party's speech may be justified by an interest in deterring crimi-nal conduct by another, see, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458
U. S. 747 (1982),13 this is not such a case.With only a handful of exceptions, the violations of

$ 2511(1)(a) that have been described in litigated cases havebeen motivated by either financial gain or domestic disputes.14 In virtually all of those cases, the identity of theperson or persons intercepting the communication has been
known.15 Moreover, petitioners cite no evidence that Con-gress viewed the prohibition against disclosures as a response to the difficulty of identifying persons making im-proper use of scanners and other surveillance devices and
accordingly of deterring such conduct,16 and there is no

13 In cases relying on such a rationale, moreover, the speech at issue is
considered of minimal value. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103 (1990); New
York v. Ferber, 458 U. S., at 762 ("The value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual
conduct is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis").

The Government also points to two other areas of the law--namely, mail
theft and stolen property--in which a ban on the receipt or possession of
an item is used to deter some primary illegality. Brief for United States
14; see also post, at 550-551 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Neither of
those examples, though, involve prohibitions on speech. As such, they
are not relevant to a First Amendment analysis.

14 The media respondents have included a list of 143 cases under

$ 2511(1)(a) and 63 cases under $$ 2511(1)(c) and (d)--which must also involve violations of subsection (a)--in an appendix to their brief. The
Reply Brief filed by the United States contains an appendix describing
each of the cases in the latter group.

15 In only 5 of the 206 cases listed in the appendixes, see n. 14, supra,

n. 17, infra, was the identity of the interceptor wholly unknown.

16 The legislative history of the 1968 Act indicates that Congress' concern focused on private surveillance "in domestic relations and industrial
espionage situations." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 225 (1968).
Similarly, in connection with the enactment of the 1986 amendment, one
Senator referred to the interest in protecting private communications

Opinion of the Court
empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal
interceptions.17

Although this suit demonstrates that there may be an
occasional situation in which an anonymous scanner will risk
criminal prosecution by passing on information without any
expectation of financial reward or public praise, surely this
is the exceptional case. Moreover, there is no basis for assuming that imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter
the unidentified scanner from continuing to engage in surreptitious interceptions. Unusual cases fall far short of a

from "a corporate spy, a police officer without probable cause, or just a
plain snoop." 131 Cong. Rec. 24366 (1985) (statement of Sen. Leahy).

17 The dissent argues that we have not given proper respect to "congressional findings" or to " `Congress' factual predictions.' " Post, at 550.
But the relevant factual foundation is not to be found in the legislative
record. Moreover, the dissent does not argue that Congress did provide
empirical evidence in support of its assumptions, nor, for that matter, does
it take real issue with the fact that in the vast majority of cases involving
illegal interceptions, the identity of the person or persons responsible for
the interceptions is known. Instead, the dissent advances a minor disagreement with our numbers, stating that nine cases "involved an unknown or unproved eavesdropper." Post, at 552, n. 9 (emphasis added).
The dissent includes in that number cases in which the identity of the
interceptor, though suspected, was not "proved" because the identity of
the interceptor was not at issue or the evidence was insufficient. In any
event, whether there are 5 cases or 9 involving anonymous interceptors
out of the 206 cases under $ 2511, in most of the cases involving illegal
interceptions, the identity of the interceptor is no mystery. If, as the
proponents of the dry-up-the-market theory would have it, it is difficult to
identify the persons responsible for illegal interceptions (and thus necessary to prohibit disclosure by third parties with no connection to, or responsibility for, the initial illegality), one would expect to see far more
cases in which the identity of the interceptor was unknown (and, concomitantly, far fewer in which the interceptor remained anonymous).
Thus, not only is there a dearth of evidence in the legislative record to
support the dry-up-the-market theory, but what postenactment evidence
is available cuts against it.

Opinion of the Court
showing that there is a "need . . . of the highest order" for a
rule supplementing the traditional means of deterring antisocial conduct. The justification for any such novel burden
on expression must be "far stronger than mere speculation
about serious harms." United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 475 (1995).18 Accordingly, the Government's first suggested justification for applying $ 2511(1)(c)
to an otherwise innocent disclosure of public information is
plainly insufficient.19

The Government's second argument, however, is considerably stronger. Privacy of communication is an important
interest, Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985),20 and Title III's restrictions
are intended to protect that interest, thereby "encouraging
the uninhibited exchange of ideas and information among
private parties . . . ." Brief for United States 27. More18 Indeed, even the burden of justifying restrictions on commercial
speech requires more than " `mere speculation or conjecture.' " Greater
New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173,
188 (1999).

19 Our holding, of course, does not apply to punishing parties for obtaining the relevant information unlawfully. "It would be frivolous to
assert--and no one does in these cases--that the First Amendment, in the
interest of securing news or otherwise, confers a license on either the
reporter or his news sources to violate valid criminal laws. Although
stealing documents or private wiretapping could provide newsworthy
information, neither reporter nor source is immune from conviction for
such conduct, whatever the impact on the flow of news." Branzburg v.
Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, 691 (1972).

20 " `The essential thrust of the First Amendment is to prohibit improper

restraints on the voluntary public expression of ideas; it shields the man
who wants to speak or publish when others wish him to be quiet. There
is necessarily, and within suitably defined areas, a concomitant freedom
not to speak publicly, one which serves the same ultimate end as freedom
of speech in its affirmative aspect.' " Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v.
Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S., at 559 (quoting Estate of Hemingway v.
Random House, Inc., 23 N. Y. 2d 341, 348, 244 N. E. 2d 250, 255 (1968)).

Opinion of the Court
over, the fear of public disclosure of private conversationsmight well have a chilling effect on private speech.

"In a democratic society privacy of communication isessential if citizens are to think and act creatively and
constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's speech isbeing monitored by a stranger, even without the reality
of such activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effectupon the willingness to voice critical and constructive
ideas." President's Commission on Law Enforcementand Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime
in a Free Society 202 (1967).
Accordingly, it seems to us that there are important interests
to be considered on both sides of the constitutional calculus.In considering that balance, we acknowledge that some intrusions on privacy are more offensive than others, and thatthe disclosure of the contents of a private conversation can
be an even greater intrusion on privacy than the interceptionitself. As a result, there is a valid independent justification
for prohibiting such disclosures by persons who lawfully
obtained access to the contents of an illegally intercepted
message, even if that prohibition does not play a significant
role in preventing such interceptions from occurring in the
first place.

We need not decide whether that interest is strong enough
to justify the application of $ 2511(c) to disclosures of trade
secrets or domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern. Cf. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 387-388
(1967) (reserving the question whether truthful publication
of private matters unrelated to public affairs can be constitutionally proscribed). In other words, the outcome of these
cases does not turn on whether $ 2511(1)(c) may be enforced
with respect to most violations of the statute without offending the First Amendment. The enforcement of that provision in these cases, however, implicates the core purposes

of the First Amendment because it imposes sanctions on thepublication of truthful information of public concern.

In these cases, privacy concerns give way when balancedagainst the interest in publishing matters of public importance. As Warren and Brandeis stated in their classic lawreview article: "The right of privacy does not prohibit any
publication of matter which is of public or general interest."The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 214 (1890). One
of the costs associated with participation in public affairs isan attendant loss of privacy.

"Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is aconcomitant of life in a civilized community. The risk
of this exposure is an essential incident of life in a so-ciety which places a primary value on freedom of speech
and of press. `Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfillits historic function in this nation, must embrace all
issues about which information is needed or appropriateto enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.' " Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S.,at 388 (quoting

Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102(1940)).
21

Our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.254 (1964), reviewed many of the decisions that settled the
"general proposition that freedom of expression upon publicquestions is secured by the First Amendment." Id., at 269;
see Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957); Bridgesv. California, 314 U. S. 252, 270 (1941); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369 (1931). Those cases all relied onour "profound national commitment to the principle that
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, andwide-open,"

U. S., at 270.We think it clear that parallel reasoning requires the conclusion that a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice toremove the First Amendment shield from speech about a
matter of public concern.22 The months of negotiations overthe proper level of compensation for teachers at the Wyoming Valley West High School were unquestionably a matter
of public concern, and respondents were clearly engaged in
debate about that concern. That debate may be more mundane than the Communist rhetoric that inspired Justice
Brandeis' classic opinion in Whitney v. California, 274 U. S.,
at 372, but it is no less worthy of constitutional protection.

The judgment is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring.

I join the Court's opinion. I agree with its narrow holding limited to the special circumstances present here: (1)
the radio broadcasters acted lawfully (up to the time of
final public disclosure); and (2) the information publicized in22 See, e. g., Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 535 (1989) (acknowledging "the `timidity and self-censorship' which may result from allowing the
media to be punished for publishing truthful information").

volved a matter of unusual public concern, namely, a threat
of potential physical harm to others. I write separately
to explain why, in my view, the Court's holding does not
imply a significantly broader constitutional immunity for
the media.

As the Court recognizes, the question before us--a question of immunity from statutorily imposed civil liability--
implicates competing constitutional concerns. Ante, at 532-
533. The statutes directly interfere with free expression in
that they prevent the media from publishing information.
At the same time, they help to protect personal privacy--an
interest here that includes not only the "right to be let
alone," Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928)
(Brandeis, J., dissenting), but also "the interest . . . in fostering private speech," ante, at 518. Given these competing
interests "on both sides of the equation, the key question
becomes one of proper fit." Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 227 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring
in part). See also Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government
PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).

I would ask whether the statutes strike a reasonable balance between their speech-restricting and speech-enhancing
consequences. Or do they instead impose restrictions on
speech that are disproportionate when measured against
their corresponding privacy and speech-related benefits,
taking into account the kind, the importance, and the extent
of these benefits, as well as the need for the restrictions in
order to secure those benefits? What this Court has called
"strict scrutiny"--with its strong presumption against constitutionality--is normally out of place where, as here, important competing constitutional interests are implicated.
See ante, at 518 (recognizing "conflict between interests of
the highest order"); ante, at 533 ("important interests to be
considered on both sides of the constitutional calculus"); ante,
at 534 ("balanc[ing]" the interest in privacy "against the in532US2 Unit: $U52 [09-19-02 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., concurring
terest in publishing matters of public importance"); ante, at534 (privacy interest outweighed in these cases).

The statutory restrictions before us directly enhance pri-vate speech. See

Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation
Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985) (describing " `freedom
not to speak publicly' " (quoting Estate of Hemingway v.
Random House, Inc., 23 N. Y. 2d 341, 348, 244 N. E. 2d 250,
255 (1968))). The statutes ensure the privacy of telephoneconversations much as a trespass statute ensures privacy

within the home. That assurance of privacy helps to over-come our natural reluctance to discuss private matters when
we fear that our private conversations may become public.
And the statutory restrictions consequently encourage conversations that otherwise might not take place.

At the same time, these statutes restrict public speech
directly, deliberately, and of necessity. They include media
publication within their scope not simply as a means, say,
to deter interception, but also as an end. Media dissemination of an intimate conversation to an entire community
will often cause the speakers serious harm over and above
the harm caused by an initial disclosure to the person who
intercepted the phone call. See Gelbard v. United States,
408 U. S. 41, 51-52 (1972). And the threat of that widespread dissemination can create a far more powerful disincentive to speak privately than the comparatively minor
threat of disclosure to an interceptor and perhaps to a
handful of others. Insofar as these statutes protect private
communications against that widespread dissemination, they
resemble laws that would award damages caused through
publication of information obtained by theft from a private
bedroom. See generally Warren & Brandeis, The Right to
Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1890) (hereinafter Warren &
Brandeis). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 652D
(1977).

As a general matter, despite the statutes' direct restrictions on speech, the Federal Constitution must tolerate

532US2 Unit: $U52 [09-19-02 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
538 BARTNICKI v. VOPPER

Breyer, J., concurring
laws of this kind because of the importance of these privacy
and speech-related objectives. See Warren & Brandeis 196
(arguing for state-law protection of the right to privacy).
Cf. Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 350-351 (1967)
("[T]he protection of a person's general right to privacy--his
right to be let alone by other people--is, like the protection
of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law
of the individual States"); ante, at 518 (protecting privacy
and promoting speech are "interests of the highest order").
Rather than broadly forbid this kind of legislative enactment, the Constitution demands legislative efforts to tailor
the laws in order reasonably to reconcile media freedom with
personal, speech-related privacy.

Nonetheless, looked at more specifically, the statutes, as
applied in these circumstances, do not reasonably reconcile
the competing constitutional objectives. Rather, they disproportionately interfere with media freedom. For one
thing, the broadcasters here engaged in no unlawful activity
other than the ultimate publication of the information another had previously obtained. They "neither encouraged
nor participated directly or indirectly in the interception."
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-1687, p. 33a. See also ante,
at 525. No one claims that they ordered, counseled, encouraged, or otherwise aided or abetted the interception, the
later delivery of the tape by the interceptor to an intermediary, or the tape's still later delivery by the intermediary to
the media. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2 (criminalizing aiding and abetting any federal offense); 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $$ 6.6(b)-(c), pp. 128-129 (1986) (describing criminal liability for aiding and abetting). And, as the
Court points out, the statutes do not forbid the receipt of the
tape itself. Ante, at 525. The Court adds that its holding
"does not apply to punishing parties for obtaining the relevant information unlawfully." Ante, at 532, n. 19 (emphasis added).

Breyer, J., concurring
For another thing, the speakers had little or no legitimate
interest in maintaining the privacy of the particular conversation. That conversation involved a suggestion about
"blow[ing] off . . . front porches" and "do[ing] some work on
some of those guys," App. 46, thereby raising a significant concern for the safety of others. Where publication of
private information constitutes a wrongful act, the law recognizes a privilege allowing the reporting of threats to public safety. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 595, Comment g (1977) (general privilege to report that "another
intends to kill or rob or commit some other serious crime
against a third person"); id., $ 652G (privilege applies to invasion of privacy tort). Cf. Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition $ 40, Comment c (1995) (trade secret law permits disclosures relevant to public health or safety, commission of crime or tort, or other matters of substantial public
concern); Lachman v. Sperry-Sun Well Surveying Co., 457
F. 2d 850, 853 (CA10 1972) (nondisclosure agreement not
binding in respect to criminal activity); Tarasoff v. Regents
of Univ. of Cal., 17 Cal. 3d 425, 436, 551 P. 2d 334, 343-344
(1976) (psychiatric privilege not binding in presence of danger to self or others). Even where the danger may have
passed by the time of publication, that fact cannot legitimize
the speaker's earlier privacy expectation. Nor should editors, who must make a publication decision quickly, have to
determine present or continued danger before publishing
this kind of threat.

Further, the speakers themselves, the president of a teacher's union and the union's chief negotiator, were "limited
public figures," for they voluntarily engaged in a public controversy. They thereby subjected themselves to somewhat
greater public scrutiny and had a lesser interest in privacy
than an individual engaged in purely private affairs. See,
e. g., ante, at 535 (respondents were engaged in matter of
public concern); Wolston v. Reader's Digest Assn., Inc., 443

(1974). See also Warren & Brandeis 215.

This is not to say that the Constitution requires anyone, including public figures, to give up entirely the right
to private communication, i. e., communication free from telephone taps or interceptions. But the subject matter of the
conversation at issue here is far removed from that in situations where the media publicizes truly private matters. See
Michaels v. Internet Entertainment Group, Inc., 5 F. Supp.
2d 823, 841-842 (CD Cal. 1998) (broadcast of videotape recording of sexual relations between famous actress and rock
star not a matter of legitimate public concern); W. Keeton,
D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton on Law
of Torts $ 117, p. 857 (5th ed. 1984) (stating that there is
little expectation of privacy in mundane facts about a person's life, but that "portrayal of . . . intimate private characteristics or conduct" is "quite a different matter"); Warren
& Brandeis 214 (recognizing that in certain matters "the
community has no legitimate concern"). Cf. Time, Inc. v.
Firestone, 424 U. S. 448, 454-455 (1976) (despite interest of
public, divorce of wealthy person not a "public controversy").
Cf. also ante, at 533 ("[S]ome intrusions on privacy are more
offensive than others").

Thus, in finding a constitutional privilege to publish unlawfully intercepted conversations of the kind here at issue,
the Court does not create a "public interest" exception that
swallows up the statutes' privacy-protecting general rule.
Rather, it finds constitutional protection for publication of
intercepted information of a special kind. Here, the speakers' legitimate privacy expectations are unusually low, and
the public interest in defeating those expectations is unusually high. Given these circumstances, along with the lawful
nature of respondents' behavior, the statutes' enforcement
would disproportionately harm media freedom.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
I emphasize the particular circumstances before us be-cause, in my view, the Constitution permits legislatures to

respond flexibly to the challenges future technology maypose to the individual's interest in basic personal privacy.
Clandestine and pervasive invasions of privacy, unlike thesimple theft of documents from a bedroom, are genuine possibilities as a result of continuously advancing technologies.Eavesdropping on ordinary cellular phone conversations in
the street (which many callers seem to tolerate) is a verydifferent matter from eavesdropping on encrypted cellular
phone conversations or those carried on in the bedroom.But the technologies that allow the former may come to permit the latter. And statutes that may seem less importantin the former context may turn out to have greater importance in the latter. Legislatures also may decide to revisitstatutes such as those before us, creating better tailored provisions designed to encourage, for example, more effectiveprivacy-protecting technologies.

For these reasons, we should avoid adopting overly broador rigid constitutional rules, which would unnecessarily restrict legislative flexibility. I consequently agree with theCourt's holding that the statutes as applied here violate the
Constitution, but I would not extend that holding beyondthese present circumstances.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Technology now permits millions of important and confidential conversations to occur through a vast system ofelectronic networks. These advances, however, raise significant privacy concerns. We are placed in the uncomfort-able position of not knowing who might have access to our
personal and business e-mails, our medical and financial rec-ords, or our cordless and cellular telephone conversations.

conversation touches upon a matter of "public concern," anamorphous concept that the Court does not even attempt
to define. But the Court's decision diminishes, rather than
enhances, the purposes of the First Amendment, therebychilling the speech of the millions of Americans who rely

upon electronic technology to communicate each day.Over 30 years ago, with Title III of the Omnibus Crime

tronic surveillance techniques. As a result of these de-velopments, privacy of communication is seriously jeopardized by these techniques of surveillance. . . . Nolonger is it possible, in short, for each man to retreat
into his home and be left alone. Every spoken wordrelating to each man's personal, marital, religious, political, or commercial concerns can be intercepted by anunseen auditor and turned against the speaker to the
auditor's advantage." S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2dSess., 67 (1968) (hereinafter S. Rep. No. 1097).

This concern for privacy was inseparably bound up withthe desire that personal conversations be frank and uninhibited, not cramped by fears of clandestine surveillanceand purposeful disclosure:

"In a democratic society privacy of communication isessential if citizens are to think and act creatively and
constructively. Fear or suspicion that one's speech isbeing monitored by a stranger, even without the reality
of such activity, can have a seriously inhibiting effectupon the willingness to voice critical and constructive
ideas." President's Commission on Law Enforcementand Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime
in a Free Society 202 (1967).
To effectuate these important privacy and speech interests,Congress and the vast majority of States have proscribed

the intentional interception and knowing disclosure of thecontents of electronic communications.

nication, knowing or having reason to know that the informa-tion was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or

electronic communication").The Court correctly observes that these are "contentneutral law[s] of general applicability" which serve recog-nized interests of the "highest order": "the interest in individual privacy and . . . in fostering private speech." Ante,
at 526, 518. It nonetheless subjects these laws to the strictscrutiny normally reserved for governmental attempts to

censor different viewpoints or ideas. See ante, at 532 (hold-ing that petitioners have not established the requisite " `need
. . . of the highest order' ") (quoting Smith v. Daily Mail
Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97, 103 (1979)). There is scant support, either in precedent or in reason, for the Court's tacitapplication of strict scrutiny.

A content-neutral regulation will be sustained if

" `it furthers an important or substantial governmental
interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated tothe suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment free-doms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance
of that interest.' " Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.v.

FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 662 (1994) (quoting United States

Here, Congress and the Pennsylvania Legislature have acted
" `without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' "

There is no intimation that these laws seek "to suppressunpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public

debate" or that they "distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed."
Turner Broadcasting, supra, at 641, 643. The antidisclosure
provision is based solely upon the manner in which the
conversation was acquired, not the subject matter of the
conversation or the viewpoints of the speakers. The same

information, if obtained lawfully, could be published withimpunity. Cf.

Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U. S. 20,
34 (1984) (upholding under intermediate scrutiny a protec-tive order on information acquired during discovery in part

because "the party may disseminate the identical infor-mation . . . as long as the information is gained through
means independent of the court's processes"). As the concerns motivating strict scrutiny are absent, these content-neutral restrictions upon speech need pass only intermediate scrutiny.The Court's attempt to avoid these precedents by reliance
upon the Daily Mail string of newspaper cases is unpersuasive. In these cases, we held that statutes prohibiting
the media from publishing certain truthful information--the
name of a rape victim, Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524
(1989); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975),
the confidential proceedings before a state judicial review
commission, Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia,
435 U. S. 829 (1978), and the name of a juvenile defendant,
Daily Mail, supra; Oklahoma Publishing Co. v. District
Court, Oklahoma Cty., 430 U. S. 308 (1977) (per curiam)--
violated the First Amendment. In so doing, we stated that
"if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about
a matter of public significance then state officials may not
constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent
a need to further a state interest of the highest order."
Daily Mail, supra, at 103. Neither this Daily Mail principle nor any other aspect of these cases, however, justifies the
Court's imposition of strict scrutiny here.

Each of the laws at issue in the Daily Mail cases regulated
the content or subject matter of speech. This fact alone was
enough to trigger strict scrutiny, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000)
("[A] content-based speech restriction . . . can stand only if
it satisfies strict scrutiny"), and suffices to distinguish these
antidisclosure provisions. But, as our synthesis of these

cases in Florida Star made clear, three other unique factorsalso informed the scope of the Daily Mail principle.

First, the information published by the newspapers hadbeen lawfully obtained from the government itself.

3

"Where information is entrusted to the government, a lessdrastic means than punishing truthful publication almost

always exists for guarding against the dissemination of pri-vate facts."

Florida Star, supra, at 534. See, e. g., Land-mark Communications, supra, at 841, and n. 12 (noting that

the State could have taken steps to protect the confidential-ity of its proceedings, such as holding in contempt commission members who breached their duty of confidentiality).Indeed, the State's ability to control the information undermined the claim that the restriction was necessary, for "[b]yplacing the information in the public domain on official court
records, the State must be presumed to have concluded thatthe public interest was thereby being served."

Cox Broadcasting, supra, at 495. This factor has no relevance in thepresent cases, where we deal with private conversations that

have been intentionally kept out of the public domain.

Second, the information in each case was already "publiclyavailable," and punishing further dissemination would not

have advanced the purported government interests of con-fidentiality.

Florida Star, supra, at 535. Such is not the
case here. These statutes only prohibit "disclos[ure]," 18U. S. C. $ 2511(1)(c); 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 5703(2) (2000), and

one cannot "disclose" what is already in the public domain.See Black's Law Dictionary 477 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "disclosure" as "[t]he act or process of making known some-thing that was previously unknown; a revelation of facts");

3 The one exception was Daily Mail, where reporters obtained the juvenile defendant's name from witnesses to the crime. See 443 U. S., at 99.
However, the statute at issue there imposed a blanket prohibition on the
publication of the information. See id., at 98-99. In contrast, these antidisclosure provisions do not prohibit publication so long as the information
comes from a legal source.

S. Rep. No. 1097, at 93 ("The disclosure of the contents of anintercepted communication that had already become `public

information' or `common knowledge' would not be prohib-ited"). These laws thus do not fall under the axiom that
"the interests in privacy fade when the information involvedalready appears on the public record." Cox Broadcasting,
supra, at 494-495.Third, these cases were concerned with "the `timidity and
self-censorship' which may result from allowing the mediato be punished for publishing certain truthful information."
Florida Star, 491 U. S., at 535. But fear of "timidity and
self-censorship" is a basis for upholding, not striking down,these antidisclosure provisions: They allow private conversations to transpire without inhibition. And unlike the statuteat issue in

Florida Star, which had no scienter requirement,
see id., at 539, these statutes only address those who knowingly disclose an illegally intercepted conversation.4 They
do not impose a duty to inquire into the source of the information and one could negligently disclose the contents of anillegally intercepted communication without liability.

In sum, it is obvious that the Daily Mail cases upon whichthe Court relies do not address the question presented here.
Our decisions themselves made this clear: "The Daily Mailprinciple does not settle the issue whether, in cases where
information has been acquired unlawfully by a newspaperor by a source, government may ever punish not only the
unlawful acquisition, but the ensuing publication as well."

U. S., at 105 ("Our holding in this case is narrow. There isno issue before us of unlawful press [conduct]");

4 In 1986, to ensure that only the most culpable could face liability for
disclosure, Congress increased the scienter requirement from "willful"
to "intentional." 18 U. S. C. $ 2511(1)(c); see also S. Rep. No. 99-541, p. 6
(1986) ("In order to underscore that the inadvertent reception of a protected communication is not a crime, the subcommittee changed the state

Undaunted, the Court places an inordinate amount ofweight upon the fact that the receipt of an illegally intercepted communication has not been criminalized. See ante,
at 528-532. But this hardly renders those who knowinglyreceive and disclose such communications "law-abiding,"

ante, at 529, and it certainly does not bring them under the
Daily Mail principle. The transmission of the intercepted
communication from the eavesdropper to the third partyis itself illegal; and where, as here, the third party then

knowingly discloses that communication, another illegal acthas been committed. The third party in this situation cannot be likened to the reporters in the Daily Mail cases, wholawfully obtained their information through consensual interviews or public documents.These laws are content neutral; they only regulate information that was illegally obtained; they do not restrict republication of what is already in the public domain; theyimpose no special burdens upon the media; they have a scienter requirement to provide fair warning; and they pro-mote the privacy and free speech of those using cellular
telephones. It is hard to imagine a more narrowly tailoredprohibition of the disclosure of illegally intercepted communications, and it distorts our precedents to review these
statutes under the often fatal standard of strict scrutiny.
These laws therefore should be upheld if they further a sub5 Tellingly, we noted in Florida Star that "[t]o the extent sensitive information rests in private hands, the government may under some circumstances forbid its nonconsensual acquisition, thereby bringing outside of the Daily Mail principle the publication of any information so

stantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppressionof free speech, and they do.

Congress and the overwhelming majority of States rea-sonably have concluded that sanctioning the knowing disclosure of illegally intercepted communications will deterthe initial interception itself, a crime which is extremely
difficult to detect. It is estimated that over 20 million scanners capable of intercepting cellular transmissions currentlyare in operation, see Thompson, Cell Phone Snooping: Why

Electronic Eavesdropping Goes Unpunished, 35 Am. Crim.L. Rev. 137, 149 (1997), notwithstanding the fact that Congress prohibited the marketing of such devices eight yearsago, see 47 U. S. C. $ 302a(d).

6 As Congress recognized,

"[a]ll too often the invasion of privacy itself will go unknown.Only by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be

adequately protected." S. Rep. No. 1097, at 69. See alsoHearings on H. R. 3378 before the Subcommittee on Courts,
Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of theHouse Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. and
2d Sess., 290 (1986) ("Congress should be under no illusion . . . that the Department [of Justice], because of thedifficulty of such investigations, would be able to bring a

substantial number of successful prosecutions").Nonetheless, the Court faults Congress for providing
"no empirical evidence to support the assumption that theprohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal interceptions," ante, at 530-531, and insists that "there
is no basis for assuming that imposing sanctions upon respondents will deter the unidentified scanner from contin6 The problem is pervasive because legal "radio scanners [may be] modified to intercept cellular calls." S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 9. For example,

uing to engage in surreptitious interceptions," ante, at 531.It is the Court's reasoning, not the judgment of Congress

and numerous States regarding the necessity of these laws,which disappoints.

The "quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfyheightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will
vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the
justification raised." Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 391 (2000). "[C]ourts must accord
substantial deference to the predictive judgments of Con-gress."

Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 665 (citing Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National
Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 103 (1973)). This deference recognizes that, as an institution, Congress is far better equipped
than the judiciary to evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon complex issues and that "[s]ound policymaking
often requires legislators to forecast future events and to
anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable." Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S.,
at 665. Although we must nonetheless independently evaluate such congressional findings in performing our constitutional review, this "is not a license to reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions
with our own." Id., at 666.

The "dry-up-the-market" theory, which posits that it is
possible to deter an illegal act that is difficult to police by
preventing the wrongdoer from enjoying the fruits of the
crime, is neither novel nor implausible. It is a time-tested
theory that undergirds numerous laws, such as the prohibition of the knowing possession of stolen goods. See 2
W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 8.10(a),

profitable. It is obvious that the receiver must be a principal target of any society anxious to stamp out theft in
its various forms"). We ourselves adopted the exclusionary

rule based upon similar reasoning, believing that it would"deter unreasonable searches,"

Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S.
298, 306 (1985), by removing an officer's "incentive to dis-regard [the Fourth Amendment],"

Elkins v. United States,
364 U. S. 206, 217 (1960).7The same logic applies here and demonstrates that the

incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms
is no greater than essential to further the interest of protect-ing the privacy of individual communications. Were there

no prohibition on disclosure, an unlawful eavesdropper whowanted to disclose the conversation could anonymously launder the interception through a third party and thereby avoiddetection. Indeed, demand for illegally obtained private information would only increase if it could be disclosed with-out repercussion. The law against interceptions, which the
Court agrees is valid, would be utterly ineffectual withoutthese antidisclosure provisions.

For a similar reason, we upheld against First Amendment
challenge a law prohibiting the distribution of child pornography. See New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982). Just
as with unlawfully intercepted electronic communications,
we there noted the difficulty of policing the "low-profile,
clandestine industry" of child pornography production and
concurred with 36 legislatures that "[t]he most expeditious
if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be
to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe
criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product." Id., at 760. In so doing, we
did not demand, nor did Congress provide, any empirical

evidence. See Elkins, 364 U. S., at 218 ("Empirical statistics are not
available to show that the inhabitants of states which follow the exclusionary rule suffer less from lawless searches and seizures than do those
of states which admit evidence unlawfully obtained"). When it comes
to this Court's awesome power to strike down an Act of Congress as unconstitutional, it should not be "do as we say, not as we do."

evidence to buttress this basic syllogism. Indeed, we re-affirmed the theory's vitality in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S.

103, 109-110 (1990), finding it "surely reasonable for theState to conclude that it will decrease the production of child
pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view theproduct, thereby decreasing demand."

At base, the Court's decision to hold these statutes un-constitutional rests upon nothing more than the bald substitution of its own prognostications in place of the rea-soned judgment of 41 legislative bodies and the United
States Congress.9 The Court does not explain how or fromwhere Congress should obtain statistical evidence about the
effectiveness of these laws, and "[s]ince as a practical matterit is never easy to prove a negative, it is hardly likely that
conclusive factual data could ever be assembled." Elkins,
supra, at 218. Reliance upon the "dry-up-the-market" the8 The Court attempts to distinguish Ferber and Osborne on the ground
that they involved low-value speech, but this has nothing to do with the
reasonableness of the "dry-up-the-market" theory. The Court also posits
that Congress here could simply have increased the penalty for intercepting cellular communications. See ante, at 529. But the Court's back-seat
legislative advice does nothing to undermine the reasonableness of Congress' belief that prohibiting only the initial interception would not effectively protect the privacy interests of cellular telephone users.

9 The Court observes that in many of the cases litigated under $ 2511(1),

"the person or persons intercepting the communication ha[ve] been
known." Ante, at 530. Of the 206 cases cited in the appendices, 143
solely involved $ 2511(1)(a) claims of wrongful interception--disclosure
was not at issue. It is of course unremarkable that intentional interception cases have not been pursued where the identity of the eavesdropper
was unknown. Of the 61 disclosure and use cases with published facts
brought under $$ 2511(1)(c) and (d), 9 involved an unknown or unproved
eavesdropper, 1 involved a lawful pen register, and 5 involved recordings
that were not surreptitious. Thus, as relevant, 46 disclosure cases involved known eavesdroppers. Whatever might be gleaned from this figure, the Court is practicing voodoo statistics when it states that it undermines the "dry-up-the-market" theory. See ante, at 531, n. 17. These
cases say absolutely nothing about the interceptions and disclosures that
have been deterred.

ory is both logical and eminently reasonable, and our prece-dents make plain that it is "far stronger than mere speculation." United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454,475 (1995).

These statutes also protect the important interests of de-terring clandestine invasions of privacy and preventing the
involuntary broadcast of private communications. Over a
century ago, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis recognizedthat "[t]he intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon

advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some re-treat from the world, and man, under the refining influence
of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that
solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual." The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193, 196
(1890). "There is necessarily, and within suitably defined
areas, a . . . freedom not to speak publicly, one which serves
the same ultimate end as freedom of speech in its affirmative aspect." Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, 559 (1985) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). One who speaks into a phone "is
surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the
mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world." Katz v.
United States, 389 U. S. 347, 352 (1967); cf. Gelbard v. United
States, 408 U. S. 41, 52 (1972) (compelling testimony about
matters obtained from an illegal interception at a grand jury
proceeding "compounds the statutorily proscribed invasion
of . . . privacy by adding to the injury of the interception the
insult of . . . disclosure").

These statutes undeniably protect this venerable right
of privacy. Concomitantly, they further the First Amendment rights of the parties to the conversation. "At the
heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each
person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence."

privacy of individual thought and expression," United States

v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407U. S. 297, 302 (1972), these statutes further the "uninhibited,

robust, and wide-open" speech of the private parties, New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). Unlike the laws at issue in the Daily Mail cases, which servedonly to protect the identities and actions of a select group

of individuals, these laws protect millions of people who
communicate electronically on a daily basis. The chillingeffect of the Court's decision upon these private conversations will surely be great: An estimated 49.1 million ana-log cellular telephones are currently in operation. See Hao,
Nokia Profits from Surge in Cell Phones, Fla. Today, July 18,
1999, p. E1.

Although the Court recognizes and even extols the virtues
of this right to privacy, see ante, at 532-533, these are "mere
words," W. Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act v, sc. 3,
overridden by the Court's newfound right to publish unlawfully acquired information of "public concern," ante,
at 525. The Court concludes that the private conversation
between Gloria Bartnicki and Anthony Kane is somehow a
"debate . . . . worthy of constitutional protection." Ante,
at 535. Perhaps the Court is correct that "[i]f the statements about the labor negotiations had been made in a
public arena--during a bargaining session, for example--
they would have been newsworthy." Ante, at 525. The
point, however, is that Bartnicki and Kane had no intention of contributing to a public "debate" at all, and it is
perverse to hold that another's unlawful interception and
knowing disclosure of their conversation is speech "worthy
of constitutional protection." Cf. Hurley v. Irish-American
Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.
557, 573 (1995) ("[O]ne important manifestation of the principle of free speech is that one who chooses to speak may
also decide `what not to say' "). The Constitution should not
protect the involuntary broadcast of personal conversations.
Even where the communications involve public figures or

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
concern public matters, the conversations are nonethelessprivate and worthy of protection. Although public persons

may have forgone the right to live their lives screened frompublic scrutiny in some areas, it does not and should not
follow that they also have abandoned their right to have aprivate conversation without fear of it being intentionally
intercepted and knowingly disclosed.

The Court's decision to hold inviolable our right to broad-cast conversations of "public importance" enjoys little support in our precedents. As discussed above, given the quali-fied nature of their holdings, the

Daily Mail cases cannot
bear the weight the Court places upon them. More mystifying still is the Court's reliance upon the "Pentagon Papers"
case, New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713
(1971) (per curiam), which involved the United States' attempt to prevent the publication of Defense Department
documents relating to the Vietnam War. In addition to involving Government controlled information, that case fell
squarely under our precedents holding that prior restraints
on speech bear " `a heavy presumption against . . . constitutionality.' " Id., at 714. Indeed, it was this presumption that caused Justices Stewart and White to join the 6-to-3
per curiam decision. See id., at 730-731 (White, J., joined
by Stewart, J., concurring) ("I concur in today's judgments,
but only because of the concededly extraordinary protection
against prior restraints enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system"). By no stretch of the imagination can
the statutes at issue here be dubbed "prior restraints."
And the Court's "parallel reasoning" from other inapposite
cases fails to persuade. Ante, at 535.

Surely "the interest in individual privacy," ante, at 518,
at its narrowest, must embrace the right to be free from
surreptitious eavesdropping on, and involuntary broadcast
of, our cellular telephone conversations. The Court subordinates that right, not to the claims of those who themselves wish to speak, but to the claims of those who wish to

UNITED STATES v. HATTER, JUDGE, UNITEDSTATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 99-1978. Argued February 20, 2001--Decided May 21, 2001
In 1982, Congress extended Medicare to federal employees. That new

law meant, inter alia, that then-sitting federal judges, like all other
federal employees and most other citizens, began to have Medicare taxes
withheld from their salaries. In 1983, Congress required all newly
hired federal employees to participate in Social Security and permitted,
without requiring, about 96% of the then-currently employed federal
employees to participate in that program. The remaining 4%--a class
consisting of the President, other high-level Government employees, and
all federal judges--were required to participate, except that those who
contributed to a "covered" retirement program could modify their participation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction for retirement and Social Security unchanged, in effect allowing them to avoid
any additional financial obligation as a result of joining Social Security.
A "covered" program was defined to include any retirement system to
which an employee had to contribute, which did not encompass the noncontributory pension system for federal judges, whose financial obligations (and payroll deductions) therefore had to increase. A number of
federal judges appointed before 1983 filed this suit, arguing that the
1983 law violated the Compensation Clause, which guarantees federal
judges a "Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their
Continuance in Office," U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1. Initially, the Court
of Federal Claims ruled against the judges, but the Federal Circuit reversed. On certiorari, because some Justices were disqualified and this
Court failed to find a quorum, the Federal Circuit's judgment was affirmed "with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided
court." 519 U. S. 801. On remand, the Court of Federal Claims found
that the judges' Medicare claims were time barred and that a 1984 judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation, making damages minimal. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the Compensation
Clause prevented the Government from collecting Medicare and Social
Security taxes from the judges and that the violation was not cured by
the 1984 pay increase.

558 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Syllabus
Held:

1. The Compensation Clause prevents the Government from collecting Social Security taxes, but not Medicare taxes, from federal judges
who held office before Congress extended those taxes to federal employees. Pp. 565-578.

(a) The Court rejects the judges' claim that the "law of the case"
doctrine now prevents consideration of the Compensation Clause because an affirmance by an equally divided Court is conclusive and binding upon the parties. United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 216, on
which the judges rely, concerned an earlier case in which the Court
heard oral argument and apparently considered the merits before affirming by an equally divided Court. The law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S.
332, 347, n. 18. When this case previously was here, due to absence of
a quorum, the Court could not consider either the merits or whether to
consider those merits through a grant of certiorari. This fact, along
with the obvious difficulty of finding other equivalent substitute forums,
convinces the Court that Pink does not control here. Pp. 565-566.

(b) Although the Compensation Clause prohibits taxation that singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment, it does not forbid
Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including
an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges and other
citizens. See O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 282. Insofar as
Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245, 255, holds to the contrary, that case is
overruled. See O'Malley, supra, at 283. There is no good reason why
a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. See
Evans, supra, at 265, 267 (Holmes, J., dissenting); O'Malley, supra,
at 281-283. Although Congress cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government
salaries, a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects
compensation indirectly, not directly. See United States v. Will, 449
U. S. 200, 226. And those prophylactic considerations that may justify
an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here,
where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that

a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to
influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Compensation
Clause, see Evans, supra, at 251-252, cannot justify a special judicial
exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats. Because the Medicare tax is nondiscriminatory, the Federal Circuit erred in finding its application to federal
judges unconstitutional. Pp. 566-572.

Syllabus
(c) However, because the special retroactivity-related Social Security rules enacted in 1983 effectively singled out then-sitting federal
judges for unfavorable treatment, the Compensation Clause forbids the
application of the Social Security tax to those judges. Four features of
the law, taken together, lead to the conclusion that it discriminates in a
manner the Clause forbids. First, the statutory history, context, purpose, and language indicate that the category of "federal employees" is
the appropriate class against which the asserted discrimination must be
measured. Second, the practical upshot of defining "covered" system
in the way the law did was to permit nearly every then-current federal
employee, but not federal judges, to avoid the newly imposed obligation
to pay Social Security taxes. Third, the new law imposed a substantial
cost on federal judges with little or no expectation of substantial benefit
for most of them. Inclusion meant a deduction of about $2,000 per year,
whereas 95% of the then-active judges had already qualified for Social
Security (due to private sector employment) before becoming judges.
And participation would benefit only the minority of judges who had not
worked the quarters necessary to be fully insured under Social Security.
Fourth, the Government's sole justification for the statutory distinction
between judges and other high-level federal employees--i. e., equalizing
the financial burdens imposed by the noncontributory judicial retirement system and the contributory system to which the other employees
belonged--is unsound because such equalization takes place not by offering all current federal employees (including judges) the same opportunities but by employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets an
advantage related to those protections afforded judges by the Clause,
and because the two systems are not equalized with any precision.
Thus, the 1983 law is very different from the nondiscriminatory tax
upheld in O'Malley, supra, at 282. The Government's additional arguments--that Article III protects judges only against a reduction in
stated salary, not against indirect measures that only reduce take-home
pay; that there is no evidence here that Congress singled out judges for
special treatment in order to intimidate, influence, or punish them; and
that the law disfavored not only judges but also the President and other
high-ranking federal employees--are unconvincing. Pp. 572-578.

2. The Compensation Clause violation was not cured by the 1984 pay
increase for federal judges. The context in which that increase took
place reveals nothing to suggest that it was intended to make whole
the losses sustained by the pre-1983 judges. Rather, everything in the
record suggests that the increase was meant to halt a slide in purchasing
power resulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation. Although
a circumstance-specific approach is more complex than the Government's

proposed automatic approach, whereby a later salary increase would
terminate a Compensation Clause violation regardless of the increase's
purpose, there is no reason why such relief as damages or an exemption

Opinion of the Court
Medicare and Social Security taxes from a small number offederal judges who held office nearly 20 years ago--before

Congress extended the taxes to federal employees in theearly 1980's.

In our view, the Clause does not prevent Congress fromimposing a "non-discriminatory tax laid generally" upon
judges and other citizens, O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S.277, 282 (1939), but it does prohibit taxation that singles out
judges for specially unfavorable treatment. Consequently,unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Congress may
apply the Medicare tax--a nondiscriminatory tax--to then-sitting federal judges. The special retroactivity-related Social Security rules that Congress enacted in 1984, however,effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment. Hence, like the Court of Appeals, weconclude that the Clause forbids the application of the Social
Security tax to those judges.

I
A

The Medicare law before us is straightforward. In 1965,Congress created a Federal Medicare "hospital insurance"

program and tied its financing to Social Security. See SocialSecurity Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 291. The Medicare
law required most American workers (whom Social Securitycovered) to pay an additional Medicare tax. But it did
not require Federal Government employees (whom SocialSecurity did not cover) to pay that tax. See 26 U. S. C.

$$ 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.).In 1982, Congress, believing that "[f]ederal workers should
bear a more equitable share of the costs of financing the ben-efits to which many of them eventually became entitled,"
S. Rep. No. 97-494, pt. 1, p. 378 (1982), extended both Medi-care eligibility and Medicare taxes to all currently employed
federal employees as well as to all newly hired federal em-ployees, Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982,

Opinion of the Court

$ 278, 96 Stat. 559-563. That new law meant that (as of Jan-uary 1, 1983) all federal judges, like all other federal employees and most other citizens, would have to contribute be-tween 1.30% and 1.45% of their federal salaries to Medicare's
hospital insurance system. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101(b)(4)-(6).The Social Security law before us is more complex. In
1935, Congress created the Social Security program. See
Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620. For nearly 50 years, thatprogram covered employees in the private sector, but it

did not cover Government employees. See 26 U. S. C.$$ 3121(b)(5), (6) (1982 ed.) (excluding federal employees);

$ 3121(b)(7) (excluding state employees). In 1981, a National
Commission on Social Security Reform, convened by the
President and chaired by Alan Greenspan, noting the need
for "action . . . to strengthen the financial status" of Social
Security, recommended that Congress extend the program to
cover Federal, but not state or local, Government employees.
Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform 2-1, 2-7 (Jan. 1983). In particular, the Commission
recommended that Congress require all incoming federal employees (those hired after January 1, 1984) to enter the Social
Security system and to pay Social Security taxes. Id., at
2-7. The Commission emphasized that "present Federal
employees will not be affected by this recommendation."
Id., at 2-8.

In 1983, Congress enacted the Commission's recommendation into law (effective January 1, 1984) with an important exception. See Social Security Amendments of 1983,

$ 101(b)(1), 97 Stat. 69 (amending 26 U. S. C. $$ 3121(b)(5),
(6)). As the Commission had recommended, Congress required all newly hired federal employees to participate in
the Social Security program. It also permitted, without
requiring, almost all (about 96%) then-currently employed
federal employees to participate.

Contrary to the Commission's recommendation, however,
the law added an exception. That exception seemed to re532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

563Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
strict the freedom of choice of the remaining 4% of all cur-rent employees. This class consisted of the President, Vice

President, high-level Executive Branch employees, Membersof Congress, a few other Legislative Branch employees, and
all federal judges. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 410(a)(5)(C)-(G); seealso H. R. Rep. No. 98-25, p. 39 (1983); H. R. Conf. Rep.
No. 98-542, p. 13 (1983) (noting that for these current federal
employees "the rules are being changed in the middle of thegame"). The new law seemed to

require this class of current
federal employees to enter into the Social Security program,see 42 U. S. C. $$ 410(a)(5)(C)-(G). But, as to almost all of

these employees, the new law imposed no additional financial
obligation or burden.

That is because the new law then created an exception to
the exception, see Federal Employees' Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983, $$ 203(a)(2), 208, 97
Stat. 1107, 1111 (codified at note following 5 U. S. C. $ 8331).
The exception to the exception said that any member of this
small class of current high-level officials (4% of all thencurrent employees) who contributed to a "covered" retirement program nonetheless could choose to modify their
participation in a manner that left their total payroll deduction--for retirement and Social Security--unchanged. A
"covered" employee paying 7% of salary to a "covered" program could continue to pay that 7% and no more, in effect
avoiding any additional financial obligation as a result of joining Social Security.

The exception to the exception defined a "covered" program to include the Civil Service Retirement and Disability
System--a program long available to almost all federal employees--as well as any other retirement system to which an
employee must contribute. $$ 203(a)(2)(A), (D). The definition of "covered" program, however, did not encompass the
pension system for federal judges--a system that is noncontributory in respect to a judge (but contributory in respect
to a spouse).

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
564 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
The upshot is that the 1983 law was specifically aimed
at extending Social Security to federal employees. It left
about 96% of those who were currently employed free to
choose not to participate in Social Security, thereby avoiding
any increased financial obligation. It required the remaining 4% to participate in Social Security while freeing them
of any added financial obligation (or additional payroll deduction) so long as they previously had participated in other
contributory retirement programs. But it left those who
could not participate in a contributory program without a
choice. Their financial obligations (and payroll deductions)
had to increase. And this last mentioned group consisted
almost exclusively of federal judges.

B
This litigation began in 1989, when eight federal judges,
all appointed before 1983, sued the Government for "compensation" in the United States Claims Court. They argued
that the 1983 law, in requiring them to pay Social Security
taxes, violated the Compensation Clause. Initially, the
Claims Court ruled against the judges on jurisdictional
grounds. 21 Cl. Ct. 786 (1990). The Court of Appeals reversed. 953 F. 2d 626 (CA Fed. 1992). On remand, eight
more judges joined the lawsuit. They contested the extension to judges of the Medicare tax as well.

The Court of Federal Claims held against the judges on
the merits. 31 Fed. Cl. 436 (1994). The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995). The Government petitioned this
Court for a writ of certiorari. Some Members of this Court
were disqualified from hearing the matter, and we failed to
find a quorum of six Justices. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1. Consequently, the Court of Appeals' judgment was affirmed "with
the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided
court." 519 U. S. 801 (1996); see 28 U. S. C. $ 2109.

565Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
On remand from the Court of Appeals, the Court of Federal Claims found (a) that the 6-year statute of limitations,
see 28 U. S. C. $$ 2401(a), 2501, barred some claims, including
all Medicare claims; and (b) that, in any event, a subsequently
enacted judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation, making damages minimal. 38 Fed. Cl. 166 (1997). The
Court of Appeals (eventually en banc) reversed both determinations. 203 F. 3d 795 (CA Fed. 2000).

The Government again petitioned for certiorari. It asked
this Court to consider two questions:

(1) Whether Congress violated the Compensation Clause

when it extended the Medicare and Social Security taxes
to the salaries of sitting federal judges; and

(2) If so, whether any such violation ended when Congress

subsequently increased the salaries of all federal judges
by an amount greater than the new taxes.
Given the specific statutory provisions at issue and the
passage of time, seven Members of this Court had (and now
have) no financial stake in the outcome of this case. Consequently a quorum was, and is, available to consider the questions presented. And we granted the Government's petition
for a writ of certiorari.

II

At the outset, the judges claim that the "law of the case"
doctrine prevents us from now considering the first question
presented, namely, the scope of the Compensation Clause.
They note that the Government presented that same question in its petition from the Court of Appeals' earlier ruling
on liability. They point out that our earlier denial of that
petition for lack of a quorum had the "same effect as" an
"affirmance by an equally divided court," 28 U. S. C. $ 2109.
And they add that this Court has said that an affirmance by
an equally divided Court is "conclusive and binding upon the
parties as respects that controversy." United States v.
Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 216 (1942).

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
566 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
Pink, however, concerned a case, United States v. MoscowFire Ins. Co., 309 U. S. 624 (1940), in which this Court had

heard oral argument and apparently considered the meritsprior to concluding that affirmance by an equally divided
Court was appropriate. The law of the case doctrine pre-sumes a hearing on the merits. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan,
440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). This case does not involvea previous consideration of the merits. Indeed, when this
case previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum,we could not consider either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of certiorari.This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding other
equivalent substitute forums, convinces us that Pink's state-ment does not control the outcome here, that the "law of the
case" doctrine does not prevent our considering both issuespresented, and that we should now proceed to decide them.

III
The Court of Appeals upheld the judges' claim of tax im-munity upon the authority of

Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245(1920). That case arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evans

challenged Congress' authority to include sitting federaljudges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the
Sixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier.See Revenue Act of 1918, $ 213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining "gross
income" to include judicial salaries). In Evans itself, theCourt held that the Compensation Clause barred application
of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge beforeCongress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264. A few years
later, the Court extended Evans, making clear that its ra-tionale covered not only judges appointed before Congress
enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took placeafter the tax had become law. See

Miles v. Graham, 268U. S. 501, 509 (1925).

Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruled
Miles. O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277 (1939). But,

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

567Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expresslyoverrule

Evans itself. 64 F. 3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals added that, if "changes in judicial doctrine" had sig-nificantly undermined

Evans' holding, this "Court itself
would have overruled the case." Ibid. Noting that thiscase is like

Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O'Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appealsheld that

Evans controlled the outcome. 64 F. 3d, at 650.
Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxesto these preenactment judges violated the Compensation

Clause.

The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to
the instant case, given that "it is this Court's prerogative
alone to overrule one of its precedents." State Oil Co. v.
Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijas v.
Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).
Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans. We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds
that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a
generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of
federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before
enactment of the tax.

The Court's opinion in Evans began by explaining why the
Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we
begin by reaffirming that explanation. As Evans points
out, 253 U. S., at 251-252, the Compensation Clause, along
with the Clause securing federal judges appointments "during good Behavior," U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1--the practical
equivalent of life tenure--helps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the "complete independence of the
courts of justice." The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961). Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of the
three" branches of Government. Id., at 465-466. It has "no
influence over either the sword or the purse." Id., at 465.

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
568 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
It has "no direction either of the strength or of the wealthof the society."

Ibid. It has "neither FORCE nor WILL
but merely judgment." Ibid.Hamilton's view, and that of many other Founders, was

informed by firsthand experience of the harmful conse-quences brought about when a King of England "made
Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their
offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries." TheDeclaration of Independence || 11. And Hamilton knew that

"a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over
his will." The Federalist No. 79, at 472. For this reason,
he observed, "[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed
provision for their support." Ibid.; see also id., No. 48, at
310 (J. Madison) ("[A]s the legislative department alone has
access to the pockets of the people, and has . . . full
discretion . . . over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill
the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the
latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of
the former").

Evans properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure exist, "not to benefit the judges," but "as
a limitation imposed in the public interest." 253 U. S., at
253. They "promote the public weal," id., at 248, in part
by helping to induce "learned" men and women "to quit the
lucrative pursuits" of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294, but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit necessary
if judges are "to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty," W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in the
United States 143 (1911).

Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important. A judge may have to decide "between
the Government and the man whom that Government is
prosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
community, and the poorest and most unpopular." Proceed-ings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-

1830, p. 616 (1830). A judge's decision may affect an individ-ual's "property, his reputation, his life, his all."

Ibid. In
the "exercise of these duties," the judge must "observe theutmost fairness."

Ibid. The judge must be "perfectly and
completely independent, with nothing to influence or contro[l] him but God and his conscience." Ibid. The "great-est scourge . . . ever inflicted," Marshall thought, "was an

ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary." Id., at 619.Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these constitutional principles. See, e. g., Wilson,
Lectures on Law (1791), in 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J.
Andrews ed. 1896) (stating that judges should be "completely independent" in "their salaries, and in their offices");
McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec.
11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 539 (J.
Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished compensation
disposes judges to be "more easy and independent"); see also
1 Kent, supra, at *294 ("[P]ermanent support" and the "tenure of their office" "is well calculated . . . to give [ judges] the
requisite independence"). They are no less important today
than in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule Evans
does not, in our view, diminish their importance.

We also agree with Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond a

legislative effort directly to diminish a judge's pay, say, by
ordering a lower salary. 253 U. S., at 254. Otherwise a

legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law,
for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect.

Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans' application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before it--a nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it
treated other citizens. Evans' basic holding was that the

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
570 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clauseforbids "all diminution," including "taxation," "whether for

one purpose or another." Id., at 255. The Federal Circuitrelied upon this holding. 64 F. 3d, at 650. But, in our view,
it is no longer sound law.For one thing, the dissenters in

Evans cast the majority's
reasoning into doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by Justice
Brandeis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers "noreason for exonerating" a judge "from the ordinary duties of

a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a manto pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a
judge." 253 U. S., at 265. Holmes analogized the "diminution" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state
law might impose upon interstate commerce. If "there was
no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted
one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted." Id., at 267.

For another thing, this Court's subsequent law repudiated
Evans' reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended
Evans' tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment
of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See
O'Malley, 307 U. S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so
doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The
Court said that the question was whether judges are immune
"from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else
within the defined classes . . . is subjected." 307 U. S., at
282. Holding that judges are not "immun[e] from sharing
with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government," ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession
had criticized Evans' contrary conclusion, and that courts
outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U. S., at 281. And the Court concluded that "a
non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not,
when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

571Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
of his salary within the prohibition of Article III." Id., at
282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles "cannot survive." 307
U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that "[b]ecause
Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O'Malley must also be read
to undermine the reasoning of Evans." United States v.
Will, 449 U. S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980).

Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandeis, and of this Court in
O'Malley, is correct. There is no good reason why a judge
should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We
concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot
directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable
effort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at
226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid.
(distinguishing between measures that directly and those
that indirectly diminish judicial compensation). And those
prophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute rule
forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, where
indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that
a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent.
Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution's compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax,
not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats.

For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause
does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change
in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted
or took effect. Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that
case, in O'Malley's words, "cannot survive." 307 U. S., at
283.

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
572 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
The Government points out that the Medicare tax is justsuch a nondiscriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor

the federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, inso-far as the Court of Appeals found that application of the
Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, wereverse its decision.

IV
The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respond-ents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon thensitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it dis-criminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the
Clause, even as interpreted in O'Malley, not Evans. Cf.O'Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judges
are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which every-one else within the defined classes . . . is subjected" (emphasis added)). After examining the statute's details, we agreewith the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that
the Clause forbids. Four features of the law, taken together,lead us to this conclusion.

First, federal employees had remained outside the SocialSecurity system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage of
the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the So-cial Security Commission's recommendation to bring those
employees within the law. See supra, at 562. And the lawitself deals primarily with that subject. Thus, history, context, statutory purpose, and statutory language, taken to-gether, indicate that the category of "federal employees" is
the appropriate class against which we must measure theasserted discrimination.

Second, the law, as applied in practice, in effect imposed anew financial obligation upon sitting judges, but it did not
impose a new financial burden upon any other group of (then)current federal employees. We have previously explained
why that is so. See supra, at 562-564. The law requiredall newly hired federal employees to join Social Security and
pay related taxes. It gave 96% of all current employees

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

573Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
(employed as of January 1, 1984, or earlier) total freedom toenter, or not to enter, the system as they chose. It gave the

remaining 4% of all current employees the freedom to main-tain their pre-1984 payroll deductions, provided that they
were currently enrolled in a "covered" system. And it de-fined "covered" system in a way that included virtually all
of that 4%, except for federal judges. See supra, at 563-
564. The practical upshot is that the law permitted nearlyevery current federal employee, but not federal judges, to

avoid the newly imposed financial obligation.Third, the law, by including sitting judges in the system,
adversely affected most of them. Inclusion meant a requirement to pay a tax of about $2,000 per year, deducted from a
monthly salary check. App. 49. At the same time, 95% of
the then-active judges had already qualified for Social Security (due to private sector employment) before becoming
judges. See id., at 115. And participation in Social Security as judges would benefit only a minority. See id., at 116-
119 (reviewing examples of individual judges and demonstrating that participation in Social Security primarily would
benefit the minority of judges who had not worked the 40
quarters necessary to be fully insured). The new law imposed a substantial cost on federal judges with little or no
expectation of substantial benefit for most of them.

Fourth, when measured against Compensation Clause objectives, the Government's justification for the statutory distinction (between judges, who do, and other federal employees, who do not, incur additional financial obligations) is
unsound. The sole justification, according to the Government, is one of "equaliz[ing]" the retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposed upon judges with the
retirement-related obligations that pre-1983 law imposed
upon other current high-level federal employees. Brief for
United States 40. Thus the Government says that the new
financial burden imposed upon judges was meant to make up
for the fact that the judicial retirement system is basically

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
574 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
a noncontributory system, while the system to which other
federal employees belonged was a contributory system. Id.,
at 39-40; Reply Brief for United States 16.

This rationale, however, is the Government's and not necessarily that of Congress, which was silent on the matter.
Cf. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State
Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 50 (1983)
(expressing concern at crediting post hoc explanation of
agency action).

More importantly, the judicial retirement system is noncontributory because it reflects the fact that the Constitution
itself guarantees federal judges life tenure--thereby constitutionally permitting federal judges to draw a salary for life
simply by continuing to serve. Cf. Booth v. United States,
291 U. S. 339, 352 (1934) (holding that Compensation Clause
protects salary of judge who has retired). That fact means
that a contributory system, in all likelihood, would not work.
And, of course, as of 1982, the noncontributory pension salary benefits were themselves part of the judge's compensation. The 1983 statute consequently singles out judges for
adverse treatment solely because of a feature required by
the Constitution to preserve judicial independence. At the
same time, the "equaliz[ation]" in question takes place not
by offering all current federal employees (including judges)
the same opportunities but by employing a statutory disadvantage which offsets a constitutionally guaranteed advantage. Hence, to accept the "justification" offered here is to
permit, through similar reasoning, taxes which have the effect of weakening or eliminating those constitutional guarantees necessary to secure judicial independence, at least insofar as similar guarantees are not enjoyed by others. This
point would be obvious were Congress, say, to deny some of
the benefits of a tax reduction to those with constitutionally
guaranteed life tenure to make up for the fact that other
employees lack such tenure. Although the relationships

575Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
here--among advantages and disadvantages--are less dis-tant and more complex, the principle is similar.

Nor does the statute "equaliz[e]" with any precision. Onthe one hand, the then-current retirement system open to all
federal employees except judges required a typical employeeto contribute 7% to 8% of his or her annual salary. See generally 5 U. S. C. $ 8334(a)(1). In return it provided a Member of Congress, for instance, with a pension that vestedafter five years and increased in value (by 2.5% of the Member's average salary) with each year of service to a maximumof 80% of salary, and covered both employee and survivors.
See 5 U. S. C. $$ 8339, 8341. On the other hand, the judges'
retirement system (based on life tenure) required no contribution for a judge who retired at age 65 (and who met certain
service requirements) to receive full salary. But the right
to receive that salary did not vest until retirement. The
system provided nothing for a judge who left office before
age 65. Nor did the law provide any coverage for a judge's
survivors. Indeed, in 1984, a judge had to contribute 4.5%
of annual salary to obtain a survivor's annuity, which increased in value by 1.25% of the judge's salary per year to a
maximum of 40% of salary. 28 U. S. C. $$ 376(b), (l) (1982
ed.).

These two systems were not equal either before or after
Congress enacted the 1983 law. Before 1983, a typical married federal employee other than a judge had to contribute
7% to 8% of annual salary to receive benefits that were better in some respects (vesting period, spousal benefit) and
worse in some respects (80% salary maximum) than his married judicial counterpart would receive in return for a 4.5%
contribution. The 1983 law imposed an added 5.7% burden
upon the judge, in return for which the typical judge received little, or no, financial benefit. Viewed purely in financial equalization terms, and as applied to typical judges,
the new requirement seems to overequalize, putting the
typical married judge at a financial disadvantage--though

576 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
perhaps it would produce greater equality when applied toother, less typical examples.

Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a lawthat is special--in its manner of singling out judges for disadvantageous treatment, in its justification as necessary to off-set advantages related to constitutionally protected features
of the judicial office, and in the degree of permissible legislative discretion that would have to underlie any determina-tion that the legislation has "equalized" rather than gone too

far. For these reasons the law before us is very differentfrom the "non-discriminatory" tax that

O'Malley upheld.
307 U. S., at 282. Were the Compensation Clause to permit
Congress to enact a discriminatory law with these features,
it would authorize the Legislature to diminish, or to equalize
away, those very characteristics of the Judicial Branch that
Article III guarantees--characteristics which, as we have
said, see supra, at 568-569, the public needs to secure that
judicial independence upon which its rights depend. We
consequently conclude that the 1983 Social Security tax law
discriminates against the Judicial Branch, in violation of the
Compensation Clause.

The Government makes additional arguments in support
of reversal. But we find them unconvincing. It suggests
that Article III protects judges only against a reduction in
stated salary, not against indirect measures that only reduce
take-home pay. Brief for United States 28. In O'Malley,
however, this Court, when upholding a "non-discriminatory"
tax, strongly implied that the Compensation Clause would
bar a discriminatory tax. 307 U. S., at 282. The commentators whose work O'Malley cited said so explicitly. See Fellman, The Diminution of Judicial Salaries, 24 Iowa L. Rev. 89,
99 (1938); see also Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925);
Corwin, Constitutional Law in 1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sci.
Rev. 635, 642 (1920). And in Will, the Court yet more
strongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to reduce judges' salaries through taxes when

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

577Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
those taxes discriminate. 449 U. S., at 226. Indeed, theGovernment itself "assume[s] that discriminatory taxation of

judges would contravene fundamental principles underlyingArticle III, if not the [Compensation] Clause itself." Brief
for United States 37, n. 27.The Government also argues that there is no evidence here
that Congress singled out judges for special treatment in
order to intimidate, influence, or punish them. But thisCourt has never insisted upon such evidence. To require it

is to invite legislative efforts that embody, but lack evidenceof, some such intent, engendering suspicion among the
branches and consequently undermining that mutual respect
that the Constitution demands. Cf. Wilson, Lectures on
Law, in 1 Works of James Wilson, at 364 (stating that judges
"should be removed from the most distant apprehension of
being affected, in their judicial character and capacity, by
anything, except their own behavior and its consequences").
Nothing in the record discloses anything other than benign
congressional motives. If the Compensation Clause is to
offer meaningful protection, however, we cannot limit that
protection to instances in which the Legislature manifests,
say, direct hostility to the Judiciary.

Finally, the Government correctly points out that the law
disfavored not only judges but also the President of the
United States and certain Legislative Branch employees.
As far as we can determine, however, all Legislative
Branch employees were free to join a covered system, and
the record provides us with no example of any current Legislative Branch employee who had failed to do so. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 16-17, 37-38. The President's pension is noncontributory. See note following 3 U. S. C. $ 102. And the
President himself, like the judges, is protected against diminution in his "[c]ompensation." See U. S. Const., Art. II,

$ 1. These facts may help establish congressional good faith.
But, as we have said, we do not doubt that good faith. And
we do not see why, otherwise, the separate and special exam532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN
578 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of the Court
ple of that single individual, the President, should make acritical difference here.

We conclude that, insofar as the 1983 statute requiredthen-sitting judges to join the Social Security system and
pay Social Security taxes, that statute violates the Compen-sation Clause.

V
The second question presented is whether the

"constitutional violation ended when Congress increasedthe statutory salaries of federal judges by an amount

greater than the amount [of the Social Security] taxesdeducted from respondents' judicial salaries." Pet. for
Cert. I.
The Government argues for an affirmative answer. Itpoints to a statutory salary increase that all judges received

in 1984. It says that this increase, subsequent to the imposi-tion of Social Security taxes on judges' salaries, cured any
earlier unconstitutional diminution of salaries in a lesseramount. Otherw ise, if "Congress improperly reduced
judges' salaries from $140,000" per year "to $130,000" peryear, the judges would be able to collect the amount of the
improper reduction, here $10,000, forever--even if Congresscured the improper reduction by raising salaries $20,000, to
$150,000, a year later. Reply Brief for United States 18.To avoid this consequence, the Government argues, we
should simply look to the fact of a later salary increase"whether or not one of Congress's purposes in increasing
the salaries" was "to terminate the constitutional viola-tion." Ibid.

But how could we always decide whether a later salaryincrease terminates a constitutional violation without examining the purpose of that increase? Imagine a violation thataffected only a few. To accept the Government's position
would leave those few at a permanent salary disadvantage.If, for example, Congress reduced the salaries of one group

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

579Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
of judges by 20%, a later increase of 30% applicable to alljudges would leave the first group permanently 20% behind.

And a pay cut that left those judges at a permanent disad-vantage would perpetuate the very harm that the Compensation Clause seeks to prevent.The Court of Appeals consequently examined the context
in which the later pay increases took place in order to determine their relation to the earlier Compensation Clause viola-tion. It found "nothing to suggest" that the later salary

increase at issue here sought "to make whole the losses sus-tained by the pre-1983 judges." 185 F. 3d, at 1362-1363.
The Government presents no evidence to the contrary.

The relevant economic circumstances surrounding the
1984, and subsequent, salary increases include inflation sufficiently serious to erode the real value of judicial salaries
and salary increases insufficient to maintain real salaries or
real compensation parity with many other private-sector
employees. See Report of 1989 Commission on Executive,
Legislative, and Judicial Salaries, Hearings before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 101st Cong., 1st
Sess., 12-13 (1989) (testimony of Lloyd Cutler regarding effect of inflation on judges' salaries since 1969). For instance,
while consumer prices rose 363% between 1969 and 1999, salaries in the private sector rose 421%, and salaries for district
judges rose 253%. See American Bar Association, Federal
Judicial Pay Erosion 11 (Feb. 2001). These figures strongly
suggest that the judicial salary increases simply reflected a
congressional effort to restore both to judges and to Members of Congress themselves some, but not all, of the real
compensation that inflation had eroded. Those salary increases amounted to a congressional effort to adjust judicial
salaries to reflect "fluctuations in the value of money," The
Federalist No. 79, at 473 (A. Hamilton)--the kind of adjustment that the Founders believed "may be requisite," McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11,
1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution, at 539; see

Opinion of the Court
also Rosenn, The Constitutional Guaranty Against Diminu-tion of Judicial Compensation, 24 UCLA L. Rev. 308, 314-

315 (1976).We have found nothing to the contrary. And we therefore
agree with the Court of Appeals' similar conclusion. 185F. 3d, at 1363 ("[E]verything in the record" suggests that the
increase was meant to halt "the slide in purchasing power
resulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation").The Government says that a circumstance-specific approach may prove difficult to administer. Brief for UnitedStates 43. And we concede that examining the circumstances in order to determine whether there is or is not a
relation between an earlier violation and a later increase is
more complex than the Government's proposed automatic approach. But we see no reason why such relief as damages or
an exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable.

Finally, the Government looks to our decision in Will for
support. In that case, federal judges challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative "freezes" that Congress
had imposed upon earlier enacted Government-wide cost-ofliving salary adjustments. The Court found a Compensation Clause violation in respect to the freeze for what was
designated Year One (where Congress had rescinded an earlier voted 4.8% salary increase). Will, 449 U. S., at 225-

226. The Government points out that the Will Court "noted
that Congress, later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutory
increase in judges' salaries that exceeded the salaries that
judges would have received" without the rescission. Brief
for United States 41. And the Government adds that "it
was unquestioned in Will" that the judges could not receive
damages for the time subsequent to this later enactment.
Id., at 41-42.

The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, in
the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later
salary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was "un532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

581Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
questioned" in Will shows that it was not argued. See 449
U. S., at 206, n. 3 (noting that the judges' complaint sought
relief for Year One's diminution only up to the moment of
the subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did not
decide the matter now before us.

We conclude that later statutory salary increases did not
cure the preceding unconstitutional harm.

VI
Insofar as the Court of Appeals found the application of
Medicare taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before
1983 unconstitutional, its judgment is reversed. Insofar as
that court found the application of Social Security taxes to
the salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its judgment is affirmed. We also affirm the Court
of Appeals' determination that the 1984 salary increase received by federal judges did not cure the Compensation
Clause violation. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor took no part in
the consideration or decision of this case.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security
tax to sitting Article III judges in 1984 violated Article III's
Compensation Clause. I part paths with the Court on the
issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal judges in 1983,
which I think was also unconstitutional.1

1 I agree with the Court, see Part II, ante, that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not bar our consideration of the merits. I also join the Court
in holding, see Part V, ante, that any constitutional violation was not remedied by subsequent salary increases.

582 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of Scalia, J.

I
As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245 (1920)--holding that
new taxes of general applicability cannot be applied to sitting
Article III judges--is no longer good law, and should be
overruled. We went out of our way in O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of
Evans, and subsequently recognized, in United States v.
Will, 449 U. S. 200, 227, and n. 31 (1980), that O'Malley had
"undermine[d] the reasoning of Evans." The Court's decision today simply recognizes what should be obvious:
that Evans has not only been undermined, but has in fact
collapsed.

II

My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon
the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive
with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds "that
the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact
a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges,
whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax
law in question was enacted or took effect." Ante, at 571.
Since "the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory
tax," the Court concludes that "application of [that] tax law
to federal judges is [c]onstitutional." Ante, at 572.

But we are dealing here with a "Compensation Clause,"
not a "Discrimination Clause." See U. S. Const., Art. III,

$ 1 ("The Judges . . . shall, at stated Times, receive for their
Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office"). As we have said, "the
Constitution makes no exceptions for `nondiscriminatory' reductions" in judicial compensation, Will, supra, at 226. A
reduction in compensation is a reduction in compensation,
even if all federal employees are subjected to the same cut.
The discrimination criterion that the Court uses would make
sense if the only purpose of the Compensation Clause were

532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN

583Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
to prevent invidious (and possibly coercive) action againstjudges. But as the Court acknowledges, the Clause " `promote[s] the public weal' . . . by helping to induce `learned'men and women to `quit the lucrative pursuits' of the private
sector," ante, at 568 (quoting Evans, supra, at 248; 1 J. Kent,Commentaries on American Law *294). That inducement
would not exist if Congress could cut judicial salaries so long
as it did not do so discriminatorily.What the question comes down to, then, is (1) whether

exemption from a certain tax can constitute part of a judge's"compensation," and (2) if so, whether exemption from the
Medicare tax was part of the judges' compensation here.
The answer to the more general question seems to me obviously yes. Surely the term "compensation" refers to the entire "package" of benefits--not just cash, but retirement benefits, medical care, and exemption from taxation if that is
part of the employment package. It is simply unreasonable
to think that "$150,000 a year tax-free" (if that was the bargain struck) is not higher compensation than "$150,000 a year
subject to taxes." Ask the employees of the World Bank.

The more difficult question--though far from an insoluble
one--is when an exemption from tax constitutes compensation. In most cases, the presence or absence of taxation
upon wages, like the presence or absence of many other factors within the control of government--inflation, for example, or the rates charged by government-owned utilities, or
import duties that increase consumer prices--affects the
value of compensation, but is not an element of compensation
itself. The Framers had this distinction well in mind.
Hamilton, for example, wrote that as a result of "the fluctuations in the value of money," "[i]t was . . . necessary to leave
it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions"
for judicial compensation. The Federalist No. 79, p. 473 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961); see also Will, supra, at 227 (the Constitution "placed faith in the integrity and sound judgment of the
elected representatives to enact increases" in judicial sala532US2 Unit: $U53 [09-06-02 19:14:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN
584 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of Scalia, J.
ries to account for inflation). Since Hamilton thought that
the Compensation Clause "put it out of the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [ judge] for
the worse," The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation does not diminish compensation as that
term is used in the Constitution.

This distinction between Government action affecting
compensation and Government action affecting the value of
compensation was the basis for our statement in O'Malley,
supra, at 282, that "[t]o subject [ judges] to a general tax is
merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that
their particular function in government does not generate
an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government . . . ." I agree with the
Court, therefore, that Evans was wrongly decided--not,
however, because in Evans there was no discrimination, but
because in Evans the universal application of the tax demonstrated that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges but was acting as sovereign rather than
employer, imposing a general tax.

But just as it is clear that a federal employee's sharing of
a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation
(and elimination of that tax-free status not a reduction in
compensation), so also it is clear that a tax-free status conditioned on federal employment is compensation, and its elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges
that if a tax is imposed on the basis of federal employment
(an income tax, for example, payable only by federal judges)
it would constitute a reduction in compensation. It is impossible to understand why a tax that is suspended on the
basis of federal employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not constitute the conferral of compensation--in which case its elimination is a reduction, whether or not federal judges end up being taxed
just like other citizens. Only converting the Compensation

585Cite as: 532 U. S. 557 (2001)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
Clause into a Discrimination Clause can explain a contraryconclusion.

And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the tar-geted extension of the Medicare tax to federal employees
who were previously exempt. It may well be that, in someabstract sense, they are not being "discriminated against,"
since they end up being taxed like other citizens; but thisdoes not alter the fact that, since exemption from the tax
was part of their employment package--since they had anemployment expectation of a preferential exemption from
taxation--their compensation was being reduced. One ofthe benefits of being a federal judge (or any federal employee) had, prior to 1982, been an exemption from the Medi-care tax. This benefit Congress took away, much as a private employer might terminate a contractual commitment topay Medicare taxes on behalf of its employees. The latter
would clearly be a cut in compensation, and so is the former.2Had Congress simply imposed the Medicare tax on its own
employees (including judges) at the time it introduced thattax for other working people, no benefit of federal employment would have been reduced, because, with respect to thenewly introduced tax, none had ever existed. But an extension to federal employees of a tax from which they had pre-viously been exempt by reason of their employment status
seems to me a flat-out reduction of federal employmentcompensation.

2 As the Court explains, the purpose of the Medicare tax extension was
to ensure that federal workers "bear a more equitable share of the costs
of financing the benefits to which many of them eventually became entitled" by reason of their own or their spouses' private-sector employment.
Ante, at 561 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As with the
Social Security tax, therefore, the Medicare tax aspect of this case does
not present the situation in which a tax exemption has been eliminated in
return for some other benefit, different in kind but equivalent in value.
Cf. ante, at 573 ("[P]articipation in Social Security as judges would benefit
only a minority").

586 UNITED STATES v. HATTER

Opinion of Thomas, J.

III
As should be clear from the above, though I agree withthe Court that the extension of the Social Security tax to

federal judges runs afoul of the Compensation Clause,I disagree with the Court's grounding of this holding on the
discriminatory manner in which the extension occurred. Inthis part of its opinion, however, the Court's antidiscrimination rationale is slightly different from that which appearedin its discussion of the Medicare tax. There, the focus was
on discrimination compared with ordinary citizens; here, thefocus is on discrimination vis-a` -vis other federal employees.
(As the Court explains, federal judges, unlike nearly allother federal employees, were not given the opportunity to
opt out of paying the tax.) On my analysis, it would notmatter if every federal employee had been made subject to
the Social Security tax along with judges, so long as one ofthe previous entitlements of their federal employment had
been exemption from that tax. Federal judges, unlike allother federal employees except the President, see Art. II,

$ 1, cl. 7, cannot, consistent with the Constitution, have theircompensation diminished. If this case involved salary cuts
to pay for Social Security, rather than taxes to pay for SocialSecurity, the irrelevance of whether other federal employees
were covered by the operative legislation would be clear.

* * *
I join in the judgment that extension of the Social Security
tax to sitting Article III judges was unconstitutional. Iwould affirm the Federal Circuit's holding that extension of

the Medicare tax was unconstitutional as well.

THE WHARF (HOLDINGS) LTD. et al. v. UNITEDINTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS, INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 00-347. Argued March 21, 2001--Decided May 21, 2001
Petitioner The Wharf (Holdings) Limited orally granted respondent

United International Holdings, Inc., an option to buy 10% of the stock
in Wharf's Hong Kong cable system if United rendered certain services,
but internal Wharf documents suggested that Wharf never intended to
carry out its promise. United fulfilled its obligation, but Wharf refused
to permit it to exercise the option. United sued in Federal District
Court, claiming that Wharf's conduct violated, inter alia, $ 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits using "any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance" "in connection with the purchase or sale of any security." 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b). A jury found for
United, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Wharf's secret intent not to honor the option it sold United violates

$ 10(b). Pp. 592-597.

(a) The Court must assume that the "security" at issue is not the
cable system stock, but the option to purchase that stock, because Wharf
conceded this point below. That concession is consistent with the Act's
language defining "security" to include both "any . . . option . . . on
any security" and "any . . . right to . . . purchase" stock. $ 78c(a)(10).
Pp. 593-594.

(b) Wharf's claim that $ 10(b) does not cover oral contracts of sale is
rejected. This Court held in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,
421 U. S. 723, that the Act does not protect a person who did not actually
buy securities, but who might have done so had the seller told the truth.
But United is not a potential buyer; by providing Wharf with its services, it actually bought the option that Wharf sold. And Blue Chip
Stamps did not suggest that oral purchases or sales fall outside the Act's
scope. Neither is there any other convincing reason to interpret the
Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it
applies to "any contract" for a security's purchase or sale, $$ 78c(a)(13),
(14), and oral contracts for the sale of securities are sufficiently common
that the Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every State
consider them enforceable. Pp. 594-596.

(c) Also rejected is Wharf's argument that a secret reservation not
to permit the exercise of an option falls outside $ 10(b) because it does

532US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-02 11:00:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
not relate to the value of a security purchase or the consideration paid,
and hence does not implicate $ 10(b)'s full disclosure policy. Even were
it the case that the Act covers only misrepresentations likely to affect
the value of securities, Wharf's secret reservation was such a misrepresentation. To sell an option while secretly intending not to permit the
option's exercise is misleading, because a buyer normally presumes good
faith. Similarly, the secret reservation misled United about the option's
value, which was, unbeknownst to United, valueless. P. 596.

(d) Finally, the Court rejects Wharf's claim that interpreting the Act
to allow recovery in a case like this one will permit numerous plaintiffs
to bring federal securities claims that are in reality no more than ordinary state breach-of-contract claims lying outside the Act's basic objectives. United's claim is not simply that Wharf failed to carry out a
promise to sell it securities, but that Wharf sold it a security (the option)
while secretly intending from the very beginning not to honor the option. Moreover, Wharf has not shown that its concern has proved serious as a practical matter in the past or that it is likely to prove serious
in the future. Pp. 596-597.

210 F. 3d 1207, affirmed.

Respondent United Internati onal Holdings, Inc., aColorado-based company, sued petitioner The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, a Hong Kong firm, in Colorado's Federal Dis-trict Court. United said that in October 1992 Wharf had
sold it an option to buy 10% of the stock of a new Hong Kongcable television system. But, United alleged, at the time of
the sale Wharf secretly intended not to permit United toexercise the option. United claimed that Wharf 's conduct
amounted to a fraud "in connection with the . . . sale of [a]security," prohibited by $ 10(b), and violated numerous state
laws as well. A jury found in United's favor. The Court ofAppeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld that verdict. 210 F. 3d
1207 (2000). And we granted certiorari to consider whetherthe dispute fell within the scope of $ 10(b).

The relevant facts, viewed in the light most favorable tothe verdict winner, United, are as follows. In 1991, the
Hong Kong Government announced that it would accept bidsfor the award of an exclusive license to operate a cable
system in Hong Kong. Wharf decided to prepare a bid.Wharf 's chairman, Peter Woo, instructed one of its managing
directors, Stephen Ng, to find a business partner with cablesystem experience. Ng found United. And United sent
several employees to Hong Kong to help prepare Wharf 'sapplication, negotiate contracts, design the system, and arrange financing.United asked to be paid for its services with a right to
invest in the cable system if Wharf should obtain the license.During August and September 1992, while United's employees were at work helping Wharf, Wharf and United negoti-ated about the details of that payment. Wharf prepared a

Opinion of the Court
draft letter of intent that contemplated giving United theright to become a co-investor, owning 10% of the system.

But the parties did not sign the letter of intent. And inSeptember, when Wharf submitted its bid, it told the Hong
Kong authorities that Wharf would be the system's initialsole owner, Lodging to App. AY-4, although Wharf would
also "consider" allowing United to become an investor, id.,
at AY-6.In early October 1992, Ng met with a United representative, who told Ng that United would continue to help only ifWharf gave United an enforceable right to invest. Ng then
orally granted United an option with the following terms: (1)
United had the right to buy 10% of the future system's stock;
(2) the price of exercising the option would be 10% of the
system's capital requirements minus the value of United's
previous services (including expenses); (3) United could exercise the option only if it showed that it could fund its 10%
share of the capital required for at least the first 18 months;
and (4) the option would expire if not exercised within six
months of the date that Wharf received the license. The
parties continued to negotiate about how to write documents
that would embody these terms, but they never reduced the
agreement to writing.

In May 1993, Hong Kong awarded the cable franchise to
Wharf. United raised $66 million designed to help finance
its 10% share. In July or August 1993, United told Wharf
that it was ready to exercise its option. But Wharf refused
to permit United to buy any of the system's stock. Contemporaneous internal Wharf documents suggested that Wharf
had never intended to carry out its promise. For example,
a few weeks before the key October 1992 meeting, Ng had
prepared a memorandum stating that United wanted a right
to invest that it could exercise if it was able to raise the
necessary capital. A handwritten note by Wharf 's Chairman Woo replied, "No, no, no, we don't accept that." App.
DT-187; Lodging to App. AI-1. In September 1993, after

Opinion of the Court

meeting with the Wharf board to discuss United's investment in the cable system, Ng wrote to another Wharf executive, "How do we get out?" Id., at CY-1. In December
1993, after United had filed documents with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) representing that United
was negotiating the acquisition of a 10% interest in the cable
system, an internal Wharf memo stated that "[o]ur next
move should be to claim that our directors got quite upset
over these representations . . . . Publicly, we do not acknowledge [United's] opportunity" to acquire the 10% interest. Id., at DF-1 (emphasis in original). In the margin of
a December 1993 letter from United discussing its expectation of investing in the cable system, Ng wrote, "[B]e careful,
must deflect this! [H]ow?" Id., at DI-1. Other Wharf
documents referred to the need to "back ped[al]," id., at
DG-1, and "stall," id., at DJ-1.

These documents, along with other evidence, convinced
the jury that Wharf, through Ng, had orally sold United an
option to purchase a 10% interest in the future cable system while secretly intending not to permit United to exercise
the option, in violation of $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act and various state laws. The jury awarded United compensatory damages of $67 million and, in light of "circumstances of fraud, malice, or willful and wanton conduct," App.
EM-18, punitive damages of $58.5 million on the state-law
claims. As we have said, the Court of Appeals upheld the
jury's award. 210 F. 3d 1207 (CA10 2000). And we granted
certiorari to determine whether Wharf 's oral sale of an option it intended not to honor is prohibited by $ 10(b).

II
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act makes it "unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection
with the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of

532US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-02 11:00:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe." 15U. S. C. $ 78j.

Pursuant to this provision, the SEC has promulgated Rule10b-5. That Rule forbids the use, "in connection with the
purchase or sale of any security," of (1) "any device, scheme,or artifice to defraud"; (2) "any untrue statement of a material fact"; (3) the omission of "a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made . . . not misleading"; or(4) any other "act, practice, or course of business" that "operates . . . as a fraud or deceit." 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (2000).To succeed in a Rule 10b-5 suit, a private plaintiff must
show that the defendant used, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, one of the four kinds of manipulative or deceptive devices to which the Rule refers, and must
also satisfy certain other requirements not at issue here.
See, e. g., 15 U. S. C. $ 78j (requiring the "use of any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or
of any facility of any national securities exchange"); Ernst &
Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 193 (1976) (requiring scienter, meaning "intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud");
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 231-232 (1988) (requiring that any misrepresentation be material); id., at 243 (requiring that the plaintiff sustain damages through reliance
on the misrepresentation).

In deciding whether the Rule covers the circumstances
present here, we must assume that the "security" at issue is
not the cable system stock, but the option to purchase that
stock. That is because the Court of Appeals found that
Wharf conceded this point. 210 F. 3d, at 1221 ("Wharf does
not contest on appeal the classification of the option as a
security"). That concession is consistent with the language
of the Securities Exchange Act, which defines "security" to
include both "any . . . option . . . on any security" and "any
. . . right to . . . purchase" stock. 15 U. S. C. $ 78c(a)(10)
(1994 ed., Supp. V); see also Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor
Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 751 (1975) ("[H]olders of . . . options,

HOLDINGS, INC.

Opinion of the Court

and other contractual rights or duties to purchase . . . securi-ties" are " `purchasers' . . . of securities for purposes of Rule

10b-5"). And Wharf 's current effort to deny the concession,by pointing to an ambiguous statement in its Court of Appeals reply brief, comes too late and is unconvincing. SeeReply Brief for Petitioners 16, n. 8 (citing Reply Brief for
Appellants in Nos. 97-1421, 98-1002 (CA10), pp. 5-6). Consequently, we must decide whether Wharf 's secret intent notto honor the option it sold United amounted to a misrepresentation (or other conduct forbidden by the Rule) in connec-tion with the sale of the option.

Wharf argues that its conduct falls outside the Rule's
scope for two basic reasons. First, Wharf points out that
its agreement to grant United an option to purchase shares
in the cable system was an oral agreement. And it says that

$ 10(b) does not cover oral contracts of sale. Wharf points
to Blue Chip Stamps, in which this Court construed the Act's
"purchase or sale" language to mean that only "actual purchasers and sellers of securities" have standing to bring
a private action for damages. See 421 U. S., at 730-731.
Wharf notes that the Court's interpretation of the Act flowed
in part from the need to protect defendants against lawsuits
that "turn largely on which oral version of a series of occurrences the jury may decide to credit." Id., at 742. And it
claims that an oral purchase or sale would pose a similar
problem of proof and thus should not satisfy the Rule's "purchase or sale" requirement.

Blue Chip Stamps, however, involved the very different
question whether the Act protects a person who did not actually buy securities, but who might have done so had the
seller told the truth. The Court held that the Act does not
cover such a potential buyer, in part for the reason that
Wharf states. But United is not a potential buyer; by providing Wharf with its services, it actually bought the option
that Wharf sold. And Blue Chip Stamps said nothing to
suggest that oral purchases or sales fall outside the scope of

532US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-02 11:00:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

595Cite as: 532 U. S. 588 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
the Act. Rather, the Court's concern was about "the abusepotential and proof problems inherent in suits by investors

who neither bought nor sold, but asserted they would havetraded absent fraudulent conduct by others."

United States
v. O'Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 664 (1997). Such a "potential pur-chase" claim would rest on facts, including the plaintiff 's

state of mind, that might be "totally unknown and unknowable to the defendant," depriving the jury of "the benefit ofweighing the plaintiff 's version against the defendant's version." Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 746. An actual sale,even if oral, would not create this problem, because both parties would be able to testify as to whether the relevant
events had occurred.

Neither is there any other convincing reason to interpret
the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself
says that it applies to "any contract" for the purchase or sale
of a security. 15 U. S. C. $$ 78c(a)(13), (14). Oral contracts
for the sale of securities are sufficiently common that the
Uniform Commercial Code and statutes of frauds in every
State now consider them enforceable. See U. C. C. $ 8-113
(Supp. 2000) ("A contract . . . for the sale or purchase of a
security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing
signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought"); see also 2C U. L. A. 77-81 (Supp. 2000)
(table of enactments of U. C. C. Revised Art. 8 (amended
1994)) (noting adoption of $ 8-113, with minor variations, by
all States except Rhode Island and South Carolina); R. I.
Gen. Laws $ 6A-8-322 (Supp. 1999) (repealed effective July
1, 2001) (making oral contracts for the sale of securities enforceable); $ 6A-8-113 (2000 Cum. Supp.) (effective July 1,
2001) (same); S. C. Code Ann. $ 36-8-113 (Supp. 2000) (same);
U. C. C. $ 8-113 Comment (Supp. 2000) ("[T]he statute of
frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business").
Any exception for oral sales of securities would significantly
limit the Act's coverage, thereby undermining its basic
purposes.

596 WHARF (HOLDINGS) LTD. v. UNITED INT'L

HOLDINGS, INC.

Opinion of the Court

Wharf makes a related but narrower argument that theAct does not encompass oral contracts of sale that are unenforceable under state law. But we do not reach that issue.The Court of Appeals held that Wharf 's sale of the option
was not covered by the then-applicable Colorado statute offrauds, Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 4-8-319 (repealed 1996), and hence
was enforceable under state law. Though Wharf disputes
the correctness of that holding, we ordinarily will not con-sider such a state-law issue, and we decline to do so here.

Second, Wharf argues that a secret reservation not to per-mit the exercise of an option falls outside $ 10(b) because it
does not "relat[e] to the value of a security purchase or the
consideration paid"; hence it does "not implicate [$ 10(b)'s]
policy of full disclosure." Brief for Petitioners 25, 26
(emphasis deleted). But even were it the case that the Act
covers only misrepresentations likely to affect the value of
securities, Wharf 's secret reservation was such a misrepresentation. To sell an option while secretly intending not to
permit the option's exercise is misleading, because a buyer
normally presumes good faith. Cf., e. g., Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 530, Comment c (1976) ("Since a promise necessarily carries with it the implied assertion of an intention
to perform[,] it follows that a promise made without such
an intention is fraudulent"). For similar reasons, the secret
reservation misled United about the option's value. Since
Wharf did not intend to honor the option, the option was,
unbeknownst to United, valueless.

Finally, Wharf supports its claim for an exemption from
the statute by characterizing this case as a "disput[e] over
the ownership of securities." Brief for Petitioners 24.
Wharf expresses concern that interpreting the Act to allow
recovery in a case like this one will permit numerous plaintiffs to bring federal securities claims that are in reality no
more than ordinary state breach-of-contract claims--actions
that lie outside the Act's basic objectives. United's claim,
however, is not simply that Wharf failed to carry out a prom532US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-02 11:00:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN

597Cite as: 532 U. S. 588 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
ise to sell it securities. It is a claim that Wharf sold it asecurity (the option) while secretly intending from the very

beginning not to honor the option. And United proved thatsecret intent with documentary evidence that went well beyond evidence of a simple failure to perform. Moreover,Wharf has not shown us that its concern has proved serious
as a practical matter in the past. Cf. Threadgill v. Black,730 F. 2d 810, 811-812 (CADC)

(per curiam) (suggesting in1984 that contracting to sell securities with the secret reservation not to perform one's obligations under the contractviolates $ 10(b)). Nor does Wharf persuade us that it is
likely to prove serious in the future. Cf. Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-67, $ 21D(b)(2),
109 Stat. 747, codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(2) (1994 ed.,Supp. V) (imposing, beginning in 1995, stricter pleading requirements in private securities fraud actions that, amongother things, require that a complaint "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendantacted with the required [fraudulent] state of mind").

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 99-1848. Argued February 27, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., which operates assisted living

residences, failed an inspection by the West Virginia fire marshal's office
because some residents were incapable of "self-preservation" as defined
by state law. After receiving orders to close its facilities, Buckhannon
and others (hereinafter petitioners) brought suit in Federal District
Court against the State and state agencies and officials (hereinafter
respondents), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the "selfpreservation" requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988 (FHAA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
Respondents agreed to stay the orders pending the case's resolution.
The state legislature then eliminated the "self-preservation" requirement, and the District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss
the case as moot. Petitioners requested attorney's fees as the "prevailing party" under the FHAA and ADA, basing their entitlement on
the "catalyst theory," which posits that a plaintiff is a "prevailing party"
if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a
voluntary change in the defendant's conduct. As the Fourth Circuit
had previously rejected the "catalyst theory," the District Court denied
the motion, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of

attorney's fees under the FHAA and ADA. Under the "American
Rule," parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's
fees, and courts follow a general practice of not awarding fees to a
prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority, Key Tronic Corp.
v. United States, 511 U. S. 809, 819. Congress has employed the legal
term of art "prevailing party" in numerous statutes authorizing awards
of attorney's fees. A "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded
some relief by a court. See, e. g., Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754,
758. Both judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees
create a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship and thus
permit an award. The "catalyst theory," however, allows an award
where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although per532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
haps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,
lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change. The legislative
history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability
of the "catalyst theory"; and, particularly in view of the "American
Rule," such history is clearly insufficient to alter the clear meaning
of "prevailing party" in the fee-shifting statutes. Given this meaning,
this Court need not determine which way petitioners' various policy
arguments cut. Pp. 602-610.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attor-ney's fees and costs to the "prevailing party." The question

in the defendant's conduct. We hold that it does not.Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., which operates

Opinion of the Court

though most Courts of Appeals recognize the "catalyst
theory," 3 the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected it in S-1 and S-2 v. State Bd. of Ed. of N. C., 21 F. 3d
49, 51 (1994) (en banc) ("A person may not be a `prevailing
party' . . . except by virtue of having obtained an enforceable judgment, consent decree, or settlement giving some
of the legal relief sought"). The District Court accordingly denied the motion and, for the same reason, the Court
of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished, per curiam opinion.
Judgt. order reported at 203 F. 3d 819 (CA4 2000).

To resolve the disagreement amongst the Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1304 (2000), and now
affirm.

In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to
bear their own attorney's fees--the prevailing party is not
entitled to collect from the loser. See Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975).
Under this "American Rule," we follow "a general practice
of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit
statutory authority." Key Tronic Corp. v. United States,
511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994). Congress, however, has authorized
the award of attorney's fees to the "prevailing party" in
numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here, such as
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 259, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-

Opinion of the Court
Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. $ 1988.See generally Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 43-51 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting).4In designating those parties eligible for an award of litigation costs, Congress employed the term "prevailing party,"a legal term of art. Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed.
1999) defines "prevailing party" as "[a] party in whose favora judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages
awarded <in certain cases, the court will award attorney'sfees to the prevailing party>. -- Also termed

successfulparty." This view that a "prevailing party" is one who has

been awarded some relief by the court can be distilled fromour prior cases.

5

In Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 758 (1980) (percuriam), we reviewed the legislative history of $ 1988 and

found that "Congress intended to permit the interim awardof counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits
of at least some of his claims." Our "[r]espect for ordinarylanguage requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief
on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail."

4 We have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently, see
Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433, n. 7 (1983), and so approach the
nearly identical provisions at issue here.

5 We have never had occasion to decide whether the term "prevailing

party" allows an award of fees under the "catalyst theory" described
above. Dictum in Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987), alluded to
the possibility of attorney's fees where "voluntary action by the defendant . . . affords the plaintiff all or some of the relief . . . sought," but we
expressly reserved the question, see id., at 763 ("We need not decide the
circumstances, if any, under which this `catalyst' theory could justify a fee
award"). And though the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit relied
upon our decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992), in rejecting
the "catalyst theory," Farrar "involved no catalytic effect." Friends
of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S.
167, 194 (2000). Thus, there is language in our cases supporting both
petitioners and respondents, and last Term we observed that it was an
open question here. See ibid.

VIRGINIA DEPT. OF HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES

Opinion of the Court

Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755, 760 (1987). We have held
that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this
test. See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992).6

In addition to judgments on the merits, we have held that
settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree
may serve as the basis for an award of attorney's fees. See
Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122 (1980). Although a consent
decree does not always include an admission of liability by
the defendant, see, e. g., id., at 126, n. 8, it nonetheless is a
court-ordered "chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between
[the plaintiff] and the defendant." Texas State Teachers
Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782,
792 (1989) (citing Hewitt, supra, at 760-761, and Rhodes v.
Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 3-4 (1988) (per curiam)).7 These decisions, taken together, establish that enforceable judgments
on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the
"material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties"
necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees. 489 U. S.,
at 792-793; see also Hanrahan, supra, at 757 ("[I]t seems
clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit . . . an
interlocutory award only to a party who has established his
entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either
in the trial court or on appeal" (emphasis added)).

6 However, in some circumstances such a "prevailing party" should still
not receive an award of attorney's fees. See Farrar v. Hobby, supra, at
115-116.

7 We have subsequently characterized the Maher opinion as also allowing for an award of attorney's fees for private settlements. See Farrar
v. Hobby, supra, at 111; Hewitt v. Helms, supra, at 760. But this dictum
ignores that Maher only "held that fees may be assessed . . . after a case
has been settled by the entry of a consent decree." Evans v. Jeff D., 475
U. S. 717, 720 (1986). Private settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees. And federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking
unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of
dismissal. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.
375 (1994).

Opinion of the Court
We think, however, the "catalyst theory" falls on the otherside of the line from these examples. It allows an award

where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legalrelationship of the parties. Even under a limited form of
the "catalyst theory," a plaintiff could recover attorney'sfees if it established that the "complaint had sufficient merit
to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or
failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted."Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 27. This is not
the type of legal merit that our prior decisions, basedupon plain language and congressional intent, have found

necessary. Indeed, we held in Hewitt that an interlocutory
ruling that reverses a dismissal for failure to state a claim
"is not the stuff of which legal victories are made." 482
U. S., at 760. See also Hanrahan, supra, at 754 (reversal
of a directed verdict for defendant does not make plaintiff
a "prevailing party"). A defendant's voluntary change in
conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff
sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial
imprimatur on the change. Our precedents thus counsel
against holding that the term "prevailing party" authorizes
an award of attorney's fees without a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.

The dissenters chide us for upsetting "long-prevailing
Circuit precedent." Post, at 622 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.)
(emphasis added). But, as Justice Scalia points out in his
concurrence, several Courts of Appeals have relied upon
dicta in our prior cases in approving the "catalyst theory."
See post, at 621-622; see also supra, at 603, n. 5. Now that
the issue is squarely presented, it behooves us to reconcile
the plain language of the statutes with our prior holdings.
We have only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has
received a judgment on the merits, see, e. g., Farrar, supra,
at 112, or obtained a court-ordered consent decree, Maher,
supra, at 129-130--we have not awarded attorney's fees
where the plaintiff has secured the reversal of a directed

verdict, see Hanrahan, 446 U. S., at 759, or acquired a judi-cial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by "judicial relief," Hewitt, supra,at 760 (emphasis added). Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial "alteration of actual circum-stances." Post, at 633 (dissenting opinion). While urging
an expansion of our precedents on this front, the dissenterswould simultaneously abrogate the "merit" requirement of
our prior cases and award attorney's fees where the plain-tiff 's claim "was at least colorable" and "not . . . groundless."
Post, at 627 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).We cannot agree that the term "prevailing party" authorizes
federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who,by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially
meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reachedthe "sought-after destination" without obtaining any judicial
relief. Post, at 634 (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).

8 Although the dissenters seek support from Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co.
v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379 (1884), that case involved costs, not attorney's fees.
"[B]y the long established practice and universally recognized rule of the
common law . . . the prevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for
costs," id., at 387, but "the rule `has long been that attorney's fees are
not ordinarily recoverable,' " Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness
Society, 421 U. S. 240, 257 (1975) (quoting Fleischmann Distilling Corp.
v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 717 (1967)). Courts generally, and
this Court in particular, then and now, have a presumptive rule for costs
which the Court in its discretion may vary. See, e. g., this Court's Rule
43.2 ("If the Court reverses or vacates a judgment, the respondent or
appellee shall pay costs unless the Court otherwise orders"). In Mansfield, the defendants had successfully removed the case to federal court,
successfully opposed the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state
court, lost on the merits of the case, and then reversed course and successfully argued in this Court that the lower federal court had no jurisdiction.
The Court awarded costs to the plaintiffs, even though they had lost and
the defendants won on the jurisdictional issue, which was the only question this Court decided. In no ordinary sense of the word can the plaintiffs have been said to be the prevailing party here--they lost and their
opponents won on the only litigated issue--so the Court's use of the term
must be regarded as a figurative rather than a literal one, justifying the

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history
of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act supports
a broad reading of "prevailing party" which includes the
"catalyst theory." We doubt that legislative history could
overcome what we think is the rather clear meaning of
"prevailing party"--the term actually used in the statute.
Since we resorted to such history in Garland, 489 U. S., at
790, Maher, 448 U. S., at 129, and Hanrahan, supra, at 756-
757, however, we do likewise here.

The House Report to $ 1988 states that "[t]he phrase `prevailing party' is not intended to be limited to the victor only
after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the
merits," H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 7 (1976), while the Senate
Report explains that "parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief," S. Rep. No. 94-
1011, p. 5 (1976). Petitioners argue that these Reports and
their reference to a 1970 decision from the Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit, Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F. 2d 421 (1970), indicate Congress' intent to
adopt the "catalyst theory." 9 We think the legislative hisdeparture from the presumptive rule allowing costs to the prevailing
party because of the obvious equities favoring the plaintiffs. The Court
employed its discretion to recognize that the plaintiffs had been the victims of the defendants' legally successful whipsawing tactics.

9 Although the Court of Appeals in Parham awarded attorney's fees

to the plaintiff because his "lawsuit acted as a catalyst which prompted
the [defendant] to take action . . . seeking compliance with the requirements of Title VII," 433 F. 2d, at 429-430, it did so only after finding
that the defendant had acted unlawfully, see id., at 426 ("We hold as a
matter of law that [plaintiff's evidence] established a violation of Title
VII"). Thus, consistent with our holding in Farrar, Parham stands for
the proposition that an enforceable judgment permits an award of attorney's fees. And like the consent decree in Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S.
122 (1980), the Court of Appeals in Parham ordered the District Court
to "retain jurisdiction over the matter for a reasonable period of time
to insure the continued implementation of the appellee's policy of equal
employment opportunities." 433 F. 2d, at 429. Clearly Parham does not

Opinion of the Court

tory cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the avail-ability of the "catalyst theory" for awarding attorney's fees.

Particularly in view of the "American Rule" that attorney'sfees will not be awarded absent "explicit statutory authority," such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter theaccepted meaning of the statutory term. Key Tronic, 511
U. S., at 819; see also Hanrahan, supra, at 758 ("[O]nly whena party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his
claims . . . has there been a determination of the `substantialrights of the parties,' which Congress determined was a
necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule inthis country that each party is to bear the expense of his
own attorney" (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8)).Petitioners finally assert that the "catalyst theory" is
necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mootingan action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award
of attorney's fees. They also claim that the rejection ofthe "catalyst theory" will deter plaintiffs with meritorious
but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skepticalof these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence (e. g., whether the num-ber of suits brought in the Fourth Circuit has declined, in
relation to other Circuits, since the decision in S-1 and S-2).Petitioners discount the disincentive that the "catalyst
theory" may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarilychange its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. "The
defendants' potential liability for fees in this kind of liti-gation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more
significant than, their potential liability on the merits,"Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 734 (1986), and the possibility
of being assessed attorney's fees may well deter a defendantfrom altering its conduct.

And petitioners' fear of mischievous defendants only ma-terializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the

support a theory of fee shifting untethered to a material alteration in the
legal relationship of the parties as defined by our precedents.

Opinion of the Court
plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant'schange in conduct will not moot the case.

10 Even then, it is

not clear how often courts will find a case mooted: "It is wellsettled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged

practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to de-termine the legality of the practice" unless it is "absolutely
clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not rea-sonably be expected to recur."

Friends of Earth, Inc. v.Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167,

189 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).If a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of courseaward attorney's fees. Given this possibility, a defendant
has a strong incentive to enter a settlement agreement,where it can negotiate attorney's fees and costs. Cf. Marek
v. Chesny, 473 U. S., at 7 ("[M]any a defendant would beunwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that
left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whateveramount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff " (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).We have also stated that "[a] request for attorney's fees
should not result in a second major litigation," Hensley v.
Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 437 (1983), and have accordinglyavoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that

would have "spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant di-mension," Garland, supra, at 791. Among other things, a
"catalyst theory" hearing would require analysis of thedefendant's subjective motivations in changing its conduct,
an analysis that "will likely depend on a highly factboundinquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the
nature and timing of the defendant's change in conduct."

10 Only States and state officers acting in their official capacity are immune from suits for damages in federal court. See, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974). Plaintiffs may bring suit for damages against
all others, including municipalities and other political subdivisions of a
State, see Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977).

Scalia, J., concurring

Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28. Althoughwe do not doubt the ability of district courts to perform

the nuanced "three thresholds" test required by the "cata-lyst theory"--whether the claim was colorable rather than
groundless; whether the lawsuit was a substantial ratherthan an insubstantial cause of the defendant's change in
conduct; whether the defendant's change in conduct wasmotivated by the plaintiff 's threat of victory rather than
threat of expense, see post, at 627-628 (dissenting opinion)--it is clearly not a formula for "ready administrability."

Bur-lington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 566 (1992).

Given the clear meaning of "prevailing party" in the fee-shifting statutes, we need not determine which way these
various policy arguments cut. In Alyeska, 421 U. S., at260, we said that Congress had not "extended any roving
authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costsor otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted." To disregard the clear legislative language and theholdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a "roving authority."For the reasons stated above, we hold that the "catalyst
theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney'sfees under the FHAA, 42 U. S. C. $ 3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42
U. S. C. $ 12205.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 387

"Costs have usually been allowed to the prevailing

the courts of the States, at the time the judicial system
of the United States was organized. . . .

The term has been found within the United States Statutes
at Large since at least the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, which
provided that "[t]he party prevailing in the suit shall be entitled to costs against the adverse party." Act of Mar. 2, 1867,
ch. 176, $ 24, 14 Stat. 528. See also Act of Mar. 3, 1887,
ch. 359, $ 15, 24 Stat. 508 ("If the Government of the United
States shall put in issue the right of the plaintiff to recover
the court may, in its discretion, allow costs to the prevailing
party from the time of joining such issue"). A computer
search shows that the term "prevailing party" appears at
least 70 times in the current United States Code; it is no
stranger to the law.

At the time 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 was enacted, I know of no
case, state or federal, in which--either under a statutory
invocation of "prevailing party" or under the common-law
rule--the "catalyst theory" was enunciated as the basis for
awarding costs. Indeed, the dissent cites only one case in

costs were awarded for a reason that the catalyst theorywould support, but today's holding of the Court would not:

Baldwin v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 156 Md. 552, 557,144 A. 703, 705 (1929), where costs were awarded because
"the granting of [appellee's] motion to dismiss the appeal hasmade it unnecessary to inquire into the merits of the suit,
and the dismissal is based on an act of appellee performed
after both the institution of the suit and the entry of theappeal." And that case is irrelevant to the meaning of "prevailing party," because it was a case in equity. While, as
Mansfield observed, costs were awarded in actions at law to
the "prevailing party," see 111 U. S., at 387, an equity courtcould award costs "as the equities of the case might require,"

sent cites as awarding costs despite the absence of a judg-ment all involve a judicial finding--or its equivalent, an

acknowledgment by the defendant--of the merits of plain-tiff 's case.

2 Moreover, the dissent cites not a single case in

2 Our decision to award costs in Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan,
111 U. S. 379 (1884), does not "tu[g] against the restrictive rule today's
decision installs," post, at 630 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Defendants had
removed the case to federal court, and after losing on the merits, sought
to have us vacate the judgment because the basis for removal (diversity
of citizenship) was absent. We concluded that because defendants were
responsible for the improper removal in the first place, our judgment's
"effect [was] to defeat the entire proceeding which they originated and
have prosecuted," 111 U. S., at 388. In other words, plaintiffs "prevailed"
because defendants' original position as to jurisdiction was defeated. In
Ficklen v. Danville, 146 Va. 426, 438-439, 132 S. E. 705, 706 (1926), appellants were deemed to have " `substantially prevail[ed]' " on their appeal
because appellees "abandoned their contention made before the lower
court," i. e., "abandoned their intention and desire to rely upon the correctness of the trial court's decree." In Talmage v. Monroe, 119 P. 526 (Cal.
App. 1911), costs were awarded after the defendant complied with an alternative writ of mandamus; it was the writ, not the mere petition, which
led to defendant's action.

Scatcherd v. Love, 166 F. 53 (CA6 1908), Wagner v. Wagner, 9 Pa. 214
(1848), and other cases cited by the dissent represent a rule adopted in
some States that by settling a defendant "acknowledged his liability,"
Scatcherd, supra, at 56; see also Wagner, supra, at 215. That rule was
hardly uniform among the States. Compare 15 C. J., Costs $ 167, p. 89
(1918) (citing cases from 13 States which hold that a "settlement is equivalent to a confession of judgment"), with id., at 89-90, $ 168, and n. a (citing
cases from 11 States which hold that under a settlement "plaintiff cannot
recover costs," because "[c]osts . . . can only follow a judgment or final
determination of the action" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). I do not think these state cases (and Scatcherd, a federal case
applying state law) justify expanding the federal meaning of "prevailing
party" (based on a "confession of judgment" fiction) to include the party
accepting an out-of-court settlement--much less to expand it beyond settlements, to the domain of the "catalyst theory."

The only case cited by the dissent in which the conclusion of acknowledgment of liability was rested on something other than a settlement is
Board of Ed. of Madison Cty. v. Fowler, 192 Ga. 35, 14 S. E. 2d 478 (1941),

which this Court--or even any other federal court applyingfederal law prior to enactment of the fee-shifting statutes at

issue here--has regarded as the "prevailing party" a litigantwho left the courthouse emptyhanded. If the term means
what the dissent contends, that is a remarkable absence ofauthority.

That a judicial finding of liability was an understood re-quirement of "prevailing" is confirmed by many statutes
that use the phrase in a context that presumes the existenceof a judicial ruling. See,

e. g., 5 U. S. C. $ 1221(g)(2) ("[i]f anemployee . . . is the prevailing party . . . and the decision

is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice");$ 1221(g)(3) (providing for an award of attorney's fees to the
"prevailing party," "regardless of the basis of the decision");$ 7701(b)(2)(A) (allowing the prevailing party to obtain an
interlocutory award of the "relief provided in the decision");8 U. S. C. $ 1324b(h) (permitting the administrative law judge
to award an attorney's fee to the prevailing party "if thelosing party's argument is without reasonable foundation
in law and fact"); 18 U. S. C. $ 1864(e) (1994 ed., Supp. V)(allowing the district court to award the prevailing party
its attorney's fee "in addition to monetary damages").The dissent points out,

post, at 629, that the Prison Litiga-tion Reform Act of 1995 limits attorney's fees to an amount

"proportionately related to the court ordered relief forthe violation." This shows that sometimes Congress does
explicitly "tightly bind fees to judgments," ibid., inviting(the dissent believes) the conclusion that "prevailing party"
does not fasten fees to judgments. That conclusion doesnot follow from the premise. What this statutory provision
demonstrates, at most, is that use of the phrase "prevailingparty" is not the

only way to impose a requirement of court-ordered relief. That is assuredly true. But it would be no

of liability, analogized compliance with what had been sought by a mandamus suit to a settlement. This is a slim reed upon which to rest the broad
conclusion of a catalyst theory.

more rational to reject the normal meaning of "prevailingparty" because some statutes produce the same result with

different language, than it would be to conclude that, sincethere are many synonyms for the word "jump," the word
"jump" must mean something else.It is undoubtedly true, as the dissent points out by quoting a nonlegal dictionary, see post, at 633-634, that the word"prevailing" can have other meanings in other contexts:
"prevailing winds" are the winds that predominate, andthe "prevailing party" in an election is the party that wins
the election. But when "prevailing party" is used by courtsor legislatures in the context of a lawsuit, it is a term of art.
It has traditionally--and to my knowledge, prior to enact-ment of the first of the statutes at issue here,

invariably--meant the party that wins the suit or obtains a finding (or

an admission) of liability. Not the party that ultimately getshis way because his adversary dies before the suit comes to
judgment; not the party that gets his way because circum-stances so change that a victory on the legal point for the
other side turns out to be a practical victory for him; and notthe party that gets his way because the other side ceases
(for whatever reason) its offensive conduct. If a nuisancesuit is mooted because the defendant asphalt plant has gone
bankrupt and ceased operations, one would not normally callthe plaintiff the prevailing party. And it would make no
difference, as far as the propriety of that characterization isconcerned, if the plant did not go bankrupt but moved to a
new location to avoid the expense of litigation. In one sensethe plaintiff would have "prevailed"; but he would not be the
prevailing party in the lawsuit. Words that have acquireda specialized meaning in the legal context must be accorded
their legal meaning.

"[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which areaccumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries

of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the clusterof ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in

the body of learning from which it was taken and themeaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless

otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of con-trary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely
accepted definitions, not as a departure from them."
Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).

The cases cited by the dissent in which we have "nottreated Black's Law Dictionary as preclusively definitive,"

post, at 628-629, are inapposite. In both Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U. S. 380 (1993), and United States v. Rodgers, 466U. S. 475 (1984), we rejected Black's definition because it conflicted with our precedent. See Pioneer, supra, at 395-396,n. 14;

Rodgers, supra, at 480. We did not, as the dissent
would do here, simply reject a relevant definition of a word
tailored to judicial settings in favor of a more general defini-tion from another dictionary.

II
The dissent distorts the term "prevailing party" beyond
its normal meaning for policy reasons, but even those seem
to me misguided. They rest upon the presumption that thecatalyst theory applies when "

the suit's merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on,to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint," post, at 622 (emphasis added).As the dissent would have it, by giving the term its normal
meaning the Court today approves the practice of denyingattorney's fees to a plaintiff with a proven claim of discrimination, simply because the very merit of his claim ledthe defendant to capitulate before judgment. That is not
the case. To the contrary, the Court approves the result in
Parham v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 433 F. 2d 421 (CA8
1970), where attorney's fees were awarded "after [a] finding that the defendant had acted unlawfully," ante, at 607-

608, and n. 9.3 What the dissent's stretching of the term
produces is something more, and something far less reasonable: an award of attorney's fees when the merits of the
plaintiff 's case remain unresolved--when, for all one knows,
the defendant only "abandon[ed] the fray" because the cost
of litigation--either financial or in terms of public relations--
would be too great. In such a case, the plaintiff may have
"prevailed" as Webster's defines that term--"gain[ed] victory by virtue of strength or superiority," see post, at 633.
But I doubt it was greater strength in financial resources, or
superiority in media manipulation, rather than superiority
in legal merit, that Congress intended to reward.

3 The dissent incorrectly characterizes Parham as involving undifferentiated "findings or retention of jurisdiction," post, at 637, n. 11. In fact,
Parham involved a finding that the defendant had discriminated, and
jurisdiction was retained so that that finding could be given effect, in the
form of injunctive relief, should the defendant ever backslide in its voluntary provision of relief to plaintiffs. Jurisdiction was not retained to
determine whether there had been discrimination, and I do not read the
Court's opinion as suggesting a fee award would be appropriate in those
circumstances.

The dissent notes that two other cases were cited in Senate legislative history (Parham is cited in legislative history from both the Senate
and House) which it claims support the catalyst theory. If legislative
history in general is a risky interpretive tool, legislative history from
only one legislative chamber--and consisting of the citation of Court of
Appeals cases that surely few if any Members of Congress read--is virtually worthless. In any event, Kopet v. Esquire Realty Co., 523 F. 2d 1005
(CA2 1975), does not support the catalyst theory because the defendant's
voluntary compliance was not at issue. Fees were awarded on the dubious premise that discovery uncovered some documents of potential use in
other litigation, making this more a case of an award of interim fees.
Thomas v. Honeybrook Mines, 428 F. 2d 981 (CA3 1970), is also inapposite.
There, the question was whether counsel for union members, whose fruitless efforts to sue the union had nonetheless spurred the union to sue the
employer, should be paid out of a fund established by the union's victory.
Whether the union members were "prevailing parties" in the union suit,
or whether they were entitled to attorney's fees as "prevailing parties"
in the earlier suit against the union, was not even at issue.

It could be argued, perhaps, that insofar as abstract justice
is concerned, there is little to choose between the dissent's
outcome and the Court's: If the former sometimes rewards
the plaintiff with a phony claim (there is no way of knowing),
the latter sometimes denies fees to the plaintiff with a
solid case whose adversary slinks away on the eve of judgment. But it seems to me the evil of the former far outweighs the evil of the latter. There is all the difference in
the world between a rule that denies the extraordinary boon
of attorney's fees to some plaintiffs who are no less "deserving" of them than others who receive them, and a rule that
causes the law to be the very instrument of wrong--exacting
the payment of attorney's fees to the extortionist.

It is true that monetary settlements and consent decrees
can be extorted as well, and we have approved the award of
attorney's fees in cases resolved through such mechanisms.
See ante, at 604 (citing cases). Our decision that the statute makes plaintiff a "prevailing party" under such circumstances was based entirely on language in a House Report,
see Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122, 129 (1980), and if this
issue were to arise for the first time today, I doubt whether
I would agree with that result. See Hewitt v. Helms, 482
U. S. 755, 760 (1987) (Scalia, J.) (opining that "[r]espect for
ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least
some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said
to prevail" (emphasis added)). But in the case of courtapproved settlements and consent decrees, even if there
has been no judicial determination of the merits, the outcome is at least the product of, and bears the sanction of,
judicial action in the lawsuit. There is at least some basis
for saying that the party favored by the settlement or decree
prevailed in the suit. Extending the holding of Maher to
a case in which no judicial action whatever has been taken
stretches the term "prevailing party" (and the potential injustice that Maher produces) beyond what the normal mean532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing of that term in the litigation context can conceivably
support.

The dissent points out that petitioners' object in bringing
their suit was not to obtain "a judge's approbation," but to
"stop enforcement of a [West Virginia] rule," post, at 634; see
also Hewitt, supra, at 761. True enough. But not even the
dissent claims that if a petitioner accumulated attorney's fees
in preparing a threatened complaint, but never filed it prior
to the defendant's voluntary cessation of its offending behavior, the wannabe-but-never-was plaintiff could recover
fees; that would be countertextual, since the fee-shifting
statutes require that there be an "action" or "proceeding,"
see 42 U. S. C. $$ 3613(d), 1988(b) (1994 ed., Supp. V)--which
in legal parlance (though not in more general usage) means
a lawsuit. See post, at 643 (concluding that a party should
be deemed prevailing as a result of a "postcomplaint payment or change in conduct" (emphasis added)). Does that
not leave achievement of the broad congressional purpose
identified by the dissent just as unsatisfactorily incomplete
as the failure to award fees when there is no decree? Just
as the dissent rhetorically asks why (never mind the language of the statute) Congress would want to award fees
when there is a judgment, but deny fees when the defendant
capitulates on the eve of judgment; so also it is fair for us to
ask why Congress would want to award fees when suit has
been filed, but deny fees when the about-to-be defendant capitulates under the threat of filing. Surely, it cannot be because determination of whether suit was actually contemplated and threatened is too difficult. All the proof takes is
a threatening letter and a batch of timesheets. Surely that
obstacle would not deter the Congress that (according to the
dissent) was willing to let district judges pursue that much
more evasive will-o'-the-wisp called "catalyst." (Is this not
why we have district courts?, asks the dissent, post, at 639-
640.) My point is not that it would take no more twisting

of language to produce prelitigation attorney's fees than toproduce the decreeless attorney's fees that the dissent favors

(though that may well be true). My point is that the depar-ture from normal usage that the dissent favors cannot be
justified on the ground that it establishes a regime of logi-cal evenhandedness. There must be a cutoff of seemingly
equivalent entitlements to fees--either the failure to filesuit in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time.
The term "prevailing party" suggests the latter rather thanthe former. One does not prevail in a suit that is never
determined.The dissent's ultimate worry is that today's opinion will
"impede access to court for the less well-heeled," post, at 623.But, of course, the catalyst theory also harms the "less wellheeled," putting pressure on them to avoid the risk of mas-sive fees by abandoning a solidly defensible case early in litigation. Since the fee-shifting statutes at issue here allowdefendants as well as plaintiffs to receive a fee award, we
know that Congress did not intend to maximize the quantityof "the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys
general," ibid. Rather, Congress desired an appropriatelevel of enforcement--which is more likely to be produced
by limiting fee awards to plaintiffs who prevail "on the mer-its," or at least to those who achieve an enforceable "alteration of the legal relationship of the parties," than by permit-ting the open-ended inquiry approved by the dissent.

4 Even the legislative history relied upon by the dissent supports the
conclusion that some merit is necessary to justify a fee award. See post,
at 636, n. 9 (citing a House Report for the proposition that fee-shifting
statutes are " `designed to give [`victims of civil rights violation'] access
to the judicial process' " (emphasis added)); ibid. (citing a Senate Report:
" `[I]f those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to proceed
with impunity,' " fee awards are necessary (emphasis added)). And for
the reasons given by the Court, see ante, at 605, the catalyst theory's
purported "merit test"--the ability to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, or the absence of frivolousness--is scant protection
for the innocent.

The dissent points out that the catalyst theory has beenaccepted by "the clear majority of Federal Circuits,"

ibid.But our disagreeing with a "clear majority" of the Circuits

is not at all a rare phenomenon. Indeed, our opinions some-times contradict the unanimous and longstanding interpretation of lower federal courts. See, e. g., McNally v. UnitedStates, 483 U. S. 350, 365 (1987) (

Stevens, J., dissenting)(the Court's decision contradicted "[e]very court to consider"

the question).The dissent's insistence that we defer to the "clear majority" of Circuit opinion is particularly peculiar in the presentcase, since that majority has been nurtured and preserved
by our own misleading dicta (to which I, unfortunately, con-tributed). Most of the Court of Appeals cases cited by the
dissent, post, at 627, and n. 5, as reaffirming the catalysttheory after our decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103
(1992), relied on our earlier opinion in Hewitt. See Marbleyv. Bane, 57 F. 3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (relying on Hewitt to
support catalyst theory); Payne v. Board of Ed., 88 F. 3d 392,397 (CA6 1996) (same); Baumgartner v. Harrisburg Housing
Auth., 21 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA3 1994) (explicitly rejecting
Farrar in favor of Hewitt); Zinn v. Shalala, 35 F. 3d 273,274-276 (CA7 1994) (same); Beard v. Teska, 31 F. 3d 942,

950-952 (CA10 1994) (same); Morris v. West Palm Beach,194 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (CA11 1999) (same). Deferring to our
colleagues' own error is bad enough; but enshrining the errorthat we ourselves have improvidently suggested and blaming it on the near-unanimous judgment of our colleagueswould surely be unworthy.

5 Informing the Courts of Ap5 That a few cases adopting the catalyst theory predate Hewitt v. Helms,
482 U. S. 755 (1987), see post, at 625-626, and n. 4, is irrelevant to my
point. Absent our dicta in Hewitt, and in light of everything else we have
said on this topic, see ante, at 603-604, it is unlikely that the catalyst
theory would have achieved that universality of acceptance by the Courts
of Appeals upon which the dissent relies.

The Court today concludes that a party cannot be deemedto have prevailed, for purposes of fee-shifting statutes such

as 42 U. S. C. $$ 1988, 3613(c)(2) (1994 ed. and Supp. V), un-less there has been an enforceable "alteration of the legal
relationship of the parties." That is the normal meaning of"prevailing party" in litigation, and there is no proper basis
for departing from that normal meaning. Congress is free,of course, to revise these provisions--but it is my guess that
if it does so it will not create the sort of inequity that thecatalyst theory invites, but will require the court to determine that there was at least a substantial likelihood that theparty requesting fees would have prevailed.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that a plaintiff whose suit promptsthe precise relief she seeks does not "prevail," and hence

cannot obtain an award of attorney's fees, unless she alsosecures a court entry memorializing her victory. The entry
need not be a judgment on the merits. Nor need there beany finding of wrongdoing. A court-approved settlement
will do.The Court's insistence that there be a document filed in
court--a litigated judgment or court-endorsed settlement--upsets long-prevailing Circuit precedent applicable to scores
of federal fee-shifting statutes. The decision allows a de-fendant to escape a statutory obligation to pay a plaintiff 's
counsel fees, even though the suit's merit led the defendantto abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord
plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress soughtin the complaint. Concomitantly, the Court's constricted

definition of "prevailing party," and consequent rejection ofthe "catalyst theory," impede access to court for the less well

heeled, and shrink the incentive Congress created for theenforcement of federal law by private attorneys general.

In my view, the "catalyst rule," as applied by the clearmajority of Federal Circuits, is a key component of the feeshifting statutes Congress adopted to advance enforcementof civil rights. Nothing in history, precedent, or plain English warrants the anemic construction of the term "prevailingparty" the Court today imposes.

Petitioner Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. (Buck-hannon), operates residential care homes for elderly persons

who need assisted living, but not nursing services. AmongBuckhannon's residents in October 1996 was 102-year-old
Dorsey Pierce. Pierce had resided at Buckhannon for somefour years. Her daughter lived nearby, and the care provided at Buckhannon met Pierce's needs. Until 1998, WestVirginia had a "self-preservation" rule prohibiting homes
like Buckhannon from accommodating persons unable toexit the premises without assistance in the event of a fire.
Pierce and two other Buckhannon residents could not get toa fire exit without aid. Informed of these residents' limitations, West Virginia officials proceeded against Buckhannonfor noncompliance with the self-preservation rule. On October 18, 1996, three orders issued, each commanding Buckhan-non to "cease operating . . . and to effect relocation of [its]
existing population within thirty (30) days." App. 46-53.Ten days later, Buckhannon and Pierce, together with an
organization of residential homes and another Buckhannonresident (hereinafter plaintiffs), commenced litigation in
Federal District Court to overturn the cease-and-desist or-ders and the self-preservation rule on which they rested.
They sued the State, state agencies, and 18 officials (here-inafter defendants) alleging that the rule discriminated

et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA), 42 U. S. C. $ 12101 et seq. Plaintiffs sought an immediate order stopping defendants from closing Buckhannon'sfacilities, injunctive relief permanently barring enforcement
of the self-preservation requirement, damages, and attor-ney's fees.

On November 1, 1996, at a hearing on plaintiffs' requestfor a temporary restraining order, defendants agreed to the
entry of an interim order allowing Buckhannon to remainopen without changing the individual plaintiffs' housing and
care. Discovery followed. On January 2, 1998, facing thestate defendants' sovereign immunity pleas, plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of their demands for damages. In Febru-ary 1998, in response to defendants' motion to dispose of the
remainder of the case summarily, the District Court deter-mined that plaintiffs had presented triable claims under the
FHAA and ADA.Less than a month after the District Court found that
plaintiffs were entitled to a trial, the West Virginia Legisla-ture repealed the self-preservation rule. Plaintiffs still allege, and seek to prove, that their suit triggered the statu-tory repeal. After the rule's demise, defendants moved to
dismiss the case as moot, and plaintiffs sought attorney'sfees as "prevailing parties" under the FHAA, 42 U. S. C.

$ 3613(c)(2), and the ADA, 42 U. S. C. $ 12205.1

Finding no likelihood that West Virginia would reenact theself-preservation rule, the District Court agreed that the

State's action had rendered the case moot. Turning toplaintiffs' application for attorney's fees, the District Court
followed Fourth Circuit precedent requiring the denial offees unless termination of the action was accompanied by a
judgment, consent decree, or settlement.2 Plaintiffs did notappeal the mootness determination, and the Fourth Circuit
affirmed the denial of attorney's fees. In sum, plaintiffswere denied fees not because they failed to achieve the relief
they sought. On the contrary, they gained the very changethey sought through their lawsuit when West Virginia repealed the self-preservation rule that would have stoppedBuckhannon from caring for people like Dorsey Pierce.

Prior to 1994, every Federal Court of Appeals (except theFederal Circuit, which had not addressed the issue) concluded that plaintiffs in situations like Buckhannon's and
attorney's fees provisions contained in Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000a-3(b) and 2000e-5(k), and $ 402 of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(e)." Hensley v.

intent, we have interpreted these fee-shifting provisions consistently
across statutes. The Court so observes. See ante, at 603, n. 4. Notably,
the statutes do not mandate fees, but provide for their award "in [the
court's] discretion."

2 On plaintiffs' motion, the District Court sanctioned defendants under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for failing timely to notify plaintiffs
"that the proposed [repeal of the self-preservation rule] was progressing
successfully at several stages . . . during the pendency of [the] litigation."
App. 144. In their Rule 11 motion, plaintiffs requested fees and costs
totaling $62,459 to cover the expense of litigating after defendants became
aware, but did not disclose, that elimination of the rule was likely. In the
alternative, plaintiffs sought $3,252 to offset fees and expenses incurred in
litigating the Rule 11 motion. The District Court, stating that "the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to deter and not to compensate," awarded the
smaller sum. App. 147.

Pierce's could obtain a fee award if their suit acted as a "catalyst" for the change they sought, even if they did not obtain

a defendant's "voluntary action . . . that redresses the plaintiff's grievances," the plaintiff "is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence
of a formal judgment in his favor." 482 U. S., at 760-761. That statement accurately conveyed the unanimous view then held by the Federal
Circuits.

judgment, consent decree, or settlement." S-1 and S-2 v.
State Bd. of Ed. of N. C., 21 F. 3d 49, 51 (1994). As the Court
today acknowledges, see ante, at 603, n. 5, and as we have
previously observed, the language on which the Fourth Circuit relied was dictum: Farrar "involved no catalytic effect";
the issue plainly "was not presented for this Court's decision
in Farrar." Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 194 (2000).

After the Fourth Circuit's en banc ruling, nine Courts of
Appeals reaffirmed their own consistently held interpretation of the term "prevail." 5 On this predominant view,
"[s]ecuring an enforceable decree or agreement may evidence
prevailing party status, but the judgment or agreement simply embodies and enforces what is sought in bringing the
lawsuit . . . . Victory can be achieved well short of a final
judgment (or its equivalent) . . . . " Marbley v. Bane, 57
F. 3d 224, 234 (CA2 1995) (Jacobs, J.).

The array of federal-court decisions applying the catalyst
rule suggested three conditions necessary to a party's qualification as "prevailing" short of a favorable final judgment
or consent decree. A plaintiff first had to show that the defendant provided "some of the benefit sought" by the lawsuit.
Wheeler v. Towanda Area School Dist., 950 F. 2d 128, 131
(CA3 1991). Under most Circuits' precedents, a plaintiff had
to demonstrate as well that the suit stated a genuine claim,

quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff finally hadto establish that her suit was a "substantial" or "significant"

cause of defendant's action providing relief. Williams v.Leatherbury, 672 F. 2d 549, 551 (CA5 1982). In some Circuits, to make this causation showing, plaintiff had to satisfythe trial court that the suit achieved results "by threat of
victory," not "by dint of nuisance and threat of expense."
Marbley, 57 F. 3d, at 234-235; see also Hooper v. Demco,Inc., 37 F. 3d 287, 293 (CA7 1994) (to render plaintiff "prevailing party," suit "must have prompted the defendant . . .to act or cease its behavior based on the strength of the case,
not `wholly gratuitously' "). One who crossed these threethresholds would be recognized as a "prevailing party" to
whom the district court, "in its discretion," supra, at 624-625, n. 1, could award attorney's fees.

Developed over decades and in legions of federal-court de-cisions, the catalyst rule and these implementing standards
deserve this Court's respect and approbation.

II

A

The Court today detects a "clear meaning" of the termprevailing party, ante, at 610, that has heretofore eluded

the large majority of courts construing those words. "Pre-vailing party," today's opinion announces, means "one who
has been awarded some relief by the court," ante, at 603.The Court derives this "clear meaning" principally from
Black's Law Dictionary, which defines a "prevailing party,"in critical part, as one "in whose favor a judgment is rendered," ibid. (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed.1999)).

One can entirely agree with Black's Law Dictionary thata party "in whose favor a judgment is rendered" prevails,
and at the same time resist, as most Courts of Appeals have,any implication that

only such a party may prevail. In priorcases, we have not treated Black's Law Dictionary as preclu532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sively definitive; instead, we have accorded statutory terms,including legal "term[s] of art,"

ante, at 603 (opinion of the
Court); ante, at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring), a contextualreading. See,

e. g., Pioneer Investment Services Co. v.
Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, 507 U. S. 380, 395-396, n. 14 (1993) (defining "excusable neglect," as used in

Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9006(b)(1), more
broadly than Black's defines that term); United States v.
Rodgers, 466 U. S. 475, 479-480 (1984) (adopting "natural,
nontechnical" definition of word "jurisdiction," as that termis used in 18 U. S. C. $ 1001, and declining to confine definition

to "narrower, more technical meanings," citing Black's).Notably, this Court did not refer to Black's Law Dictionary
in Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122 (1980), which held that aconsent decree could qualify a plaintiff as "prevailing." The
Court explained:

"The fact that [plaintiff] prevailed through a settlement
rather than through litigation does not weaken her claimto fees. Nothing in the language of [42 U. S. C.] $ 1988

conditions the District Court's power to award fees onfull litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination
that the plaintiff 's rights have been violated." Id., at129.

The spare "prevailing party" language of the fee-shiftingprovision applicable in

Maher, and the similar wording of the
fee-shifting provisions now before the Court, contrast withprescriptions that so tightly bind fees to judgments as to

exclude the application of a catalyst concept. The PrisonLitigation Reform Act of 1995, for example, directs that fee
awards to prisoners under $ 1988 be "proportionately related
to the court ordered relief for the violation." 110 Stat.
1321-72, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(d)(1)(B)(i) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) (emphasis added). That statute, by its express
terms, forecloses an award to a prisoner on a catalyst theory.
But the FHAA and ADA fee-shifting prescriptions, modeled

on 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 unmodified, see supra, at 624-625, n. 1,do not similarly staple fee awards to "court ordered relief."

Their very terms do not foreclose a catalyst theory.

B
It is altogether true, as the concurring opinion points out,
ante, at 610-611, that litigation costs other than attorney'sfees traditionally have been allowed to the "prevailing

party," and that a judgment winner ordinarily fits that de-scription. It is not true, however, that precedent on costs
calls for the judgment requirement the Court ironly adoptstoday for attorney's fees. Indeed, the first decision cited in
the concurring opinion, Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan,111 U. S. 379 (1884), see

ante, at 611, tugs against the restric-tive rule today's decision installs.

In Mansfield, plaintiffs commenced a contract action instate court. Over plaintiffs' objections, defendants successfully removed the suit to federal court. Plaintiffs prevailedon the merits there, and defendants obtained review here.
See 111 U. S., at 380-381. This Court determined, on itsown motion, that federal subject-matter jurisdiction was absent from the start. Based on that determination, the Courtreversed the lower court's judgment for plaintiffs. Worse
than entering and leaving this Courthouse equally "empty-handed,"

ante, at 614 (concurring opinion), the plaintiffs inMansfield were stripped of the judgment they had won, including the "judicial finding . . . of the merits" in their favor,ante, at 613 (concurring opinion). The Mansfield plaintiffs
did, however, achieve this small consolation: The Courtawarded them costs here as well as below. Recognizing that
defendants had "prevail[ed]" in a "formal and nominalsense," the Mansfield Court nonetheless concluded that "[i]n
a true and proper sense" defendants were "the losing andnot the prevailing party." 111 U. S., at 388.

While Mansfield casts doubt on the present majority's"formal and nominal" approach, that decision does not con532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
sider whether costs would be in order for the plaintiff who
obtains substantial relief, but no final judgment. Nor does
"a single case" on which the concurring opinion today relies,
ante, at 613 (emphasis in original).6 There are, however,
enlightening analogies. In multiple instances, state high
courts have regarded plaintiffs as prevailing, for costs taxation purposes, when defendants' voluntary conduct, mooting
the suit, provided the relief that plaintiffs sought.7 The con6 The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377 (1869), featured in the concurring opinion,
see ante, at 611, does not run the distance to which that opinion would
take it. In The Baltimore, there was a judgment in one party's favor.
See 8 Wall., at 384. The Court did not address the question whether costs
are available absent such a judgment. The Baltimore's "incident to the
judgment" language, which the concurrence emphasizes, ante, at 611 (citing 8 Wall., at 388, 390), likely related to the once-maintained rule that a
court without jurisdiction may not award costs. See Mayor v. Cooper, 6
Wall. 247, 250-251 (1868). That ancient rule figured some years later in
Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379 (1884); the Court
noted the "universally recognized rule of the common law" that, absent
jurisdiction, a "court can render no judgment for or against either party,
[and therefore] cannot render a judgment even for costs." Id., at 387.
Receding from that rule, the Court awarded costs, even upon dismissal for
lack of jurisdiction, because "there is a judgment or final order in the
cause dismissing it for want of jurisdiction." Ibid.; see U. S. Bancorp
Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21 (1994).

7 See, e. g., Board of Ed. of Madison Cty. v. Fowler, 192 Ga. 35, 36, 14

S. E. 2d 478, 479 (1941) (mandamus action dismissed as moot, but costs

curring opinion labors unconvincingly to distinguish thesestate-law cases.

8 A similar federal practice has been observed in cases governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure54(d), the default rule allowing costs "to the prevailing party

unless the court otherwise directs." See 10 C. Wright,A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2667,
pp. 187-188 (2d ed. 1983) (When "the defendant alters itsconduct so that plaintiff 's claim [for injunctive relief] becomes moot before judgment is reached, costs may be al-lowed [under Rule 54(d)] if the court finds that the changes

upon the merits," defendant "acknowledged its liability . . . by paying to
the plaintiff the sum of $5,000," rendering plaintiff the "successful party"
entitled to costs); Talmage v. Monroe, 119 P. 526 (Cal. App. 1911) (fees
awarded to petitioner after court issued "alternative writ" directing respondent either to take specified action or to show cause for not doing so,
and respondent chose to take the action).

8 The concurrence urges that Baldwin is inapposite because it was an

action "in equity," and equity courts could award costs as the equities
required. Ante, at 612 (emphasis in original). The catalyst rule becomes
relevant, however, only when a party seeks relief of a sort traditionally
typed equitable, i. e., a change of conduct, not damages. There is no such
thing as an injunction at law, and therefore one cannot expect to find
long-ago plaintiffs who quested after that mythical remedy and received
voluntary relief. By the concurrence's reasoning, the paucity of precedent
applying the catalyst rule to "prevailing parties" is an artifact of nothing
more "remarkable," ante, at 614, than the historic law-equity separation.

The concurrence notes that the other cited cases "all involve a judicial
finding--or its equivalent, an acknowledgment by the defendant--of the
merits of plaintiff's case." Ante, at 613 (emphasis added). I agree. In
Fowler and Scatcherd, however, the "acknowledgment" consisted of nothing more than the defendant's voluntary provision to the plaintiff of the
relief that the plaintiff sought. See also, e. g., Jeffersonville R. R. Co. v.
Weinman, 39 Ind. 231 (1872) (costs awarded where defendant voluntarily
paid damages; no admission or merits judgment); Wagner v. Wagner, 9 Pa.
214 (1848) (same); Hudson v. Johnson, 1 Va. 10 (1791) (same). Commonlaw courts thus regarded a defendant's voluntary compliance, by settlement or otherwise, as an "acknowledgment . . . of the merits" sufficient to
warrant treatment of a plaintiff as prevailing. But cf. ante, at 604, n. 7
(opinion of the Court). One can only wonder why the concurring opinion
would not follow the same practice today.

were the result, at least in part, of plaintiff 's litigation.")(citing, inter alia, Black Hills Alliance v. Regional Forester,

526 F. Supp. 257 (SD 1981)).In short, there is substantial support, both old and new,
federal and state, for a costs award, "in [the court's] discre-tion," supra, at 625, n. 1, to the plaintiff whose suit prompts
the defendant to provide the relief plaintiff seeks.

C
Recognizing that no practice set in stone, statute, rule, orprecedent, see

infra, at 643, dictates the proper constructionof modern civil rights fee-shifting prescriptions, I would

"assume . . . that Congress intends the words in its enact-ments to carry `their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.' " Pioneer, 507 U. S., at 388 (defining "excusable ne-glect") (quoting

Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42(1979) (defining "bribery")); see also, e. g., Sutton v. United

Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 491 (1999) (defining "substan-tially" in light of ordinary usage); Rutledge v. United States,
517 U. S. 292, 299-300, n. 10 (1996) (similarly defining "inconcert"). In everyday use, "prevail" means "gain victory
by virtue of strength or superiority: win mastery: triumph."Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1797 (1976).
There are undoubtedly situations in which an individual'sgoal is to obtain approval of a judge, and in those situations,
one cannot "prevail" short of a judge's formal declaration.In a piano competition or a figure skating contest, for example, the person who prevails is the person declared winnerby the judges. However, where the ultimate goal is not an
arbiter's approval, but a favorable alteration of actual cir-cumstances, a formal declaration is not essential. Western
democracies, for instance, "prevailed" in the Cold War eventhough the Soviet Union never formally surrendered.
Among television viewers, John F. Kennedy "prevailed" inthe first debate with Richard M. Nixon during the 1960 Presidential contest, even though moderator Howard K. Smith

never declared a winner. See T. White, The Making of thePresident 1960, pp. 293-294 (1961).

A lawsuit's ultimate purpose is to achieve actual relieffrom an opponent. Favorable judgment may be instrumental in gaining that relief. Generally, however, "the judi-cial decree is not the end but the means. At the end of the
rainbow lies not a judgment, but some action (or cessa-tion of action) by the defendant . . . ."

Hewitt v. Helms,482 U. S. 755, 761 (1987). On this common understanding,

if a party reaches the "sought-after destination," then theparty "prevails" regardless of the "route taken." Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Bd., 749 F. 2d 1148, 1153(CA5 1985).

Under a fair reading of the FHAA and ADA provisions inpoint, I would hold that a party "prevails" in "a true and
proper sense," Mansfield, 111 U. S., at 388, when sheachieves, by instituting litigation, the practical relief sought
in her complaint. The Court misreads Congress, as I see it,by insisting that, invariably, relief must be displayed in a
judgment, and correspondingly that a defendant's voluntaryaction never suffices. In this case, Buckhannon's purpose in
suing West Virginia officials was not narrowly to obtain ajudge's approbation. The plaintiffs' objective was to stop
enforcement of a rule requiring Buckhannon to evict resi-dents like centenarian Dorsey Pierce as the price of remaining in business. If Buckhannon achieved that objective onaccount of the strength of its case, see

supra, at 628--if itsucceeded in keeping its doors open while housing and caring

for Ms. Pierce and others similarly situated--then Buckhan-non is properly judged a party who prevailed.

III
As the Courts of Appeals have long recognized, the cata-lyst rule suitably advances Congress' endeavor to place private actions, in civil rights and other legislatively definedareas, securely within the federal law enforcement arsenal.

The catalyst rule stemmed from modern legislation ex-tending civil rights protections and enforcement measures.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 included provisions for feeawards to "prevailing parties" in Title II (public accommodations), 42 U. S. C. $ 2000a-3(b), and Title VII (employment),$ 2000e-5(k), but not in Title VI (federal programs). The
provisions' central purpose was "to promote vigorous enforcement" of the laws by private plaintiffs; although usingthe two-way term "prevailing party," Congress did not make

fees available to plaintiffs and defendants on equal terms.
Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 417, 421
(1978) (under Title VII, prevailing plaintiff qualifies for fee
award absent "special circumstances," but prevailing defendant may obtain fee award only if plaintiff 's suit is "frivolous,
unreasonable, or without foundation").

Once the 1964 Act came into force, courts commenced to
award fees regularly under the statutory authorizations, and
sometimes without such authorization. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 262,
270-271, n. 46 (1975). In Alyeska, this Court reaffirmed the
"American Rule" that a court generally may not award attorney's fees without a legislative instruction to do so. See id.,
at 269. To provide the authorization Alyeska required for
fee awards under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as
well as under Reconstruction Era civil rights legislation, 42
U. S. C. $$ 1981-1983, 1985, 1986 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and
certain other enactments, Congress passed the Civil Rights
Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. $ 1988 (1994
ed. and Supp. V).

As explained in the Reports supporting $ 1988, civil rights
statutes vindicate public policies "of the highest priority,"

general." Id., at 5; H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 2 (1976).Such suitors, Congress recognized, often "cannot afford legal

counsel." Id., at 1. They therefore experience "severehardshi[p]" under the "American Rule." Id., at 2. Congress enacted $ 1988 to ensure that nonaffluent plaintiffswould have "effective access" to the Nation's courts to enforce civil rights laws. Id., at 1.9 That objective accountsfor the fee-shifting provisions before the Court in this case,
prescriptions of the FHAA and the ADA modeled on $ 1988.See

supra, at 624-625, n. 1.Under the catalyst rule that held sway until today, plaintiffs who obtained the relief they sought through suit on gen-uine claims ordinarily qualified as "prevailing parties," so
that courts had discretion to award them their costs and fees.Persons with limited resources were not impelled to "wage
total law" in order to assure that their counsel fees would bepaid. They could accept relief, in money or of another kind,
voluntarily proffered by a defendant who sought to avoid arecorded decree. And they could rely on a judge then to
determine, in her equitable discretion, whether counsel feeswere warranted and, if so, in what amount.

victims of civil rights violations cannot afford legal counsel, they are unable to present their cases to the courts. . . . [This statute] is designed to
give such persons effective access to the judicial process . . . ."); S. Rep.
No. 94-1011, at 2 ("If private citizens are to be able to assert their civil
rights, and if those who violate the Nation's fundamental laws are not to

Congress appears to have envisioned that very prospect.

fees, parties may be considered to have prevailed when they
vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief." S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (emphasis

recovered fees in the absence of any court-conferred relief.11

Cf. ante, at 608 (opinion of the Court). Apt here is Judge Friendly's observation construing a fee-shifting statute kin to the provisions before us:

suit had gone to trial and developments made it apparent that the judge
was about to rule for the plaintiff, the Government could abort any award

The Court features a case cited by the House as well as the Senate in
the Reports on $ 1988, Parham v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 433 F. 2d 421

the catalyst rule, alternately because the Eighth Circuit made a "finding
that the defendant had acted unlawfully," and because that court ordered
the District Court to " `retain jurisdiction over the matter . . . to insure the
continued implementation of the [defendant's] policy of equal employment
opportunities.' " Ante, at 607, n. 9 (quoting 433 F. 2d, at 429). Congress
did not fix on those factors, however: Nothing in either Report suggests
that judicial findings or retention of jurisdiction is essential to an award
of fees. The courts in Kopet and Thomas awarded fees based on claims
as to which they neither made "a finding" nor "retain[ed] jurisdic532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

The House Report corroborates: "[A]fter a complaint is filed,a defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful practice.

A court should still award fees even though it might con-clude, as a matter of equity, that no formal relief, such as an
injunction, is needed." H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 7 (empha-ses added). These Reports, Courts of Appeals have observed, are hardly ambiguous. Compare ante, at 607-608("legislative history . . . is at best ambiguous"), with,

e. g.,Dunn v. The Florida Bar, 889 F. 2d 1010, 1013 (CA11 1989)

(legislative history "evinces a clear Congressional intent" topermit award "even when no formal judicial relief is obtained" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Robinson v.Kimbrough, 652 F. 2d 458, 465 (CA5 1981) (same); American
Constitutional Party v. Munro, 650 F. 2d 184, 187 (CA91981) (Senate Report "directs" fee award under catalyst
rule). Congress, I am convinced, understood that " `[v]ic-tory' in a civil rights suit is typically a practical, rather than
a strictly legal matter." Exeter-West Greenwich Regional
School Dist. v. Pontarelli, 788 F. 2d 47, 51 (CA1 1986) (cita-tion omitted).

IV
The Court identifies several "policy arguments" that mightwarrant rejection of the catalyst rule. See

ante, at 608-610.A defendant might refrain from altering its conduct, fearing

liability for fees as the price of voluntary action. See ante,at 608. Moreover, rejection of the catalyst rule has limited
impact: Desisting from the challenged conduct will not ren-der a case moot where damages are sought, and even when
the plaintiff seeks only equitable relief, a defendant's volun-tary cessation of a challenged practice does not render the
case moot "unless it is `absolutely clear that the allegedlywrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to
recur.' " Ante, at 609 (quoting Friends of Earth, Inc., 528
tion." (It nonetheless bears attention that, in line with the Court's description of Parham, a plaintiff could qualify as the "prevailing party"
based on a finding or retention of jurisdiction.)

U. S., at 189). Because a mootness dismissal is not easilyachieved, the defendant may be impelled to settle, negotiating fees less generous than a court might award. See ante,at 609. Finally, a catalyst rule would "require analysis of
the defendant's subjective motivations," and thus protractthe litigation.

Ibid.
The Court declines to look beneath the surface of these
arguments, placing its reliance, instead, on a meaning of"prevailing party" that other jurists would scarcely recognize as plain. See ante, at 603. Had the Court inspectedthe "policy arguments" listed in its opinion, I doubt it would
have found them impressive.

In opposition to the argument that defendants will resist
change in order to stave off an award of fees, one could urge
that the catalyst rule may lead defendants promptly to comply with the law's requirements: the longer the litigation, the
larger the fees. Indeed, one who knows noncompliance will
be expensive might be encouraged to conform his conduct to
the legal requirements before litigation is threatened. Cf.
Hylton, Fee Shifting and Incentives to Comply with the Law,
46 Vand. L. Rev. 1069, 1121 (1993) ("fee shifting in favor of
prevailing plaintiffs enhances both incentives to comply with
legal rules and incentives to settle disputes"). No doubt, a
mootness dismissal is unlikely when recurrence of the controversy is under the defendant's control. But, as earlier
observed, see supra, at 636, why should this Court's feeshifting rulings drive a plaintiff prepared to accept adequate
relief, though out-of-court and unrecorded, to litigate on and
on? And if the catalyst rule leads defendants to negotiate
not only settlement terms but also allied counsel fees, is that
not a consummation to applaud, not deplore?

As to the burden on the court, is it not the norm for the
judge to whom the case has been assigned to resolve fee
disputes (deciding whether an award is in order, and if it is,
the amount due), thereby clearing the case from the calendar? If factfinding becomes necessary under the catalyst

rule, is it not the sort that "the district courts, in their fact-finding expertise, deal with on a regular basis"? Baumgartner v. Harrisburg Housing Auth., 21 F. 3d 541, 548 (CA31994). Might not one conclude overall, as Courts of Appeals
have suggested, that the catalyst rule "saves judicial re-sources," Paris v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 988 F. 2d 236, 240 (CA1 1993), by encouraging"plaintiffs to discontinue litigation after receiving through
the defendant's acquiescence the remedy initially sought"?
Morris v. West Palm Beach, 194 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (CA111999).

The concurring opinion adds another argument against thecatalyst rule: That opinion sees the rule as accommodating
the "extortionist" who obtains relief because of "greaterstrength in financial resources, or superiority in media manipulation, rather than superiority in legal merit." Ante,at 617, 618 (emphasis in original). This concern overlooks
both the character of the rule and the judicial superintend-ence Congress ordered for all fee allowances. The catalyst
rule was auxiliary to fee-shifting statutes whose primarypurpose is "to promote the vigorous enforcement" of the civil
rights laws. Christiansburg Garment Co., 434 U. S., at 422.To that end, courts deemed the conduct-altering catalyst
that counted to be the substance of the case, not merely theplaintiff 's atypically superior financial resources, media ties,
or political clout. See supra, at 628. And Congress as-signed responsibility for awarding fees not to automatons unable to recognize extortionists, but to judges expected andinstructed to exercise "discretion." See

supra, at 624-625,n. 1. So viewed, the catalyst rule provided no berth for nuisance suits, see Hooper, 37 F. 3d, at 292, or "thinly disguisedforms of extortion,"

Tyler v. Corner Constr. Corp., 167 F. 3d1202, 1206 (CA8 1999) (citation omitted).

12

12 The concurring opinion notes, correctly, that "[t]here must be a cutoff
of seemingly equivalent entitlements to fees--either the failure to file suit
in time or the failure to obtain a judgment in time." Ante, at 620 (empha532US2 Unit: $U55 [09-19-02 20:51:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

V
As to our attorney's fee precedents, the Court correctlyobserves, "[w]e have never had occasion to decide whether

the term `prevailing party' allows an award of fees underthe `catalyst theory,' " and "there is language in our cases
supporting both petitioners and respondents." Ante, at 603,n. 5. It bears emphasis, however, that in determining
whether fee shifting is in order, the Court in the past hasplaced greatest weight not on any "judicial

imprimatur,"ante, at 605, but on the practical impact of the lawsuit.

13 In

Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122 (1980), in which the Court heldfees could be awarded on the basis of a consent decree, the

opinion nowhere relied on the presence of a formal judgment.See

supra, at 629; infra, at 642-643, n. 14. Some years

sis in original). The former cutoff, the Court has held, is impelled both
by "plain language" requiring a legal "action" or "proceeding" antecedent
to a fee award, and by "legislative history . . . replete with references to
[enforcement] `in suits,' `through the courts' and by `judicial process.' "
North Carolina Dept. of Transp. v. Crest Street Community Council, Inc.,
479 U. S. 6, 12 (1986) (citations omitted). The latter cutoff, requiring "a
judgment in time," is not similarly impelled by text or legislative history.

The concurring opinion also states that a prevailing party must obtain
relief "in the lawsuit." Ante, at 615, 618. One can demur to that elaboration of the statutory text and still adhere to the catalyst rule. Under
the rule, plaintiff's suit raising genuine issues must trigger defendant's
voluntary action; plaintiff will not prevail under the rule if defendant
"ceases . . . [his] offensive conduct" by dying or going bankrupt. See ante,
at 615. A behavior-altering event like dying or bankruptcy occurs outside the lawsuit; a change precipitated by the lawsuit's claims and demand
for relief is an occurrence brought about "through" or "in" the suit.

13 To qualify for fees in any case, we have held, relief must be real. See

Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) (per curiam) (a plaintiff who obtains a formal declaratory judgment, but gains no real "relief whatsoever,"
is not a "prevailing party" eligible for fees); Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S., at
761 (an interlocutory decision reversing a dismissal for failure to state a
claim, although stating that plaintiff's rights were violated, does not entitle plaintiff to fees; to "prevail," plaintiff must gain relief of "substance,"
i. e., more than a favorable "judicial statement that does not affect the
relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant").

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

later, in Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 (1987), the Court sug-gested that fees might be awarded the plaintiff who "obtain[ed] relief without [the] benefit of a formal judgment."Id., at 760. The Court explained: "If the defendant, under
the pressure of the lawsuit, pays over a money claim beforethe judicial judgment is pronounced," or "if the defendant,
under pressure of [a suit for declaratory judgment], altershis conduct (or threatened conduct) towards the plaintiff,"
i. e., conduct "that was the basis for the suit, the plaintiff willhave prevailed."

Id., at 761. I agree, and would apply thatanalysis to this case.

The Court posits a " `merit' requirement of our priorcases." Ante, at 606. Maher, however, affirmed an award
of attorney's fees based on a consent decree that "did notpurport to adjudicate [plaintiff 's] statutory or constitutional
claims." 448 U. S., at 126, n. 8. The decree in Maher "ex-plicitly stated that `nothing [therein was] intended to constitute an admission of fault by either party.' " Ibid. Thecatalyst rule, in short, conflicts with none of "our prior

hold-ings," ante, at 605.
14

14 The Court repeatedly quotes passages from Hanrahan v. Hampton,
446 U. S., at 757-758, stating that to "prevail," plaintiffs must receive relief
"on the merits." Ante, at 603, 604, 608. Nothing in Hanrahan, however,
declares that relief "on the merits" requires a "judicial imprimatur."
Ante, at 605. As the Court acknowledges, Hanrahan concerned an interim award of fees, after plaintiff succeeded in obtaining nothing more
than reversal of a directed verdict. See ante, at 605. At that juncture,
plaintiff had obtained no change in defendant's behavior, and the suit's
ultimate winner remained undetermined. There is simply no inconsistency between Hanrahan, denying fees when a plaintiff might yet obtain
no real benefit, and the catalyst rule, allowing fees when a plaintiff obtains
the practical result she sought in suing. Indeed, the harmony between
the catalyst rule and Hanrahan is suggested by Hanrahan itself; like
Maher v. Gagne, 448 U. S. 122, 129 (1980), Hanrahan quoted the Senate
Report recognizing that parties may prevail "through a consent judgment
or without formally obtaining relief." 446 U. S., at 757 (quoting S. Rep.
No. 94-1011, at 5) (emphasis added). Hanrahan also selected for citation

* * *
The Court states that the term "prevailing party" in fee-shifting statutes has an "accepted meaning."

Ante, at 608.If that is so, the "accepted meaning" is not the one the Court

today announces. It is, instead, the meaning accepted byevery Court of Appeals to address the catalyst issue before
our 1987 decision in Hewitt, see supra, at 626, n. 4, and disa-vowed since then only by the Fourth Circuit, see supra, at
627, n. 5. A plaintiff prevails, federal judges have over-whelmingly agreed, when a litigated judgment, consent decree, out-of-court settlement, or the defendant's voluntary,postcomplaint payment or change in conduct in fact affords
redress for the plaintiff 's substantial grievances.When this Court rejects the considered judgment prevailing in the Circuits, respect for our colleagues demands a cothe influential elaboration of the catalyst rule in Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581
F. 2d, at 279-281. See 446 U. S., at 757.

The Court additionally cites Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782 (1989), which held, unanimously, that
a plaintiff could become a "prevailing party" without obtaining relief on
the "central issue in the suit." Id., at 790. Texas State Teachers linked
fee awards to a "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties," id., at 792-793, but did not say, as the Court does today, that the
change must be "court-ordered," ante, at 604. The parties' legal relationship does change when the defendant stops engaging in the conduct that
furnishes the basis for plaintiff's civil action, and that action, which both
parties would otherwise have litigated, is dismissed.

The decision with language most unfavorable to the catalyst rule, Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992), does not figure prominently in the
Court's opinion--and for good reason, for Farrar "involved no catalytic
effect." See ante, at 603, n. 5 (quoting Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw
Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 194 (2000) (internal
quotation marks omitted)); supra, at 627. Farrar held that a plaintiff who
sought damages of $17 million, but received damages of $1, was a "prevailing party" nonetheless not entitled to fees. 506 U. S., at 113-116. In
reinforcing the link between the right to a fee award and the "degree of
success obtained," id., at 114 (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S., at
436), Farrar's holding is consistent with the catalyst rule.

gent explanation. Today's decision does not provide one.The Court's narrow construction of the words "prevailing

party" is unsupported by precedent and unaided by historyor logic. Congress prescribed fee-shifting provisions like
those included in the FHAA and ADA to encourage privateenforcement of laws designed to advance civil rights. Fidelity to that purpose calls for court-awarded fees when a pri-vate party's lawsuit, whether or not its settlement is registered in court, vindicates rights Congress sought to secure.I would so hold and therefore dissent from the judgment and
opinion of the Court.

ATKINSON TRADING CO., INC. v. SHIRLEY et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 00-454. Argued March 27, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
In Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, this Court held that, with two

limited exceptions, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct
of nonmembers on non-Indian land within a reservation. Petitioner's
trading post on such land within the Navajo Nation Reservation is subject to a hotel occupancy tax that the Tribe imposes on any hotel room
located within the reservation's boundaries. The Federal District
Court upheld the tax, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Relying in part
on Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, the latter court
complemented Montana's framework with a case-by-case approach that
balanced the land's non-Indian fee status with the Tribe's sovereign
powers, its interests, and the impact that the exercise of its powers had
on the nonmembers' interests. The court concluded that the tax fell
under Montana's first exception.

Held: The Navajo Nation's imposition of a hotel occupancy tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within its reservation is invalid.
Pp. 649-659.

(a) Montana's general rule applies to tribal attempts to tax nonmember activity occurring on non-Indian fee land. Tribal jurisdiction is limited: For powers not expressly conferred them by federal statute or
treaty, tribes must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty.
Their power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is sharply circumscribed. Montana noted only two exceptions: (1) a tribe may regulate
the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with
the tribe or its members; and (2) a tribe may exercise civil authority
over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when
that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the tribe's political
integrity, economic security, or health or welfare. 450 U. S., at 565-566.
Montana's rule applies to a tribe's regulatory authority, id., at 566, and
adjudicatory authority, Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453.
Citing Merrion, respondents submit that Montana and Strate do not
restrict a tribe's power to impose revenue-raising taxes. However, because Merrion noted that a tribe's inherent taxing power only extended
to transactions occurring on trust lands and involving the tribe or its
members, 455 U. S., at 137, it is easily reconcilable with the MontanaStrate line of authority. A tribe's sovereign power to tax reaches no

646 ATKINSON TRADING CO. v. SHIRLEY

Syllabus
further than tribal land. Thus, Merrion does not exempt taxation from
Montana's general rule, and Montana is applied straight up. Because
Congress had not authorized the tax at issue through treaty or statute,
and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on nonIndian fee land, the Navajo Nation must establish the existence of one
of Montana's exceptions. Pp. 649-654.

(b) Montana's exceptions do not obtain here. Neither petitioner nor
its hotel guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the
Navajo Nation justifying the tax's imposition. Such a relationship
must stem from commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements, Montana, supra, at 565, and a nonmember's actual or potential
receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the
requisite connection. Nor is petitioner's status as an "Indian trader"
licensed by the Indian Affairs Commissioner sufficient by itself to support the tax's imposition. As to Montana's second exception, petitioner's operation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land does not threaten or
have a direct effect on the tribe's political integrity, economic security,
or health or welfare. Contrary to respondents' argument, the judgment
in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492
U. S. 408, 440, did not give Indian tribes broad authority over nonmembers where the acreage of non-Indian fee land is minuscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land. Irrespective of the percentage of
non-Indian fee land within a reservation, Montana's second exception grants tribes nothing beyond what is necessary to protect tribal
self-government or control internal relations. Strate, supra, at 459.
Whatever effect petitioner's operation of its trading post might have
upon surrounding Navajo land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nation's political integrity. Pp. 654-659.

Opinion of the Court
directly from the United States, but the Navajo NationReservation, which had been established in 1868, see 15

Stat. 667, was later extended eight miles south so that theCameron Trading Post fell within its exterior boundaries.
See Act of June 14, 1934, ch. 521, 48 Stat. 960-962. This1934 enlargement of the Navajo Reservation--which today
stretches across northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico,
and southeast Utah--did not alter the status of the property:It is, like millions of acres throughout the United States,

non-Indian fee land within a tribal reservation.Richardson's "drafty, wooden store building and four small,
one-room-shack cabins overlooking the bare river canyon,"
Richardson, supra, at 135, have since evolved into a business
complex consisting of a hotel, restaurant, cafeteria, gallery,
curio shop, retail store, and recreational vehicle facility.
The current owner, petitioner Atkinson Trading Company,
Inc., benefits from the Cameron Trading Post's location near
the intersection of Arizona Highway 64 (which leads west to
the Grand Canyon) and United States Highway 89 (which
connects Flagstaff on the south with Glen Canyon Dam to
the north). A significant portion of petitioner's hotel business stems from tourists on their way to or from the Grand
Canyon National Park.

In 1992, the Navajo Nation enacted a hotel occupancy tax,
which imposes an 8 percent tax upon any hotel room located
within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation Reservation. See 24 Navajo Nation Code $$ 101-142 (1995), App.
to Pet. for Cert. 102a-124a. Although the legal incidence
of the tax falls directly upon the guests, the owner or operator of the hotel must collect and remit it to respondents,
members of the Navajo Tax Commission. $$ 104, 107. The
nonmember guests at the Cameron Trading Post pay approximately $84,000 in taxes to respondents annually.

Petitioner's challenge under Montana to the Navajo Nation's authority to impose the hotel occupancy tax was rejected by both the Navajo Tax Commission and the Navajo

Opinion of the Court
Supreme Court. Petitioner then sought relief in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of New Mexico, which

also upheld the tax. A divided panel of the Court of Ap-peals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. See 210 F. 3d 1247
(2000).Although the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that
our cases in this area "did make an issue of the fee status of
the land in question," id., at 1256, it nonetheless concludedthat the status of the land as "fee land or tribal land is simply

one of the factors a court should consider" when determiningwhether civil jurisdiction exists,

id., at 1258 (citing 18 U. S. C.

$ 1151). Relying in part upon our decision in Merrion v.
Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130 (1982), the court "complement[ed]" Montana's framework with a "case-by-case approach" that balanced the non-Indian fee status of the land
with "the nature of the inherent sovereign powers the tribe
is attempting to exercise, its interests, and the impact that
the exercise of the tribe's powers has upon the nonmember
interests involved." 210 F. 3d, at 1255, 1257, 1261. The
Court of Appeals then likened the Navajo hotel occupancy
tax to similar taxes imposed by New Mexico and Arizona,
concluding that the tax fell under Montana's first exception
because a "consensual relationship exists in that the nonmember guests could refrain from the privilege of lodging within the confines of the Navajo Reservation and therefore remain free from liability for the [tax]." 210 F. 3d, at

Opinion of the Court
must rely upon their retained or inherent sovereignty. InMontana, the most exhaustively reasoned of our modern

cases addressing this latter authority, we observed that In-dian tribe power over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land is
sharply circumscribed. At issue in Montana was the CrowTribe's attempt to regulate nonmember fishing and hunting
on non-Indian fee land within the reservation. Although we"readily agree[d]" that the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty authorized the Crow Tribe to prohibit nonmembers from huntingor fishing on tribal land, 450 U. S., at 557, we held that such
"power cannot apply to lands held in fee by non-Indians."
Id., at 559. This delineation of members and nonmembers,tribal land and non-Indian fee land, stemmed from the dependent nature of tribal sovereignty. Surveying our casesin this area dating back to 1810, see Fletcher v. Peck, 6
Cranch 87, 147 (1810) (Johnson, J., concurring) (stating thatIndian tribes have lost any "right of governing every person
within their limits except themselves"), we noted that"through their original incorporation into the United States
as well as through specific treaties and statutes, Indian
tribes have lost many of the attributes of sovereignty." 450U. S., at 563.

1 We concluded that the inherent sovereignty

of Indian tribes was limited to "their members and their ter-ritory": "[E]xercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary

to protect tribal self-government or to control internal rela1 We also noted that nearly 90 million acres of non-Indian fee land had
been acquired as part of the Indian General Allotment Act, 24 Stat. 388,
as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 331 et seq., which authorized the issuance of patents in fee to individual Indian allottees who, after holding the patent for
25 years, could then transfer the land to non-Indians. Although Congress
repudiated the practice of allotment in the Indian Reorganization Act, 48
Stat. 984, 25 U. S. C. $ 461 et seq., we nonetheless found significant that
Congress equated alienation "with the dissolution of tribal affairs and jurisdiction." Montana, 450 U. S., at 559, n. 9. We thus concluded that
it "defie[d] common sense to suppose that Congress would intend that
non-Indians purchasing allotted lands would become subject to tribal jurisdiction." Ibid.

tions is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes."
Id., at 564 (citing United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,
326 (1978) ("[T]he dependent status of Indian tribes . . . isnecessarily inconsistent with their freedom to determine

their external relations" (emphasis deleted))).Although we extracted from our precedents "the general
proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian
tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of thetribe," 450 U. S., at 565, we nonetheless noted in

Montana
two possible bases for tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian feeland. First, "[a] tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who
enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,
through commercial dealings, contracts, leases, or other
arrangements." Ibid. Second, "[a] tribe may . . . exercise
civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands
within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has
some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." Id., at 566.
Applying these precepts, we found that the nonmembers at
issue there had not subjected themselves to "tribal civil jurisdiction" through any agreements or dealings with the
Tribe and that hunting and fishing on non-Indian fee land did
not "imperil the subsistence or welfare of the Tribe." Ibid.
We therefore held that the Crow Tribe's regulations could
not be enforced.

The framework set forth in Montana "broadly addressed
the concept of `inherent sovereignty.' " Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 453 (1997) (quoting Montana, supra,
at 563). In Strate, we dealt with the Three Affiliated
Tribes' assertion of judicial jurisdiction over an automobile
accident involving two nonmembers traveling on a state
highway within the reservation. Although we did not question the ability of tribal police to patrol the highway, see
520 U. S., at 456, n. 11, we likened the public right-of-way to
non-Indian fee land because the Tribes lacked the power to

Opinion of the Court
"assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude," id., at456. Recognizing that Montana "immediately involved regulatory authority," 2 we nonetheless concluded that its rea-soning had "delineated--in a main rule and exceptions--the
bounds of the power tribes retain to exercise `forms of civiljurisdiction over non-Indians.' " 520 U. S., at 453 (quoting
Montana, supra, at 565). We accordingly held that Montana governed tribal assertions of adjudicatory authorityover non-Indian fee land within a reservation. See 520

U. S., at 453 ("Subject to controlling provisions in treatiesand statutes, and the two exceptions identified in Montana,
the civil authority of Indian tribes and their courts withrespect to non-Indian fee lands generally `do[es] not extend
to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe' " (emphasisadded) (quoting Montana, supra, at 565)).

Citing our decision in Merrion, respondents submit thatMontana and Strate do not restrict an Indian tribe's power
to impose revenue-raising taxes.3 In Merrion, just one yearafter our decision in

Montana, we upheld a severance taximposed by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe upon non-Indian lessees authorized to extract oil and gas from tribal land. Inso doing, we noted that the power to tax derives not solely
from an Indian tribe's power to exclude non-Indians fromtribal land, but also from an Indian tribe's "general authority,
as sovereign, to control economic activity within its juris-diction." 455 U. S., at 137. Such authority, we held, was
incident to the benefits conferred upon nonmembers: "Theybenefit from the provision of police protection and other governmental services, as well as from ` "the advantages of acivilized society" ' that are assured by the existence of tribal

2 See also South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679 (1993); Brendale v.
Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408 (1989).

3 Respondents concede that regulatory taxes fall under the Montana

framework. See 450 U. S., at 565 ("A tribe may regulate, through taxation, . . . the activities of nonmembers").

532US2 Unit: $U56 [09-19-02 20:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
government." Id., at 137-138 (quoting Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980)).

Merrion, however, was careful to note that an Indiantribe's inherent power to tax only extended to " `transactions

occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or
its members.' " 455 U. S., at 137 (emphasis added) (quoting
Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,
447 U. S. 134, 152 (1980)). There are undoubtedly parts of
the Merrion opinion that suggest a broader scope for tribal
taxing authority than the quoted language above.4 But
Merrion involved a tax that only applied to activity occurring on the reservation, and its holding is therefore easily
reconcilable with the Montana-Strate line of authority,
which we deem to be controlling. See Merrion, supra, at
142 ("[A] tribe has no authority over a nonmember until the
nonmember enters tribal lands or conducts business with the
tribe"). An Indian tribe's sovereign power to tax--whatever its derivation--reaches no further than tribal land.5

4 Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130 (1982), for example,
referenced the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in
Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947 (1905). But we have never endorsed Buster's
statement that an Indian tribe's "jurisdiction to govern the inhabitants of
a country is not conditioned or limited by the title to the land which they
occupy in it." Id., at 951. Accordingly, beyond any guidance it might
provide as to the type of consensual relationship contemplated by the first
exception of Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 566 (1981), Buster
is not an authoritative precedent.

5 We find misplaced the Court of Appeals' reliance upon 18 U. S. C.

$ 1151, a statute conferring upon Indian tribes jurisdiction over certain
criminal acts occurring in "Indian country," or "all land within the limits
of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including
rights-of-way running through the reservation." See also Duro v. Reina,
495 U. S. 676, 680, n. 1 (1990). Although $ 1151 has been relied upon to
demarcate state, federal, and tribal jurisdiction over criminal and civil
matters, see DeCoteau v. District County Court for Tenth Judicial Dist.,
420 U. S. 425, 427, n. 2 (1975) ("While $ 1151 is concerned, on its face, only

654 ATKINSON TRADING CO. v. SHIRLEY

Opinion of the Court
We therefore do not read Merrion to exempt taxation
from Montana's general rule that Indian tribes lack civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land. Accordingly, as in Strate, we apply Montana straight up. Because
Congress has not authorized the Navajo Nation's hotel occupancy tax through treaty or statute, and because the incidence of the tax falls upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee
land, it is incumbent upon the Navajo Nation to establish the
existence of one of Montana's exceptions.

Respondents argue that both petitioner and its hotel
guests have entered into a consensual relationship with the
Navajo Nation justifying the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.6 Echoing the reasoning of the Court of Appeals,
respondents note that the Cameron Trading Post benefits
from the numerous services provided by the Navajo Nation.
The record reflects that the Arizona State Police and the
Navajo Tribal Police patrol the portions of United States

with criminal jurisdiction, the Court has recognized that it generally applies as well to questions of civil jurisdiction [citing cases]"), we do not
here deal with a claim of statutorily conferred power. Section 1151 simply does not address an Indian tribe's inherent or retained sovereignty
over nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.

At least in the context of non-Indian fee land, we also find inapt the
Court of Appeals' analogy to state taxing authority. Our reference in
Merrion to a State's ability to tax activities with which it has a substantial
nexus was made in the context of describing an Indian tribe's authority
over tribal land. See 455 U. S., at 137-138 (citing Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980); Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979)). Only full territorial
sovereigns enjoy the "power to enforce laws against all who come within
the sovereign's territory, whether citizens or aliens," and Indian tribes
"can no longer be described as sovereigns in this sense." Duro v. Reina,
supra, at 685.

6 Because the legal incidence of the tax falls directly upon the guests,

not petitioner, it is unclear whether the Tribe's relationship with petitioner
is at all relevant. We need not, however, decide this issue since the hotel
occupancy tax exceeds the Tribe's authority even considering petitioner's
contacts with the Navajo Nation.

Opinion of the Court
Highway 89 and Arizona Highway 64 traversing the reservation; that the Navajo Tribal Police and the Navajo Tribal
Emergency Medical Services Department will respond to an
emergency call from the Cameron Trading Post; and that
local Arizona Fire Departments and the Navajo Tribal Fire
Department provide fire protection to the area.7 Although
we do not question the Navajo Nation's ability to charge an
appropriate fee for a particular service actually rendered,8
we think the generalized availability of tribal services patently insufficient to sustain the Tribe's civil authority over
nonmembers on non-Indian fee land.

The consensual relationship must stem from "commercial
dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements," Montana,
450 U. S., at 565, and a nonmember's actual or potential receipt of tribal police, fire, and medical services does not create the requisite connection. If it did, the exception would
swallow the rule: All non-Indian fee lands within a reservation benefit, to some extent, from the "advantages of a civilized society" offered by the Indian tribe. Merrion, supra,
at 137-138 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Such a result does not square with our precedents; indeed,
we implicitly rejected this argument in Strate,9 where we
held that the nonmembers had not consented to the Tribes'
adjudicatory authority by availing themselves of the benefit
of tribal police protection while traveling within the reservation. See 520 U. S., at 456-457, and n. 11. We therefore
reject respondents' broad reading of Montana's first exception, which ignores the dependent status of Indian tribes and
subverts the territorial restriction upon tribal power.

7 The Navajo Tribal Fire Department has responded to a fire at the
Cameron Trading Post. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.

8 The Navajo Nation charges for its emergency medical services (a flat

call-out fee of $300 and a mileage fee of $6.25 per mile). See App. 127-129.

656 ATKINSON TRADING CO. v. SHIRLEY

Opinion of the Court
Respondents and their principal amicus, the UnitedStates, also argue that petitioner consented to the tax by

becoming an "Indian trader." Congress has authorized theCommissioner of Indian Affairs "to appoint traders to the
Indian tribes and to make such rules and regulations as hemay deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity
of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold tothe Indians." 25 U. S. C. $ 261. Petitioner has acquired the
requisite license to transact business with the Navajo Nationand therefore is subject to the regulatory strictures promulgated by the Indian Affairs Commissioner. See 25 CFR pt.141 (2000).

10 But whether or not the Navajo Nation could

impose a tax on activities arising out of this relationship, anissue not before us, it is clear that petitioner's "Indian

trader" status by itself cannot support the imposition of thehotel occupancy tax.

Montana's consensual relationship exception requires thatthe tax or regulation imposed by the Indian tribe have a
nexus to the consensual relationship itself. In Strate, forexample, even though respondent A-1 Contractors was on
the reservation to perform landscaping work for the ThreeAffiliated Tribes at the time of the accident, we nonetheless
held that the Tribes lacked adjudicatory authority becausethe other nonmember "was not a party to the subcontract,
and the [T]ribes were strangers to the accident." 520 U. S.,at 457 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A
nonmember's consensual relationship in one area thus doesnot trigger tribal civil authority in another--it is not "in for
a penny, in for a Pound." E. Ravenscroft, The CanterburyGuests; Or A Bargain Broken, act v, sc. 1. The hotel occupancy tax at issue here is grounded in petitioner's relation-ship with its nonmember hotel guests, who can reach the
Cameron Trading Post on United States Highway 89 and

10 Although the regulations do not "preclude" the Navajo Nation from
imposing upon "Indian traders" such "fees or taxes [it] may deem appropriate," the regulations do not contemplate or authorize the hotel occupancy tax at issue here. 25 CFR $ 141.11 (2000).

Opinion of the Court
Arizona Highway 64, non-Indian public rights-of-way. Peti-tioner cannot be said to have consented to such a tax by

virtue of its status as an "Indian trader."Although the Court of Appeals did not reach Montana's
second exception, both respondents and the United Statesargue that the hotel occupancy tax is warranted in light of
the direct effects the Cameron Trading Post has upon theNavajo Nation. Again noting the Navajo Nation's provision
of tribal services and petitioner's status as an "Indiantrader," respondents emphasize that petitioner employs almost 100 Navajo Indians; that the Cameron Trading Postderives business from tourists visiting the reservation; and
that large amounts of tribal land surround petitioner's iso-lated property.

11 Although we have no cause to doubt respondents' assertion that the Cameron Chapter of the Nav-ajo Nation possesses an "overwhelming Indian character,"

Brief for Respondents 13-14, we fail to see how petitioner'soperation of a hotel on non-Indian fee land "threatens or has
some direct effect on the political integrity, the economicsecurity, or the health or welfare of the tribe." Montana,
supra, at 566.12

11 The record does not reflect the amount of non-Indian fee land within
the Navajo Nation. A 1995 study commissioned by the United States
Department of Commerce states that 96.3 percent of the Navajo Nation's
16,224,896 acres is tribally owned, with allotted land comprising 762,749
acres, or 4.7 percent, of the reservation. See Economic Development Administration, V. Tiller, American Indian Reservations and Indian Trust
Areas 214 (1995). The 1990 Census reports that that 96.6 percent of
residents on the Navajo Nation are Indian. Joint Lodging 182. The
Cameron Chapter of the Navajo Nation, in which petitioner's land lies, has
a non-Indian population of 2.3 percent. See id., at 181.

12 Although language in Merrion referred to taxation as "necessary to

tribal self-government and territorial management," 455 U. S., at 141, it
did not address assertions of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indian fee land.
Just as with Montana's first exception, incorporating Merrion's reasoning
here would be tantamount to rejecting Montana's general rule. In Strate
v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 459 (1997), we stated that Montana's
second exception "can be misperceived." The exception is only triggered
by nonmember conduct that threatens the Indian tribe; it does not broadly

658 ATKINSON TRADING CO. v. SHIRLEY

Opinion of the Court
We find unpersuasive respondents' attempt to augment
this claim by reference to Brendale v. Confederated Tribes
and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 440 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J.). In this portion of Brendale, per the
reasoning of two Justices, we held that the Yakima Nation
had the authority to zone a small, non-Indian parcel located
"in the heart" of over 800,000 acres of closed and largely
uninhabited tribal land. Ibid. Respondents extrapolate
from this holding that Indian tribes enjoy broad authority
over nonmembers wherever the acreage of non-Indian fee
land is minuscule in relation to the surrounding tribal land.
But we think it plain that the judgment in Brendale turned
on both the closed nature of the non-Indian fee land 13 and
the fact that its development would place the entire area "in
jeopardy." Id., at 443 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).14 Irrespective of the percentage of non-Indian fee
land within a reservation, Montana's second exception
grants Indian tribes nothing " `beyond what is necessary to

permit the exercise of civil authority wherever it might be considered
"necessary" to self-government. Thus, unless the drain of the nonmember's conduct upon tribal services and resources is so severe that it actually "imperil[s]" the political integrity of the Indian tribe, there can be
no assertion of civil authority beyond tribal lands. Montana, 450 U. S.,
at 566. Petitioner's hotel has no such adverse effect upon the Navajo
Nation.

13 Justice Stevens' opinion in Brendale sets out in some detail the

restrictive nature of "closed area" surrounding the non-Indian fee land.
See 492 U. S., at 438-441. Pursuant to the powers reserved it in an 1855
treaty with the United States, the Yakima Nation closed this forested area
to the public and severely limited the activities of those who entered the
land through a "courtesy permit system." Id., at 439 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). The record here establishes that, save a few
natural areas and parks not at issue, the Navajo Reservation is open to
the general public. App. 61.

14 See Strate v. A-1 Contractors, supra, at 447, n. 6 (noting that the

Yakima Nation "retained zoning authority . . . only in the closed area");
Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S., at 688 (noting that zoning "is vital to the maintenance of tribal integrity and self-determination").

protect tribal self-government or to control internal rela-tions.' " Strate, 520 U. S., at 459 (quoting Montana, 450

U. S., at 564). Whatever effect petitioner's operation of theCameron Trading Post might have upon surrounding Navajo
land, it does not endanger the Navajo Nation's political integ-rity. See Brendale, supra, at 431 (opinion of White, J.)
(holding that the impact of the nonmember's conduct "mustbe demonstrably serious and must imperil the political integrity, the economic security, or the health and welfare of thetribe").

Indian tribes are "unique aggregations possessing attri-butes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory," but their dependent status generally precludes ex-tension of tribal civil authority beyond these limits.

UnitedStates v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975). The Navajo

Nation's imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indianfee land within the reservation is, therefore, presumptively
invalid. Because respondents have failed to establish thatthe hotel occupancy tax is commensurately related to any
consensual relationship with petitioner or is necessary tovindicate the Navajo Nation's political integrity, the presumption ripens into a holding. The judgment of the Court
of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is accordingly

Reversed.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring.

If we are to see coherence in the various manifestations of
the general law of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, thesource of doctrine must be

Montana v. United States, 450
U. S. 544 (1981), and it is in light of that case that I join theCourt's opinion. Under

Montana, the status of territory
within a reservation's boundaries as tribal or fee land mayhave much to do (as it does here) with the likelihood (or not)

that facts will exist that are relevant under the exceptions
to Montana's "general proposition" that "the inherent sover532US2 Unit: $U56 [09-19-02 20:53:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

eign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activitiesof nonmembers of the tribe." Id., at 565. That general

proposition is, however, the first principle, regardless ofwhether the land at issue is fee land, or land owned by or
held in trust for an Indian tribe.

PGA TOUR, INC. v. MARTIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-24. Argued January 17, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
Petitioner sponsors professional golf tournaments conducted on three annual tours. A player may gain entry into the tours in various ways,
most commonly through successfully competing in a three-stage qualifying tournament known as the "Q-School." Any member of the public
may enter the Q-School by submitting two letters of recommendation
and paying a $3,000 entry fee to cover greens fees and the cost of golf
carts, which are permitted during the first two stages, but have been
prohibited during the third stage since 1997. The rules governing competition in tour events include the "Rules of Golf," which apply at all
levels of amateur and professional golf and do not prohibit the use of
golf carts, and the "hard card," which applies specifically to petitioner's
professional tours and requires players to walk the golf course during
tournaments, except in "open" qualifying events for each tournament
and on petitioner's senior tour. Respondent Martin is a talented golfer
afflicted with a degenerative circulatory disorder that prevents him
from walking golf courses. His disorder constitutes a disability under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. $ 12101
et seq. When Martin turned pro and entered the Q-School, he made a
request, supported by detailed medical records, for permission to use a
golf cart during the third stage. Petitioner refused, and Martin filed
this action under Title III of the ADA, which, among other things, requires an entity operating "public accommodations" to make "reasonable
modifications" in its policies "when . . . necessary to afford such . . .
accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can
demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally
alter the nature of such . . . accommodations," $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). In denying petitioner summary judgment, the Magistrate Judge rejected its contention, among others, that the play areas
of its tour competitions are not places of "public accommodation" within
Title III's scope. After trial, the District Court entered a permanent
injunction requiring petitioner to permit Martin to use a cart. Among
its rulings, that court found that the walking rule's purpose was to inject fatigue into the skill of shotmaking, but that the fatigue injected
by walking a golf course cannot be deemed significant under normal

Syllabus
circumstances; determined that even with the use of a cart, the fatigue
Martin suffers from coping with his disability is greater than the fatigue
his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the course; and concluded that it would not fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's
game to accommodate Martin. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding,
inter alia, that golf courses, including play areas, are places of public
accommodation during professional tournaments and that permitting
Martin to use a cart would not "fundamentally alter" the nature of
those tournaments.

Held:

1. Title III of the ADA, by its plain terms, prohibits petitioner from
denying Martin equal access to its tours on the basis of his disability.
Cf. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 209.
That Title provides, as a general rule, that "[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of a disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the . . . privileges . . . of any place of public accommodation."

$ 12182(a). The phrase "public accommodation" is defined in terms of 12
extensive categories, $ 12181(7), which the legislative history indicates
should be construed liberally to afford people with disabilities equal access to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled.
Given the general rule and the comprehensive definition of "public accommodation," it is apparent that petitioner's golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortably within Title III's coverage, and Martin
within its protection. The events occur on "golf course[s]," a type of
place specifically identified as a public accommodation. $ 12181(7)(L).
And, at all relevant times, petitioner "leases" and "operates" golf
courses to conduct its Q-School and tours. $ 12182(a). As a lessor and
operator, petitioner must not discriminate against any "individual" in
the "full and equal enjoyment of the . . . privileges" of those courses.
Ibid. Among those "privileges" are competing in the Q-School and
playing in the tours; indeed, the former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from the general public pay, and the latter is one for
which they vie. Martin is one of those individuals. The Court rejects
petitioner's argument that competing golfers are not members of the
class protected by Title III--i. e., "clients or customers of the covered
public accommodation," $ 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv)--but are providers of the
entertainment petitioner sells, so that their "job-related" discrimination
claims may only be brought under Title I. Even if Title III's protected
class were so limited, it would be entirely appropriate to classify the
golfers who pay petitioner $3,000 for the chance to compete in the

clients or customers. This conclusion is consistent with case law in the
analogous context of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, e. g.,
Daniel v. Paul, 395 U. S. 298, 306. Pp. 674-681.

2. Allowing Martin to use a golf cart, despite petitioner's walking
requirement, is not a modification that would "fundamentally alter the
nature" of petitioner's tours or the third stage of the Q-School. In theory, a modification of the tournaments might constitute a fundamental
alteration in these ways: (1) It might alter such an essential aspect of
golf, e. g., the diameter of the hole, that it would be unacceptable even
if it affected all competitors equally; or (2) a less significant change that
has only a peripheral impact on the game itself might nevertheless give
a disabled player, in addition to access to the competition as required
by Title III, an advantage over others and therefore fundamentally alter
the character of the competition. The Court is not persuaded that a
waiver of the walking rule for Martin would work a fundamental alteration in either sense. The use of carts is not inconsistent with the
fundamental character of golf, the essence of which has always been
shotmaking. The walking rule contained in petitioner's hard cards
is neither an essential attribute of the game itself nor an indispensable
feature of tournament golf. The Court rejects petitioner's attempt to
distinguish golf as it is generally played from the game at the highest
level, where, petitioner claims, the waiver of an "outcome-affecting" rule
such as the walking rule would violate the governing principle that competitors must be subject to identical substantive rules, thereby fundamentally altering the nature of tournament events. That argument's
force is mitigated by the fact that it is impossible to guarantee that all
golfers will play under exactly the same conditions or that an individual's ability will be the sole determinant of the outcome. Further, the
factual basis of petitioner's argument--that the walking rule is "outcome affecting" because fatigue may adversely affect performance--is
undermined by the District Court's finding that the fatigue from walking during a tournament cannot be deemed significant. Even if petitioner's factual predicate is accepted, its legal position is fatally flawed
because its refusal to consider Martin's personal circumstances in deciding whether to accommodate his disability runs counter to the ADA's
requirement that an individualized inquiry be conducted. Cf. Sutton v.
United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 483. There is no doubt that allowing Martin to use a cart would not fundamentally alter the nature of
petitioner's tournaments, given the District Court's uncontested finding
that Martin endures greater fatigue with a cart than his able-bodied
competitors do by walking. The waiver of a peripheral tournament

I
Petitioner PGA TOUR, Inc., a nonprofit entity formed in1968, sponsors and cosponsors professional golf tournaments

conducted on three annual tours. About 200 golfers partici-pate in the PGA TOUR; about 170 in the NIKE TOUR;

1 and

about 100 in the SENIOR PGA TOUR. PGA TOUR andNIKE TOUR tournaments typically are 4-day events, played

on courses leased and operated by petitioner. The entirefield usually competes in two 18-hole rounds played on
Thursday and Friday; those who survive the "cut" play onSaturday and Sunday and receive prize money in amounts
determined by their aggregate scores for all four rounds.The revenues generated by television, admissions, concessions, and contributions from cosponsors amount to about$300 million a year, much of which is distributed in prize
money.There are various ways of gaining entry into particular
tours. For example, a player who wins three NIKE TOURevents in the same year, or is among the top-15 money winners on that tour, earns the right to play in the PGA TOUR.Additionally, a golfer may obtain a spot in an official tournament through successfully competing in "open" qualifyingrounds, which are conducted the week before each tournament. Most participants, however, earn playing privilegesin the PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR by way of a three-stage
qualifying tournament known as the "Q-School."Any member of the public may enter the Q-School by paying a $3,000 entry fee and submitting two letters of reference

Opinion of the Court
from, among others, PGA TOUR or NIKE TOUR members.The $3,000 entry fee covers the players' greens fees and the

cost of golf carts, which are permitted during the first twostages, but which have been prohibited during the third
stage since 1997. Each year, over a thousand contestantscompete in the first stage, which consists of four 18-hole
rounds at different locations. Approximately half of themmake it to the second stage, which also includes 72 holes.
Around 168 players survive the second stage and advance tothe final one, where they compete over 108 holes. Of those
finalists, about a fourth qualify for membership in the PGATOUR, and the rest gain membership in the NIKE TOUR.
The significance of making it into either tour is illuminatedby the fact that there are about 25 million golfers in the
country.2Three sets of rules govern competition in tour events.
First, the "Rules of Golf," jointly written by the UnitedStates Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club of Scotland, apply to the game as it is played, notonly by millions of amateurs on public courses and in private
country clubs throughout the United States and worldwide,but also by the professionals in the tournaments conducted
by petitioner, the USGA, the Ladies' Professional Golf Asso-ciation, and the Senior Women's Golf Association. Those
rules do not prohibit the use of golf carts at any time.3Second, the "Conditions of Competition and Local Rules,"
often described as the "hard card," apply specifically to peti-tioner's professional tours. The hard cards for the PGA

2 Generally, to maintain membership in a tour for the succeeding year,
rather than go through the Q-School again, a player must perform at a
certain level.

3 Instead, Appendix I to the Rules of Golf lists a number of "optional"

conditions, among them one related to transportation: "If it is desired
to require players to walk in a competition, the following condition is
suggested:

"Players shall walk at all times during a stipulated round." App. 125.

Opinion of the Court
TOUR and NIKE TOUR require players to walk the golf
course during tournaments, but not during open qualifying
rounds.4 On the SENIOR PGA TOUR, which is limited to
golfers age 50 and older, the contestants may use golf carts.
Most seniors, however, prefer to walk.5

Third, "Notices to Competitors" are issued for particular
tournaments and cover conditions for that specific event.
Such a notice may, for example, explain how the Rules of Golf
should be applied to a particular water hazard or manmade
obstruction. It might also authorize the use of carts to
speed up play when there is an unusual distance between
one green and the next tee.6

The basic Rules of Golf, the hard cards, and the weekly
notices apply equally to all players in tour competitions. As
one of petitioner's witnesses explained with reference to "the
Masters Tournament, which is golf at its very highest
level, . . . the key is to have everyone tee off on the first hole
under exactly the same conditions and all of them be tested
over that 72-hole event under the conditions that exist during those four days of the event." App. 192.

during a stipulated round unless permitted to ride by the PGA TOUR
Rules Committee." Id., at 127. The NIKE TOUR hard card similarly

as noted, golf carts have not been permitted during the third stage of the
Q-School since 1997. Petitioner added this recent prohibition in order to

Opinion of the Court
and won the state championship as a high school senior. He
played on the Stanford University golf team that won the
1994 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. As a professional, Martin qualified for the NIKE
TOUR in 1998 and 1999, and based on his 1999 performance,
qualified for the PGA TOUR in 2000. In the 1999 season,
he entered 24 events, made the cut 13 times, and had 6 top-10
finishes, coming in second twice and third once.

Martin is also an individual with a disability as defined in
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act).7
Since birth he has been afflicted with Klippel-TrenaunayWeber Syndrome, a degenerative circulatory disorder that
obstructs the flow of blood from his right leg back to his
heart. The disease is progressive; it causes severe pain and
has atrophied his right leg. During the latter part of his
college career, because of the progress of the disease, Martin
could no longer walk an 18-hole golf course.8 Walking not
only caused him pain, fatigue, and anxiety, but also created
a significant risk of hemorrhaging, developing blood clots,
and fracturing his tibia so badly that an amputation might
be required. For these reasons, Stanford made written requests to the Pacific 10 Conference and the NCAA to waive
for Martin their rules requiring players to walk and carry
their own clubs. The requests were granted.9

7 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 12102 provides, in part:
"The term `disability' means, with respect to an individual--
"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more of the major life activities of such individual . . . ."

8 Before then, even when Martin was in extreme pain, and was offered

a cart, he declined. Tr. 564-565.

the Stanford coach testified:

Opinion of the Court
When Martin turned pro and entered petitioner 'sQ-School, the hard card permitted him to use a cart during

his successful progress through the first two stages. Hemade a request, supported by detailed medical records, for
permission to use a golf cart during the third stage. Peti-tioner refused to review those records or to waive its walking rule for the third stage. Martin therefore filed thisaction. A preliminary injunction entered by the District
Court made it possible for him to use a cart in the final stageof the Q-School and as a competitor in the NIKE TOUR and
PGA TOUR. Although not bound by the injunction, and de-spite its support for petitioner's position in this litigation,
the USGA voluntarily granted Martin a similar waiver inevents that it sponsors, including the U. S. Open.

III
In the District Court, petitioner moved for summary judg-ment on the ground that it is exempt from coverage under

Title III of the ADA as a "private clu[b] or establish-men[t],"

10 or alternatively, that the play areas of its tour

competitions do not constitute places of "public accommoda-tion" within the scope of that Title.

11 The Magistrate Judge

concluded that petitioner should be viewed as a commercialenterprise operating in the entertainment industry for the

economic benefit of its members rather than as a private
doing with his life, and every coach, to my knowledge, and every player
wanted Casey in the tournament and they welcomed him there.

"Q. Did anyone contend that that constituted an alteration of the competition to the extent that it didn't constitute the game to your level, the
college level?

"A. Not at all, sir." App. 208.
10 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 12187 provides: "The provisions of this subchapter

shall not apply to private clubs or establishments exempted from coverage
under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U. S. C. $ 2000-a(e)) or to
religious organizations or entities controlled by religious organizations,
including places of worship."

club. Furthermore, after noting that the statutory defini-tion of public accommodation included a "golf course,"

12 he

rejected petitioner's argument that its competitions are onlyplaces of public accommodation in the areas open to spectators. The operator of a public accommodation could not, inhis view, "create private enclaves within the facility . . . and
thus relegate the ADA to hop-scotch areas." 984 F. Supp.1320, 1326-1327 (Ore. 1998). Accordingly, he denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment.At trial, petitioner did not contest the conclusion that Martin has a disability covered by the ADA, or the fact "that his
disability prevents him from walking the course during around of golf." 994 F. Supp. 1242, 1244 (Ore. 1998). Rather,

petitioner asserted that the condition of walking is a sub-stantive rule of competition, and that waiving it as to
any individual for any reason would fundamentally alter thenature of the competition. Petitioner's evidence included
the testimony of a number of experts, among them someof the greatest golfers in history. Arnold Palmer,

13 "Q. And fatigue is one of the factors that can cause a golfer at the

PGA Tour level to lose one stroke or more?

"A. Oh, it is. And it has happened.
"Q. And can one stroke be the difference between winning and not winning a tournament at the PGA Tour level?

"A. As I said, I've lost a few national opens by one stroke." App. 177.
14 "Q. Mr. Nicklaus, what is your understanding of the reason why in

Opinion of the Court
a critical factor in a tournament, particularly on the last day
when psychological pressure is at a maximum. Their testimony makes it clear that, in their view, permission to use a
cart might well give some players a competitive advantage
over other players who must walk. They did not, however,
express any opinion on whether a cart would give Martin
such an advantage.16

Rejecting petitioner's argument that an individualized inquiry into the necessity of the walking rule in Martin's case
would be inappropriate, the District Court stated that it had
"the independent duty to inquire into the purpose of the rule
at issue, and to ascertain whether there can be a reasonable
modification made to accommodate plaintiff without frustrating the purpose of the rule" and thereby fundamentally altering the nature of petitioner's tournaments. Id., at 1246.
The judge found that the purpose of the rule was to inject
fatigue into the skill of shotmaking, but that the fatigue injected "by walking the course cannot be deemed significant
under normal circumstances." Id., at 1250. Furthermore,
Martin presented evidence, and the judge found, that even
with the use of a cart, Martin must walk over a mile during

"A. Oh, there's no doubt, again, but that, that fatigue does play a big
part. It will influence your game. It will influence your shot-making.
It will influence your decisions." Id., at 236-237.

16 "Q. Based on your experience, do you believe that it would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition on the PGA Tour and the Nike
Tour if competitors in those events were permitted to use golf carts?

"A. Yes, absolutely.
"Q. Why do you say so, sir?
"A. It would--it would take away the fatigue factor in many ways. It
would--it would change the game.. . . . .

"Q. Now, when you say that the use of carts takes away the fatigue
factor, it would be an aid, et cetera, again, as I understand it, you are not
testifying now about the plaintiff. You are just talking in general terms?. . . . .

"A. Yes, sir." Id., at 238. See also id., at 177-178 (Palmer); id., at
191 (Nicklaus).

Opinion of the Court
an 18-hole round,17 and that the fatigue he suffers from coping with his disability is "undeniably greater" than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the
course. Id., at 1251. As the judge observed:

"[P]laintiff is in significant pain when he walks, and
even when he is getting in and out of the cart. With
each step, he is at risk of fracturing his tibia and hemorrhaging. The other golfers have to endure the psychological stress of competition as part of their fatigue;
Martin has the same stress plus the added stress of pain
and risk of serious injury. As he put it, he would gladly
trade the cart for a good leg. To perceive that the cart
puts him--with his condition--at a competitive advantage is a gross distortion of reality." Id., at 1251-1252.

As a result, the judge concluded that it would "not fundamentally alter the nature of the PGA Tour's game to accommodate him with a cart." Id., at 1252. The judge accordingly entered a permanent injunction requiring petitioner
to permit Martin to use a cart in tour and qualifying events.

On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, petitioner did not challenge the District Court's rejection of its claim that it was
exempt as a "private club," but it renewed the contention
that during a tournament the portion of the golf course " `behind the ropes' is not a public accommodation because the
public has no right to enter it." 204 F. 3d 994, 997 (2000).
The Court of Appeals viewed that contention as resting on
the incorrect assumption that the competition among participants was not itself public. The court first pointed out that,
as with a private university, "the fact that users of a facility
are highly selected does not mean that the facility cannot be

17 "In the first place, he does walk while on the course--even with a cart,
he must move from cart to shot and back to the cart. In essence, he still
must walk approximately 25% of the course. On a course roughly five
miles in length, Martin will walk 11/4 miles." 994 F. Supp., at 1251.

a public accommodation." Id., at 998.18 In its opinion, thecompetition to enter the select circle of PGA TOUR and

NIKE TOUR golfers was comparable because "[a]ny mem-ber of the public who pays a $3000 entry fee and supplies
two letters of recommendation may try out in the qualifyingschool." Id., at 999. The court saw "no justification in reason or in the statute to draw a line beyond which the per-formance of athletes becomes so excellent that a competition
restricted to their level deprives its situs of the character ofa public accommodation."

Ibid. Nor did it find a basis fordistinguishing between "use of a place of public accommodation for pleasure and use in the pursuit of a living." Ibid.Consequently, the Court of Appeals concluded that golf
courses remain places of public accommodation during PGAtournaments.

Ibid.
On the merits, because there was no serious dispute aboutthe fact that permitting Martin to use a golf cart was both a

reasonable and a necessary solution to the problem of provid-ing him access to the tournaments, the Court of Appeals regarded the central dispute as whether such permission would
"fundamentally alter" the nature of the PGA TOUR orNIKE TOUR. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals viewed the issue not as "whether use of carts generallywould fundamentally alter the competition, but whether the
use of a cart by Martin would do so." Id., at 1001. Thatissue turned on "an intensively fact-based inquiry," and, the
court concluded, had been correctly resolved by the trialjudge. In its words, "[a]ll that the cart does is permit Martin access to a type of competition in which he otherwisecould not engage because of his disability."

Id., at 1000.

18 It explained: "For example, Title III includes in its definition `secondary, undergraduate, or post-graduate private school[s].' 42 U. S. C.

$ 12181(7)(J). The competition to enter the most elite private universities
is intense, and a relatively select few are admitted. That fact clearly does
not remove the universities from the statute's definition as places of public
accommodation." 204 F. 3d, at 998.

674 PGA TOUR, INC. v. MARTIN

Opinion of the Court
The day after the Ninth Circuit ruled in Martin's favor,the Seventh Circuit came to a contrary conclusion in a case

brought against the USGA by a disabled golfer who failed toqualify for "America's greatest--and most democratic--golf
tournament, the United States Open." Olinger v. UnitedStates Golf Assn., 205 F. 3d 1001 (2000).

19 The Seventh Circuit endorsed the conclusion of the District Court in thatcase that "the nature of the competition would be fundamentally altered if the walking rule were eliminated because itwould remove stamina (at least a particular type of stamina)
from the set of qualities designed to be tested in this compe-tition."

Id., at 1006 (internal quotation marks omitted). Inthe Seventh Circuit's opinion, the physical ordeals endured

by Ken Venturi and Ben Hogan when they walked to theirOpen victories in 1964 and 1950 amply demonstrated the importance of stamina in such a tournament.20 As an alterna-tive basis for its holding, the court also concluded that the
ADA does not require the USGA to bear "the administrativeburdens of evaluating requests to waive the walking rule and
permit the use of a golf cart." Id., at 1007.Although the Seventh Circuit merely assumed that the
ADA applies to professional golf tournaments, and thereforedid not disagree with the Ninth on the threshold coverage
issue, our grant of certiorari, 530 U. S. 1306 (2000), encom-passes that question as well as the conflict between those
courts. IV

Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespreaddiscrimination against disabled individuals. In studying the
need for such legislation, Congress found that "historically,society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with

disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms ofdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue

to be a serious and pervasive social problem." 42 U. S. C.$ 12101(a)(2); see $ 12101(a)(3) ("[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas asemployment, housing, public accommodations, education,
transportation, communication, recreation, institutionaliza-tion, health services, voting, and access to public services").
Congress noted that the many forms such discriminationtakes include "outright intentional exclusion" as well as the
"failure to make modifications to existing facilities and prac-tices." $ 12101(a)(5). After thoroughly investigating the
problem, Congress concluded that there was a "compellingneed" for a "clear and comprehensive national mandate" to
eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals, and tointegrate them "into the economic and social mainstream of
American life." S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 20 (1989); H. R. Rep.No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 50 (1990).

In the ADA, Congress provided that broad mandate. See42 U. S. C. $ 12101(b). In fact, one of the Act's "most impressive strengths" has been identified as its "comprehensivecharacter," Hearings on S. 933 before the Senate Committee
on Labor and Human Resources and the Subcommittee onthe Handicapped, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1989) (statement of Attorney General Thornburgh), and accordingly theAct has been described as "a milestone on the path to a more
decent, tolerant, progressive society," Board of Trustees ofUniv. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 375 (2001) (

Kennedy,J., concurring). To effectuate its sweeping purpose, the

ADA forbids discrimination against disabled individuals inmajor areas of public life, among them employment (Title I
of the Act),21 public services (Title II),22 and public accommo-dations (Title III).

ties "equal access" to the wide variety of establishmentsavailable to the nondisabled.

25

It seems apparent, from both the general rule and the com-prehensive definition of "public accommodation," that petitioner's golf tours and their qualifying rounds fit comfortablywithin the coverage of Title III, and Martin within its protection. The events occur on "golf course[s]," a type of placespecifically identified by the Act as a public accommodation.

$ 12181(7)(L). In addition, at all relevant times, petitioner"leases" and "operates" golf courses to conduct its Q-School
and tours. $ 12182(a). As a lessor and operator of golfcourses, then, petitioner must not discriminate against any
"individual" in the "full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations" of those courses. Ibid. Certainly, among the "privi-leges" offered by petitioner on the courses are those of competing in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, theformer is a privilege for which thousands of individuals from
the general public pay, and the latter is one for which theyvie. Martin, of course, is one of those individuals. It would
therefore appear that Title III of the ADA, by its plainterms, prohibits petitioner from denying Martin equal access
to its tours on the basis of his disability. Cf. PennsylvaniaDept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 209 (1998)
(holding that text of Title II's prohibition of discrimina-tion by "public entities" against disabled individuals "unmistakably includes State prisons and prisoners within itscoverage").

Petitioner argues otherwise. To be clear about its posi-tion, it does not assert (as it did in the District Court) that
it is a private club altogether exempt from Title III's cov-erage. In fact, petitioner admits that its tournaments are
conducted at places of public accommodation.26 Nor doespetitioner contend (as it did in both the District Court and

Opinion of the Court
the Court of Appeals) that the competitors' area "behind theropes" is not a public accommodation, notwithstanding the

status of the rest of the golf course. Rather, petitioner re-frames the coverage issue by arguing that the competing
golfers are not members of the class protected by Title IIIof the ADA.

27

According to petitioner, Title III is concerned with dis-crimination against "clients and customers" seeking to obtain

"goods and services" at places of public accommodation,whereas it is Title I that protects persons who work at such
places.28 As the argument goes, petitioner operates not a"golf course" during its tournaments but a "place of exhibition or entertainment," 42 U. S. C. $ 12181(7)(C), and a pro-fessional golfer such as Martin, like an actor in a theater
production, is a provider rather than a consumer of the
entertainment that petitioner sells to the public. Martintherefore cannot bring a claim under Title III because he is

not one of the " `clients or customers of the covered public
accommodation.' " 29 Rather, Martin's claim of discrimina-tion is "job-related"

30 and could only be brought under Title

I--but that Title does not apply because he is an independentcontractor (as the District Court found) rather than an

employee.The reference to "clients or customers" that petitioner
quotes appears in 42 U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv), which

27 Martin complains that petitioner's failure to make this exact argument
below precludes its assertion here. However, the Title III coverage issue
was raised in the lower courts, petitioner advanced this particular argument
in support of its position on the issue in its petition for certiorari, and the
argument was fully briefed on the merits by both parties. Given the importance of the issue, we exercise our discretion to consider it. See Harris
Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 245-246,

Opinion of the Court
states: "For purposes of clauses (i) through (iii) of this sub-paragraph, the term `individual or class of individuals' refers

to the clients or customers of the covered public accommoda-tion that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement." Clauses (i) through (iii) of the subparagraphprohibit public accommodations from discriminating against
a disabled "individual or class of individuals" in certainways

31 either directly or indirectly through contractual arrangements with other entities. Those clauses make clearon the one hand that their prohibitions cannot be avoided by

means of contract, while clause (iv) makes clear on the otherhand that contractual relationships will not expand a public
accommodation's obligations under the subparagraph beyondits own clients or customers.

As petitioner recognizes, clause (iv) is not literally appli-cable to Title III's general rule prohibiting discrimination against disabled individuals.32 Title III's broad generalrule contains no express "clients or customers" limitation,

$ 12182(a), and $ 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides that its limi-tation is only "[f]or purposes of " the clauses in that separate subparagraph. Nevertheless, petitioner contends thatclause (iv)'s restriction of the subparagraph's coverage to the
clients or customers of public accommodations fairly de-scribes the scope of Title III's protection as a whole.

We need not decide whether petitioner's construction ofthe statute is correct, because petitioner's argument falters
even on its own terms. If Title III's protected class werelimited to "clients or customers," it would be entirely appropriate to classify the golfers who pay petitioner $3,000 forthe chance to compete in the Q-School and, if successful, in
the subsequent tour events, as petitioner's clients or custom31 Clause (i) prohibits the denial of participation, clause (ii) participation in
unequal benefits, and clause (iii) the provision of separate benefits.

Opinion of the Court
ers. In our view, petitioner's tournaments (whether situated at a "golf course" or at a "place of exhibition or entertainment") simultaneously offer at least two "privileges" to
the public--that of watching the golf competition and that of
competing in it. Although the latter is more difficult and
more expensive to obtain than the former, it is nonetheless
a privilege that petitioner makes available to members of the
general public. In consideration of the entry fee, any golfer
with the requisite letters of recommendation acquires the
opportunity to qualify for and compete in petitioner's tours.
Additionally, any golfer who succeeds in the open qualifying
rounds for a tournament may play in the event. That petitioner identifies one set of clients or customers that it serves
(spectators at tournaments) does not preclude it from having
another set (players in tournaments) against whom it may
not discriminate. It would be inconsistent with the literal
text of the statute as well as its expansive purpose to read
Title III's coverage, even given petitioner's suggested limitation, any less broadly.33

33 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, our view of the Q-School does not
make "everyone who seeks a job" at a public accommodation, through "an
open tryout" or otherwise, "a customer." Post, at 697 (opinion of Scalia,
J.). Unlike those who successfully apply for a job at a place of public accommodation, or those who successfully bid for a contract, the golfers who qualify for petitioner's tours play at their own pleasure (perhaps, but not necessarily, for prize money), and although they commit to playing in at least 15
tournaments, they are not bound by any obligations typically associated
with employment. See, e. g., App. 260 (trial testimony of PGA commissioner Timothy Finchem) (petitioner lacks control over when and where tour
members compete, and over their manner of performance outside the rules
of competition). Furthermore, unlike athletes in "other professional
sports, such as baseball," post, at 697, in which players are employed by their
clubs, the golfers on tour are not employed by petitioner or any related organizations. The record does not support the proposition that the purpose of
the Q-School "is to hire," ibid., rather than to narrow the field of participants
in the sporting events that petitioner sponsors at places of public
accommodation.

Opinion of the Court
Our conclusion is consistent with case law in the analogouscontext of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat.

243, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000a et seq. Title II of that Act prohibitspublic accommodations from discriminating on the basis of
race, color, religion, or national origin. $ 2000a(a). In Dan-iel v. Paul, 395 U. S. 298, 306 (1969), applying Title II to the
Lake Nixon Club in Little Rock, Arkansas, we held that thedefinition of a "place of exhibition or entertainment," as a
public accommodation, covered participants "in some sportor activity" as well as "spectators or listeners." We find
equally persuasive two lower court opinions applying TitleII specifically to golfers and golf tournaments. In

Evans v.Laurel Links, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 474, 477 (ED Va. 1966), a

class action brought to require a commercial golf establish-ment to permit black golfers to play on its course, the District Court held that Title II "is not limited to spectators ifthe place of exhibition or entertainment provides facilities
for the public to participate in the entertainment." 34 Andin

Wesley v. Savannah, 294 F. Supp. 698 (SD Ga. 1969), theDistrict Court found that a private association violated Title

II when it limited entry in a golf tournament on a municipalcourse to its own members but permitted all (and only) white
golfers who paid the membership and entry fees to com-pete.

35 These cases support our conclusion that, as a public

accommodation during its tours and qualifying rounds, peti-tioner may not discriminate against either spectators or competitors on the basis of disability.

682 PGA TOUR, INC. v. MARTIN

Opinion of the Court
discriminating against individuals because of their disabili-ties. The question whether petitioner has violated that rule

depends on a proper construction of the term "discrimina-tion," which is defined by Title III to include

"a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices, or procedures, when such modifications are
necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, priv-ileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals
with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate thatmaking such modifications would fundamentally alter
the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges,advantages, or accommodations." $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)
(emphasis added).
Petitioner does not contest that a golf cart is a reasonablemodification that is necessary if Martin is to play in its tournaments. Martin's claim thus differs from one that mightbe asserted by players with less serious afflictions that make
walking the course uncomfortable or difficult, but not beyondtheir capacity. In such cases, an accommodation might be
reasonable but not necessary. In this case, however, thenarrow dispute is whether allowing Martin to use a golf
cart, despite the walking requirement that applies to thePGA TOUR, the NIKE TOUR, and the third stage of the
Q-School, is a modification that would "fundamentally alterthe nature" of those events.

In theory, a modification of petitioner's golf tournamentsmight constitute a fundamental alteration in two different
ways. It might alter such an essential aspect of the gameof golf that it would be unacceptable even if it affected all
competitors equally; changing the diameter of the hole fromthree to six inches might be such a modification.

36 Alternatively, a less significant change that has only a peripheral

which the rules of a well-known game are changed to such a degree that no

Opinion of the Court
impact on the game itself might nevertheless give a disabledplayer, in addition to access to the competition as required

by Title III, an advantage over others and, for that reason,fundamentally alter the character of the competition.

37 We

are not persuaded that a waiver of the walking rule for Mar-tin would work a fundamental alteration in either sense.

38

As an initial matter, we observe that the use of carts isnot itself inconsistent with the fundamental character of the

game of golf. From early on, the essence of the game hasbeen shotmaking--using clubs to cause a ball to progress
from the teeing ground to a hole some distance away with asfew strokes as possible.

39 That essential aspect of the game

37 Accord, post, at 703 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The statute seeks to assure that a disabled person's disability will not deny him equal access to
(among other things) competitive sporting events--not that his disability
will not deny him an equal chance to win competitive sporting events").

38 As we have noted, the statute contemplates three inquiries: whether

the requested modification is "reasonable," whether it is "necessary" for
the disabled individual, and whether it would "fundamentally alter the
nature of" the competition. 42 U. S. C. $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Whether one
question should be decided before the others likely will vary from case to
case, for in logic there seems to be no necessary priority among the three.
In routine cases, the fundamental alteration inquiry may end with the
question whether a rule is essential. Alternatively, the specifics of the
claimed disability might be examined within the context of what is a reasonable or necessary modification. Given the concession by petitioner
that the modification sought is reasonable and necessary, and given petitioner's reliance on the fundamental alteration provision, we have no occasion to consider the alternatives in this case.

39 Golf is an ancient game, tracing its ancestry to Scotland, and played

by such notables as Mary Queen of Scots and her son James. That shotmaking has been the essence of golf since early in its history is reflected
in the first recorded rules of golf, published in 1744 for a tournament on
the Leith Links in Edinburgh:

"Articles & Laws in Playing at Golf
"1. You must Tee your Ball, within a Club's length of the [previous] Hole.
"2. Your Tee must be upon the Ground.
"3. You are not to change the Ball which you Strike off the Tee.

is still reflected in the very first of the Rules of Golf, which
declares: "The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from
the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive
strokes in accordance with the rules." Rule 1-1, Rules of
Golf, App. 104 (emphasis in original). Over the years, there
have been many changes in the players' equipment, in golf
course design, in the Rules of Golf, and in the method of
transporting clubs from hole to hole.40 Originally, so few
clubs were used that each player could carry them without

a bag. Then came golf bags, caddies, carts that were pulledby hand, and eventually motorized carts that carried players

as well as clubs. "Golf carts started appearing with increas-ing regularity on American golf courses in the 1950's.
Today they are everywhere. And they are encouraged.For one thing, they often speed up play, and for another, they
are great revenue producers." 41 There is nothing in theRules of Golf that either forbids the use of carts or penalizes
a player for using a cart. That set of rules, as we have ob-served, is widely accepted in both the amateur and professional golf world as the rules of the game.42 The walkingrule that is contained in petitioner's hard cards, based on an
optional condition buried in an appendix to the Rules ofGolf,

43 is not an essential attribute of the game itself.

Indeed, the walking rule is not an indispensable featureof tournament golf either. As already mentioned, petitioner

permits golf carts to be used in the SENIOR PGA TOUR,the open qualifying events for petitioner's tournaments, the
first two stages of the Q-School, and, until 1997, the thirdstage of the Q-School as well. See supra, at 665-667.
Moreover, petitioner allows the use of carts during certaintournament rounds in both the PGA TOUR and the NIKE

41 Olinger v. United States Golf Assn., 205 F. 3d 1001, 1003 (CA7 2000).
42 On this point, the testimony of the immediate past president of the

USGA (and one of petitioner's witnesses at trial) is illuminating:

"Tell the court, if you would, Ms. Bell, who it is that plays under these
Rules of Golf . . . ?

"A. Well, these are the rules of the game, so all golfers. These are for
all people who play the game.

"Q. So the two amateurs that go out on the weekend to play golf
together would--would play by the Rules of Golf?

"Q. Or a tournament that is conducted at a private country club for its
members, is it your understanding that that would typically be conducted
under the Rules of Golf?

by these rules." App. 239.

TOUR. See supra, at 667, and n. 6. In addition, althoughthe USGA enforces a walking rule in most of the tournaments that it sponsors, it permits carts in the Senior Ama-teur and the Senior Women's Amateur championships.

44

Petitioner, however, distinguishes the game of golf as it isgenerally played from the game that it sponsors in the PGA

TOUR, NIKE TOUR, and (at least recently) the last stageof the Q-School--golf at the "highest level." According to
petitioner, "[t]he goal of the highest-level competitive athlet-ics is to assess and compare the performance of different
competitors, a task that is meaningful only if the competitorsare subject to identical substantive rules."

45 The waiver of

any possibly "outcome-affecting" rule for a contestant wouldviolate this principle and therefore, in petitioner's view, fundamentally alter the nature of the highest level athleticevent.

46 The walking rule is one such rule, petitioner submits, because its purpose is "to inject the element of fatigueinto the skill of shot-making,"

47 and thus its effect may be

the critical loss of a stroke. As a consequence, the reason-able modification Martin seeks would fundamentally alter

the nature of petitioner's highest level tournaments even ifhe were the only person in the world who has both the talent
to compete in those elite events and a disability sufficientlyserious that he cannot do so without using a cart.

The force of petitioner's argument is, first of all, mitigatedby the fact that golf is a game in which it is impossible to
guarantee that all competitors will play under exactly the

44 Furthermore, the USGA's handicap system, used by over 4 million
amateur golfers playing on courses rated by the USGA, does not consider
whether a player walks or rides in a cart, or whether she uses a caddy or
carries her own clubs. Rather, a player's handicap is determined by a
formula that takes into account the average score in the 10 best of her 20
most recent rounds, the difficulty of the different courses played, and
whether or not a round was a "tournament" event.

same conditions or that an individual's ability will be the soledeterminant of the outcome. For example, changes in the

weather may produce harder greens and more head windsfor the tournament leader than for his closest pursuers. A
lucky bounce may save a shot or two.48 Whether such hap-penstance events are more or less probable than the likelihood that a golfer afflicted with Klippel-Trenaunay-WeberSyndrome would one day qualify for the NIKE TOUR and
PGA TOUR, they at least demonstrate that pure chance mayhave a greater impact on the outcome of elite golf tournaments than the fatigue resulting from the enforcement of the
walking rule.Further, the factual basis of petitioner's argument is undermined by the District Court's finding that the fatiguefrom walking during one of petitioner's 4-day tournaments
cannot be deemed significant. The District Court creditedthe testimony of a professor in physiology and expert on fatigue, who calculated the calories expended in walking a golfcourse (about five miles) to be approximately 500 calories--
" `nutritionally . . . less than a Big Mac.' " 994 F. Supp., at
1250. What is more, that energy is expended over a 5-hourperiod, during which golfers have numerous intervals for

rest and refreshment. In fact, the expert concluded, be-cause golf is a low intensity activity, fatigue from the game
is primarily a psychological phenomenon in which stress andmotivation are the key ingredients. And even under conditions of severe heat and humidity, the critical factor in fa-tigue is fluid loss rather than exercise from walking.

Moreover, when given the option of using a cart, the ma-jority of golfers in petitioner's tournaments have chosen to

Opinion of the Court
walk, often to relieve stress or for other strategic reasons.49As NIKE TOUR member Eric Johnson testified, walking

allows him to keep in rhythm, stay warmer when it is chilly,and develop a better sense of the elements and the course
than riding a cart.50Even if we accept the factual predicate for petitioner's
argument--that the walking rule is "outcome affecting"
because fatigue may adversely affect performance--its legalposition is fatally flawed. Petitioner's refusal to consider

Martin's personal circumstances in deciding whether to ac-commodate his disability runs counter to the clear language
and purpose of the ADA. As previously stated, the ADAwas enacted to eliminate discrimination against "individuals"
with disabilities, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101(b)(1), and to that endTitle III of the Act requires without exception that any "policies, practices, or procedures" of a public accommodation bereasonably modified for disabled "individuals" as necessary
to afford access unless doing so would fundamentally alter
what is offered, $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). To comply with this
command, an individualized inquiry must be made to determine whether a specific modification for a particular person's
disability would be reasonable under the circumstances as
well as necessary for that person, and yet at the same time
not work a fundamental alteration. See S. Rep. No. 101-116,
at 61; H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 102 (public accommodations "are required to make decisions based on facts applicable to individuals"). Cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,
527 U. S. 471, 483 (1999) ("[W]hether a person has a disability
under the ADA is an individualized inquiry").

49 That has been so not only in the SENIOR PGA TOUR and the first
two stages of the Q-School, but also, as Martin himself noticed, in the third
stage of the Q-School after petitioner permitted everyone to ride rather
than just waiving the walking rule for Martin as required by the District
Court's injunction.

Opinion of the Court
To be sure, the waiver of an essential rule of competitionfor anyone would fundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments. As we have demonstrated, however, thewalking rule is at best peripheral to the nature of petitioner's athletic events, and thus it might be waived in individ-ual cases without working a fundamental alteration. Therefore, petitioner's claim that all the substantive rules for its"highest-level" competitions are sacrosanct and cannot be
modified under any circumstances is effectively a contentionthat it is exempt from Title III's reasonable modification requirement. But that provision carves out no exemption forelite athletics, and given Title III's coverage not only of
places of "exhibition or entertainment" but also of "golfcourse[s]," 42 U. S. C. $$ 12181(7)(C), (L), its application to
petitioner's tournaments cannot be said to be unintended orunexpected, see $$ 12101(a)(1), (5). Even if it were, "the fact
that a statute can be applied in situations not expresslyanticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.
It demonstrates breadth." Pennsylvania Dept. of Correc-tions v. Yeskey, 524 U. S., at 212 (internal quotation marks
omitted).51

51 Hence, petitioner's questioning of the ability of courts to apply the
reasonable modification requirement to athletic competition is a complaint
more properly directed to Congress, which drafted the ADA's coverage
broadly, than to us. Even more misguided is Justice Scalia's suggestion
that Congress did not place that inquiry into the hands of the courts at
all. According to the dissent, the game of golf as sponsored by petitioner
is, like all sports games, the sum of its "arbitrary rules," and no one,
including courts, "can pronounce one or another of them to be `nonessential' if the rulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential."
Post, at 700. Whatever the merit of Justice Scalia's postmodern view
of "What Is [Sport]," ibid., it is clear that Congress did not enshrine it in
Title III of the ADA. While Congress expressly exempted "private clubs
or establishments" and "religious organizations or entities" from Title III's
coverage, 42 U. S. C. $ 12187, Congress made no such exception for athletic
competitions, much less did it give sports organizations carte blanche authority to exempt themselves from the fundamental alteration inquiry by
deeming any rule, no matter how peripheral to the competition, to be

Opinion of the Court
Under the ADA's basic requirement that the need of a dis-abled person be evaluated on an individual basis, we have

no doubt that allowing Martin to use a golf cart would notfundamentally alter the nature of petitioner's tournaments.
As we have discussed, the purpose of the walking rule is tosubject players to fatigue, which in turn may influence the
outcome of tournaments. Even if the rule does serve thatpurpose, it is an uncontested finding of the District Court
that Martin "easily endures greater fatigue even with a cartthan his able-bodied competitors do by walking." 994 F.
Supp., at 1252. The purpose of the walking rule is thereforenot compromised in the slightest by allowing Martin to use
a cart. A modification that provides an exception to a pe-ripheral tournament rule without impairing its purpose cannot be said to "fundamentally alter" the tournament. Whatit can be said to do, on the other hand, is to allow Martin
the chance to qualify for, and compete in, the athletic eventspetitioner offers to those members of the public who have
the skill and desire to enter. That is exactly what the ADArequires.

52 As a result, Martin's request for a waiver of the

walking rule should have been granted.The ADA admittedly imposes some administrative burdens on the operators of places of public accommodation thatcould be avoided by strictly adhering to general rules and
policies that are entirely fair with respect to the able-bodiedbut that may indiscriminately preclude access by qualified
persons with disabilities.53 But surely, in a case of this kind,
essential. In short, Justice Scalia's reading of the statute renders the
word "fundamentally" largely superfluous, because it treats the alteration
of any rule governing an event at a public accommodation to be a fundamental alteration.

52 On this fundamental point, the dissent agrees. See post, at 699 ("The

PGA TOUR cannot deny respondent access to that game because of his
disability").

53 However, we think petitioner's contention that the task of assessing

requests for modifications will amount to a substantial burden is overstated. As Martin indicates, in the three years since he requested the

Congress intended that an entity like the PGA not only giveindividualized attention to the handful of requests that it

might receive from talented but disabled athletes for a modi-fication or waiver of a rule to allow them access to the competition, but also carefully weigh the purpose, as well as theletter, of the rule before determining that no accommodation
would be tolerable.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.

In my view today's opinion exercises a benevolent compas-sion that the law does not place it within our power to impose. The judgment distorts the text of Title III, the struc-ture of the ADA, and common sense. I respectfully dissent.

I
The Court holds that a professional sport is a place of pub-lic accommodation and that respondent is a "custome[r]" of

"competition" when he practices his profession. Ante, at679-680. It finds,

ante, at 680, that this strange conclusionis compelled by the "literal text" of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. $ 12101et seq., by the "expansive purpose" of the ADA, and by the
fact that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000a(a), has been applied to an amusement park and public
golf courses. I disagree.The ADA has three separate titles: Title I covers employment discrimination, Title II covers discrimination by
use of a cart, no one else has sued the PGA, and only two other golfers
(one of whom is Olinger) have sued the USGA for a waiver of the walking
rule. In addition, we believe petitioner's point is misplaced, as nowhere
in $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) does Congress limit the reasonable modification requirement only to requests that are easy to evaluate.

government entities, and Title III covers discrimination byplaces of public accommodation. Title II is irrelevant to this

case. Title I protects only "employees" of employers whohave 15 or more employees, $$ 12112(a), 12111(5)(A). It does
not protect independent contractors. See, e. g., Birchem v.
Knights of Columbus, 116 F. 3d 310, 312-313 (CA8 1997);
cf. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322-
323 (1992). Respondent claimed employment discriminationunder Title I, but the District Court found him to be an independent contractor rather than an employee.Respondent also claimed protection under $ 12182 of Title
III. That section applies only to particular places and persons. The place must be a "place of public accommodation,"
and the person must be an "individual" seeking "enjoyment
of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,
or accommodations" of the covered place. $ 12182(a). Of
course a court indiscriminately invoking the "sweeping" and
"expansive" purposes of the ADA, ante, at 675, 680, could
argue that when a place of public accommodation denied any
"individual," on the basis of his disability, anything that
might be called a "privileg[e]," the individual has a valid
Title III claim. Cf. ante, at 677. On such an interpretation,
the employees and independent contractors of every place of
public accommodation come within Title III: The employee
enjoys the "privilege" of employment, the contractor the
"privilege" of the contract.

For many reasons, Title III will not bear such an interpretation. The provision of Title III at issue here ($ 12182, its
principal provision) is a public-accommodation law, and it is
the traditional understanding of public-accommodation laws
that they provide rights for customers. "At common law,
innkeepers, smiths, and others who made profession of a public employment, were prohibited from refusing, without good
reason, to serve a customer." Hurley v. Irish-American
Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.

Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241(1964). This understanding is clearly reflected in the text of

Title III itself. Section 12181(7) lists 12 specific types ofentities that qualify as "public accommodations," with a
follow-on expansion that makes it clear what the "enjoymentof the goods, services, etc.," of those entities consists of--and
it plainly envisions that the person "enjoying" the "public
accommodation" will be a customer. For example, Title IIIis said to cover an "auditorium" or "other place of public

gathering," $ 12181(7)(D). Thus, "gathering" is the distinc-tive enjoyment derived from an auditorium; the persons
"gathering" at an auditorium are presumably covered by
Title III, but those contracting to clean the auditorium are
not. Title III is said to cover a "zoo" or "other place of recreation," $ 12181(7)(I). The persons "recreat[ing]" at a "zoo"
are presumably covered, but the animal handlers bringing
in the latest panda are not. The one place where Title III
specifically addresses discrimination by places of public accommodation through "contractual" arrangements, it makes
clear that discrimination against the other party to the contract is not covered, but only discrimination against "clients
or customers of the covered public accommodation that enters into the contractual, licensing or other arrangement."

$ 12182(b)(1)(A)(iv). And finally, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice reinforce the conclusion
that Title III's protections extend only to customers. "The
purpose of the ADA's public accommodations requirements,"
they say, "is to ensure accessibility to the goods offered by
a public accommodation." 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B,
p. 650 (2000). Surely this has nothing to do with employees
and independent contractors.

If there were any doubt left that $ 12182 covers only clients and customers of places of public accommodation, it is
eliminated by the fact that a contrary interpretation would
make a muddle of the ADA as a whole. The words of Title
III must be read "in their context and with a view to their

place in the overall statutory scheme." Davis v. Michigan
Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989). Congress expressly excluded employers of fewer than 15 employees fromTitle I. The mom-and-pop grocery store or laundromat need

not worry about altering the nonpublic areas of its place ofbusiness to accommodate handicapped employees--or about
the litigation that failure to do so will invite. Similarly,
since independent contractors are not covered by Title I, thesmall business (or the large one, for that matter) need not

worry about making special accommodations for the paint-ers, electricians, and other independent workers whose services are contracted for from time to time. It is an entirely
unreasonable interpretation of the statute to say that these
exemptions so carefully crafted in Title I are entirely eliminated by Title III (for the many businesses that are places of
public accommodation) because employees and independent
contractors "enjoy" the employment and contracting that
such places provide. The only distinctive feature of places
of public accommodation is that they accommodate the public, and Congress could have no conceivable reason for according the employees and independent contractors of such
businesses protections that employees and independent contractors of other businesses do not enjoy.

The United States apparently agrees that employee claims
are not cognizable under Title III, see Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 18-19, n. 17, but despite the implications of its own regulations, see 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36,
App. B, at 650, appears to believe (though it does not explicitly state) that claims of independent contractors are cognizable. In a discussion littered with entirely vague statements from the legislative history, cf. ante, at 674-675, the
United States argues that Congress presumably wanted independent contractors with private entities covered under
Title III because independent contractors with governmental entities are covered by Title II, see Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 18, and n. 17--a line of reasoning

that does not commend itself to the untutored intellect. But
since the United States does not provide (and I cannot conceive of) any possible construction of the terms of Title III
that will exclude employees while simultaneously covering
independent contractors, its concession regarding employees
effectively concedes independent contractors as well. Title
III applies only to customers.

The Court, for its part, assumes that conclusion for the
sake of argument, ante, at 679-680, but pronounces respondent to be a "customer" of the PGA TOUR or of the golf
courses on which it is played. That seems to me quite incredible. The PGA TOUR is a professional sporting event,
staged for the entertainment of a live and TV audience, the
receipts from whom (the TV audience's admission price is
paid by advertisers) pay the expenses of the tour, including
the cash prizes for the winning golfers. The professional
golfers on the tour are no more "enjoying" (the statutory
term) the entertainment that the tour provides, or the facilities of the golf courses on which it is held, than professional
baseball players "enjoy" the baseball games in which they
play or the facilities of Yankee Stadium. To be sure, professional ballplayers participate in the games, and use the ballfields, but no one in his right mind would think that they are
customers of the American League or of Yankee Stadium.
They are themselves the entertainment that the customers
pay to watch. And professional golfers are no different. It
makes not a bit of difference, insofar as their "customer"
status is concerned, that the remuneration for their performance (unlike most of the remuneration for ballplayers) is not
fixed but contingent--viz., the purses for the winners in the
various events, and the compensation from product endorsements that consistent winners are assured. The compensation of many independent contractors is contingent upon
their success--real estate brokers, for example, or insurance salesmen.

Scalia, J., dissenting
As the Court points out, the ADA specifically identifiesgolf courses as one of the covered places of public accommodation. See $ 12181(7)(L) ("a gymnasium, health spa,bowling alley, golf course, or other place of exercise or recreation"); and the distinctive "goo[d], servic[e], facilit[y], privi-leg[e], advantag[e], or accommodatio[n]" identified by that
provision as distinctive to that category of place of public accommodation is "exercise or recreation." Respondentdid not seek to "exercise" or "recreate" at the PGA TOUR

events; he sought to make money (which is why he is calleda

professional golfer). He was not a customer buying recreation or entertainment; he was a professional athlete sellingit. That is the reason (among others) the Court's reliance

upon Civil Rights Act cases like Daniel v. Paul, 395 U. S. 298(1969), see

ante, at 681, is misplaced. A professional golfer's
practicing his profession is not comparable to John Q. Pub-lic's frequenting "a 232-acre amusement area with swimming, boating, sun bathing, picnicking, miniature golf, danc-ing facilities, and a snack bar."

Daniel, supra, at 301.
The Court relies heavily upon the Q-School. It says that
petitioner offers the golfing public the "privilege" of "com-peting in the Q-School and playing in the tours; indeed, the

former is a privilege for which thousands of individuals fromthe general public pay, and the latter is one for which they
vie." Ante, at 677. But the Q-School is no more a "privi-lege" offered for the general public's "enjoyment" than is the
California Bar Exam.1 It is a competition for entry into the
PGA TOUR--an open tryout, no different in principle from
open casting for a movie or stage production, or walk-on try1 The California Bar Exam is covered by the ADA, by the way, because
a separate provision of Title III applies to "examinations . . . related to
applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or
post-secondary education, professional, or trade purposes." 42 U. S. C.

in the tryouts "customers," $ 12189 would have been unnecessary.

outs for other professional sports, such as baseball. See,e. g., Amateurs Join Pros for New Season of HBO's "Sopranos," Detroit News, Dec. 22, 2000, p. 2 (20,000 attend opencasting for "The Sopranos"); Bill Zack, Atlanta Braves,
Sporting News, Feb. 6, 1995 (1,300 would-be players at-tended an open tryout for the Atlanta Braves). It may well
be that some amateur golfers enjoy trying to make thegrade, just as some amateur actors may enjoy auditions, and
amateur baseball players may enjoy open tryouts (I hesitateto say that amateur lawyers may enjoy taking the California
Bar Exam). But the purpose of holding those tryouts is notto provide entertainment; it is to hire. At bottom, open tryouts for performances to be held at a place of public accom-modation are no different from open bidding on contracts to
cut the grass at a place of public accommodation, or openapplications for any job at a place of public accommodation.
Those bidding, those applying--and those trying out--arenot converted into customers. By the Court's reasoning, a
business exists not only to sell goods and services to thepublic, but to provide the "privilege" of employment to the
public; wherefore it follows, like night the day, that everyonewho seeks a job is a customer.

2 The Court suggests that respondent is not an independent contractor
because he "play[s] at [his] own pleasure," and is not subject to PGA
TOUR control "over [his] manner of performance," ante, at 680, n. 33.
But many independent contractors--composers of movie music, portrait
artists, script writers, and even (some would say) plumbers--retain at
least as much control over when and how they work as does respondent,
who agrees to play in a minimum of 15 of the designated PGA TOUR
events, and to play by the rules that the PGA TOUR specifies. Cf. Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730, 751-753 (1989)
(discussing independent contractor status of a sculptor). Moreover, although, as the Court suggests in the same footnote, in rare cases a PGA
TOUR winner will choose to forgo the prize money (in order, for example,
to preserve amateur status necessary for continuing participation in college play) he is contractually entitled to the prize money if he demands it,
which is all that a contractual relationship requires.

Scalia, J., dissenting

Having erroneously held that Title III applies to the "customers" of professional golf who consist of its practitioners,
the Court then erroneously answers--or to be accurate simply ignores--a second question. The ADA requires covered
businesses to make such reasonable modifications of "policies, practices, or procedures" as are necessary to "afford"
goods, services, and privileges to individuals with disabilities; but it explicitly does not require "modifications [that]
would fundamentally alter the nature" of the goods, services,
and privileges. $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). In other words, disabled individuals must be given access to the same goods,
services, and privileges that others enjoy. The regulations
state that Title III "does not require a public accommodation
to alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods
with accessibility features that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with disabilities." 28 CFR $ 36.307
(2000); see also 28 CFR, ch. 1, pt. 36, App. B, at 650. As one
Court of Appeals has explained:

"The common sense of the statute is that the content
of the goods or services offered by a place of public accommodation is not regulated. A camera store may not
refuse to sell cameras to a disabled person, but it is not
required to stock cameras specially designed for such
persons. Had Congress purposed to impose so enormous a burden on the retail sector of the economy and
so vast a supervisory responsibility on the federal
courts, we think it would have made its intention clearer
and would at least have imposed some standards. It
is hardly a feasible judicial function to decide whether
shoestores should sell single shoes to one-legged persons
and if so at what price, or how many Braille books the
Borders or Barnes and Noble bookstore chains should
stock in each of their stores." Doe v. Mutual of Omaha
Ins. Co., 179 F. 3d 557, 560 (CA7 1999).

Scalia, J., dissenting
Since this is so, even if respondent here is a consumer of the"privilege" of the PGA TOUR competition, see

ante, at 677,
I see no basis for considering whether the rules of that com-petition must be altered. It is as irrelevant to the PGA

TOUR's compliance with the statute whether walking is es-sential to the game of golf as it is to the shoe store's compliance whether "pairness" is essential to the nature of shoes.
If a shoe store wishes to sell shoes only in pairs it may; andif a golf tour (or a golf course) wishes to provide only walkaround golf, it may. The PGA TOUR cannot deny respond-ent

access to that game because of his disability, but it need
not provide him a game different (whether in its essentials
or in its details) from that offered to everyone else.

Since it has held (or assumed) professional golfers to be
customers "enjoying" the "privilege" that consists of PGA
TOUR golf; and since it inexplicably regards the rules of
PGA TOUR golf as merely "policies, practices, or procedures" by which access to PGA TOUR golf is provided, the
Court must then confront the question whether respondent's
requested modification of the supposed policy, practice, or
procedure of walking would "fundamentally alter the nature"
of the PGA TOUR game, $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). The Court
attacks this "fundamental alteration" analysis by asking
two questions: first, whether the "essence" or an "essential
aspect" of the sport of golf has been altered; and second,
whether the change, even if not essential to the game, would
give the disabled player an advantage over others and
thereby "fundamentally alter the character of the competition." Ante, at 683. It answers no to both.

Before considering the Court's answer to the first question, it is worth pointing out that the assumption which underlies that question is false. Nowhere is it writ that PGA
TOUR golf must be classic "essential" golf. Why cannot the
PGA TOUR, if it wishes, promote a new game, with distinctive rules (much as the American League promotes a game
of baseball in which the pitcher's turn at the plate can be

taken by a "designated hitter")? If members of the publicdo not like the new rules--if they feel that these rules do

not truly test the individual's skill at "real golf " (or theteam's skill at "real baseball") they can withdraw their patronage. But the rules are the rules. They are (as in allgames) entirely arbitrary, and there is no basis on which anyone--not even the Supreme Court of the United States--can
pronounce one or another of them to be "nonessential" if therulemaker (here the PGA TOUR) deems it to be essential.

If one assumes, however, that the PGA TOUR has somelegal obligation to play classic, Platonic golf--and if one assumes the correctness of all the other wrong turns the Court
has made to get to this point--then we Justices must confront what is indeed an awesome responsibility. It has been
rendered the solemn duty of the Supreme Court of the
United States, laid upon it by Congress in pursuance of the
Federal Government's power "[t]o regulate Commerce with
foreign Nations, and among the several States," U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, to decide What Is Golf. I am sure that the
Framers of the Constitution, aware of the 1457 edict of King
James II of Scotland prohibiting golf because it interfered
with the practice of archery, fully expected that sooner or
later the paths of golf and government, the law and the links,
would once again cross, and that the judges of this august
Court would some day have to wrestle with that age-old jurisprudential question, for which their years of study in the
law have so well prepared them: Is someone riding around a
golf course from shot to shot really a golfer? The answer,
we learn, is yes. The Court ultimately concludes, and it will
henceforth be the Law of the Land, that walking is not a
"fundamental" aspect of golf.

Either out of humility or out of self-respect (one or the
other) the Court should decline to answer this incredibly difficult and incredibly silly question. To say that something
is "essential" is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the
achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very

Scalia, J., dissenting
nature of a game to have no object except amusement (thatis what distinguishes games from productive activity), it is

quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rulesis "essential." Eighteen-hole golf courses, 10-foot-high basketball hoops, 90-foot baselines, 100-yard football fields--allare arbitrary and none is essential. The only support for
any of them is tradition and (in more modern times) insistence by what has come to be regarded as the ruling body ofthe sport--both of which factors support the PGA TOUR's

position in the present case. (Many, indeed, consider walk-ing to be

the central feature of the game of golf--hence Mark
Twain's classic criticism of the sport: "a good walk spoiled.")
I suppose there is some point at which the rules of a wellknown game are changed to such a degree that no reasonable
person would call it the same game. If the PGA TOUR
competitors were required to dribble a large, inflated ball
and put it through a round hoop, the game could no longer
reasonably be called golf. But this criterion--destroying
recognizability as the same generic game--is surely not the
test of "essentialness" or "fundamentalness" that the Court
applies, since it apparently thinks that merely changing the
diameter of the cup might "fundamentally alter" the game
of golf, ante, at 682.

Having concluded that dispensing with the walking rule
would not violate federal-Platonic "golf " (and, implicitly, that
it is federal-Platonic golf, and no other, that the PGA TOUR
can insist upon), the Court moves on to the second part of
its test: the competitive effects of waiving this nonessential
rule. In this part of its analysis, the Court first finds that
the effects of the change are "mitigated" by the fact that
in the game of golf weather, a "lucky bounce," and "pure
chance" provide different conditions for each competitor
and individual ability may not "be the sole determinant
of the outcome." Ante, at 687. I guess that is why those
who follow professional golfing consider Jack Nicklaus the
luckiest golfer of all time, only to be challenged of late by

Scalia, J., dissenting
the phenomenal luck of Tiger Woods. The Court's empiricism is unpersuasive. "Pure chance" is randomly distributed among the players, but allowing respondent to use a
cart gives him a "lucky" break every time he plays. Pure
chance also only matters at the margin--a stroke here or
there; the cart substantially improves this respondent's competitive prospects beyond a couple of strokes. But even
granting that there are significant nonhuman variables affecting competition, that fact does not justify adding another
variable that always favors one player.

In an apparent effort to make its opinion as narrow as
possible, the Court relies upon the District Court's finding
that even with a cart, respondent will be at least as fatigued
as everyone else. Ante, at 690. This, the Court says, proves
that competition will not be affected. Far from thinking
that reliance on this finding cabins the effect of today's opinion, I think it will prove to be its most expansive and destructive feature. Because step one of the Court's two-part
inquiry into whether a requested change in a sport will "fundamentally alter [its] nature," $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), consists of
an utterly unprincipled ontology of sports (pursuant to which
the Court is not even sure whether golf 's "essence" requires
a 3-inch hole), there is every reason to think that in future
cases involving requests for special treatment by would-be
athletes the second step of the analysis will be determinative. In resolving that second step--determining whether
waiver of the "nonessential" rule will have an impermissible
"competitive effect"--by measuring the athletic capacity of
the requesting individual, and asking whether the special
dispensation would do no more than place him on a par (so
to speak) with other competitors, the Court guarantees that
future cases of this sort will have to be decided on the basis
of individualized factual findings. Which means that future
cases of this sort will be numerous, and a rich source of lucrative litigation. One can envision the parents of a Little

the only thing that could prevent a court order giving the
kid four strikes would be a judicial determination that, in
baseball, three strikes are metaphysically necessary, which
is quite absurd.)

The statute, of course, provides no basis for this individualized analysis that is the Court's last step on a long and
misguided journey. The statute seeks to assure that a disabled person's disability will not deny him equal access to
(among other things) competitive sporting events--not that
his disability will not deny him an equal chance to win competitive sporting events. The latter is quite impossible,
since the very nature of competitive sport is the measurement, by uniform rules, of unevenly distributed excellence.
This unequal distribution is precisely what determines the
winners and losers--and artificially to "even out" that distribution, by giving one or another player exemption from a
rule that emphasizes his particular weakness, is to destroy
the game. That is why the "handicaps" that are customary
in social games of golf--which, by adding strokes to the
scores of the good players and subtracting them from scores
of the bad ones, "even out" the varying abilities--are not
used in professional golf. In the Court's world, there is one
set of rules that is "fair with respect to the able-bodied" but
"individualized" rules, mandated by the ADA, for "talented
but disabled athletes." Ante, at 691. The ADA mandates
no such ridiculous thing. Agility, strength, speed, balance,
quickness of mind, steadiness of nerves, intensity of concentration--these talents are not evenly distributed. No wildeyed dreamer has ever suggested that the managing bodies
of the competitive sports that test precisely these qualities
should try to take account of the uneven distribution of God532US3 Unit: $U57 [09-19-02 20:27:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

given gifts when writing and enforcing the rules of compe-tition. And I have no doubt Congress did not authorize

misty-eyed judicial supervision of such a revolution.

* * *
My belief that today's judgment is clearly in error shouldnot be mistaken for a belief that the PGA TOUR clearly

ought not allow respondent to use a golf cart. That is aclose question, on which even those who compete in the PGA
TOUR are apparently divided; but it is a different questionfrom the one before the Court. Just as it is a different question whether the Little League ought to give disabled young-sters a fourth strike, or some other waiver from the rules
that makes up for their disabilities. In both cases, whetherthey ought to do so depends upon (1) how central to the game
that they have organized (and over whose rules they are themaster) they deem the waived provision to be, and (2) how
competitive--how strict a test of raw athletic ability in allaspects of the competition--they want their game to be.
But whether Congress has said they must do so dependsupon the answers to the legal questions I have discussed
above--not upon what this Court sententiously decrees to be" `decent, tolerant, [and] progressive,' " ante, at 675 (quoting
Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356,375 (2001) (K

ennedy, J., concurring)).And it should not be assumed that today's decent, tolerant,

and progressive judgment will, in the long run, accrue to thebenefit of sports competitors with disabilities. Now that it
is clear courts will review the rules of sports for "fundamen-talness," organizations that value their autonomy have every
incentive to defend vigorously the necessity of every regula-tion. They may still be second-guessed in the end as to the
Platonic requirements of the sport, but they will assuredlylose if they have at all wavered in their enforcement. The
lesson the PGA TOUR and other sports organizations shouldtake from this case is to make sure that the same written

rules are set forth for all levels of play, and never voluntarilyto grant any modifications. The second lesson is to end open

tryouts. I doubt that, in the long run, even disabled athleteswill be well served by these incentives that the Court has
created.Complaints about this case are not "properly directed to
Congress," ante, at 689, n. 51. They are properly directedto this Court's Kafkaesque determination that professional
sports organizations, and the fields they rent for their exhibi-tions, are "places of public accommodation" to the competing
athletes, and the athletes themselves "customers" of the or-ganization that pays them; its Alice in Wonderland determination that there are such things as judicially determinable"essential" and "nonessential" rules of a made-up game; and
its Animal Farm determination that fairness and the ADAmean that everyone gets to play by individualized rules
which will assure that no one's lack of ability (or at least noone's lack of ability so pronounced that it amounts to a disability) will be a handicap. The year was 2001, and "every-body was finally equal." K. Vonnegut, Harrison Bergeron,

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v.KENTUCKY RIVER COMMUNITY

CARE, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 99-1815. Argued February 21, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
When co-respondent labor union petitioned the National Labor Relations

Board to represent a unit of employees at respondent's residential care
facility, respondent objected to the inclusion of its registered nurses
in the unit, arguing that they were "supervisors" under $ 2(11) of the
National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11), and hence excluded from the Act's protections. At the representation hearing, the
Board's Regional Director placed the burden of proving supervisory
status on respondent, found that respondent had not carried its burden,
and included the nurses in the unit. Thereafter, respondent refused to
bargain with the union, leading the Board's General Counsel to file an
unfair labor practice complaint. The Board granted the General Counsel summary judgment on the basis of the representation determination,
but the Sixth Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order. It rejected
the Board's interpretation of "independent judgment" in $ 2(11)'s test
for supervisory status, and held that the Board had erred in placing the
burden of proving supervisory status on respondent.

Held:

1. Respondent carries the burden of proving the nurses' supervisory
status in the representation hearing and unfair labor practice proceeding. The Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proving
or disproving supervisory status, but the Board has consistently placed
the burden on the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor.
That rule is both reasonable and consistent with the Act, which makes
supervisors an exception to the general class of employees. It is not
contrary to the requirement that the Board must prove the elements of
an unfair labor practice, because supervisory status is not an element
of the Board's refusal-to-bargain charge. The Board must prove that
the employer refused to bargain with the representative of a properly
certified unit; the unit was not properly certified only if respondent
successfully showed at the certification stage that some employees in
the unit were supervisors. Pp. 710-712.

2. The Board's test for determining supervisory status is inconsistent
with the Act. The Act deems employees to be "supervisors" if they

Syllabus
(1) exercise 1 of 12 listed supervisory functions, including "responsibly
direct[ing]" other employees, (2) use "independent judgment" in exercising their authority, and (3) hold their authority in the employer's
interest, $ 2(11). The Board rejected respondent's proof of supervisory
status on the ground that employees do not use "independent judgment"
under $ 2(11) when they exercise "ordinary professional or technical
judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in
accordance with employer-specified standards." Brief for Petitioner 11.
This interpretation, by distinguishing different kinds of judgment,
introduces a categorical exclusion into statutory text that does not
suggest its existence. The text permits questions regarding the degree
of discretion an employee exercises, but the Board's interpretation
renders determinative factors that have nothing to do with degree:
even a significant judgment only loosely constrained by the employer
will not be independent if it is "professional or technical." The Board
limits its categorical exclusion with a qualifier that is no less striking:
only professional judgment applied in directing less skilled employees
to deliver services is not "independent judgment." Hence, the exclusion would apply to only 1 of the listed supervisory functions--"responsibly to direct"--though all 12 require using independent judgment.
Contrary to the Board's contention, Congress did not incorporate the
Board's categorical restrictions on "independent judgment" when it
first added "supervisor" to the Act in 1947. The Board's policy concern regarding the proper balance of labor-management power cannot be given effect through this statutory text. Because this Court
may not enforce the Board's order by applying a legal standard the
Board did not adopt, NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 289-

290, the Board's error precludes the Court from enforcing its order.

Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. With him on thebrief were Louise S. Brock and Cheryl E. Bruner.*

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under the National Labor Relations Act, employees aredeemed to be "supervisors" and thereby excluded from the

protections of the Act if, inter alia, they exercise "inde-pendent judgment" in "responsibly . . . direct[ing]" other
employees "in the interest of the employer." 29 U. S. C.$ 152(11). This case presents two questions: which party
in an unfair-labor-practice proceeding bears the burden ofproving or disproving an employee's supervisory status;
and whether judgment is not "independent judgment" tothe extent that it is informed by professional or technical
training or experience. I

In Pippa Passes, Kentucky, respondent Kentucky RiverCommunity Care, Inc., operates a care facility for residents who suffer from mental retardation and mental illness.The facility, named the Caney Creek Developmental Complex (Caney Creek), employs approximately 110 professionaland nonprofessional employees in addition to roughly a dozen

union that is co-respondent here, supporting petitioner) peti-tioned the National Labor Relations Board to represent a

single unit of all 110 potentially eligible employees at CaneyCreek. See National Labor Relations Act (Act) $ 9(c), 49
Stat. 453, 29 U. S. C. $ 159(c).At the ensuing representation hearing, respondent objected to the inclusion of Caney Creek's six registered
nurses in the bargaining unit, arguing that they were "super-visors" under $ 2(11) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11), and

therefore excluded from the class of "employees" subject tothe Act's protection and includable in the bargaining unit.
See $ 2(3), 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3). The Board's Regional Director, to whom the Board has delegated its initial authority
to determine an appropriate bargaining unit, see $ 3(b), 29
U. S. C. $ 153(b); 29 CFR $ 101.21 (2000), placed the burden
of proving supervisory status on respondent, found that respondent had not carried its burden, and therefore included
the nurses in the bargaining unit. The Regional Director
accordingly directed an election to determine whether the
union would represent the unit. See $ 9(c)(1), 29 U. S. C.

$ 159(c)(1). The Board denied respondent's request for review of the Regional Director's decision and direction of
election, and the union won the election and was certified as
the representative of the Caney Creek employees.

Because direct judicial review of representation determinations is unavailable, AFL v. NLRB, 308 U. S. 401, 409-411
(1940), respondent sought indirect review by refusing to bargain with the union, thereby inducing the General Counsel
of the Board to file an unfair labor practice complaint under

$$ 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $$ 158(a)(1), (5).
The Board granted summary judgment to the General Counsel pursuant to regulations providing that, absent newly developed evidence, the propriety of a bargaining unit may
not be relitigated in an unfair labor practice hearing predicated on a challenge to the representation determination.

710 NLRB v. KENTUCKY RIVER COMMUNITY CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
NLRB, 401 U. S. 137, 139-141 (1971) (approving that prac-tice); Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. NLRB, 313 U. S. 146,

161-162 (1941) (same).Respondent petitioned for review of the Board's decision
in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,and the Board cross-petitioned. The Sixth Circuit granted
respondent's petition as it applied to the nurses and refusedto enforce the bargaining order. It held that the Board had
erred in placing the burden of proving supervisory statuson respondent rather than on its General Counsel, and it
rejected the Board's interpretation of "independent judg-ment," explaining that the Board had erred by classifying
"the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in ad-ministering patient care" as " `routine' [simply] because
the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by vir-tue of their training and expertise, not because of their
connection with `management.' " 193 F. 3d 444, 453 (1999).We granted the Board's petition for a writ of certiorari. 530
U. S. 1304 (2000). II

The Act expressly defines the term "supervisor" in $ 2(11),which provides:

"The term `supervisor' means any individual havingauthority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign,reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to
direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectivelyto recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merelyroutine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment." 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11).
The Act does not, however, expressly allocate the burdenof proving or disproving a challenged employee's supervisory status. The Board therefore has filled the statutorygap with the consistent rule that the burden is borne by

Opinion of the Court
the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor. Forexample, when the General Counsel seeks to attribute the

conduct of certain employees to the employer by virtueof their supervisory status, this rule dictates that he
bear the burden of proving supervisory status. See, e. g.,
Masterform Tool Co., 327 N. L. R. B. 1071, 1071-1072 (1999).
Or, when a union challenges certain ballots cast in a representation election on the basis that they were cast by super-visors, the union bears the burden. See,

e. g., Panaro and
Grimes, 321 N. L. R. B. 811, 812 (1996).The Board argues that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth

Circuit erred in not deferring to its resolution of the statutory ambiguity, and we agree. The Board's rule is supported by "the general rule of statutory construction that
the burden of proving justification or exemption under a
special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally
rests on one who claims its benefits." FTC v. Morton Salt
Co., 334 U. S. 37, 44-45 (1948). The Act's definition of "employee," $ 2(3), 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3), "reiterate[s] the breadth
of the ordinary dictionary definition" of that term, so that
it includes "any `person who works for another in return
for financial or other compensation.' " NLRB v. Town &
Country Elec., Inc., 516 U. S. 85, 90 (1995) (quoting American
Heritage Dictionary 604 (3d ed. 1992)). Supervisors would
fall within the class of employees, were they not expressly
excepted from it. See Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S.
883, 891 (1984); cf. Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U. S.
485 (1947). The burden of proving the applicability of the
supervisory exception, under Morton Salt, should thus fall
on the party asserting it. In addition, it is easier to prove
an employee's authority to exercise 1 of the 12 listed supervisory functions than to disprove an employee's authority
to exercise any of those functions, and practicality therefore
favors placing the burden on the party asserting supervisory
status. We find that the Board's rule for allocating the burden of proof is reasonable and consistent with the Act, and

Opinion of the Court
we therefore defer to it. NLRB v. Transportation Manage-ment Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 402-403 (1983).

Applying its rule to this case, the Board placed on re-spondent the duty to prove the supervisory status of its
nurses both in the $ 9(c) representation proceeding, whererespondent sought to exclude the nurses from the bargaining unit prior to the election, and in the unfair laborpractice hearing, where respondent defended against the

$ 8(a)(5) refusal-to-bargain charge. Respondent challengesthe application of the rule to the latter proceeding where,
it correctly observes and the Board does not dispute, "theGeneral Counsel carries the burden of proving the elements
of an unfair labor practice," id., at 401, which means thatit bears the burden of persuasion as well as of production,
see Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d); Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Green-wich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 276-278 (1994) (rejecting

statement to contrary in NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., supra, at 404, n. 7). Supervisory status, how-ever, is not an element of the Board's claim in this setting.

The Board must prove that the employer refused to bargainwith the representative of a unit of "employees," $ 8(a)(5),
29 U. S. C. $ 158(a)(5), that was properly certified; the unitwas not properly certified (as the respondent contends) only
if the respondent successfully demonstrated, at the cer-tification stage, that some employees in the unit were also
supervisors. In the unfair labor practice proceeding, there-fore, the burden remains on the employer to establish the
excepted status of these nurses. Insofar as the Court ofAppeals held otherwise, it erred. It remains to consider
whether the court's other holding that is challenged heresuffices to sustain its judgment.

III
The text of $ 2(11) of the Act that we quoted above,29 U. S. C. $ 152(11), sets forth a three-part test for deter532US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-02 06:51:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mining supervisory status. Employees are statutory super-visors if (1) they hold the authority to engage in any 1 of the

12 listed supervisory functions, (2) their "exercise of suchauthority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but
requires the use of independent judgment," and (3) theirauthority is held "in the interest of the employer."

NLRB
v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U. S.
571, 573-574 (1994). The only basis asserted by the Board,before the Court of Appeals and here, for rejecting respondent's proof of supervisory status with respect to di-recting patient care was the Board's interpretation of the
second part of the test--to wit, that employees do not use
"independent judgment" when they exercise "ordinary
professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled
employees to deliver services in accordance with employerspecified standards." Brief for Petitioner 11. The Court
of Appeals rejected that interpretation, and so do we.

Two aspects of the Board's interpretation are reasonable,
and hence controlling on this Court, see NLRB v. Town &
Country Elec., Inc., supra, at 89-90; Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,
842-844 (1984). First, it is certainly true that the statutory
term "independent judgment" is ambiguous with respect to
the degree of discretion required for supervisory status.
See NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America,
supra, at 579. Many nominally supervisory functions may
be performed without the "exercis[e of] such a degree of . . .
judgment or discretion . . . as would warrant a finding" of
supervisory status under the Act. Weyerhaeuser Timber
Co., 85 N. L. R. B. 1170, 1173 (1949). It falls clearly within
the Board's discretion to determine, within reason, what
scope of discretion qualifies. Second, as reflected in the
Board's phrase "in accordance with employer-specified standards," it is also undoubtedly true that the degree of judgment that might ordinarily be required to conduct a particular task may be reduced below the statutory threshold

714 NLRB v. KENTUCKY RIVER COMMUNITY CARE, INC.

Opinion of the Court
by detailed orders and regulations issued by the employer.So, for example, in Chevron Shipping Co., 317 N. L. R. B.

379, 381 (1995), the Board concluded that "although thecontested licensed officers are imbued with a great deal of
responsibility, their use of independent judgment and dis-cretion is circumscribed by the master's standing orders,
and the Operating Regulations, which require the watchofficer to contact a superior officer when anything unusual
occurs or when problems occur."The Board, however, argues further that the judgment
even of employees who are permitted by their employer to
exercise a sufficient degree of discretion is not "independentjudgment" if it is a particular

kind of judgment, namely,
"ordinary professional or technical judgment in directingless-skilled employees to deliver services." Brief for Petitioner 11. The first five words of this interpretation inserta startling categorical exclusion into statutory text that
does not suggest its existence. The text, by focusing on the"clerical" or "routine" (as opposed to "independent") nature
of the judgment, introduces the question of degree of judgment that we have agreed falls within the reasonable dis-cretion of the Board to resolve. But the Board's categorical

exclusion turns on factors that have nothing to do with thedegree of discretion an employee exercises. Cf.

Whitman v.
American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 481 (2001)("[T]he agency's interpretation goes beyond the limits of

what is ambiguous and contradicts what in our view is quiteclear"). Let the judgment be significant and only loosely
constrained by the employer; if it is "professional or tech-nical" it will nonetheless not be independent.

1 The breadth

1 The Board in its reply brief in this Court steps back from this interpretation and argues that it has only drawn distinctions between degrees
of authority. Reply Brief for Petitioner 3. But the opinions of the Board
that developed its current interpretation of "independent judgment"
clearly draw a categorical distinction. See, e. g., Providence Hospital,
320 N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996) ("Section 2(11) supervisory authority does

Opinion of the Court
of this exclusion is made all the more startling by virtueof the Board's extension of it to judgment based on greater

"experience" as well as formal training. See Reply Brieffor Petitioner 3 ("professional or technical skill or experience"). What supervisory judgment worth exercising, onemust wonder, does not rest on "professional or technical
skill or experience"? If the Board applied this aspect ofits test to every exercise of a supervisory function, it would
virtually eliminate "supervisors" from the Act. Cf. NLRBv.

Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672, 687 (1980) (Excluding "de-cisions . . . based on . . . professional expertise" would risk

"the indiscriminate recharacterization as covered employeesof professionals working in supervisory and managerial
capacities").As it happens, though, only one class of supervisors would
be eliminated in practice, because the Board limits its cate-gorical exclusion with a qualifier: Only professional judgment that is applied "in directing less-skilled employeesto deliver services" is excluded from the statutory category
of "independent judgment." Brief for Petitioner 11. Thissecond rule is no less striking than the first, and is directly
contrary to the text of the statute. Every supervisory func-tion listed by the Act is accompanied by the statutory requirement that its exercise "requir[e] the use of independentjudgment" before supervisory status will obtain, $ 152(11),
but the Board would apply its restriction upon "independentjudgment" to just 1 of the 12 listed functions: "responsibly

not include the authority of an employee to direct another to perform
discrete tasks stemming from the directing employee's experience,
skills, training, or position"). It is those opinions that were cited in the
Regional Director's opinion resolving the representation dispute, see App.
to Pet. for Cert. 52a-53a, which was accepted without further review by
the Board and was unreviewable in the unfair labor practice proceeding.
"We do not, of course, substitute counsel's post hoc rationale for the reasoning supplied by the Board itself." NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S.
672, 685, n. 22 (1980) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 196

Opinion of the Court
to direct." There is no apparent textual justification forthis asymmetrical limitation, and the Board has offered none.

Surely no conceptual justification can be found in the propo-sition that supervisors exercise professional, technical, or experienced judgment only when they direct other employees.Decisions "to hire, . . . suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, . . . or discipline" other employees, ibid., must often
depend upon that same judgment, which enables assessmentof the employee's proficiency in performing his job. See

NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., supra, at 686 ("[M]ost professionalsin managerial positions continue to draw on their special
skills and training"). Yet in no opinion that we were able
to discover has the Board held that a supervisor's judgment in hiring, disciplining, or promoting another employee
ceased to be "independent judgment" because it depended
upon the supervisor's professional or technical training or
experience. When an employee exercises one of these functions with judgment that possesses a sufficient degree of independence, the Board invariably finds supervisory status.
See, e. g., Trustees of Noble Hospital, 218 N. L. R. B. 1441,
1442 (1975).

The Board's refusal to apply its limiting interpretation of
"independent judgment" to any supervisory function other
than responsibly directing other employees is particularly
troubling because just seven years ago we rejected the
Board's interpretation of part three of the supervisory test
that similarly was applied only to the same supervisory
function. See NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp.
of America, 511 U. S. 571 (1994). In Health Care, the Board
argued that nurses did not exercise their authority "in the
interest of the employer," as $ 152(11) requires, when their
"independent judgment [was] exercised incidental to professional or technical judgment" instead of for "disciplinary
or other matters, i. e., in addition to treatment of patients."

sis was the supervisory function of responsible direction.
"Under $ 2(11)," we noted, "an employee who in the course
of employment uses independent judgment to engage in
1 of the 12 listed activities, including responsible direction
of other employees, is a supervisor. Under the Board's test,
however, a nurse who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in responsible direction of
other employees is not a supervisor." 511 U. S., at 578-579.
We therefore rejected the Board's analysis as "inconsistent
with . . . the statutory language," because it "rea[d] the responsible direction portion of $ 2(11) out of the statute in
nurse cases." Id., at 579-580. It is impossible to avoid the
conclusion that the Board's interpretation of "independent
judgment," applied to nurses for the first time after our decision in Health Care, has precisely the same object. This
interpretation of "independent judgment" is no less strained
than the interpretation of "in the interest of the employer"
that it has succeeded.2 Cf. Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U. S. 359, 374 (1998) (an agency that
announces one principle but applies another is not acting
rationally under the Act).

The Board contends, however, that Congress incorporated
the Board's categorical restrictions on "independent judgment" when it first added the term "supervisor" to the Act
in 1947. We think history shows the opposite. The Act as
originally passed by Congress in 1935 did not mention supervisors directly. It extended to "employees" the "right to
self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations,

concurring in part and dissenting in part), as the Board argued in NLRB
v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U. S. 571, 579 (1994),
that the strain is eased by the ambiguity of a different term in the statute,
"responsibly to direct." That argument is no more persuasive now than
when we rejected it in Health Care: "[A]mbiguity in one portion of a
statute does not give the Board license to distort other provisions of
the statute," ibid.

and it defined "employee" expansively (if circularly) to "in-clude any employee," $ 2(3). We therefore held that supervisors were protected by the Act. Packard Motor Car Co.v.

NLRB, 330 U. S. 485 (1947). Congress in response added
to the Act the exemption we had found lacking. The Labor
Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act) ex-pressly excluded "supervisors" from the definition of "employees" and thereby from the protections of the Act. $ 2(3),61 Stat. 137, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3) ("The term
`employee' . . . shall not include . . . any individual employed
as a supervisor"); Taft-Hartley Act $ 14(a), as amended,
29 U. S. C. $ 164(a) ("[N]o employer [covered by the Act]
shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as
supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either
national or local, relating to collective bargaining").

Well before the Taft-Hartley Act added the term "supervisor" to the Act, however, the Board had already been defining it, because while the Board agreed that supervisors
were protected by the 1935 Act, it also determined that they
should not be placed in the same bargaining unit as the
employees they oversaw. To distinguish the two groups,
the Board defined "supervisors" as employees who "supervise or direct the work of [other] employees . . . , and who
have authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline, or
otherwise effect changes in the status of such employees."
Douglas Aircraft Co., 50 N. L. R. B. 784, 787 (1943) (emphasis
added). The "and" bears emphasis because it was a true
conjunctive: The Board consistently held that employees
whose only supervisory function was directing the work
of other employees were not "supervisors" within its test.
For example, in Bunting Brass & Bronze Co., 58 N. L. R. B.
618, 620 (1944), the Board wrote: "We are of the opinion that,
while linemen do direct the work of [other] employees, they
do not exercise substantial supervisory authority within the

usual meaning of that term." See also, e. g., Duval Texas
Sulphur Co., 53 N. L. R. B. 1387, 1390-1391 (1943) ("As to
the chief electrician, motor mechanic, plant engineers, anddrillers, . . . [t]he fact that they work with helpers, and perforce direct and guide the work of their helpers, does not,of itself, elevate them to such supervisory rank that they
must be excluded from the broad production and maintenance unit").When the Taft-Hartley Act added the term "supervisor"

to the Act in 1947, it largely borrowed the Board's definitionof the term, with one notable exception: Whereas the Board
required a supervisor to direct the work of other employees
and perform another listed function, the Act permitted direction alone to suffice. "The term `supervisor' means any
individual having authority . . . to hire, transfer, suspend,
lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or
to adjust their grievances." Taft-Hartley Act $ 2(11), as
amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11) (emphasis added). Moreover,
the Act assuredly did not incorporate the Board's current
interpretation of the term "independent judgment" as
applied to the function of responsible direction, since the
Board had not yet developed that interpretation. It had
had no reason to do so, because it had limited the category of supervisors more directly, by requiring functions
in addition to responsible direction. It is the Act's alteration of precisely that aspect of the Board's jurisprudence that
has pushed the Board into a running struggle to limit the
impact of "responsibly to direct" on the number of employees
qualifying for supervisory status--presumably driven by the
policy concern that otherwise the proper balance of labormanagement power will be disrupted.

It is upon that policy concern that the Board ultimately
rests its defense of its interpretation of "independent judgment." In arguments that parallel those expressed by the
dissent in Health Care, see 511 U. S., at 588-590 (Gins532US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-02 06:51:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN

burg, J., dissenting), and which are adopted by Justice
Stevens in this case, see post, at 726-727, the Board contends that its interpretation is necessary to preserve the in-clusion of "professional employees" within the coverage of

the Act. See $ 2(12), 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12). Professional em-ployees by definition engage in work "involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment." $ 152(12)(a)(ii).
Therefore, the Board argues (enlisting dictum from our deci-sion in

NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S., at 690, and n. 30,
that was rejected in Health Care, see 511 U. S., at 581-582),if judgment of that sort makes one a supervisor under

$ 152(11), then Congress's intent to include professionals in
the Act will be frustrated, because "many professional employees (such as lawyers, doctors, and nurses) customarily
give judgment-based direction to the less-skilled employees
with whom they work," Brief for Petitioner 33. The problem with the argument is not the soundness of its labor policy
(the Board is entitled to judge that without our constant
second-guessing, see, e. g., NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 786 (1990)). It is that the policy
cannot be given effect through this statutory text. See
Health Care, supra, at 581 ("[T]here may be `some tension
between the Act's exclusion of [supervisory and] managerial
employees and its inclusion of professionals,' but we find
no authority for `suggesting that that tension can be resolved' by distorting the statutory language in the manner
proposed by the Board") (quoting NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ.,
supra, at 686). Perhaps the Board could offer a limiting
interpretation of the supervisory function of responsible
direction by distinguishing employees who direct the manner
of others' performance of discrete tasks from employees
who direct other employees, as $ 152(11) requires. Certain
of the Board's decisions appear to have drawn that distinction in the past, see, e. g., Providence Hospital, 320
N. L. R. B. 717, 729 (1996). We have no occasion to consider it here, however, because the Board has carefully

insisted that the proper interpretation of "responsibly todirect" is not at issue in this case, see Brief for Petitioner

21-22, n. 9; Reply Brief for Petitioner 7-8, n. 6.What is at issue is the Board's contention that the policy
of covering professional employees under the Act justifiesthe categorical exclusion of professional judgments from a
term, "independent judgment," that naturally includes them.And further, that it justifies limiting this categorical exclusion to the supervisory function of responsibly direct-ing other employees. These contentions contradict both
the text and structure of the statute, and they contradictas well the rule of

Health Care that the test for super-visory status applies no differently to professionals than

to other employees. 511 U. S., at 581. We therefore findthe Board's interpretation unlawful. See Allentown Mack
Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U. S., at 364 ("Courtsmust defer to the requirements imposed by the Board if
they are `rational and consistent with the Act,' and if theBoard's `explication is not inadequate, irrational or arbitrary' " (citations omitted)).

We may not enforce the Board's order by applying alegal standard the Board did not adopt,

precludes us from enforcing its order. Our decision inHealth Care, where the Board similarly had not asserted

that the Court of Appeals was correct to find the Board's
test inconsistent with the statute . . . suffices to resolve the
case." Health Care, supra, at 584. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and
dissenting in part.

In my opinion, the National Labor Relations Board correctly found that respondent, Kentucky River Community
Care, Inc., failed to prove that the six registered nurses employed at its facility in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, are "supervisors" within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act. While we are unanimous in holding that the Court of
Appeals set aside that finding based upon an incorrect allocation of the burden of proof, we disagree as to whether the
Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Board misinterpreted the provision of the NLRA excluding supervisors from the Act's coverage. Moreover, even if I agreed
with the majority's view that the Board's interpretation was
error, that error would not justify affirming the erroneous
decision of the Court of Appeals.

3 Our decision in Health Care cannot be distinguished, as Justice
Stevens suggests, see post, at 729, n. 10, on the ground that there we
found that the Court of Appeals had not erred in any respect. The basis
for remand to an agency is the agency's error on a point of law, not the
reviewing court's. (That the reviewing court erred is irrelevant in light
of "the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it
must be affirmed if the result is correct `although the lower court relied
upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason,' " SEC v. Chenery Corp.,
318 U. S. 80, 88 (1943) (quoting Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U. S. 238, 245
(1937)).) And in Health Care, as here, the Board erred in interpreting
the test for supervisory status.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

I
In the proceedings before the Board, respondent reliedheavily on the fact that two registered nurses (RNs) served

as "building supervisors" on weekends, and on the secondand third shifts. However, as the Regional Director who
considered the evidence noted, the RNs received no extracompensation for serving as building supervisors and did
not have keys to the facility. Instead, the only additionalresponsibility shouldered by the RNs when serving as building supervisors was that of contacting other employees ifa shift was not fully staffed according to preestablished
ratios not set by the RNs. However, the RNs had no au-thority to compel an employee to stay on duty or to come to
work to fill a vacancy under threat of discipline.With respect to the RNs' regular duties, while they might
"occasionally request other employees to perform routinetasks," they had no "authority to take any action if the employee refuse[d] their directives." 1 App. to Pet. for Cert.51a. In their routine work, they had no "authority to hire,
fire, reward, promote or independently discipline employeesor to effectively recommend such action. They did not evaluate employees or take any action which would affect theiremployment status."

Id., at 52a. Indeed, the RNs, evenwhen serving as "building supervisors," for the most part

"work[ed] independently and by themselves without anysubordinates."

Ibid.
Based on his evaluation of the evidence, the NLRB's Re-gional Director applied "the same test to registered nurses

as is applicable to all other individuals in determining super-visory status."

Ibid. Under that test, he concluded that
"only supervisory personnel vested with `genuine manage-ment prerogatives' should be considered supervisors, and

not `straw bosses, leadmen, set-up men and other minor

Cert. 54a.Over the dissent of Judge Jones, the Court of Appeals
set aside the Board's order. The panel majority first criti-cized the Board for ignoring its "repeated admonition"
that the NLRB " `has the burden of proving that employeesare not supervisors.' "

Id., at 15a. After acknowledgingthat "whether an employee is a supervisor is a highly factintensive inquiry," that majority concluded that the RNs'duties as building supervisors involved "independent judgment which is not limited to, or inherent in, the professionaltraining of nurses." Id., at 16a-19a. The panel majority
also criticized the NLRB for interpreting the admittedlyambiguous statutory term "independent judgment" inconsistently with Sixth Circuit precedent.2

II
Although it is not necessary to do so to overturn the Courtof Appeals' decision, the NLRB has asked us to reject the

Sixth Circuit's interpretation of the term "independentjudgment." In contrast to the Sixth Circuit, the NLRB
interprets the term "independent judgment" as not includ-ing the exercise of ordinary professional or technical judgment in directing less-skilled employees to deliver servicesin accordance with employer-specified standards.

3 Provi2 "According to NLRB interpretations, the practice of a nurse supervising a nurse's aide in administering patient care, for example, does not
involve `independent judgment.' The NLRB classifies these activities as
`routine' because the nurses have the ability to direct patient care by
virtue of their training and expertise, not because of their connection
with `management.' " Id., at 17a.

N. L. R. B., at 1053. Applying that interpretation, the
NLRB has concluded that in some cases the employees in
question are supervisors, and that in others they are not.4
See Brief for Petitioner 17-19, nn. 5-7 (collecting cases); see
also Brief for Respondent Kentucky State District Council
of Carpenters 36, n. 16 (collecting cases).

The question before us is whether the Board's interpretation is both "rational and consistent with the Act." 5 NLRB
v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 796 (1990);
see Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U. S.
27, 42 (1987). To my mind, the Board's test is both fully
rational and entirely consistent with the Act.

The term "independent judgment" is indisputably ambiguous, and it is settled law that the NLRB's interpretation

doing, it ignores a key nuance in the NLRB's position. That, however,
is characteristic of the majority's treatment of the NLRB's position,
which is at once more fact specific and far less categorical than the majority makes it out to be.

4 The majority, however, pays scant heed to the adjudicative record

when it asserts that the Board's interpretation would in essence eliminate the supervisory exception with respect to the "responsibly to direct"
function. See ante, at 714-715.

5 "[I]n many . . . contexts of labor policy, `[t]he ultimate problem is

the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of

of ambiguous language in the National Labor Relations Act
is entitled to deference.6 See NLRB v. Health Care and
Retirement Corporation, 511 U. S. 571, 579 (1994) (HCR);
Auciello Iron Works, Inc. v. NLRB, 517 U. S. 781, 787-788
(1996); Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S., at 786-
787. Such deference is particularly appropriate when the
statutory ambiguity is compounded by the use of one ambiguous term--"independent judgment"--to modify another,
equally ambiguous term--namely, "responsibly to direct."

Moreover, since Congress has expressly provided that professional employees are entitled to the protection of the Act,
there is good reason to resolve the ambiguities consistently
with the Board's interpretation. At the same time that
Congress acted to exclude supervisors from the NLRA's
protection, it explicitly extended those same protections
to professionals, who, by definition, engage in work that
involves "the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment
in its performance." 7 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12)(a)(ii). As this
Court has acknowledged, the inclusion of professional employees and the exclusion of supervisors necessarily gives
rise to some tension in the statutory text. Cf. NLRB v.
Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672, 686 (1980). Accordingly, if the
term "supervisor" is construed too broadly, without regard
for the statutory context, then Congress' inclusion of profes6 The majority suggests that the Board's interpretation of the term
"independent judgment" is particularly problematic in light of this Court's
decision in NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511
U. S. 571 (1994) (HCR). But in HCR, this Court concluded that the terms
"independent judgment" and "responsibly to direct" were ambiguous,
while the term at issue in that case, "in the interest of the employer,"
was not. Id., at 579.

sionals within the Act's protections is effectively nullified.8
See HCR, 511 U. S., at 585 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). In
my opinion, the Court's approach does precisely what it accuses the Board of doing--namely, reading one part of the
statute to the exclusion of the other.

The Court acknowledges today that deference is appropriate when the Board determines both the degree of discretion required for supervisory status as well as the significance of limitations on the alleged supervisor's discretion
imposed by the employer. Thus, in a case like this, a court
should not second-guess the Board's evaluation of the authority of the nurses as building supervisors, or of the significance of the employer's definition of that authority.

However, in a tour de force supported by little more than
ipse dixit, the Court concludes that no deference is due the
Board's evaluation of the "kind of judgment" that professional employees exercise. Ante, at 714 (emphasis deleted). Thus, under the Court's view, it is impermissible for
the Board to attach a different weight to a nurse's judgment
that an employee should be reassigned or disciplined than to
a nurse's judgment that the employee should take a patient's
temperature, even if nurses routinely instruct others to take
a patient's temperature but do not ordinarily reassign or discipline employees. The Court's approach finds no support
in the text of the statute, and is inconsistent with our case
law. See, e. g., Yeshiva, 444 U. S., at 690 ("Only if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of the duties routinely

8 Moreover, so broad a reading seems contrary to congressional intent
in enacting the supervisory exception. Rather, the definition of "supervisor" was intended to apply only to those employees with "genuine management prerogatives" so that those employees excluded from the Act's
coverage would be "truly supervisory." S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st

performed by similarly situated professionals will he befound aligned with management").

The Court further argues that the Board errs by notapplying its limiting interpretation of the term "independent

judgment" to all 12 functions identified by the statute assupervisory in nature.

Ante, at 715-716. But of those 12,
it is only "responsibly to direct" that is ambiguous and thus
capable of swallowing the whole if not narrowly construed.The authority to "promote" or to "discharge," to use only

two examples, is specific and readily identifiable. In con-trast, the authority "responsibly to direct" is far more vague.
Thus, it is only logical for the term "independent judgment"to take on different contours depending on the nature of the
supervisory function at issue and its comparative ambiguity.Simply put, these are quintessential examples of terms
that the expert agency should be allowed to interpret in thelight of the policies animating the statute. See,

e. g., Curtin
Matheson, 494 U. S., at 786; Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984).
Because the Board's interpretation is fully consistent both
with the statutory text and with the policy favoring collec-tive bargaining by professional employees, this Court is obligated to uphold it. III

Even if I shared the majority's view that the term "in-dependent judgment" should be given the same meaning
when applied to each of the 12 supervisory functions andwhen applied to professional and nonprofessional employees,
I would not simply affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals. Cf.

NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 289-
290 (1974); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 87-88 (1943).The Court's rejection of the Board's interpretation of the

Opinion of Stevens, J.
term "independent judgment" does not justify a categorical
affirmance of the Sixth Circuit's decision, which rests in part
on an erroneous allocation of the burden of proof.10

In any case, I do not agree with the majority's view.
Given the Regional Director's findings that the RNs' duties
as building supervisors do not qualify them as "supervisors"
within the meaning of 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11), and that they,
" `for the most part, work independently and by themselves
without any subordinates,' " it is absolutely clear that the
nurses in question are covered by the NLRA.11 193 F. 3d
444, 457 (CA6 1999). The Court's willingness to treat them
as supervisors even if they have no subordinates 12 is particularly ironic when compared to the Board's undisturbed
decision to deny supervisory status to the other group of
professionals employed by respondent--namely, the 20 rehabilitation counselors who supervise the work of 40 rehabilitation assistants.

10 Even under the Court's approach, since the NLRB might well prevail
under the correct allocation of the burden of proof, the appropriate course
of action in this case would be to return the case to the NLRB for further
proceedings. See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 295 (1974);
see also Electrical Workers v. NLRB, 366 U. S. 667 (1961); Ford Motor Co.
v. NLRB, 305 U. S. 364 (1939). HCR, on which the majority relies, see
ante, at 721-722, is not to the contrary. In that case, unlike in this one,
we found no error in the lower court's decision. Here, however, the lower
court erred in its allocation of the burden of proof, a fact which would
seem to make a remand to the NLRB in order to apply what the majority
deems to be the correct legal principle particularly appropriate.

11 Nor do the RNs exercise any of the other supervisorial functions

listed in $ 152(11). They play no role in assigning staff to shifts on a
permanent basis or in setting the staff-to-resident ratio. App. 18-19,
23-24. As noted above, the RNs, whether functioning in their ordinary
capacity or as "building supervisors," do not have authority to hire, fire,

BOOTH v. CHURNER et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 99-1964. Argued March 20, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 amended 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a),

which now requires a prisoner to exhaust "such administrative remedies
as are available" before suing over prison conditions. Petitioner Booth
was a Pennsylvania state prison inmate when he began this 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 action in Federal District Court, claiming that respondent corrections officers violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from
cruel and unusual punishment by assaulting him, using excessive force
against him, and denying him medical attention to treat ensuing injuries. He sought various forms of injunctive relief and money damages.
At the time, Pennsylvania provided an administrative grievance and appeals system, which addressed Booth's complaints but had no provision for recovery of money damages. Before resorting to federal court,
Booth filed an administrative grievance, but did not seek administrative
review after the prison authority denied relief. Booth's failure to appeal administratively led the District Court to dismiss the complaint
without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under

$ 1997e(a). The Third Circuit affirmed, rejecting Booth's argument that
the exhaustion requirement is inapposite to his case because the administrative process could not award him the monetary relief he sought
(money then being the only relief still requested).

Held: Under 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a), an inmate seeking only money damages must complete any prison administrative process capable of addressing the inmate's complaint and providing some form of relief,
even if the process does not make specific provision for monetary relief.
The meaning of the phrase "administrative remedies . . . available" is
the crux of the case. Neither the practical considerations urged by the
parties nor their reliance on the dictionary meanings of the words "remedies" and "available" are conclusive in seeking congressional intent.
Clearer clues are found in two considerations. First, the broader statutory context in which Congress referred to "available" "remedies" indicates that exhaustion is required regardless of the relief offered
through administrative procedures. While the modifier "available" requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of, the
word "exhausted" has a decidedly procedural emphasis. It makes no
sense, for instance, to demand that someone exhaust "such adminis532US3 Unit: $U59 [09-06-02 18:48:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
732 BOOTH v. CHURNER

Syllabus
trative [redress]" as is available; one "exhausts" processes, not forms
of relief, and the statute provides that one must. Second, statutory
history confirms the suggestion that Congress meant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between a prisoner's prayer for
relief and the administrative remedies possible. Before $ 1997e(a) was
amended by the 1995 Act, a court had discretion (though no obligation)
to require a state inmate to exhaust "such . . . remedies as are available,"
but only if they were "plain, speedy, and effective." That scheme is
now a thing of the past, for the amendments eliminated both the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition
that the remedy be "plain, speedy, and effective" before exhaustion
could be required. The significance of deleting that condition is apparent in light of McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140. In holding
that the preamended version of $ 1997e(a) did not require exhaustion
by those seeking only money damages when money was unavailable at
the administrative level, id., at 149-151, the McCarthy Court reasoned
in part that only a procedure able to provide money damages would
be "effective" within the statute's meaning, id., at 150. It has to be
significant that Congress removed the very term, "effective," the McCarthy Court had previously emphasized in reaching the result Booth
now seeks, and the fair inference to be drawn is that Congress meant
to preclude the McCarthy result. Congress's imposition of an obviously
broader exhaustion requirement makes it highly implausible that it
meant to give prisoners a strong inducement to skip the administrative
process simply by limiting prayers for relief to money damages not
offered through administrative grievance mechanisms. Pp. 736-741.

Opinion of the Court
"such administrative remedies as are available" before suingover prison conditions. The question is whether an inmate

seeking only money damages must complete a prison admin-istrative process that could provide some sort of relief on the
complaint stated, but no money. We hold that he must.

I
Petitioner, Timothy Booth, was an inmate at the StateCorrectional Institution at Smithfield, Pennsylvania, when

he began this action under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.$ 1983, in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania. He claimed that respondent cor-rections officers at Smithfield violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishmentby assaulting him, bruising his wrists in tightening and
twisting handcuffs placed upon him, throwing cleaning mate-rial in his face, and denying him medical attention to treat
ensuing injuries. Booth sought various forms of injunctiverelief, including transfer to another prison, as well as several
hundred thousand dollars in money damages.The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections provided an
administrative grievance system at the time. It called for awritten charge within 15 days of an event prompting an inmate's complaint, which was referred to a grievance officerfor investigation and resolution. If any action taken or recommended was unsatisfactory to the inmate, he could appealto an intermediate reviewing authority, with the possibility
of a further and final appeal to a central review committee.App. 46-50. While the grievance system addressed complaints of the abuse and excessive force Booth alleged, it hadno provision for recovery of money damages.

1

Before resorting to federal court, Booth filed an admin-istrative grievance charging at least some of the acts of

awards of money. App. 60.

Opinion of the Court
abuse he later alleged in his action. Id., at 10-14. He didnot, however, go beyond the first step, and never sought

intermediate or final administrative review after the prisonauthority denied relief.

Booth's failure to avail himself of the later stages of theadministrative process led the District Court to dismiss
the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust "administrative remedies . . . available" within the meaningof 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V). See App. to Pet.

for Cert. 38a. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitaffirmed, 206 F. 3d 289 (2000), rejecting Booth's argument
that the statutory exhaustion requirement is inapposite tohis case simply because the Commonwealth's administrative
process could not award him the monetary relief he sought(money then being the only relief still requested, since
Booth's transfer to another institution had mooted his claimsfor injunctive orders).

2 Although the Third Circuit acknowledged that several other Courts of Appeals had heldthe exhaustion requirement subject to exception when the

internal grievance procedure could not provide an inmateplaintiff with the purely monetary relief requested in his fed-eral action, see,

e. g., Whitley v. Hunt, 158 F. 3d 882 (CA5
1998); Lunsford v. Jumao-As, 155 F. 3d 1178 (CA9 1998);
Garrett v. Hawk, 127 F. 3d 1263 (CA10 1997), the court found
no such exception in the statute, 206 F. 3d, at 299-300; ac-cord,

Freeman v. Francis, 196 F. 3d 641 (CA6 1999); Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F. 3d 1321 (CA11 1998). We granted certiorari to address this conflict among the Circuits, 531 U. S.
956 (2000), and we now affirm.

2 There is some uncertainty, probably stemming in part from the ambiguity of Booth's pro se filings in District Court, as to whether all of
Booth's claims for relief other than money damages became moot when he
was transferred. See Brief for Petitioner 12, n. 7; Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 10, n. 2. We assume for present purposes that only
Booth's claims for money damages remain.

736 BOOTH v. CHURNER

Opinion of the Court

II
In the aftermath of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of1995,

3 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides that

"[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prisonconditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other

Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative
remedies as are available are exhausted."
The meaning of the phrase "administrative remedies . . .available" is the crux of the case, and up to a point the

parties approach it with agreement. Neither of them de-nies that some redress for a wrong is presupposed by the
statute's requirement of an "available" "remed[y]"; neitherargues that exhaustion is required where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any reliefor to take any action whatsoever in response to a complaint.

4

The dispute here, then, comes down to whether or not a re-medial scheme is "available" where, as in Pennsylvania, the

administrative process has authority to take some action inresponse to a complaint, but not the remedial action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.In seeking the congressional intent, the parties urge us to
give weight to practical considerations, among others, andat first glance Booth's position holds some intuitive appeal.
Although requiring an inmate to exhaust prison grievanceprocedures will probably obviate some litigation when the
administrative tribunal can award at least some of the reliefsought, Booth argues that when the prison's process simply
cannot satisfy the inmate's sole demand, the odds of keeping

3 110 Stat. 1321, as renumbered and amended.
4 Without the possibility of some relief, the administrative officers would

presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust. The parties do not dispute that
the state grievance system at issue in this case has authority to take some
responsive action with respect to the type of allegations Booth raises.

Opinion of the Court
the matter out of court are slim. See Reply Brief for Peti-tioner 16. The prisoner would be clearly burdened, while

the government would obtain little or no value in return.The respondents, however, also have something to say.
They argue that requiring exhaustion in these circumstanceswould produce administrative results that would satisfy at
least some inmates who start out asking for nothing but
money, since the very fact of being heard and prompting ad-ministrative change can mollify passions even when nothing

ends up in the pocket. And one may suppose that the ad-ministrative process itself would filter out some frivolous
claims and foster better-prepared litigation once a dispute
did move to the courtroom, even absent formal factfinding.
Although we have not accorded much weight to these possibilities in the past, see McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U. S.
140, 155-156 (1992), Congress, as we explain below, may well
have thought we were shortsighted. See infra, at 739-741.
In any event, the practical arguments for exhaustion at least
suffice to refute Booth's claim that no policy considerations
justify respondents' position. The upshot is that pragmatism is inconclusive.

Each of the parties also says that the plain meaning of
the words "remedies" and "available" in the phrase "such
administrative remedies . . . available" is controlling. But
as it turns out both of them quote some of the same dictionary definitions of "available" "remedies," and neither comes
up with anything conclusive. Booth says the term "remedy"
means a procedure that provides redress for wrong or enforcement of a right, and "available" means having sufficient
power to achieve an end sought. See Brief for Petitioner
15-16 (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary
150, 1920 (1993) (defining "remedy" as "the legal means to
recover a right or to prevent or obtain redress for a wrong "
and "available" as "having sufficient power or force to
achieve an end," "capable of use for the accomplishment
of a purpose," and that which "is accessible or may be ob532US3 Unit: $U59 [09-06-02 18:48:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tained")). So far so good, but Booth then claims to be ableto infer with particularity that when a prisoner demands

money damages as the sole means to compensate his injuries,a grievance system without that relief offers no "available"
"remed[y]." The general definitions, however, just do notentail such a specific conclusion.

It strikes us that the same definitions get the respondent corrections officers and their amicus the United Statescloser to firm ground for their assertion that the phrase

"such administrative remedies as are available" naturallyrequires a prisoner to exhaust the grievance procedures
offered, whether or not the possible responses cover the
specific relief the prisoner demands. See Brief for Respondents 21. The United States tracks Booth in citing Webster's
Third New International Dictionary to define "remedy" as
"the legal means to recover a right or to prevent or obtain
redress for a wrong" and "available" as "capable of use for
the accomplishment of a purpose." Webster's Third New
International Dictionary, supra, at 150, 1920. But this exercise in isolated definition is ultimately inconclusive, for,
depending on where one looks, "remedy" can mean either
specific relief obtainable at the end of a process of seeking
redress, or the process itself, the procedural avenue leading
to some relief. See Black's Law Dictionary 1296 (7th ed.
1999) (defining "remedy" alternatively as "[t]he means of
enforcing a right or preventing or redressing a wrong," or
as "remedial action. . . . Cf. relief ").

We find clearer pointers toward the congressional objective in two considerations, the first being the broader statutory context in which "available" "remedies" are mentioned.
The entire modifying clause in which the words occur is
this: "until such administrative remedies as are available
are exhausted." The "available" "remed[y]" must be "exhausted" before a complaint under $ 1983 may be entertained. While the modifier "available" requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of (as the

532US3 Unit: $U59 [09-06-02 18:48:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

739Cite as: 532 U. S. 731 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
parties agree), the word "exhausted" has a decidedly proce-dural emphasis. It makes sense only in referring to the procedural means, not the particular relief ordered. It would,for example, be very strange usage to say that a prisoner
must "exhaust" an administrative order reassigning an abu-sive guard before a prisoner could go to court and ask for
something else; or to say (in States that award money damages administratively) that a prisoner must "exhaust" hisdamages award before going to court for more. How would

he "exhaust" a transfer of personnel? Would he have tospend the money to "exhaust" the monetary relief given
him? It makes no sense to demand that someone exhaust
"such administrative [redress]" as is available; one "exhausts" processes, not forms of relief, and the statute provides that one must.

A second consideration, statutory history, confirms the
suggestion that Congress meant to require procedural exhaustion regardless of the fit between a prisoner's prayer
for relief and the administrative remedies possible. Before

$ 1997e(a) was amended by the Act of 1995, a court had
discretion (though no obligation) to require a state inmate
to exhaust "such . . . remedies as are available," but only
if those remedies were "plain, speedy, and effective." 42
U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (1994 ed.). That scheme, however, is now
a thing of the past, for the amendments eliminated both
the discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion
and the condition that the remedy be "plain, speedy, and
effective" before exhaustion could be required.

The significance of deleting that condition is apparent
in light of our decision two years earlier in McCarthy v.
Madigan, supra. In McCarthy, a federal inmate, much like
Booth, sought only money damages against federal prison
officials, and the Bureau of Prison's administrative procedure
offered no such relief. Although $ 1997e(a) did not at that
time apply to suits brought against federal officials, the government argued that the Court should create an analogous

Opinion of the Court
exhaustion requirement for Bivens actions. See Bivens v.Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).

It proposed $ 1997e(a) as a model, on the assumption that theprovision required exhaustion by those seeking nothing but
money damages even when money was unavailable at theadministrative level. We understood the effect of $ 1997e(a)
to be quite different, however. See 503 U. S., at 149-151.In holding that exhaustion was not required, we reasoned in
part from the language of $ 1997e(a) that required an "effec-tive" administrative remedy as a precondition to exhaustion.
Id., at 150. When a prisoner sought only money damages,we indicated, only a procedure able to provide money damages would be "effective" within the meaning of the statute.
Ibid. ("[I]n contrast to the absence of any provision forthe award of money damages under the Bureau's general

grievance procedure, the statute conditions exhaustion onthe existence of `effective administrative remedies' "); see
also id., at 156 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by Scalia and
Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment) ("[I]n cases . . . whereprisoners seek monetary relief, the Bureau's administrative

remedy furnishes no effective remedy").When Congress replaced the text of the statute as construed in McCarthy with the exhaustion requirement atissue today, it presumably understood that under McCarthy
the term "effective" in the former $ 1997e(a) eliminatedthe possibility of requiring exhaustion of administrative
remedies when an inmate sought only monetary relief andthe administrative process offered none. It has to be significant that Congress removed the very term we had pre-viously emphasized in reaching the result Booth now seeks,
and the fair inference to be drawn is that Congress meantto preclude the

McCarthy result.5 Congress's imposition

5 This inference is, to say the least, also consistent with Congress's elimination of the requirement that administrative procedures must satisfy
certain "minimum acceptable standards" of fairness and effectiveness
before inmates can be required to exhaust them, and the elimination of

Opinion of the Court
of an obviously broader exhaustion requirement makes ithighly implausible that it meant to give prisoners a strong

inducement to skip the administrative process simply bylimiting prayers for relief to money damages not offered
through administrative grievance mechanisms.Thus, we think that Congress has mandated exhaustion clearly enough, regardless of the relief offered throughadministrative procedures.

("Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaustion is re-quired"). We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Third

Circuit.

It is so ordered.

courts' discretion to excuse exhaustion when it would not be "appropriate
and in the interests of justice." Compare 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) with 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e(a) (1994 ed.).

6 That Congress has mandated exhaustion in either case defeats the

argument of Booth and supporting amici that this reading of $ 1997e
(1994 ed., Supp. V) is at odds with traditional doctrines of administrative
exhaustion, under which a litigant need not apply to an agency that has
"no power to decree . . . relief," Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S. 258, 269 (1993),
or need not exhaust where doing so would otherwise be futile. See Brief
for Petitioner 24-27; Brief for Brennan Center for Justice et al. as Amici
Curiae. Without getting into the force of this claim generally, we stress
the point (which Booth acknowledges, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4)
that we will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion
requirements where Congress has provided otherwise. See McCarthy
v. Madigan, 503 U. S. 140, 144 (1992); cf. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S.
749, 766-767 (1975). Here, we hold only that Congress has provided in

$ 1997e(a) that an inmate must exhaust irrespective of the forms of relief
sought and offered through administrative avenues.

NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINE
on motion to dismiss complaint
No. 130, Orig. Argued April 16, 2001--Decided May 29, 2001
New Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs from northwest to

southeast. At the border's southeastern end, New Hampshire's easternmost point meets Maine's southernmost point. The boundary in
this region follows the Piscataqua River eastward into Portsmouth
Harbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly direction into the
sea. In 1977, in a dispute between the two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entered a consent judgment setting the precise
location of the States' "lateral marine boundary," i. e., the boundary in
the marine waters off the coast, from the closing line of Portsmouth
Harbor five miles seaward. New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S. 363;
New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S. 1, 2. The Piscataqua River boundary was fixed by a 1740 decree of King George II at the "Middle of the
River." See 426 U. S., at 366-367. In the course of litigation, the two
States proposed a consent decree in which they agreed, inter alia,
that the descriptive words "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree
refer to the middle of the Piscataqua River's main navigable channel.
Rejecting the Special Master's view that the quoted words mean the
geographic middle of the river, this Court accepted the States' interpretation and directed entry of the consent decree. Id., at 369-370.
The final decree, entered in 1977, defined "Middle of the River" as
"the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River."
434 U. S., at 2. The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marine
boundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary. In 2000, New
Hampshire brought this original action against Maine, claiming on the
basis of historical records that the inland river boundary runs along
the Maine shore and that the entire Piscataqua River and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire. Maine has filed a motion
to dismiss, urging that the earlier proceedings bar New Hampshire's
complaint.

Held: Judicial estoppel bars New Hampshire from asserting that the

Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore. Pp. 749-756.

(a) Judicial estoppel is a doctrine distinct from the res judicata doctrines of claim and issue preclusion. Under the judicial estoppel doctrine, where a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding,
and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply
because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, espe532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

743Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)
Syllabus
cially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the
position formerly taken by him. Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 680, 689.
The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial
process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions
according to the exigencies of the moment. Courts have recognized
that the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately
be invoked are not reducible to any general formulation. Nevertheless,
several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's later position must be clearly
inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire
whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that
party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent
position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either
the first or the second court was misled. Third, courts ask whether the
party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair
advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not
estopped. In enumerating these factors, this Court does not establish
inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the
applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform
the doctrine's application in specific factual contexts. Pp. 749-751.

(b) Considerations of equity persuade the Court that application of
judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. New Hampshire's claim
that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is
clearly inconsistent with its interpretation of the words "Middle of
the River" during the 1970's litigation to mean either the middle of the
main navigable channel or the geographic middle of the river. Either
construction located the "Middle of the River" somewhere other than
the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River. Moreover, the record of the
1970's dispute makes clear that this Court accepted New Hampshire's
agreement with Maine that "Middle of the River" means middle of
the main navigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from
that interpretation. Notably, in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that
the proposed judgment was "in the best interest of each State." Were
the Court to accept New Hampshire's latest view, the risk of inconsistent court determinations would become a reality. The Court cannot
interpret "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree to mean two different
things along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity
of the judicial process. Pp. 751-752.

(c) The Court rejects various arguments made by New Hampshire.
The State urged at oral argument that the 1977 consent decree simply
fixed the "Middle of the River" at an arbitrary location based on the
parties' administrative convenience. But that view is foreclosed by

Syllabus
the Court's determination that the consent decree proposed a wholly
permissible final resolution of the controversy both as to facts and law,
426 U. S., at 368-369. The Court rejected the dissenters' view that
the decree interpreted the middle-of-the-river language "by agreements
of convenience" and not "in accordance with legal principles," id., at 369.
New Hampshire's contention that the 1977 consent decree was entered
without a searching historical inquiry into what "Middle of the River"
meant is refuted by the pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case
and by this Court's independent determination that nothing suggests the location of the 1740 boundary agreed upon by the States is
wholly contrary to relevant evidence, ibid. Nor can it be said that
New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river
boundary at Maine's shore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire
relies on historical materials that were no less available in the 1970's
than they are today. And New Hampshire had every reason to consult
those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would
have resulted in a substantial amount of additional territory for New
Hampshire. Pp. 752-755.

(d) Also unavailing is New Hampshire's reliance on this Court's recognition that the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is ordinarily not
applied to States, Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U. S. 362, 369.
This is not a case where estoppel would compromise a governmental
interest in enforcing the law. Cf. Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U. S. 51, 60. Nor is this a case where
the shift in the government's position results from a change in public
policy, cf. Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U. S. 591, 601, or a change in
facts essential to the prior judgment, cf. Montana v. United States, 440
U. S. 147, 159. Instead, it is a case between two States, in which
each owes the other a full measure of respect. The Court is unable
to discern any substantial public policy interest allowing New Hampshire to construe "Middle of the River" differently today than it did
25 years ago. Pp. 755-756.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Piscataqua River lies at the southeastern end ofNew Hampshire's boundary with Maine. The river begins

at the headwaters of Salmon Falls and runs seaward intoPortsmouth Harbor (also known as Piscataqua Harbor). On
March 6, 2000, New Hampshire brought this original actionagainst Maine, claiming that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire riverand all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire.
Maine has filed a motion to dismiss on the ground thattwo prior proceedings--a 1740 boundary determination by
King George II and a 1977 consent judgment entered by thisCourt--definitively fixed the Piscataqua River boundary at
the middle of the river's main channel of navigation.The 1740 decree located the Piscataqua River boundary
at the "Middle of the River." Because New Hampshire, inthe 1977 proceeding, agreed without reservation that the
words "Middle of the River" mean the middle of the Pis-cataqua River's main channel of navigation, we conclude
that New Hampshire is estopped from asserting now thatthe boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly, we
grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.

New Hampshire and Maine share a border that runs fromnorthwest to southeast. At the southeastern end of the

Opinion of the Court
border, the easternmost point of New Hampshire meets thesouthernmost point of Maine. The boundary in this region

follows the Piscataqua River eastward into PortsmouthHarbor and, from there, extends in a southeasterly direction
into the sea. Twenty-five years ago, in a dispute betweenthe two States over lobster fishing rights, this Court entered
a consent judgment fixing the precise location of the "lateral
marine boundary," i. e., the boundary in the marine watersoff the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, from the closing

line of Portsmouth Harbor five miles seaward to GosportHarbor in the Isles of Shoals.

New Hampshire v. Maine,
426 U. S. 363 (1976); New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S. 1, 2(1977). This case concerns the location of the Maine-New

Hampshire boundary along the inland stretch of the Pis-cataqua River, from the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor westward to the river's headwaters at Salmon Falls. (A map ofthe region appears as an appendix to this opinion.)

In the 1970's contest over the lateral marine boundary,we summarized the history of the interstate boundary in the
Piscataqua River region. See New Hampshire v. Maine,
426 U. S., at 366-367. The boundary, we said, "was in factfixed in 1740 by decree of King George II of England" as

follows:

" `That the Dividing Line shall pass up thro the Mouth
of Piscataqua Harbour and up the Middle of theRiver . . . . And that the Dividing Line shall part

the Isles of Shoals and run thro the Middle of the Har-bour between the Islands to the Sea on the Southerly
Side. . . .' " Id., at 366 (quoting the 1740 decree).
In 1976, New Hampshire and Maine "expressly agree[d]
. . . that the decree of 1740 fixed the boundary in the Piscataqua Harbor area." Id., at 367 (internal quotation marks
omitted). "Their quarrel was over the location . . . of the
`Mouth of Piscataqua River,' `Middle of the River,' and `Middle of the Harbour' within the contemplation of the decree."

Opinion of the Court
Ibid. The meaning of those terms was essential to delineat-ing the lateral marine boundary. See Report of Special

Master, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 32-49 (hereinafter Re-port). In particular, the northern end of the lateral marine
boundary required a determination of the point where theline marking the "Middle of the [Piscataqua] River" crosses
the closing line of Piscataqua Harbor. Id., at 43.

In the course of litigation, New Hampshire and Maineproposed a consent decree in which they agreed,

inter alia,
that the words "Middle of the River" in the 1740 decree referto the middle of the Piscataqua River's main channel of navigation. Motion for Entry of Judgment By Consent of Plaintiff and Defendant in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1973,
No. 64 Orig., p. 2 (hereinafter Motion for Consent Judgment).
The Special Master, upon reviewing pertinent history, rejected the States' interpretation and concluded that "the
geographic middle of the river and not its main or navigable channel was intended by the 1740 decree." Report 41.
This Court determined, however, that the States' interpretation "reasonably invest[ed] imprecise terms" with a
definition not "wholly contrary to relevant evidence." New
Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S., at 369. On that basis, the
Court declined to adopt the Special Master's construction
of "Middle of the River" and directed entry of the consent
decree. Id., at 369-370. The final decree, entered in 1977,
defined "Middle of the River" as "the middle of the main
channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River." New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S., at 2.

The 1977 consent judgment fixed only the lateral marine
boundary and not the inland Piscataqua River boundary.
See Report 42-43 ("For the purposes of the present dispute, . . . it is unnecessary to lay out fully the course of the
boundary as it proceeds upriver . . . ."). In the instant action, New Hampshire contends that the inland river boundary "run[s] along the low water mark on the Maine shore,"
Complaint 49, and asserts sovereignty over the entire river

and all of Portsmouth Harbor, including the PortsmouthNaval Shipyard on Seavey Island located within the harbor

just south of Kittery, Maine, id., at 34.* Relying on varioushistorical records, New Hampshire urges that "Middle of the
River," as those words were used in 1740, denotes the mainbranch of the river, not a midchannel boundary, Brief in
Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-16, and that New Hamp-shire, not Maine, exercised sole jurisdiction over shipping
and military activities in Portsmouth Harbor during thedecades before and after the 1740 decree,

id., at 17-19, andnn. 35-38.

While disagreeing with New Hampshire's understandingof history, see Motion to Dismiss 9-14, 18-19 (compiling evidence that Maine continually exercised jurisdiction over theharbor and shipyard from the 1700's to the present day),
Maine primarily contends that the 1740 decree and the 1977consent judgment divided the Piscataqua River at the middle
of the main channel of navigation--a division that placesSeavey Island within Maine's jurisdiction. Those earlier
proceedings, according to Maine, bar New Hampshire's com-plaint under principles of claim and issue preclusion as well
as judicial estoppel.We pretermit the States' competing historical claims along
with their arguments on the application vel non of theres judicata doctrines commonly called claim and issue preclusion. Claim preclusion generally refers to the effect of aprior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of the
very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claimraises the same issues as the earlier suit. Issue preclusion
generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclos-ing successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually

litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essen-tial to the prior judgment, whether or not the issue arises

on the same or a different claim. See Restatement (Second)of Judgments $$ 17, 27, pp. 148, 250 (1980); D. Shapiro, Civil
Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 32, 46 (2001). In theunusual circumstances this case presents, we conclude that a
discrete doctrine, judicial estoppel, best fits the controversy.Under that doctrine, we hold, New Hampshire is equitably
barred from asserting--contrary to its position in the 1970'slitigation--that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runs
along the Maine shore. II

"[W]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal pro-ceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may
not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed,assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerlytaken by him."

Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 680, 689 (1895).This rule, known as judicial estoppel, "generally prevents a

party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argumentand then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in
another phase." Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211, 227, n. 8(2000); see 18 Moore's Federal Practice $ 134.30, p. 134-62
(3d ed. 2000) ("The doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents aparty from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is
inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previousproceeding"); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 4477, p. 782 (1981) (hereinafterWright) ("absent any good explanation, a party should not
be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory,and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory").Although we have not had occasion to discuss the doctrine
elaborately, other courts have uniformly recognized that itspurpose is "to protect the integrity of the judicial process,"
Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F. 2d 595, 598 (CA6

1982), by "prohibiting parties from deliberately changingpositions according to the exigencies of the moment,"

United
States v. McCaskey, 9 F. 3d 368, 378 (CA5 1993). See In re
Cassidy, 892 F. 2d 637, 641 (CA7 1990) ("Judicial estoppel is
a doctrine intended to prevent the perversion of the judicialprocess.");

Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F. 2d 1162, 1166 (CA4
1982) ( judicial estoppel "protect[s] the essential integrity of
the judicial process"); Scarano v. Central R. Co., 203 F. 2d510, 513 (CA3 1953) ( judicial estoppel prevents parties from

"playing `fast and loose with the courts' " (quoting Stretch v.
Watson, 6 N. J. Super. 456, 469, 69 A. 2d 596, 603 (1949))).
Because the rule is intended to prevent "improper use of
judicial machinery," Konstantinidis v. Chen, 626 F. 2d 933,
938 (CADC 1980), judicial estoppel "is an equitable doctrine
invoked by a court at its discretion," Russell v. Rolfs, 893
F. 2d 1033, 1037 (CA9 1990) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).

Courts have observed that "[t]he circumstances under
which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are
probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle," Allen, 667 F. 2d, at 1166; accord, Lowery v. Stovall,
92 F. 3d 219, 223 (CA4 1996); Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 834 F. 2d 208, 212 (CA1 1987). Nevertheless, several factors typically inform the decision whether
to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's
later position must be "clearly inconsistent" with its earlier
position. United States v. Hook, 195 F. 3d 299, 306 (CA7
1999); In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F. 3d 197, 206 (CA5
1999); Hossaini v. Western Mo. Medical Center, 140 F. 3d
1140, 1143 (CA8 1998); Maharaj v. Bankamerica Corp., 128
F. 3d 94, 98 (CA2 1997). Second, courts regularly inquire
whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to
accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would
create "the perception that either the first or the second
court was misled," Edwards, 690 F. 2d, at 599. Absent suc532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

751Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
cess in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no "risk of inconsistent court determinations," United States v. C. I. T. Constr. Inc., 944 F. 2d 253,
259 (CA5 1991), and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. See Hook, 195 F. 3d, at 306; Maharaj, 128 F. 3d, at 98;
Konstantinidis, 626 F. 2d, at 939. A third consideration is
whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position
would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. See Davis, 156
U. S., at 689; Philadelphia, W., & B. R. Co. v. Howard, 13
How. 307, 335-337 (1852); Scarano, 203 F. 2d, at 513 ( judicial
estoppel forbids use of "intentional self-contradiction . . . as
a means of obtaining unfair advantage"); see also 18 Wright

$ 4477, p. 782.

In enumerating these factors, we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining
the applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factual
contexts. In this case, we simply observe that the factors
above firmly tip the balance of equities in favor of barring
New Hampshire's present complaint.

New Hampshire's claim that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore is clearly inconsistent with
its interpretation of the words "Middle of the River" during
the 1970's litigation. As mentioned above, supra, at 747, interpretation of those words was "necessary" to fixing the
northern endpoint of the lateral marine boundary, Report 43.
New Hampshire offered two interpretations in the earlier
proceeding--first agreeing with Maine in the proposed consent decree that "Middle of the River" means the middle of
the main channel of navigation, and later agreeing with the
Special Master that the words mean the geographic middle
of the river. Both constructions located the "Middle of the
River" somewhere other than the Maine shore of the Piscataqua River.

532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
752 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, the record of the 1970's dispute makes clearthat this Court accepted New Hampshire's agreement with

Maine that "Middle of the River" means middle of the mainnavigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from
that interpretation. New Hampshire, it is true, preferredthe interpretation of "Middle of the River" in the Special
Master's report. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff in
New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T. 1975, No. 64 Orig., p. 3 (here-inafter Plaintiff 's Exceptions) ("the boundary now proposed

by the Special Master is more favorable to [New Hampshire]than that recommended in the proposed consent decree").
But the consent decree was sufficiently favorable to New
Hampshire to garner its approval. Although New Hampshire now suggests that it "compromised in Maine's favor"
on the definition of "Middle of the River" in the 1970's litigation, Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 24, that
"compromise" enabled New Hampshire to settle the case, see
id., at 24-25, on terms beneficial to both States. Notably,
in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New
Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that the
proposed judgment was "in the best interest of each State."
Motion for Consent Judgment 1. Relying on that representation, the Court accepted the boundary proposed by the
two States. New Hampshire v. Maine, 434 U. S. 1 (1977).

At oral argument, New Hampshire urged that the consent decree simply fixed the "Middle of the River" at "an
arbitrary location based on the administrative convenience
of the parties." Tr. of Oral Arg. 37. To the extent New
Hampshire implies that the parties settled the lateral marine
boundary dispute without judicial endorsement of their interpretation of "Middle of the River," that view is foreclosed by the Court's determination that "[t]he consent decree . . . proposes a wholly permissible final resolution of
the controversy both as to facts and law," New Hampshire
v. Maine, 426 U. S., at 368-369. Three dissenting Justices
agreed with New Hampshire that the consent decree in532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

753Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
terpreted the middle-of-the-river language "by agreementsof convenience" and not "in accordance with legal principles."

Id., at 371 (White, J., joined by Blackmun and Stevens,JJ., dissenting). But the Court concluded otherwise, noting that its acceptance of the consent decree involved"[n]othing remotely resembling `arbitral' rather than `judicial' functions," id., at 369. The consent decree "reasonably
invest[ed] imprecise terms with definitions that give effectto [the 1740] decree,"

ibid., and "[did] not fall into the category of agreements that we reject because acceptance wouldnot be consistent with our Art. III function and duty,"

ibid.
New Hampshire also contends that the 1977 consent decree was entered without "a searching historical inquiry into
what that language [`Middle of the River'] meant." Tr. of
Oral Arg. 39. According to New Hampshire, had it known
then what it knows now about the relevant history, it would
not have entered into the decree. Ibid. We do not question
that it may be appropriate to resist application of judicial
estoppel "when a party's prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake." John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert &
Frieden, P. C., 65 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA4 1995); see In re Corey,
892 F. 2d 829, 836 (CA9 1989); Konstantinidis, 626 F. 2d, at
939. We are unpersuaded, however, that New Hampshire's
position in 1977 fairly may be regarded as a product of inadvertence or mistake.

The pleadings in the lateral marine boundary case show
that New Hampshire did engage in "a searching historical
inquiry" into the meaning of "Middle of the River." See
Reply Brief for Plaintiff in New Hampshire v. Maine, O. T.
1975, No. 64 Orig., pp. 3-9 (examining history of river boundaries under international law, proceedings leading up to the
1740 order of the King in Council, and relevant precedents
of this Court). None of the historical evidence cited by New
Hampshire remotely suggested that the Piscataqua River
boundary runs along the Maine shore. In fact, in attempting to place the boundary at the geographic middle of the

532US3 Unit: $U60 [09-06-02 19:13:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
754 NEW HAMPSHIRE v. MAINE

Opinion of the Court
river, New Hampshire acknowledged that its agents in 1740
understood the King's order to "adjudg[e] half of the river
to" the portion of Massachusetts that is now Maine. Id., at
6 (emphasis in original) (quoting N. H. State Papers, XIX,
pp. 591, 596-597); see Reply Brief in No. 64 Orig., supra, at
4 ("The intention of those participating in the proceedings
leading to the [1740 decree] was to use `geographic middle'
as the Piscataqua boundary." (emphasis in original)). In
addition, this Court independently determined that "there is
nothing to suggest that the location of the 1740 boundary
agreed upon by the States is wholly contrary to relevant evidence." New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S., at 369.

Nor can it be said that New Hampshire lacked the opportunity or incentive to locate the river boundary at Maine's
shore. In its present complaint, New Hampshire relies on
historical materials--primarily official documents and events
from the colonial and postcolonial periods, see Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss 12-19--that were no less available 25 years ago than they are today. And New Hampshire
had every reason to consult those materials: A river boundary running along Maine's shore would have placed the
northern terminus of the lateral marine boundary much
closer to Maine, "result[ing] in hundreds if not thousands
of additional acres of territory being in New Hampshire
rather than Maine," Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (rebuttal argument
of Maine). Tellingly, New Hampshire at the time understood the importance of placing the northern terminus as
close to Maine as possible. While agreeing with the Special
Master that "Middle of the River" means geographic middle,
New Hampshire insisted that the geographic middle should
be determined by using the banks of the river, not low tide
elevations (as the Special Master had proposed), as the key
reference points--a methodology that would have placed
the northern terminus 350 yards closer to the Maine shore.
Plaintiff 's Exceptions 3.

755Cite as: 532 U. S. 742 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
In short, considerations of equity persuade us that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. Having
convinced this Court to accept one interpretation of "Middle
of the River," and having benefited from that interpretation,
New Hampshire now urges an inconsistent interpretation to
gain an additional advantage at Maine's expense. Were we
to accept New Hampshire's latest view, the "risk of inconsistent court determinations," C. I. T. Constr. Inc., 944 F. 2d, at
259, would become a reality. We cannot interpret "Middle
of the River" in the 1740 decree to mean two different things
along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process.

Finally, notwithstanding the balance of equities, New
Hampshire points to this Court's recognition that "ordinarily the doctrine of estoppel or that part of it which precludes inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings is not
applied to states," Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329
U. S. 362, 369 (1946). Of course, "broad interests of public
policy may make it important to allow a change of positions
that might seem inappropriate as a matter of merely private interests." 18 Wright $ 4477, p. 784. But this is not
a case where estoppel would compromise a governmental
interest in enforcing the law. Cf. Heckler v. Community
Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U. S. 51, 60 (1984)
("When the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has given rise to an estoppel,
the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the
rule of law is undermined. It is for this reason that it is
well settled that the Government may not be estopped on
the same terms as any other litigant."). Nor is this a case
where the shift in the government's position is "the result
of a change in public policy," United States v. Owens, 54 F. 3d
271, 275 (CA6 1995); cf. Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U. S.
591, 601 (1948) (collateral estoppel does not apply to Commissioner where pertinent statutory provisions or Treasury

Opinion of the Court
regulations have changed between the first and second pro-ceeding), or the result of a change in facts essential to the

prior judgment, cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147,159 (1979) ("changes in facts essential to a judgment will
render collateral estoppel inapplicable in a subsequent ac-tion raising the same issues"). Instead, it is a case between
two States, in which each owes the other a full measure ofrespect.

What has changed between 1976 and today is New Hamp-shire's interpretation of the historical evidence concerning
the King's 1740 decree. New Hampshire advances its newinterpretation not to enforce its own laws within its borders,
but to adjust the border itself. Given Maine's countervailinginterest in the location of the boundary, we are unable to
discern any "broad interes[t] of public policy," 18 Wright$ 4477, p. 784, that gives New Hampshire the prerogative to
construe "Middle of the River" differently today than it did25 years ago.

* * *
For the reasons stated, we conclude that judicial estoppelbars New Hampshire from asserting that the Piscataqua

River boundary runs along the Maine shore. Accordingly,we grant Maine's motion to dismiss the complaint.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter took no part in the consideration ordecision of this case.

Within the 30 days allowed for appeal from a district court's judgment,
see 28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1), Becker, still pro se,
filed a notice of appeal using a Government-printed form on which he
filled in all of the requested information. On the line tagged "(Counsel
for Appellant)," Becker typed, but did not hand sign, his own name.
The form contained no indication of a signature requirement. The District Court docketed the notice, sent a copy to the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit, and subsequently granted Becker leave to proceed in
forma pauperis on appeal. The Sixth Circuit Clerk's Office sent Becker
a letter telling him that his appeal had been docketed, setting a briefing
schedule, and stating that the court would not hold him to the same
standards it required of attorneys in stating his case. Becker filed his
brief in advance of the scheduled deadline, signing it on both the cover
and the last page. Long after the 30-day time to appeal had expired,
the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal on its own motion, holding, in
reliance on its prior Mattingly decision, that the notice of appeal was
fatally defective because it was not signed. The Court of Appeals
deemed the defect "jurisdictional," and therefore not curable outside
the time allowed to file the notice. No court officer had earlier called
Becker's attention to the need for a signature.

Held: When a party files a timely notice of appeal in district court, the

failure to sign the notice does not require the court of appeals to dismiss
the appeal. Pp. 762-768.

(a) The Sixth Circuit based its Mattingly determination on the complementary operation of two Federal Rules: Federal Rule of Appellate
Procedure (Appellate Rule) 4(a)(1), which provides that "the notice of
appeal required by Rule 3 [to commence an appeal] must be filed with
the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment . . . appealed from is
entered"; and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (Civil Rule) 11(a), which
provides that "[e]very pleading, written motion, and other paper [filed

532US3 Unit: $U61 [10-25-01 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
758 BECKER v. MONTGOMERY

Syllabus
in a district court] shall be signed" by counsel or, if the party is unrepresented, by the party himself. Pp. 762-763.

(b) The Sixth Circuit is correct that the governing Federal Rules call
for a signature on notices of appeal. Civil Rule 11(a), the signature
requirement's source, comes into play on appeal this way. An appeal
can be initiated, Appellate Rule 3(a)(1) instructs, "only by filing a notice
of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by [Appellate]
Rule 4." Whenever the Appellate Rules provide for a filing in the district court, Appellate Rule 1(a)(2) directs, "the procedure must comply
with the practice of the district court." The district court practice
relevant here is Civil Rule 11(a)'s signature requirement. Notices of
appeal unquestionably qualify as "other paper[s]" under that requirement, so they "shall be signed." Without a rule change so ordering,
the Court is not disposed to extend the meaning of the word "signed"
to permit typed names, as Becker urges. Rather, the Court reads Civil
Rule 11(a) to call for a name handwritten (or a mark handplaced).
Pp. 763-764.

(c) However, the Sixth Circuit erred in its dispositive ruling that the
signature requirement cannot be met after the appeal period expires.
As plainly as Civil Rule 11(a) requires a signature on filed papers, so
the rule goes on to provide that "omission of the signature" may be
"corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney
or party." Corrections can be made, the Rules Advisory Committee
noted, by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that
contains the signature. Civil Rule 11(a)'s provision for correction applies to appeal notices. The rule was formulated and should be applied
as a cohesive whole. So understood, the signature requirement and the
cure for an initial failure to meet the requirement go hand in hand.
Becker proffered a correction of the defect in his notice in the manner
Rule 11(a) permits--he attempted to submit a duplicate containing his
signature--and therefore should not have suffered dismissal of his appeal for nonobservance of that rule. The Court does not disturb its
earlier statements describing Appellate Rules 3 and 4 as "jurisdictional
in nature." E. g., Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 315.
The Court rules simply and only that Becker's lapse was curable as
Civil Rule 11(a) prescribes; his initial omission was not a "jurisdictional"
impediment to pursuit of his appeal. While Appellate Rules 3 and 4
are indeed linked jurisdictional provisions, Rule 3(c)(1), which details
what the notice of appeal must contain, does not include a signature
requirement. Civil Rule 11(a) alone calls for and controls that requirement and renders it nonjurisdictional. Pp. 764-766.

(d) The Court rejects the argument that, even if there is no jurisdictional notice of appeal signature requirement for parties represented

532US3 Unit: $U61 [10-25-01 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

759Cite as: 532 U. S. 757 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
by attorneys, pro se parties, like Becker, must sign within Rule 4's time
line to avoid automatic dismissal. The foundation for this argument
is Appellate Rule 3(c)(2), which reads: "A pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer and the signer's spouse and minor
children (if they are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise." That provision does not dislodge the signature requirement
from its Civil Rule 11(a) moorings and make of it an Appellate Rule 3
jurisdictional specification. Rather, Rule 3(c)(2) is entirely ameliorative; it assumes and assures that the pro se litigant's spouse and minor
children, if they were parties below, will remain parties on appeal, unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent. This reading of Rule
3(c)(2) is in harmony with a related ameliorative rule, Appellate Rule
3(c)(4), which provides: "An appeal must not be dismissed for informality
of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party
whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice." Imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine
doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which
appellate court. See, e. g., Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 245, 248-249.
Pp. 766-768.

Petitioner Dale G. Becker, an Ohio prisoner, instituted a

complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, Becker soughtto appeal. Using a Government-printed form, Becker timely
filed a notice of appeal that contained all of the requestedinformation. On the line tagged "(Counsel for Appellant),"

Opinion of the Court
Becker typed, but did not hand sign, his own name. Forwant of a handwritten signature on the notice as originally filed, the Court of Appeals dismissed Becker's appeal.The appellate court deemed the defect "jurisdictional," and
therefore not curable outside the time allowed to file thenotice.

We granted review to address this question: "When aparty files a timely notice of appeal in district court, does
the failure to sign the notice of appeal require the court ofappeals to dismiss the appeal?" 531 U. S. 1110 (2001). Our
answer is no. For want of a signature on a timely notice,the appeal is not automatically lost. The governing Federal
Rules direct that the notice of appeal, like other papers filedin district court, shall be signed by counsel or, if the party
is unrepresented, by the party himself. But if the notice istimely filed and adequate in other respects, jurisdiction will
vest in the court of appeals, where the case may proceed solong as the appellant promptly supplies the signature once
the omission is called to his attention.

I
This case originated from a civil rights complaint under42 U. S. C. $ 1983 filed pro se by Ohio prison inmate Dale G.

Becker in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of Ohio. Becker challenged the conditions of his
incarceration at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution,specifically, his exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke.
The District Court dismissed Becker's complaint for failureto exhaust prison administrative remedies and failure to
state a claim upon which relief could be granted. App. 5-8.Within the 30 days allowed for appeal from a district
court's judgment, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2107(a); Fed. Rule App.Proc. 4(a)(1), Becker, still

pro se, filed a notice of appeal.Using a notice of appeal form printed by the Government

Printing Office, Becker filled in the blanks, specifying him-self as sole appellant, designating the judgment from which

Opinion of the Court
he appealed, and naming the court to which he appealed.
See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1). He typed his own name in
the space above "(Counsel for Appellant)," and also typed,
in the spaces provided on the form, his address and the
date of the notice. The form Becker completed contained
no statement or other indication of a signature requirement
and Becker did not hand sign the notice.

The District Court docketed the notice, sent a copy to the
Court of Appeals, and subsequently granted Becker leave to
proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Becker received a
letter from the Sixth Circuit Clerk's Office telling him that
his appeal had been docketed and setting a briefing schedule.
The letter stated: "The court is aware that you are not an
attorney and it will not hold you to the same standards it
requires of them in stating your case." App. 14.

Becker filed his brief more than two weeks in advance of
the scheduled deadline. He signed it both on the cover and
on the last page. Some six months later, on its own motion,
the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal in a spare order relying on that court's prior, published decision in Mattingly v.
Farmers State Bank, 153 F. 3d 336 (1998) (per curiam). In
Becker's case, the Court of Appeals said, summarily:

"This court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. The
notice of appeal is defective because it was not signed
by the pro se appellant or by a qualified attorney."
App. 16-17.

No court officer had earlier called Becker's attention to the
need for a signature, and the dismissal order, issued long
after the 30-day time to appeal expired, accorded Becker no
opportunity to cure the defect.

Becker filed a timely but unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, to which he appended a new, signed notice of appeal.
Thereafter, he petitioned for this Court's review. The Attorney General of Ohio, in response, urged us "to summarily

reverse the judgment below," Brief in Response to Pet. forCert. 1, stating:

"We cannot honestly claim any uncertain[t]y about peti-tioner Becker's intention to pursue an appeal once he
filed his timely, though unsigned, notice of appeal in thedistrict court. We never objected to the lack of a signature on his notice of appeal, and fully expected thecourt of appeals to address his appellate arguments on
the merits." Id., at 5.
We granted certiorari, 531 U. S. 1069; 531 U. S. 1110 (2001),to assure the uniform interpretation of the governing Federal Rules, and now address the question whether Becker'sfailure to sign his timely filed notice of appeal requires the
Court of Appeals to dismiss his appeal.1

II
In Mattingly v. Farmers State Bank, 153 F. 3d 336 (1998)
(per curiam), the Sixth Circuit determined that a notice ofappeal must be signed, and that a signature's omission cannot be cured by giving the appellant an opportunity to signafter the time to appeal has expired. For this determination, that court relied on the complementary operation of twoFederal Rules: Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (Appellate Rule) 4(a)(1), which provides that "the notice of appealrequired by Rule 3 [to commence an appeal] must be filed

1 Without any party to defend the Sixth Circuit's position, we invited
Stewart A. Baker to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the judgment below. 531 U. S. 1110 (2001). His able representation, and that of Jeffrey S. Sutton, whom we appointed to represent
Becker, 531 U. S. 1123 (2001), permit us to decide this case satisfied that
the relevant issues have been fully aired.

Opinion of the Court
Procedure (Civil Rule) 11(a), which provides that "[e]very . . .paper [filed in a district court] shall be signed." We agree

with the Sixth Circuit that the governing Federal Rules callfor a signature on notices of appeal. We disagree, however,
with that court's dispositive ruling that the signature re-quirement cannot be met after the appeal period expires.

Civil Rule 11(a), the source of the signature requirement,comes into play on appeal this way. An appeal can be initiated, Appellate Rule 3(a)(1) instructs, "only by filing a no-tice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed
by [Appellate] Rule 4." Whenever the Appellate Rules pro-vide for a filing in the district court, Appellate Rule 1(a)(2)
directs, "the procedure must comply with the practice of thedistrict court." The district court practice relevant here is
Civil Rule 11(a).Ru le 11(a)'s first sentence st ates the si g nature
requirement:

"Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shallbe signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, or, if the party is not representedby an attorney, shall be signed by the party."

Notices of appeal unquestionably qualify as "other paper[s],"so they "shall be signed."

Becker maintains that typing one's name satisfies thesignature requirement and that his original notice of appeal,
containing his name typed above "(Counsel of Record)," metCivil Rule 11(a)'s instruction. We do not doubt that the
signature requirement can be adjusted to keep pace withtechnological advances. A 1996 amendment to Civil Rule 5
provides in this regard:

"A court may by local rule permit papers to be filed,signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistdays after the [originally] prescribed time or 10 days after the date when
the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later." Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 4(a)(5).

764 BECKER v. MONTGOMERY

Opinion of the Court
ent with technical standards, if any, that the Judicial
Conference of the United States establishes. A paper
filed by electronic means in compliance with a local rule
constitutes a written paper for the purpose of applying
these rules." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(e).

See, e. g., Rule 5.1 (ND Ohio 2000) (permitting "papers filed,
signed, or verified by electronic means"). The local rules
on electronic filing provide some assurance, as does a handwritten signature, that the submission is authentic. See,
e. g., United States District Court for the Northern District
of Ohio, Electronic Filing Policies and Procedures Manual
4 (Apr. 2, 2001) (available at http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/
Electronic Filing/user.pdf) (allowing only registered attorneys assigned identification names and passwords to file
papers electronically). Without any rule change so ordering, however, we are not disposed to extend the meaning
of the word "signed," as that word appears in Civil Rule
11(a), to permit typed names. As Rule 11(a) is now framed,
we read the requirement of a signature to indicate, as a
signature requirement commonly does, and as it did in John
Hancock's day, a name handwritten (or a mark handplaced).

As plainly as Civil Rule 11(a) requires a signature on filed
papers, however, so the rule goes on to provide in its final
sentence that "omission of the signature" may be "corrected
promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney
or party." "Correction can be made," the Rules Advisory
Committee noted, "by signing the paper on file or by submitting a duplicate that contains the signature." Advisory
Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11, 28 U. S. C.
App., p. 666.

Amicus urges that only the first sentence of Civil Rule
11(a), containing the signature requirement--not Rule 11(a)'s
final sentence, providing for correction of a signature omission--applies to appeal notices. Appellate Rule 1(a)(2)'s di532US3 Unit: $U61 [10-25-01 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
rection to "comply with the practice of the district court"
ceases to hold sway, amicus maintains, once the notice of
appeal is transmitted from the district court, in which it is
filed, to the court of appeals, in which the case will proceed.
Brief for Amicus Curiae in Support of the Judgment Below
15-18, and nn. 18-20.

Civil Rule 11(a), in our view, cannot be sliced as amicus
proposes. The rule was formulated and should be applied as
a cohesive whole. So understood, the signature requirement
and the cure for an initial failure to meet the requirement
go hand in hand. The remedy for a signature omission, in
other words, is part and parcel of the requirement itself.
Becker proffered a correction of the defect in his notice in
the manner Rule 11(a) permits--he attempted to submit a
duplicate containing his signature, see supra, at 761--and
therefore should not have suffered dismissal of his appeal for
nonobservance of that rule.

The Sixth Circuit in Mattingly correctly observed that we
have described Appellate Rules 3 and 4 as "jurisdictional in
nature." 153 F. 3d, at 337 (citing Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 315 (1988), and Smith v. Barry, 502
U. S. 244, 248 (1992)). We do not today hold otherwise. We
rule simply and only that Becker's lapse was curable as Civil
Rule 11(a) prescribes; his initial omission was not a "jurisdictional" impediment to pursuit of his appeal.

Appellate Rules 3 and 4, we clarify, are indeed linked jurisdictional provisions. Rule 3(a)(1) directs that a notice
of appeal be filed "within the time allowed by Rule 4,"
i. e., ordinarily, within 30 days after the judgment appealed
from is entered, see supra, at 762-763, and n. 2. Rule 3(c)(1)
details what the notice of appeal must contain: The notice,
within Rule 4's timeframe, must (1) specify the party or
parties taking the appeal; (2) designate the judgment from
which the appeal is taken; and (3) name the court to which

532US3 Unit: $U61 [10-25-01 20:50:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
766 BECKER v. MONTGOMERY

Opinion of the Court
the appeal is taken.3 Notably, a signature requirement isnot among Rule 3(c)(1)'s specifications, for Civil Rule 11(a)

alone calls for and controls that requirement and renders itnonjurisdictional.

Amicus ultimately urges that even if there is no juris-dictional notice of appeal signature requirement for parties
represented by attorneys, pro se parties, like Becker, mustsign within Rule 4's time line to avoid automatic dismissal.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-36. Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) is thefoundation for this argument. That provision reads: "A
pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of thesigner and the signer's spouse and minor children (if they
are parties), unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise."We do not agree that Rule 3(c)(2)'s prescription, added in
1993 to a then unsubdivided Rule 3(c), see Advisory Commit-tee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 590,
places pro se litigants in a singularly exacting time bind.The provision, as we read it, does not dislodge the signature
requirement from its Civil Rule 11(a) moorings and makeof it an Appellate Rule 3 jurisdictional specification. The
current Rule 3(c)(2), like other changes made in 1993, theAdvisory Committee Notes explain, was designed "to prevent the loss of a right to appeal through inadvertent omis-sion of a party's name" when "it is objectively clear that [the]
party intended to appeal." Advisory Committee's Notes onFed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 590. Seen in this
light, the Rule is entirely ameliorative; it assumes and as-sures that the pro se litigant's spouse and minor children,

3 Appellate Rule 3(c)(1), as currently framed, provides in full:
"(1) The notice of appeal must:
"(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one
in the caption or body of the notice, but an attorney representing more
than one party may describe those parties with such terms as `all plaintiffs,' `the defendants,' `the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,' or `all defendants
except X';

"(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; and
"(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken."

Opinion of the Court
if they were parties below, will remain parties on appeal,"unless the notice clearly indicates a contrary intent." Ibid.

If we had any doubt that Appellate Rule 3(c)(2) was meantonly to facilitate, not to impede, access to an appeal, we
would find corroboration in a related ameliorative rule, Ap-pellate Rule 3(c)(4), which provides: "An appeal must not be
dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of ap-peal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is
otherwise clear from the notice." Cf. this Court's Rule 14.5("If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely
and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with thisRule [governing the content of petitions for certiorari] or
with Rule 33 or Rule 34 [governing document preparation],the Clerk will return it with a letter indicating the deficiency.
A corrected petition received no more than 60 days after thedate of the Clerk's letter will be deemed timely.").

In Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312 (1988),it is true, we held, that a notice of appeal that omitted the
name of a particular appellant, through a clerical error, wasineffective to take an appeal for that party. Id., at 318 (construing Rule 3(c) prior to the ameliorative changes made in1993).

4 Becker's notice, however, did not suffer from any

failure to "specify the party or parties taking the appeal."Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1)(A). Other opinions of this

Court are in full harmony with the view that imperfectionsin noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine
doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judg-ment, to which appellate court. See Smith v. Barry, 502
U. S., at 245, 248-249 (holding that "a document intended toserve as an appellate brief [filed within the time specified by Appellate Rule 4 and containing the informationrequired by Appellate Rule 3] may qualify as the notice of

Appellate Rule 3(c) "to reduce the amount of satellite litigation spawned
by [Torres]." Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3, 28

a whole--including a timely but incomplete notice of appealand a premature but complete notice--revealed the orders
petitioner sought to appeal).

* * *
In sum, the Federal Rules require a notice of appeal tobe signed. That requirement derives from Civil Rule 11(a),

and so does the remedy for a signature's omission on thenotice originally filed. On the facts here presented, the
Sixth Circuit should have accepted Becker's corrected noticeas perfecting his appeal. We therefore reverse the judgment dismissing Becker's appeal and remand the case forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

769OCTOBER TERM, 2000
Per Curiam

ARKANSAS v. SULLIVAN
on petition for writ of certiorari to thesupreme court of arkansas

No. 00-262. Decided May 29, 2001
When the Arkansas police officer who stopped respondent Sullivan for

speeding and improper window tinting remembered intelligence on
Sullivan regarding narcotics, he arrested Sullivan for traffic violations
and carrying a weapon and, during an inventory search of the vehicle,
discovered a bag of drugs and drug-related materials. Sullivan was
charged with, inter alia, various state-law drug offenses. The trial
court granted Sullivan's motion to suppress the evidence seized from his
vehicle on the basis that his arrest was a pretext to search him and
therefore violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. After affirming, the Arkansas Supreme Court denied the State's rehearing petition, rejecting the State's argument that the court took into account the
officer's subjective motivation in disregard of Whren v. United States,
517 U. S. 806, and holding that, even if Whren precludes inquiry into an
arresting officer's subjective motivation, that court could interpret the
United States Constitution more broadly than this Court.

Held: The State Supreme Court's decision on rehearing is flatly contrary

to this Court's controlling precedent. Its decision that the drug-related
evidence should be suppressed because the police officer had an improper subjective motivation for making the stop cannot be squared
with this Court's holding in Whren, supra, at 813, that "[s]ubjective
intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment
analysis." The State Supreme Court's alternative holding, that it may
interpret the Federal Constitution to provide greater protection than
this Court's own precedents provide, is foreclosed by Oregon v. Hass,
420 U. S. 714.

Certiorari granted; 340 Ark. 315, 11 S. W. 3d 526, and 340 Ark. 318-A,

16 S. W. 3d 551, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
In November 1998, Officer Joe Taylor of the Conway,Arkansas, Police Department stopped respondent Sullivan

for speeding and for having an improperly tinted wind-shield. Taylor approached Sullivan's vehicle, explained the
reason for the stop, and requested Sullivan's license, regis532US3 Unit: $U62 [09-06-02 19:14:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Per Curiam
tration, and insurance documentation. Upon seeing Sulli-van's license, Taylor realized that he was aware of " `intelligence on [Sullivan] regarding narcotics.' " 340 Ark. 318-A,318-B, 16 S. W. 3d 551, 552 (2000). When Sullivan opened
his car door in an (unsuccessful) attempt to locate his regis-tration and insurance papers, Taylor noticed a rusted roofing
hatchet on the car's floorboard. Taylor then arrested Sullivan for speeding, driving without his registration and insur-ance documentation, carrying a weapon (the roofing hatchet),

and improper window tinting.After another officer arrived and placed Sullivan in his
squad car, Officer Taylor conducted an inventory search ofSullivan's vehicle pursuant to the Conway Police Department's Vehicle Inventory Policy. Under the vehicle's arm-rest, Taylor discovered a bag containing a substance that
appeared to him to be methamphetamine as well as nu-merous items of suspected drug paraphernalia. As a result
of the detention and search, Sullivan was charged with vari-ous state-law drug offenses, unlawful possession of a weapon,
and speeding.

Sullivan moved to suppress the evidence seized from hisvehicle on the basis that his arrest was merely a "pretext

and sham to search" him and, therefore, violated the Fourth
and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Pet. for Cert. 3. The trial court granted the suppression motion and, on the State's interlocutory appeal,
the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed. 340 Ark. 315, 11
S. W. 3d 526 (2000). The State petitioned for rehearing,
contending that the court had erred by taking into account Officer Taylor's subjective motivation, in disregard
of this Court's opinion in Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.
806 (1996). Over the dissent of three justices, the court rejected the State's argument that Whren makes "the ulterior
motives of police officers . . . irrelevant so long as there is

Per Curiam
The Arkansas Supreme Court declined to follow Whren onthe ground that "much of it is

dicta." 340 Ark., at 318-B,
16 S. W. 3d, at 552. The court reiterated the trial judge'sconclusion that "the arrest was pretextual and made for the

purpose of searching Sullivan's vehicle for evidence of acrime," and observed that "we do not believe that

Whren
disallows" suppression on such a basis. Id., at 318-C, 16
S. W. 3d, at 552. Finally, the court asserted that, even if itwere to conclude that

Whren precludes inquiry into an arresting officer's subjective motivation, "there is nothing thatprevents this court from interpreting the U. S. Constitution

more broadly than the United States Supreme Court, whichhas the effect of providing more rights." 340 Ark., at
318-C, 16 S. W. 3d, at 552.Because the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision on rehearing is flatly contrary to this Court's controlling prece-dent, we grant the State's petition for a writ of certiorari and
reverse.* As an initial matter, we note that the ArkansasSupreme Court never questioned Officer Taylor's authority
to arrest Sullivan for a fine-only traffic violation (speeding),
and rightly so. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, ante, p. 318.Rather, the court affirmed the trial judge's suppression of

the drug-related evidence on the theory that Officer Taylor'sarrest of Sullivan, although supported by probable cause,
nonetheless violated the Fourth Amendment because Taylorhad an improper subjective motivation for making the stop.
The Arkansas Supreme Court's holding to that effect cannotbe squared with our decision in

Whren, in which we noted
our "unwilling[ness] to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers,"

*Sullivan's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.
We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1257 notwithstanding the absence of final judgment in the underlying prosecution. See New York v.
Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 651, n. 1 (1984) ("[S]hould the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot. Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State
will be precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal").

Ginsburg, J., concurring
and held unanimously that "[s]ubjective intentions play norole in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis." 517 U. S., at 813. That Whren involved a traffic stop,rather than a custodial arrest, is of no particular moment;
indeed, Whren itself relied on United States v. Robinson, 414U. S. 218 (1973), for the proposition that "a traffic-violation
arrest . . . [will] not be rendered invalid by the fact thatit was `a mere pretext for a narcotics search.' " 517 U. S.,
at 812-813.The Arkansas Supreme Court's alternative holding, that
it may interpret the United States Constitution to providegreater protection than this Court's own federal constitutional precedents provide, is foreclosed by Oregon v. Hass,420 U. S. 714 (1975). There, we observed that the Oregon
Supreme Court's statement that it could " `interpret theFourth Amendment more restrictively than interpreted by
the United States Supreme Court' " was "not the law andsurely must be an inadvertent error."

Id., at 719, n. 4. Wereiterated in
Hass that while "a State is free as a matterof its own law to impose greater restrictions on police activity than those this Court holds to be necessary uponfederal constitutional standards," it "may not impose such
greater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional lawwhen this Court specifically refrains from imposing them."
Id., at 719.The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

The Arkansas Supreme Court was moved by a concernrooted in the Fourth Amendment. Validating Kenneth Sullivan's arrest, the Arkansas court feared, would accord police
officers disturbing discretion to intrude on individuals' lib532US3 Unit: $U62 [09-06-02 19:14:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

erty and privacy. See 340 Ark. 318-A, 318-B, 16 S. W. 3d551, 552 (2000) (expressing unwillingness "to sanction conduct where a police officer can trail a targeted vehicle witha driver merely suspected of criminal activity, wait for the
driver to exceed the speed limit by one mile per hour, arrestthe driver for speeding, and conduct a full-blown inventory
search of the vehicle with impunity"). But this Court hasheld that such exercises of official discretion are unlimited by
the Fourth Amendment. See Atwater v. Lago Vista, ante,p. 318;

Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996). Giventhe Court's current case law, I join the Court's opinion.

In Atwater, which recognized no constitutional limitationon arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor offense, this Court relied in part on a perceived "dearth of horribles demandingredress." Ante, at 353. Although I joined a dissenting
opinion questioning the relevance of the Court's conclusionon that score, see ante, at 372 (opinion of O'C

onnor, J.),I hope the Court's perception proves correct. But if it does

not, if experience demonstrates "anything like an epidemicof unnecessary minor-offense arrests," ante, at 353 (opinion
of the Court), I hope the Court will reconsider its recentprecedent. See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986)
(observing that Court has departed from stare decisis whennecessary "to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained") (quoting Burnetv. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).

FLORIDA v. THOMAS
certiorari to the supreme court of florida

No. 00-391. Argued April 25, 2001--Decided June 4, 2001
While officers were investigating marijuana sales and making arrests at

a Florida home, respondent Thomas drove up, parked in the home's
driveway, and walked toward the back of his car. An officer met him
there and asked his name and whether he had a driver's license. After
a check of Thomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant, the officer arrested him, handcuffed him, and took him inside the home. The
officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car, finding
several bags containing methamphetamine. Thomas was charged with
possession of that drug and related offenses. The trial court granted
his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court of Appeal reversed, finding the
search valid under New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, in which this Court
established a "bright-line" rule permitting an officer who has made a
lawful custodial arrest of a car's occupant to search the car's passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. Holding
that Belton did not apply, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, but
remanded for the trial court to determine whether the vehicle search
was justified under Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752. This Court
granted certiorari to consider whether, as the State Supreme Court had
held, Belton's bright-line rule is limited to situations where the officer
initiates contact with a vehicle's occupant while that person remains
in the vehicle.

Held: The Court lacks jurisdiction to decide the question on which certiorari was granted. Although the parties did not raise the issue in
their briefs on the merits, this Court must first consider whether it has
jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch,
488 U. S. 299, 306. Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a) authorizes this Court to
review "[f]inal judgments . . . by the highest court of a State . . . where
any . . . right . . . is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution."
In a criminal prosecution, finality generally is defined by a judgment
of conviction and the imposition of a sentence. Fort Wayne Books, Inc.

Court has treated state-court judgments as final for jurisdictional
purposes even though further proceedings were to take place in the

kind into four categories: (1) cases in which there are further proceedings, even entire trials, yet to occur in the state courts, but where
the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings
preordained; (2) cases in which the federal issue, finally decided by a
State's highest court, will survive and require decision regardless of
the outcome of future state-court proceedings; (3) cases in which the
federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on
the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the
federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case;
and (4) cases in which the state courts have finally decided the federal
issue with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review in this Court might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds,
thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court,
and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be
preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather
than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining
the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come.
Because none of those categories fits the Florida Supreme Court's judgment in this case, the judgment is not final. Pp. 777-781.

776 FLORIDA v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

In New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), we establisheda "bright-line" rule permitting a law enforcement officer who
has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a carto search the passenger compartment of that car as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. We granted certiorarito consider whether that rule is limited to situations in which
the officer initiates contact with the occupant of a vehiclewhile that person remains inside the vehicle. 531 U. S. 1069
(2001). We find, however, that we lack jurisdiction to decidethe question.

On the evening at issue, officers were present at a homein Polk County, Florida, investigating the sale of marijuana
and making arrests. Respondent Robert Thomas drove upto the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked toward
the back of his vehicle. Officer J. D. Maney met Thomasat the rear of Thomas' vehicle, and asked him his name
and whether he had a driver's license. After a check ofThomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant for his
arrest, Officer Maney arrested him, handcuffed him, and took
him inside the residence. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car. The search revealedseveral small bags containing a white substance that tested

positive for methamphetamine.Respondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial courtgranted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcotics
and narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court ofAppeal reversed, 711 So. 2d 1241 (1998), finding the search
valid under New York v. Belton, supra. The Supreme Courtof Florida in turn reversed, holding that

Belton did not apply.
The court held that "Belton's bright-line rule is limitedto situations where the law enforcement officer initiates

contact with the defendant" while the defendant remains in
the car. 761 So. 2d 1010, 1014 (2000). The court concluded

777Cite as: 532 U. S. 774 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
that Belton was inapplicable, and directed that the trialcourt determine "whether the factors in

Chimel [v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969),] justify the search of Thomas'vehicle." 761 So. 2d, at 1014. The court explained that

"[b]ased on the record . . . we are unable to ascertain whether[the officer's] safety was endangered or whether the preservation of the evidence was in jeopardy," as necessary to
justify the search under Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752(1969), and remanded for further proceedings.

Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefson the merits, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v.
Barasch, 488 U. S. 299, 306 (1989). Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a)
authorizes this Court to review "[f]inal judgments or decrees
rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision
could be had . . . where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution."
In a criminal prosecution, finality generally "is defined by
a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence."
Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 54 (1989).
But we have not, in practice, interpreted the finality rule so
strictly. In certain circumstances, we have "treated statecourt judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although
there were further proceedings to take place in the state
court." Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, 620-621 (1981) (per
curiam). In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469
(1975), we divided cases of this kind into four categories.
None fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, however, and we therefore conclude that its judgment is not final.

The first Cox category includes those cases in which "there
are further proceedings--even entire trials--yet to occur in
the state courts but where for one reason or another the
federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained." Id., at 479. The prototypical example
of this category is Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966).
There the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a statute

532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
778 FLORIDA v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
which prohibited the publication of an editorial endorse-ment on election day did not violate the First Amendment,

and remanded the case for trial. Id., at 216-217. Millsconceded that his only defense to the state charge was his
constitutional claim; he admitted that he did publish theeditorial. We held that this was a "final judgment" and took
jurisdiction, saying that a trial "would be no more than afew formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction,
and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court forit formally to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutional
contentions whereupon the case could then once more windits weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably final
and appealable. Such a roundabout process would not onlybe an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended
to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it wouldalso result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and
energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays dueto congested dockets."

Id., at 217-218.The decision of the Supreme Court of Florida here differs considerably from that of the state court in Mills. TheFlorida Supreme Court remanded the case not only for application of Chimel, but for further factfinding, and the Statehas not conceded that the search is invalid under

Chimel.In Cox's second category are those cases in which "the

federal issue, finally decided by the highest court in theState, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings." 420 U. S., at 480.In

Cox we used our decision in Radio Station WOW, Inc.
v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120 (1945), to illustrate the secondcategory. We said:

"In Radio Station WOW, the Nebraska Supreme Courtdirected the transfer of the properties of a federally
licensed radio station and ordered an accounting, reject-ing the claim that the transfer order would interfere
with the federal license. . . . Nothing that could happen

532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN

779Cite as: 532 U. S. 774 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
in the course of the accounting, short of settlement of
the case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decision
on the federal question." Cox, supra, at 480.

In this case, however, were the Florida courts to find that
Chimel allows the search, a decision on the Belton issue
would no longer be necessary. We have also noted that we
treat state-court judgments in this category as final on the
assumption that " `the federal questions that could come here
have been adjudicated by the State court,' " and the state
proceedings to take place on remand " `could not remotely
give rise to a federal question . . . that may later come here.' "
Cox, 420 U. S., at 480. We cannot make that assumption in
this case.

Cases where "the federal claim has been finally decided,
with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to
come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot
be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case," fall into
Cox's third category. Id., at 481. New York v. Quarles, 467
U. S. 649 (1984), is such a case. Respondent was charged in
state court with criminal possession of a weapon, and certain
evidence was suppressed on federal constitutional grounds.
We granted the petition for certiorari and reversed, explaining that the suppression ruling was a "final judgment"
although respondent had yet to be tried. Id., at 651. We
said that this case fell within Cox's third category because
"should the State convict respondent at trial, its claim that
certain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot.
Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will be
precluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal."
467 U. S., at 651, and n. 1.

To deny review here would not necessarily cause Florida
to go to trial without the suppressed evidence, with further
appeal barred in the event of an acquittal or the federal claim
mooted in the event of a conviction. The state court has

532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN
780 FLORIDA v. THOMAS

Opinion of the Court
yet to decide whether the evidence should be suppressed;that will be resolved on remand. If the State prevails on

remand and the evidence is admitted under Chimel, thenthe

Belton issue will be moot, and the State cannot seek
review of it. But if the State loses, and the evidence issuppressed, Florida law allows the State to appeal, as long

as it does so prior to trial. Fla. Stat. $ 924.071(1) (1996)
("The state may appeal from a pretrial order . . . suppressingevidence"); Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.140(c)(1)(B) (2001) ("The

state may appeal an order . . . suppressing before trial . . .evidence obtained by search and seizure"). Should the Supreme Court of Florida rule against the State on the Chimel
issue, the question of suppression would be finally decided
by the Florida courts, and the State could then seek certiorari in this Court. At that time it could obtain review of
both the Belton issue and the Chimel issue. See Jefferson
v. City of Tarrant, 522 U. S. 75, 83 (1997).

The fourth Cox category includes those cases where "the
federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts
with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal
grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal
issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on
the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation
on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling
the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility
of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In these
circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the statecourt decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court
has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself
has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes
of the state litigation." 420 U. S., at 482-483.

Here the State can make no claim of serious erosion of
federal policy that is not common to all run-of-the-mine decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials. The fourth
Cox exception does not apply here.

PENRY v. JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, TEXAS

DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,INSTITUTIONAL DIVISION

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 00-6677. Argued March 27, 2001--Decided June 4, 2001
In 1989, this Court held that petitioner Penry had been sentenced to death

in violation of the Eighth Amendment. At the close of the penalty
hearing during Penry's first Texas capital murder trial, the jury was
instructed to answer three statutorily mandated "special issues":
(1) whether Penry's conduct was committed deliberately and with the
reasonable expectation that death would result; (2) whether it was probable that he would be a continuing threat to society; and (3) whether
the killing was unreasonable in response to any provocation by the
deceased. Although Penry had offered extensive evidence that he was
mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a child, the jury
was never told it could consider and give mitigating effect to that
evidence in imposing sentence. In holding that the jury had not been
adequately instructed with respect to the mitigating evidence, the Court
found, among other things, that none of the special issues was broad
enough to allow the jury to consider and give effect to that evidence.
Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (Penry I). When Texas retried Penry
in 1990, he was again found guilty of capital murder. During the penalty phase, the defense again put on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments and childhood abuse. On direct examination
by the defense, a clinical neuropsychologist, Dr. Price, testified that he
believed Penry suffered from organic brain impairment and mental retardation. During cross-examination, Price cited as one of the records
he had reviewed in preparing his testimony a psychiatric evaluation
prepared by Dr. Peebles in 1977 at the request of Penry's then-counsel
to determine Penry's competency to stand trial on an earlier charge
unrelated to the murder at issue. Over a defense objection, Price recited a portion of that evaluation which stated that it was Peebles' professional opinion that if Penry were released, he would be dangerous to
others. When it came time to submit the case to the jury, the trial
court instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering the same three special issues that were at issue in Penry I. The
trial court then gave a "supplemental instruction": "[W]hen you deliberate on the . . . special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence . . . . If you find [such]

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

783Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Syllabus
circumstances . . . , you must decide how much weight they deserve, if
any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing
the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special
issue. If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence,
if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue
under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to [Penry's] personal culpability . . . , a negative finding should
be given to one of the special issues." The verdict form itself, however,
contained only the text of the three special issues, and gave the jury
two choices with respect to each: "Yes" or "No." Because the jury
unanimously answered "yes" to each special issue, the court sentenced
Penry to death in accordance with state law. In affirming, the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Penry's claims that the admission
of language from the Peebles report violated Penry's Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, and that the jury instructions were
constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to consider and give effect to his particular mitigating evidence. With respect to the latter, the court held that the supplemental instruction met
Penry I's constitutional requirements. After his petition for state habeas corpus relief was denied, Penry petitioned for federal habeas relief
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. The District Court found that the state appellate court's conclusions on both of Penry's claims were neither contrary
to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.
The Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.

Held:

1. Penry's argument is unavailing that the admission into evidence
of the portion of the Peebles report referring to his future dangerousness violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
This case is distinguishable from Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454, in which
the Court held that the admission of a psychiatrist's testimony on the
topic of future dangerousness, based on a defendant's uncounseled statements, violated the Fifth Amendment. The Court need not and does
not decide whether the several respects in which this case differs from
Estelle affect the merits of Penry's claim. Rather, the question is
whether the Texas court's decision was "contrary to" or an "unreasonable application" of this Court's precedent. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1);
see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362. It was not. The differences
between this case and Estelle are substantial, and the Court's Estelle
opinion suggested that its holding was limited to the "distinct circumstances" presented there. 451 U. S., at 466. It also indicated that the
Fifth Amendment analysis might be different where a defendant introduces psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase. Id., at 472. Indeed,
the Court has never extended Estelle's Fifth Amendment holding beyond its particular facts. Cf., e. g., Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U. S.

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
784 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Syllabus
402. It therefore cannot be said that it was objectively unreasonable
for the Texas court to conclude that Penry is not entitled to relief on his
Fifth Amendment claim. See Williams, supra, at 409. Even if the
Court's precedent were to establish squarely that use of the Peebles
report violated the Fifth Amendment, that error would justify overturning Penry's sentence only if he could establish that the error had
a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the
jury's verdict. E. g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637. There
is considerable doubt that Penry could make such a showing. The excerpt from the Peebles report was neither the first nor the last expert
opinion the jury heard to the effect that Penry posed a future danger
and was by no means the key to the State's case on future dangerousness. Pp. 793-796.

2. The jury instructions at Penry's resentencing, however, did not
comply with the Court's mandate in Penry I. To the extent the Texas
appellate court believed that Penry I was satisfied merely because a
supplemental instruction was given, the court clearly misapprehended
that prior decision. The key under Penry I is that the jury be able
to "consider and give effect to [a defendant's mitigating] evidence in
imposing sentence." 492 U. S., at 319. To the extent the state court
concluded that the substance of the jury instructions given at Penry's
resentencing satisfied Penry I, that determination was objectively
unreasonable. The three special issues submitted to the jury were
identical to the ones found inadequate in Penry I. Although the supplemental instruction mentioned mitigating evidence, the mechanism it
purported to create for the jurors to give effect to that evidence was
ineffective and illogical. The jury was clearly instructed that a "yes"
answer to a special issue was appropriate only when supported by the
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and that a "no" answer was appropriate only when there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the answer
to a special issue should be "yes." The verdict form listed the three
special issues and, with no mention of mitigating circumstances, confirmed and clarified the jury's two choices with respect to each special
issue. In the State's view, however, the jury was also told that it could
ignore these clear guidelines and--even if there was in fact no reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about--answer any special issue in
the negative if the mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence.
In other words, the jury could change one or more truthful "yes" answers to an untruthful "no" answer in order to avoid a death sentence
for Penry. The supplemental instruction thereby made the jury charge
as a whole internally contradictory, and placed law-abiding jurors in
an impossible situation. The comments of the prosecutor and defense
counsel, as well as the comments of the court during voir dire, did

little to clarify the confusion caused by the instructions themselves.
Any realistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental instruction operated would therefore lead to the same conclusion the
Court reached in Penry I: "[A] reasonable juror could well have believed
that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not

786 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1989, we held that Johnny Paul Penry had been sen-tenced to death in violation of the Eighth Amendment because his jury had not been adequately instructed with re-spect to mitigating evidence. See

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I). The State of Texas retried Penry

in 1990, and that jury also found him guilty of capital murderand sentenced him to death. We now consider whether the
jury instructions at Penry's resentencing complied with ourmandate in

Penry I. We also consider whether the admis-sion into evidence of statements from a psychiatric report

based on an uncounseled interview with Penry ran afoul ofthe Fifth Amendment.

I
Johnny Paul Penry brutally raped and murdered PamelaCarpenter on October 25, 1979. In 1980, a Texas jury found

him guilty of capital murder. At the close of the penaltyhearing, the jury was instructed to answer three statutorily
mandated "special issues":

" `(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that causedthe death of the deceased was committed deliberately

and with the reasonable expectation that the death ofthe deceased or another would result;
" `(2) whether there is a probability that the defendantwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and
" `(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct ofthe defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable

in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.' "
Id., at 310 (quoting Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).

The jury answered "yes" to each issue and, as required bystatute, the trial court sentenced Penry to death. 492 U. S.,
at 310-311.

787Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Although Penry had offered extensive evidence that he
was mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a
child, the jury was never instructed that it could consider
and give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing sentence. Id., at 320. Nor was any of the three special issues
broad enough in scope that the jury could consider and give
effect to the mitigating evidence in answering the special
issue. Id., at 322-325. While Penry's mental retardation
was potentially relevant to the first special issue--whether
he had acted deliberately--we found no way to be sure
that the jurors fully considered the mitigating evidence as
it bore on the broader question of Penry's moral culpability.
Id., at 322-323. As to the second issue--whether Penry
would be a future danger--the evidence of his mental retardation and history of abuse was "relevant only as an
aggravating factor." Id., at 323 (emphasis in original).
And the evidence was simply not relevant in a mitigating
way to the third issue--whether Penry had unreasonably
responded to any provocation. Id., at 324-325.

The comments of counsel also failed to clarify the jury's
role. Defense counsel had urged the jurors to vote "no" on
one of the special issues if they believed that Penry, because
of the mitigating evidence, did not deserve to be put to death.
The prosecutor, however, had reminded them of their "oath
to follow the law and . . . answe[r] these questions based on
the evidence and following the law." Id., at 325 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

"In light of the prosecutor's argument, and . . . in the absence of instructions informing the jury that it could consider
and give effect to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental
retardation and abused background by declining to impose
the death penalty," we concluded that "a reasonable juror
could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced
to death based upon his mitigating evidence." Id., at 326,

788 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
328. We thus vacated Penry's sentence, confirming that in
a capital case, "[t]he sentencer must . . . be able to consider
and give effect to [mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence," so that " `the sentence imposed . . . reflec[ts] a reasoned moral response to the defendant's background, character, and crime.' " Id., at 319 (quoting California v. Brown,
479 U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (emphasis
in original)).

Penry was retried in 1990 and again found guilty of capital
murder. During the penalty phase, the defense again put
on extensive evidence regarding Penry's mental impairments
and childhood abuse. One defense witness on the subject of
Penry's mental impairments was Dr. Randall Price, a clinical
neuropsychologist. On direct examination, Dr. Price testified that he believed Penry suffered from organic brain impairment and mental retardation. App. 276-279; 878. In
the course of cross-examining Dr. Price, the prosecutor asked
what records Price had reviewed in preparing his testimony.
Price cited 14 reports, including a psychiatric evaluation of
Penry prepared by Dr. Felix Peebles on May 19, 1977. Id.,
at 327. The Peebles report had been prepared at the request of Penry's then-counsel to determine Penry's competency to stand trial on a 1977 rape charge--unrelated to the
rape and murder of Pamela Carpenter. Id., at 55-60, 125.
The prosecutor asked Dr. Price to read a specific portion
of the Peebles report for the jury. Over the objection of
defense counsel, Dr. Price recited that it was Dr. Peebles'
"professional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from custody, that he would be dangerous to other
persons." Id., at 413. The prosecutor again recited this
portion of the Peebles report during his closing argument.
Id., at 668.

When it came time to submit the case to the jury, the court
instructed the jury to determine Penry's sentence by answering three special issues--the same three issues that

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

789Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
had been put before the jury in Penry I. Specifically, thejury had to determine whether Penry acted deliberately

when he killed Pamela Carpenter; whether there was a prob-ability that Penry would be dangerous in the future; and
whether Penry acted unreasonably in response to provoca-tion. App. 676-678. Cf. Penry I, 492 U. S., at 320.

The court told the jury how to determine its answers tothose issues:

"[B]efore any issue may be answered `Yes,' all jurorsmust be convinced by the evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt that the answer to such issue should be `Yes.' . . .[I]f any juror, after considering the evidence and these
instructions, has a reasonable doubt as to whether theanswer to a Special Issue should be answered `Yes,' then
such juror should vote `No' to that Special Issue."App. 672-673.

The court explained the consequences of the jury's decision:

"[I]f you return an affirmative finding on each of thespecial issues submitted to you, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. You are further in-structed that if you return a negative finding on any
special issue submitted to you, the court shall sen-tence the defendant to the Texas Department of Corrections for life. You are therefore instructed that youranswers to the special issues, which determine the punishment to be assessed the defendant by the court,should be reflective of your finding as to the personal
culpability of the defendant, JOHNNY PAUL PENRY,in this case." Id., at 674-675.

The court then gave the follow i ng "supplementalinstruction":

"You are instructed that when you deliberate on thequestions posed in the special issues, you are to consider

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
790 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect
of the defendant's character and record or circumstances
of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case. If you find that there
are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must
decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing
the defendant's personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue. If you determine, when giving
effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue
under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an
appropriate response to the personal culpability of the
defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of
the special issues." Id., at 675.

A complete copy of the instructions was attached to the
verdict form, and the jury took the entire packet into the
deliberation room. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. The verdict form
itself, however, contained only the text of the three special
issues, and gave the jury two choices with respect to each
special issue: "We, the jury, unanimously find and determine
beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to this Special
Issue is `Yes,' " or "We, the jury, because at least ten (10)
jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired
about in this Special Issue, find and determine that the answer to this Special Issue is `No.' " App. 676-678.

After deliberating for approximately 21/2 hours, the jury
returned its punishment verdict. See 51 Record 1948, 1950.
The signed verdict form confirmed that the jury had unanimously agreed that the answer to each special issue was
"yes." App. 676-678. In accordance with state law, the
court sentenced Penry to death.

791Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Penry'sconviction and sentence. The court rejected Penry's claim

that the admission of language from the 1977 Peebles reportviolated Penry's Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. The court reasoned that because Dr. Peebleshad examined Penry two years prior to the murder of Pamela Carpenter, Penry had not at that time been "confronted
with someone who was essentially an agent for the Statewhose function was to gather evidence that might be used

against him in connection with the crime for which he wasincarcerated."

Penry v. State, 903 S. W. 2d 715, 759-760
(1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

The court also rejected Penry's claim that the jury instructions given at his second sentencing hearing were constitutionally inadequate because they did not permit the jury to
consider and give effect to his mitigating evidence of mental
retardation and childhood abuse. The court cited Penry I
for the proposition that when a defendant proffers "mitigating evidence that is not relevant to the special issues
or that has relevance to the defendant's moral culpability
beyond the scope of the special issues . . . the jury must be
given a special instruction in order to allow it to consider
and give effect to such evidence." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765.
Quoting the supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's
second trial, see supra, at 789-790, the court overruled Penry's claim of error. The court stated that "a nullification instruction such as this one is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I]." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765.

In 1998, after his petition for state habeas corpus relief
was denied, see App. 841 (trial court order); id., at 863 (Court
of Criminal Appeals order), Penry filed a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and
Supp. V) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court rejected both
of Penry's claims, finding that the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals' conclusions on both points were neither contrary

792 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established
federal law. App. 893, 920. After full briefing and argument, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit denied a certificate of appealability. 215 F. 3d 504
(2000).

We stayed Penry's execution and granted certiorari to
consider Penry's constitutional arguments regarding the admission of the Peebles report and the adequacy of the jury
instructions. 531 U. S. 1010 (2000).

II
Because Penry filed his federal habeas petition after the
enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996, the provisions of that law govern the scope of
our review. Specifically, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed.,
Supp. V) prohibits a federal court from granting an application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication
"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."

Last Term in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), we
explained that the "contrary to" and "unreasonable application" clauses of $ 2254(d)(1) have independent meaning.
Id., at 404. A state court decision will be "contrary to"
our clearly established precedent if the state court either
"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth
in our cases," or "confronts a set of facts that are materially
indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent."
Id., at 405-406. A state court decision will be an "unreasonable application of " our clearly established precedent
if it "correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies
it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner's case."
Id., at 407-408.

793Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
"[A] federal habeas court making the `unreasonable appli-cation' inquiry should ask whether the state court's application of clearly established federal law was objectivelyunreasonable." Id., at 409. Distinguishing between an
unreasonable and an incorrect application of federal law, weclarified that even if the federal habeas court concludes that
the state court decision applied clearly established federallaw incorrectly, relief is appropriate only if that application
is also objectively unreasonable. Id., at 410-411.Although the District Court evaluated the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals' disposition of Penry's claims under astandard we later rejected in

Williams, see App. 882 (statingthat an application of law to facts is "unreasonable `only

when it can be said that reasonable jurists considering thequestion would be of one view that the state court ruling was incorrect' " (citation omitted)), the Fifth Circuitarticulated the proper standard of review, as set forth in

$ 2254(d)(1) and clarified in Williams, and denied Penryrelief. Guided by this same standard, we now turn to the
substance of Penry's claims.

III

A

Penry contends that the admission into evidence of theportion of the 1977 Peebles report that referred to Penry's

future dangerousness violated his Fifth Amendment privi-lege against self-incrimination because he was never warned
that the statements he made to Dr. Peebles might later beused against him. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
disagreed, concluding that when Dr. Peebles interviewedPenry, Peebles was not acting as an agent for the State in
order to gather evidence that might be used against Penry.903 S. W. 2d, at 759.

Penry argues that this case is indistinguishable from
Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454 (1981). In Estelle, we con-sidered a situation in which a psychiatrist conducted an

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
794 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
ostensibly neutral competency examination of a capital de-fendant, but drew conclusions from the defendant's uncounseled statements regarding his future dangerousness,and later testified for the prosecution on that crucial issue.
We likened the psychiatrist to "an agent of the State re-counting unwarned statements made in a postarrest custodial setting," and held that "[a] criminal defendant, who
neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts tointroduce any psychiatric evidence, may not be compelled to

respond to a psychiatrist if his statements can be usedagainst him at a capital sentencing proceeding."

Id., at 467-
468. The admission of the psychiatrist's testimony under
those "distinct circumstances" violated the Fifth Amendment. Id., at 466.

This case differs from Estelle in several respects. First,
the defendant in Estelle had not placed his mental condition
at issue, id., at 457, n. 1, whereas Penry himself made his
mental status a central issue in both the 1977 rape case and
his trials for Pamela Carpenter's rape and murder. Second,
in Estelle, the trial court had called for the competency
evaluation and the State had chosen the examining psychiatrist. Id., at 456-457. Here, however, it was Penry's own
counsel in the 1977 case who requested the psychiatric exam
performed by Dr. Peebles. Third, in Estelle, the State
had called the psychiatrist to testify as a part of its affirmative case. Id., at 459. Here, it was during the crossexamination of Penry's own psychological witness that the
prosecutor elicited the quotation from the Peebles report.
And fourth, in Estelle, the defendant was charged with a
capital crime at the time of his competency exam, and it
was thus clear that his future dangerousness would be a
specific issue at sentencing. Penry, however, had not yet
murdered Pamela Carpenter at the time of his interview
with Dr. Peebles.

We need not and do not decide whether these differences affect the merits of Penry's Fifth Amendment claim.

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

795Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
Rather, the question is whether the Texas court's decisionwas contrary to or an unreasonable application of our precedent. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V). We thinkit was not. The differences between this case and

Estelle
are substantial, and our opinion in Estelle suggested that ourholding was limited to the "distinct circumstances" presented there. It also indicated that the Fifth Amendment
analysis might be different where a defendant "intends tointroduce psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase." 451

U. S., at 472. Indeed, we have never extended Estelle'sFifth Amendment holding beyond its particular facts. Cf.,
e. g., Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U. S. 402 (1987) (Estelle
does not apply, and it does not violate the Fifth Amendment,
where a prosecutor uses portions of a psychiatric evaluation
requested by a defendant to rebut psychiatric evidence presented by the defendant at trial). We therefore cannot say
that it was objectively unreasonable for the Texas court to
conclude that Penry is not entitled to relief on his Fifth
Amendment claim.

Even if our precedent were to establish squarely that
the prosecution's use of the Peebles report violated Penry's
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, that
error would justify overturning Penry's sentence only if
Penry could establish that the error " `had substantial
and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's
verdict.' " Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993)
(quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776
(1946)). We think it unlikely that Penry could make such
a showing.

The excerpt from the Peebles report bolstered the State's
argument that Penry posed a future danger, but it was
neither the first nor the last opinion the jury heard on
that point. Four prison officials testified that they were of
the opinion that Penry "would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society."
App. 94, 104, 138; 47 Record 970. Three psychiatrists tes532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tified that Penry was a dangerous individual and likelyto remain so. Two were the State's own witnesses. See

App. 487, 557. The third was Dr. Price--the same defensewitness whom the prosecutor had asked to read from the
Peebles report. Before that recitation, Dr. Price had statedhis own opinion that "[i]f [Penry] was in the free world,
I would consider him dangerous." Id., at 392.While the Peebles report was an effective rhetorical tool,
it was by no means the key to the State's case on the ques-tion whether Penry was likely to commit future acts of
violence. We therefore have considerable doubt that theadmission of the Peebles report, even if erroneous, had a
"substantial and injurious effect" on the verdict. Brechtv.

Abrahamson, supra, at 637. Accordingly, we will notdisturb the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' rejection of

Penry's Fifth Amendment claim.

B
Penry also contends that the jury instructions given athis second sentencing hearing did not comport with our

holding in Penry I because they did not provide the jurywith a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response
to the mitigating evidence of Penry's mental retardationand childhood abuse. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
disagreed. The court summarized Penry I as holding thatwhen a defendant proffers "mitigating evidence that is not
relevant to the special issues or that has relevance to thedefendant's moral culpability beyond the scope of the special
issues . . . the jury must be given a special instruction inorder to allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765. The court then stated thatthe supplemental jury instruction given at Penry's second
sentencing hearing satisfied that mandate. Ibid.The Texas court did not make the rationale of its holding entirely clear. On one hand, it might have believedthat

Penry I was satisfied merely by virtue of the fact that

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

797Cite as: 532 U. S. 782 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
a supplemental instruction had been given. On the otherhand, it might have believed that it was the substance of that

instruction which satisfied Penry I.While the latter seems to be more likely, to the extent
it was the former, the Texas court clearly misapprehendedour prior decision. Penry I did not hold that the mere mention of "mitigating circumstances" to a capital sentencingjury satisfies the Eighth Amendment. Nor does it stand for
the proposition that it is constitutionally sufficient to informthe jury that it may "consider" mitigating circumstances in
deciding the appropriate sentence. Rather, the key under
Penry I is that the jury be able to "consider and give effectto [a defendant's mitigating] evidence in imposing sentence."

492 U. S., at 319 (emphasis added). See also Johnson v.Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 381 (1993) (O'C

onnor, J., dissenting)("[A] sentencer [must] be allowed to give

full considerationand full effect to mitigating circumstances" (emphasis in

original)). For it is only when the jury is given a "vehiclefor expressing its `reasoned moral response' to that evidence
in rendering its sentencing decision," Penry I, 492 U. S., at328, that we can be sure that the jury "has treated the defendant as a `uniquely individual human bein[g]' and hasmade a reliable determination that death is the appropriate
sentence," id., at 319 (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina,428 U. S. 280, 304, 305 (1976)).

The State contends that the substance of the supple-mental instruction satisfied

Penry I because it provided thejury with the requisite vehicle for expressing its reasoned

moral response to Penry's particular mitigating evidence.Specifically, the State points to the admittedly "less than
artful" portion of the supplemental instruction which says:

"If you find that there are any mitigating circumstancesin this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and considerationto them in assessing the defendant's personal culpability
at the time you answer the special issue. If you de532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
termine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence,if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative

finding to the issue under consideration, rather than adeath sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative findingshould be given to one of the special issues." App. 675
(emphasis added). See also Brief for Respondent 16.
We see two possible ways to interpret this confusing in-struction. First, as the portions italicized above indicate,

it can be understood as telling the jurors to take Penry'smitigating evidence into account in determining their truthful answers to each special issue. Viewed in this light, how-ever, the supplemental instruction placed the jury in no better position than was the jury in Penry I. As we made clearin Penry I, none of the special issues is broad enough to
provide a vehicle for the jury to give mitigating effect to theevidence of Penry's mental retardation and childhood abuse.
Cf. 492 U. S., at 322-325. In the words of Judge Dennisbelow, the jury's ability to consider and give effect to Penry's
mitigating evidence was still "shackled and confined withinthe scope of the three special issues." 215 F. 3d, at 514
(dissenting opinion). Thus, because the supplemental in-struction had no practical effect, the jury instructions at
Penry's second sentencing were not meaningfully differ-ent from the ones we found constitutionally inadequate in
Penry I.Alternatively, the State urges, it is possible to understand
the supplemental instruction as informing the jury thatit could "simply answer one of the special issues `no' if it
believed that mitigating circumstances made a life sen-tence . . . appropriate . . . regardless of its initial answers
to the questions." Brief for Respondent 16. The TexasCourt of Criminal Appeals appeared to understand the instruction in this sense, when it termed the supplemental in-struction a "nullification instruction." 903 S. W. 2d, at 765.
Even assuming the jurors could have understood the instruc532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion to operate in this way, the instruction was not as simpleto implement as the State contends. Rather, it made the

jury charge as a whole internally contradictory, and placedlaw-abiding jurors in an impossible situation.

The jury was clearly instructed that a "yes" answer toa special issue was appropriate only when supported "by
the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt." App. 672. A
"no" answer was appropriate only when there was "a rea-sonable doubt as to whether the answer to a Special Issue

should be . . . `Yes.' " Id., at 673. The verdict form listedthe three special issues and, with no mention of mitigating
circumstances, confirmed and clarified the jury's two choices
with respect to each special issue. The jury could swear
that it had unanimously determined "beyond a reasonable
doubt that the answer to this Special Issue is `Yes.' " Id., at
676-678. Or it could swear that at least 10 jurors had "a
reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about in this
Special Issue" and that the jury thus had "determin[ed] that
the answer to this Special Issue is `No.' " Ibid. (emphasis
added).

In the State's view, however, the jury was also told that
it could ignore these clear guidelines and--even if there was
in fact no reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired about--
answer any special issue in the negative if the mitigating
circumstances warranted a life sentence. In other words,
the jury could change one or more truthful "yes" answers to
an untruthful "no" answer in order to avoid a death sentence
for Penry.

We generally presume that jurors follow their instructions. See, e. g., Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 211
(1987). Here, however, it would have been both logically
and ethically impossible for a juror to follow both sets of
instructions. Because Penry's mitigating evidence did not
fit within the scope of the special issues, answering those
issues in the manner prescribed on the verdict form necessarily meant ignoring the command of the supplemental in532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
struction. And answering the special issues in the mode
prescribed by the supplemental instruction necessarily
meant ignoring the verdict form instructions. Indeed, jurors who wanted to answer one of the special issues falsely
to give effect to the mitigating evidence would have had to
violate their oath to render a " `true verdict.' " Tex. Code
Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 35.22 (Vernon 1989).

The mechanism created by the supplemental instruction
thus inserted "an element of capriciousness" into the sentencing decision, "making the jurors' power to avoid the
death penalty dependent on their willingness" to elevate the
supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions.
Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality
opinion). There is, at the very least, "a reasonable likelihood that the jury . . . applied the challenged instruction in
a way that prevent[ed] the consideration" of Penry's mental
retardation and childhood abuse. Boyde v. California, 494
U. S. 370, 380 (1990). The supplemental instruction therefore provided an inadequate vehicle for the jury to make a
reasoned moral response to Penry's mitigating evidence.

Even though the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals focused
solely on the supplemental instruction in affirming Penry's
sentence, the State urges us to evaluate the instruction contextually, with reference to the comments of the prosecutor
and defense counsel, as well as the comments of the court
during voir dire. Indeed, we have said that we will approach jury instructions in the same way a jury would--with
a "commonsense understanding of the instructions in the
light of all that has taken place at the trial." Id., at 381.
Penry I itself illustrates this methodology, as there we evaluated the likely effect on the jury of the comments of the
defense counsel and prosecutor. 492 U. S., at 325-326. As
we did there, however, we conclude that these comments
were insufficient to clarify the confusion caused by the instructions themselves.

Opinion of the Court
Voir dire was a month-long process, during which approxi-mately 90 prospective jurors were interviewed. See 3 Record (index of transcripts). Many of the venire members--including each of the 12 jurors who was eventually empaneled--received a copy of an instruction largely similarto the supplemental instruction ultimately given to the

jury. After each juror read the instruction, the judge attempted to explain how it worked. See, e. g., 18 Record 966-967 ("[I]f you thought the mitigating evidence was sufficient . . . you might, even though you really felt those an-swers [to the three special issues] should be yes, you might
answer one or more of them no . . . so [Penry] could get the
life sentence rather than the death penalty"). The prosecutor then attempted to explain the instruction. See, e. g.,
id., at 980 ("[E]ven though [you] believe all three of these
answers are yes, [you] don't think the death penalty is appropriate for this particular person because of what has happened to him in the past . . . . [The] instruction is to give
effect to that belief and answer one or all of these issues
no"). And with most of the jurors, defense counsel also gave
a similar explanation. See, e. g., id., at 1018 ("[I]f you believe[d] [there] was a mitigating circumstance . . . you [could]
apply that mitigation to answer--going back and changing
an answer from yes to a no").

While these comments reinforce the State's construction of the supplemental instruction, they do not bolster
our confidence in the jurors' ability to give effect to Penry's
mitigating evidence in deciding his sentence. Rather, they
highlight the arbitrary way in which the supplemental instruction operated, and the fact that the jury was essentially
instructed to return a false answer to a special issue in order
to avoid a death sentence.

Moreover, we are skeptical that, by the time their penalty
phase deliberations began, the jurors would have remembered the explanations given during voir dire, much less
taken them as a binding statement of the law. Voir dire

802 PENRY v. JOHNSON

Opinion of the Court
began almost two full months before the penalty phase de-liberations. In the interim, the jurors had observed the rest

of voir dire, listened to a 5-day guilt-phase trial and exten-sive instructions, participated in 2

1/2 hours of deliberations

with respect to Penry's guilt, and listened to another 5-daytrial on punishment. The comments of the court and counsel during voir dire were surely a distant and convoluted
memory by the time the jurors began their deliberations onPenry's sentence.

The State also contends that the closing arguments in thepenalty phase clarified matters. Penry's counsel attempted
to describe the jury's task:

"If, when you thought about mental retardation and the
child abuse, you think that this guy deserves a life sen-tence, and not a death sentence, . . . then, you get to

answer one of . . . those questions no. The Judge hasnot told you which question, and you have to give that
answer, even if you decide the literally correct answeris yes. Not the easiest instruction to follow and the law
does funny things sometimes." App. 640.
Again, however, this explanation only reminded the jurors
that they had to answer the special issues dishonestly inorder to give effect to Penry's mitigating evidence. For the

reasons discussed above, such a "clarification" provided noreal help. Moreover, even if we thought that the arguments
of defense counsel could be an adequate substitute for state-ments of the law by the court, but see

Boyde v. California,
supra, at 384, the prosecutor effectively neutralized defensecounsel's argument, as did the prosecutor in

Penry I, by
stressing the jury's duty "[t]o follow your oath, the evidence
and the law." App. 616. At best, the jury received mixed
signals.

Our opinion in Penry I provided sufficient guidance as
to how the trial court might have drafted the jury charge
for Penry's second sentencing hearing to comply with our

Opinion of the Court
mandate. We specifically indicated that our concerns wouldhave been alleviated by a jury instruction defining the term

"deliberately" in the first special issue "in a way that wouldclearly direct the jury to consider fully Penry's mitigating
evidence as it bears on his personal culpability." 492 U. S.,at 323. The trial court surely could have drafted an instruction to this effect. Indeed, Penry offered two defini-tions of "deliberately" that the trial court refused to give.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 14-15.A clearly drafted catchall instruction on mitigating evidence also might have complied with Penry I. Texas' cur-rent capital sentencing scheme (revised after Penry's second
trial and sentencing) provides a helpful frame of reference.Texas now requires the jury to decide "[w]hether, taking
into consideration all of the evidence, including the cir-cumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and
background, and the personal moral culpability of the de-fendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or
circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life impris-onment rather than a death sentence be imposed." Tex.
Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(2)(e)(1) (Vernon Supp.2001).* Penry's counsel, while not conceding the issue, admitted that he "would have a tough time saying that [PenryI] was not complied with under the new Texas procedure."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. At the very least, the brevity and clar-ity of this instruction highlight the confusing nature of the
supplemental instruction actually given, and indicate thatthe trial court had adequate alternatives available to it as it
drafted the instructions for Penry's trial.Thus, to the extent the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
concluded that the substance of the jury instructions given

at Penry's second sentencing hearing satisfied our mandatein Penry I, that determination was objectively unreasonable.

Cf. Shafer v. South Carolina, ante, at 40, 50 (holding on di-rect review that the South Carolina Supreme Court "incorrectly limited" our holding in Simmons v. South Carolina,512 U. S. 154 (1994), because the court had mischaracterized
"how the State's new [capital sentencing] scheme works").The three special issues submitted to the jury were identical
to the ones we found constitutionally inadequate as appliedin

Penry I. Although the supplemental instruction mademention of mitigating evidence, the mechanism it purported

to create for the jurors to give effect to that evidence wasineffective and illogical. The comments of the court and
counsel accomplished little by way of clarification. Any re-alistic assessment of the manner in which the supplemental
instruction operated would therefore lead to the same con-clusion we reached in Penry I: "[A] reasonable juror could
well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressingthe view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death
based upon his mitigating evidence." 492 U. S., at 326.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed
in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia join, concurring in Parts I, II, and III-A,
and dissenting in Part III-B.

Two Texas juries have now deliberated and reasoned
that Penry's brutal rape and murder of Pamela Carpenterwarrants the death penalty under Texas law. And two opinions of this Court have now overruled those decisions onthe ground that the sentencing courts should have said
more about Penry's alleged mitigating evidence. Because

an opportunity to consider the evidence Penry presented,
I respectfully dissent.

As a habeas reviewing court, we are not called upon to
propose what we believe to be the ideal instruction on how
a jury should take into account evidence related to Penry's
childhood and mental status. Our job is much simpler, and
it is significantly removed from writing the instruction in
the first instance. We must decide merely whether the conclusion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals--that the
sentencing court's supplemental instruction explaining how
the jury could give effect to any mitigating value it found
in Penry's evidence satisfied the requirements of Penry v.
Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I)--was "objectively
unreasonable." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409
(2000). See also 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

At Penry's first sentencing, the court read to the jury
Texas' three special issues for capital sentencing.1 The
court did not instruct the jury that "it could consider the
evidence offered by Penry as mitigating evidence and that
it could give mitigating effect to that evidence in imposing
sentence." 492 U. S., at 320. The prosecutor also did not
offer any way for the jury to give mitigating effect to the
evidence, but instead simply reiterated that the jury was to
answer the three questions and follow the law. In Penry I,
this Court concluded that, "[i]n light of the prosecutor's ar1 The special issues are:
" `(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the
deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation
that the death of the deceased or another would result;

" `(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit
criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to
society; and

" `(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant
in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation,
if any, by the deceased.' " Penry I, 492 U. S. 302, 310 (1989) (quoting Tex.
Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981 and Supp. 1989)).

gument, and in the absence of appropriate jury instructions,a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no

vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did not deserve tobe sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence."
Id., at 326.At Penry's second sentencing, the court read to the jury
the same three special issues. In contrast to the first sen-tencing, however, the court instructed the jury at length that
it could consider Penry's proffered evidence as mitigatingevidence and that it could give mitigating effect to that evidence. See ante, at 789-790. The Texas Court of CriminalAppeals concluded that this supplemental instruction "allow[ed] [the jury] to consider and give effect to" Penry's prof-fered mitigating evidence and therefore was "sufficient to
meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I]." 2 Penryv.

State, 903 S. W. 2d 715, 765 (1995). In my view, this deci-sion is not only objectively reasonable but also compelled by

this Court's precedents and by common sense."In evaluating the instructions, [a court should] not engage
in a technical parsing of this language of the instructions,but instead approach the instructions in the same way that
the jury would--with a `commonsense understanding of theinstructions in the light of all that has taken place at the
trial.' " Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 368 (1993) (quoting
Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 381 (1990)). The Texascourt's instruction, read for common sense, or, even after a

technical parsing, tells jurors that they may consider the

2 This Court's suggestion that the Texas court may have believed that
any supplemental instruction, regardless of its substance, would satisfy
Penry I's requirement, see ante, at 796-797, is specious. The Texas court
explained that a "jury must be given a special instruction in order to
allow it to consider and give effect to such evidence"; it quoted the full
text of the supplemental instruction; and it concluded that "a nullification
instruction such as this one is sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of [Penry I]." Penry v. State, 903 S. W. 2d 715, 765 (1995) (emphasis added). It is quite obvious that the court based its legal conclusion on
the content of the supplemental instruction.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
evidence Penry presented as mitigating evidence and that,if they believe the mitigating evidence makes a death sentence inappropriate, they should answer "no" to one of thespecial issues. Given this straightforward reading of the instructions, it is objectively reasonable, if not eminently logi-cal, to conclude that a reasonable juror would have believed
he had a "vehicle for expressing the view that Penry did notdeserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating
evidence." 492 U. S., at 326.It is true that Penry's proffered evidence did not fit neatly
into any of the three special issues for imposing the deathpenalty under Texas law.

3 But the sentencing court told

the jury in no uncertain terms precisely how to follow thisCourt's directive in

Penry I. First, the sentencing courtinstructed the jury that it could consider such evidence

to be mitigating evidence. See App. 675 ("[W]hen you de-liberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are
to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported bythe evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether
presented by the state or the defendant. A mitigating cir-cumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect
of the defendant's character and record or circumstances ofthe crime which you believe could make a death sentence
inappropriate in this case"). Next, the court explained tothe jury how it must give effect to the evidence.

Ibid.("If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances

in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve,if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them
in assessing the defendant's personal culpability at the timeyou answer the special issue"). And finally, the court unambiguously instructed: "If you determine, when giving

3 I am still bewildered as to why this Court finds it unconstitutional
for Texas to limit consideration of mitigating evidence to those factors
relevant to the three special issues. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S.
461, 478 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring). But we need not address this
broader issue to uphold Penry's sentence.

532US3 Unit: $U64 [09-06-02 19:16:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sen-tence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under

consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appro-priate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special
issues." Ibid. (emphasis added). Without performing legal
acrobatics, I cannot make the instruction confusing. And I
certainly cannot do the contortions necessary to find the
Texas appellate court's decision "objectively unreasonable." 4
I simply do not share the Court's confusion as to how a juror
could consider mitigating evidence, decide whether it makes
a death sentence inappropriate, and respond with a "yes" or
"no" depending on the answer.

4 I think we need not look beyond the court's instructions in evaluating
the Texas appellate court's decision. But even if there were any doubt as
to whether the instruction led the jurors to believe there was a vehicle
for giving mitigating effect to Penry's evidence, the instruction was made
clear " `in the light of all that ha[d] taken place at the trial.' " Johnson v.
Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 368 (1993). The judge and prosecutor fully explained
how to give effect to mitigating evidence during the voir dire process, and
defense counsel made the instruction clear in closing: "[i]f, when you
thought about mental retardation and the child abuse, you think that this
guy deserves a life sentence, and not a death sentence, . . . then, you get
to answer one of . . . those questions no," App. 640. Even if the jurors
had forgotten what they had been told at voir dire, see ante, at 801-802,
an assumption that I find questionable given our presumptions about jurors' ability to remember and follow instructions, see, e. g., Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000), the defense counsel's explanation from closing arguments would have been fresh on their minds.

Despite the Court's assertion that defense counsel told the jurors to
answer the questions dishonestly, ante, at 802, it seems to me that the
jurors reasonably could have believed that they could honestly answer
any question "no" if they found that the death sentence would be inappropriate given the mitigating evidence. They could follow their " `oath, the
evidence and the law,' " ibid. (quoting the prosecutor's statement, App.
616), by truthfully concluding that the evidence of Penry's childhood and
mental status did not warrant the death penalty and by writing "no" next
to one of the special issues.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
Curiously, this Court concludes that the supplemental
instruction "inserted `an element of capriciousness' into the
sentencing decision, `making the jurors' power to avoid
the death penalty dependent on their willingness' to elevate
the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions." Ante, at 800 (quoting Roberts v. Louisiana,
428 U. S. 325, 335 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Any reference
to Roberts, however, is wholly misplaced. Roberts involved
a situation in which the jury was told to find the defendant
guilty of a lesser included offense, unsupported by any evidence, if the jury did not want him to be sentenced to death.
Id., at 334-335. In Penry's case there was no suggestion,
express or implied, made to the jury that it could disregard
the evidence. On the contrary, it was instructed on how to
give effect to Penry's proffered evidence, as required by this
Court in Penry I. Tellingly, the Roberts plurality stated in
full that "[t]here is an element of capriciousness in making
the jurors' power to avoid the death penalty dependent on
their willingness to accept this invitation to disregard the
trial judge's instructions." 428 U. S., at 335 (emphasis
added). In Penry's case, the judge's instructions included
an explanation of how to answer the three special issues and
how to give effect to the mitigating evidence.

Finally, contrary to the Court's claim that the jury received "mixed signals," ante, at 802, it appears that it is
the Texas courts that have received the mixed signals. In
Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976), this Court upheld the
Texas sentencing statute at issue here against attack under
the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The joint opinion
in Jurek concluded that the statute permits the jury "to
consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances
the defense can bring before it" and "guides and focuses
the jury's objective consideration of the particularized
circumstances of the individual offense and the individual
offender before it can impose a sentence of death." Id., at

273-274 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Then, while purporting to distinguish, rather than to overrule, Jurek, this Court in Penry I determined that the sameTexas statute was constitutionally insufficient by not permitting jurors to give effect to mitigating evidence. 492U. S., at 328. See also id., at 355-356 (S

calia, J., dissenting)(explaining how
Penry I contradicts Jurek's conclusions).According to the Court, an instruction informing the jury

that it could give effect to the mitigating evidence wasnecessary. 492 U. S., at 328. And in today's decision, this
Court yet again has second-guessed itself and decided thateven this supplemental instruction is not constitutionally
sufficient.

NORFOLK SHIPBUILDING & DRYDOCK CORP. v.GARRIS,

administratrix of the ESTATE OF

GARRIS, DECEASED

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-346. Argued April 18, 2001--Decided June 4, 2001
In her complaint filed in the District Court, respondent alleged that her

son died as a result of injuries sustained while performing sandblasting
aboard a vessel berthed in the navigable waters of the United States.
She further asserted that the injuries were caused by the negligence
of petitioner and another, and prayed for damages under general maritime law. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to
state a federal claim, stating that no cause of action exists, under general maritime law, for death resulting from negligence. The Fourth
Circuit reversed, explaining that although this Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from
negligence, the principles contained in Moragne v. States Marine Lines,
Inc., 398 U. S. 375, made such an action appropriate.

Held: The general maritime cause of action recognized in Moragne--for

death caused by violation of maritime duties, id., at 409--is available for the negligent breach of a maritime duty of care. Although
Moragne's opinion did not limit its rule to any particular maritime
duty, Moragne's facts were limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and
so the issue of wrongful death for negligence has remained technically open. There is no rational basis, however, for distinguishing
negligence from unseaworthiness. Negligence is no less a maritime
duty than seaworthiness, and the choice-of-law and remedial anomalies
provoked by withholding a wrongful-death remedy are no less severe.
Nor is a negligence action precluded by any of the three relevant federal statutes that provide remedies for injuries and death suffered in
admiralty: the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Because of Congress's
extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many cases that assert
new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave
further development to Congress. See, e. g., American Dredging Co.
v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 455. The cause of action recognized today,
however, is new only in the most technical sense. The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a cen532US3 Unit: $U65 [09-06-02 19:22:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

remanded for further proceedings, explaining that althoughthis Court had not yet recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death resulting from negligence, the prin-ciples contained in our decision in

Moragne v. States MarineLines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375 (1970), made such an action appropriate. 210 F. 3d 209, 211 (2000). Judge Hall concurred inthe judgment because, in her view, Moragne had itself recognized the action. 210 F. 3d, at 222-227. The Court ofAppeals denied petitioner's suggestion for rehearing en
banc, with two judges dissenting. 215 F. 3d 420 (2000). Wegranted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1050 (2000).

II
Three of four issues of general maritime law are settled,and the fourth is before us. It is settled that the general

maritime law imposes duties to avoid unseaworthiness andnegligence, see,

e. g., Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362U. S. 539, 549-550 (1960) (unseaworthiness); Leathers v.

Blessing, 105 U. S. 626, 630 (1882) (negligence), that non-fatal injuries caused by the breach of either duty are compensable, see, e. g., Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., 321 U. S.96, 102-103 (1944) (unseaworthiness); Robins Dry Dock &
Repair Co. v. Dahl, 266 U. S. 449, 457 (1925) (negligence), andthat death caused by breach of the duty of seaworthiness
is also compensable, Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,
supra, at 409. Before us is the question whether death

caused by negligence should, or must under direction of afederal statute, be treated differently.

A
For more than 80 years, from 1886 until 1970, all fourissues were considered resolved, though the third not in the

manner we have just described. The governing rule thenwas the rule of The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, 213 (1886):
Although the general maritime law provides relief for in-juries caused by the breach of maritime duties, it does
not provide relief for wrongful death. The Harrisburg saidthat rule was compelled by the existence of the same rule at
common law, id., at 213-214--although it acknowledged,
id., at 205-212, that admiralty courts had held that damagesfor wrongful death were recoverable under maritime law,

see also Moragne, supra, at 387-388 (listing cases).In 1969, however, we granted certiorari in Moragne v.
States Marine Lines, Inc., supra, for the express purposeof considering "whether The Harrisburg . . . should any
longer be regarded as acceptable law." 398 U. S., at 375-376. We inquired whether the rule of The Harrisburg was
defensible under either the general maritime law or thepolicy displayed in the maritime statutes Congress had since
enacted, 398 U. S., at 379-393, whether those statutes pre-empted judicial action overruling

The Harrisburg, 398 U. S.,at 393-403, whether stare decisis required adherence to

The Harrisburg, 398 U. S., at 403-405, and whether insuper-able practical difficulties would accompany The Harrisburg's
overruling, 398 U. S., at 405-408. Answering every ques-tion no, we overruled the case and declared a new rule of
maritime law: "We . . . hold that an action does lie undergeneral maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties." Id., at 409.As we have noted in an earlier opinion, the wrongful-death
rule of Moragne was not limited to any particular mari-time duty,

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 199, 214, n. 11 (1996) (dictum), but Moragne's factswere limited to the duty of seaworthiness, and so the issue

of wrongful death for negligence has remained techni-cally open. We are able to find no rational basis, however,
for distinguishing negligence from seaworthiness. It is noless a distinctively maritime duty than seaworthiness: The
common-law duties of care have not been adopted and re-tained unmodified by admiralty, but have been adjusted
to fit their maritime context, see, e. g., Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 630-632(1959), and a century ago the maritime law exchanged the

common law's rule of contributory negligence for one ofcomparative negligence, see, e. g., The Max Morris, 137 U. S.
1, 14-15 (1890); Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406,408-409 (1953). Consequently the "tensions and discrepancies" in our precedent arising "from the necessity to ac-commodate state remedial statutes to exclusively maritime
substantive concepts"--which ultimately drove this Courtin

Moragne to abandon The Harrisburg, see 398 U. S., at401--were no less pronounced with maritime negligence

than with unseaworthiness. In fact, both cases cited byMoragne to exemplify those discrepancies involved maritime
negligence, see ibid. (citing Hess v. United States, 361 U. S.314 (1960); Goett v. Union Carbide Corp., 361 U. S. 340 (1960)
(per curiam)); see also Nelson v. United States, 639 F. 2d469, 473 (CA9 1980) (opinion by then-Judge Kennedy) (concluding that uniformity concerns required Moragne's applica-tion to negligence). It is true, as petitioner observes, that
we have held admiralty accommodation of state remedialstatutes to be constitutionally permissible, see, e. g., Western
Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U. S. 233, 242 (1921); The Tungus v.
Skovgaard, 358 U. S. 588, 594 (1959),1 but that does not re1 The issue addressed in Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A. v. Calhoun, 516

Opinion of the Court

solve the issue here: whether requiring such an accommodation by refusing to recognize a federal remedy is preferable
as a matter of maritime policy. We think it is not.

The choice-of-law anomaly occasioned by providing a federal remedy for injury but not death is no less strange when
the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. Of two victims injured at the same instant in the
same location by the same negligence, only one would be
covered by federal law, provided only that the other died of
his injuries. See, e. g., Byrd v. Napoleon Avenue Ferry Co.,
125 F. Supp. 573, 578 (ED La. 1954) (in case involving single
car accident on ferry, applying state negligence law to claim
for deceased husband's wrongful death but federal maritime
negligence law to claim for surviving wife's injuries), aff 'd,
227 F. 2d 958 (CA5 1955) (per curiam). And cutting off the
law's remedy at the death of the injured person is no less "a
striking departure from the result dictated by elementary
principles in the law of remedies," Moragne v. States Marine
Lines, Inc., 398 U. S., at 381, when the duty breached is negligence than when it is seaworthiness. "Where existing law
imposes a primary duty, violations of which are compensable
if they cause injury, nothing in ordinary notions of justice
suggests that a violation should be nonactionable simply because it was serious enough to cause death." Ibid. Finally,
the maritime policy favoring recovery for wrongful death
that Moragne found implicit in federal statutory law cannot
be limited to unseaworthiness, for both of the federal Acts
on which Moragne relied permit recovery for negligence, see
Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a); Death on the High Seas
Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 761 et seq.; see also Engel
v. Davenport, 271 U. S. 33, 36-37 (1926) (Jones Act). In sum,
a negligent breach of a maritime duty of care being assumed

Court dismissed her state-law claim on jurisdictional grounds, respondent
re-filed it in state court, where it was resolved against her. See Brief for

Opinion of the Court
by the posture of this case,2 no rational basis within themaritime law exists for denying respondent the recovery

recognized by Moragne for the death of her son.

B
Weightier arguments against recognizing a wrong ful-death action for negligence may be found not within general maritime law but without, in the federal statutes thatprovide remedies for injuries and death suffered in admiralty. As we explained in Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,498 U. S. 19, 27 (1990), "[w]e no longer live in an era when
seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to thecourts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury
and death; Congress . . . [has] legislated extensively in theseareas." And, even in admiralty, "we have no authority to
substitute our views for those expressed by Congress in aduly enacted statute." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,
436 U. S. 618, 626 (1978). Hence, when a statute resolvesa particular issue, we have held that the general maritime
law must comply with that resolution. See, e. g., Dooleyv. Korean Air Lines Co., 524 U. S. 116, 123-124 (1998). We
must therefore make careful study of the three statutesrelevant here.

1
The Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a), establishes a causeof action for negligence for injuries or death suffered in the

course of employment, but only for seamen. See generally
Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (describing testfor seaman status). Respondent's son, who was not a seaman, was not covered by the Jones Act, and we have heldthat the Jones Act bears no implication for actions brought

2 The District Court dismissed the case for the threshold reason that,
regardless of a negligent breach, there could be no recovery. See supra,
at 813. Petitioner therefore will be free to present its arguments regarding duty and breach on remand to the extent they have been preserved.

Opinion of the Court

by nonseamen. See, e. g., American Export Lines, Inc. v.
Alvez, 446 U. S. 274, 282-283 (1980). Moreover, even as to
seamen, we have held that general maritime law may provide wrongful-death actions predicated on duties beyond
those that the Jones Act imposes. See, e. g., Miles v. Apex
Marine Corp., supra, at 28-30 (seaworthiness). The Jones
Act does not preclude respondent's negligence action.

DOHSA creates wrongful-death actions for negligence
and unseaworthiness, see Moragne, supra, at 395, but only
by the personal representatives of people killed "beyond a
marine league from the shore of any State," 46 U. S. C. App.

$ 761. Respondent's son was killed in state territorial waters, where DOHSA expressly provides that its provisions
"shall . . . [not] apply," $ 767. In Moragne, after discussing
the anomalies that would result if DOHSA were interpreted
to preclude federal maritime causes of action even where
its terms do not apply, 398 U. S., at 395-396, we held that
DOHSA "was not intended to preclude the availability of a
remedy for wrongful death under general maritime law in
situations not covered by the Act," id., at 402. Or, "[t]o put
it another way, . . . no intention appears that the Act have
the effect of foreclosing any nonstatutory federal remedies
that might be found appropriate to effectuate the policies of
general maritime law." Id., at 400. DOHSA therefore does
not pre-empt respondent's negligence action.

Finally, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C.

$ 901 et seq., provides nonseaman maritime workers such as
respondent's son, see $ 902(3) (defining covered employees),
with no-fault workers' compensation claims (against their
employer, $ 904(b)) and negligence claims (against the vessel,

$ 905(b)) for injury and death. As to those two defendants,
the LHWCA expressly pre-empts all other claims, $$ 905(a),
(b); but cf. Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 447 U. S. 715,
723-726 (1980) (holding some state workers' compensation
claims against employer not pre-empted), but it expressly

Opinion of the Court
preserves all claims against third parties, $$ 933(a), (i). Andpetitioner is a third party: It neither employed respondent's

son nor owned the vessel on which he was killed.Petitioner argues, however, that $ 933's preservation-ofother-claims provisions express Congress's intent to reserveall other wrongful-death actions to the States. That argument cannot withstand our precedent, since we have consistently interpreted $ 933 to preserve federal maritimeclaims as well as state claims, see,

e. g., Seas Shipping Co.
v. Sieracki, 328 U. S. 85, 100-102 (1946); Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U. S. 106, 113 (1974), including maritime negligence claims, see, e. g., Pope & Talbot,
Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S., at 411-413 (upholding recovery for
negligence under maritime law by longshoreman coveredby the LHWCA). Petitioner's further contention--that

the policy implicit in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCAbars a maritime action for wrongful death though the
text of those amendments (which left $ 933 unchanged) per-mits it--cannot succeed. We do not find, as petitioner
does, an anti-maritime-wrongful-death policy implicit in the
amendment to $ 905(b), see 86 Stat. 1263, which eliminatedcovered workers' unseaworthiness claims against a vessel,

see, e. g., Bloomer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 445 U. S. 74, 83
(1980) ("Congress abolished the unseaworthiness remedy for
longshoremen, recognized in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki,
328 U. S. 85 (1946)"). That amendment was directed not
at wrongful death in particular, but at unseaworthiness
generally, see Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 262 (1979) ("Congress acted in
1972, among other things, to eliminate the shipowner's liability to the longshoreman for unseaworthiness . . .--in other
words, to overrule Sieracki"). To the extent the amendment to $ 905(b) reflects any policy relevant here, it is in
expressly ratifying longshore and harbor workers' claims
against the vessel for negligence, see id., at 259-260. The
LHWCA therefore does not preclude this negligence action
for wrongful death.

Even beyond the express pre-emptive reach of federalmaritime statutes, however, we have acknowledged that

they contain a further prudential effect. "While there isan established and continuing tradition of federal common
lawmaking in admiralty, that law is to be developed, insofaras possible, to harmonize with the enactments of Congress
in the field." American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S.443, 455 (1994). Cf.

Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A.v.
Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 332-333 (1999)(equitable lawmaking power of bankruptcy courts limited

by statute). Because of Congress's extensive involvementin legislating causes of action for maritime personal injuries,
it will be the better course, in many cases that assert newclaims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow,
to leave further development to Congress. The cause of ac-tion we recognize today, however, is new only in the most
technical sense. The general maritime law has recognizedthe tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has
been clear since Moragne that breaches of a maritime dutyare actionable when they cause death, as when they cause
injury. Congress's occupation of this field is not yet so ex-tensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already
logically compelled by our precedents.

The maritime cause of action that Moragne establishedfor unseaworthiness is equally available for negligence.

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

I join all but Part II-B-2 of the Court's opinion.Following the reasoning in

the maritime cause of action Moragne established for un-seaworthiness is equally available for negligence. I agree

with the Court's clear opinion with one reservation. In PartII-B-2, the Court counsels: "Because of Congress's extensive involvement in legislating causes of action for mari-time personal injuries, it will be the better course, in many
cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes . . .allow, to leave further development to Congress."

Ante,at 820. Moragne itself, however, tugs in the opposite direction. Inspecting the relevant legislation, the Court inMoragne found no measures counseling against the judicial
elaboration of general maritime law there advanced. See398 U. S., at 399-402, 409; see also id., at 393 ("Where death
is caused by the breach of a duty imposed by federal mari-time law, Congress has established a policy favoring recovery in the absence of a legislative direction to except a par-ticular class of cases."). In accord with Moragne, I see
development of the law in admiralty as a shared venture inwhich "federal common lawmaking" does not stand still, but
"harmonize[s] with the enactments of Congress in the field."
Ante, at 820 (quoting American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510U. S. 443, 455 (1994)). I therefore do not join the Court's

UNITED DOMINION INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

UNITED STATES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-157. Argued March 26, 2001--Decided June 4, 2001
Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a "net operating loss" (NOL)

results from deductions in excess of gross income for a given year.
26 U. S. C. $ 172(c). A taxpayer may carry its NOL either backward
or forward to other tax years in order to set off its lean years against
its lush years. $ 172(b)(1)(A). The carryback period for "product liability loss[es]" is 10 years. $ 172(b)(1)(I). Because a product liability
loss (PLL) is the total of a taxpayer's product liability expenses (PLEs)
up to the amount of its NOL, $ 172(j)(1), a taxpayer with a positive
annual income, and thus no NOL, may have PLEs but can have no PLL.
An affiliated group of corporations may file a single consolidated return.

$ 1501. Treasury Regulations provide that such a group's "consolidated
taxable income" (CTI), or, alternatively, its "consolidated net operating
loss" (CNOL), is determined by taking into account several items, the
first of which is the "separate taxable income" (STI) of each group
member. In calculating STI, the member must disregard items such
as capital gains and losses, which are considered, and factored into CTI
or CNOL, on a consolidated basis. Petitioner's predecessor in interest,
AMCA International Corporation, was the parent of an affiliated group
filing consolidated returns for the years 1983 through 1986. In each
year, AMCA reported CNOL exceeding the aggregate of its 26 individual members' PLEs. Five group members with PLEs reported
positive STIs. Nonetheless, AMCA included those PLEs in determining its PLL for 10-year carryback under a "single-entity" approach in
which it compared the group's CNOL and total PLEs to determine the
group's total PLL. In contrast, the Government's "separate-member"
approach compares each affiliate's STI and PLEs in order to determine whether each affiliate suffers a PLL, and only then combines
any PLLs of the individual affiliates to determine a consolidated PLL.
Under this approach, PLEs incurred by an affiliate with positive STI
cannot contribute to a PLL. In 1986 and 1987, AMCA petitioned the
Internal Revenue Service for refunds based on its PLL calculations.
The IRS ruled in AMCA's favor, but was reversed by a joint congressional committee that controls refunds exceeding a certain thresh532US3 Unit: $U66 [09-06-02 19:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
old. AMCA then filed this refund action. The District Court applied
AMCA's single-entity approach, concluding that so long as the affiliated
group's consolidated return reflects CNOL in excess of the group's
aggregate PLEs, the total of those expenses is a PLL that may be
carried back. In reversing, the Fourth Circuit applied the separatemember approach.

Held: An affiliated group's PLL must be figured on a consolidated, singleentity basis, not by aggregating PLLs separately determined company
by company. Pp. 829-838.

(a) The single-entity approach to calculating an affiliated group's
PLL is straightforward. The first step in applying $ 172(j)'s definition of PLL requires a taxpayer filing a consolidated return to calculate an NOL. The Code and regulations governing affiliated groups
of corporations filing consolidated returns provide only one definition
of NOL: "consolidated" NOL. The absence of a separate NOL for a
group member in this context is underscored by the fact that the regulations provide a measure of separate NOL in a different context,
for any year in which an affiliated corporation files a separate return.
The exclusive definition of NOL as CNOL at the consolidated level is
important. Neither the Code nor the regulations indicate that the essential relationship between NOL and PLL for a consolidated group
differs from their relationship for a conventional corporate taxpayer.
Comparable treatment of PLL for the group and the conventional
taxpayer can be achieved only if PLEs are compared with the loss
amount at the consolidated level after CNOL has been determined, for
CNOL is the only NOL measure for the group. An approach based
on comparable treatment is also (relatively) easy to understand and to
apply. Pp. 829-831.

(b) The case for the separate-member approach is not so easily
made. Because there is no NOL below the consolidated level, there
is nothing for comparison with PLEs to produce a PLL at any stage
before the CNOL calculation. Thus, a separate-member proponent
must identify some figure in the consolidated return scheme with a
plausible analogy to NOL at the affiliated corporations level. An individual member's STI is not analogous, for it excludes several items
that an individual taxpayer would normally count in computing income
or loss, but which an affiliated group may tally only at the consolidated
level. The "separate net operating loss," Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-79(a)(3),
used by the Fourth Circuit fares no better. Although that figure accounts for some gains or losses that STI does not, $ 1.1502-79(a)(3)'s
purpose is to allocate CNOL to an affiliate member seeking to carry

back a loss to a year in which the member was not part of the consolidated group. Such returns are not at issue here. Pp. 831-834.

(c) Several objections to the single-entity approach--that it allows
affiliated groups a double deduction, that the omission of PLEs from
the series of items that Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-12 requires to be tallied
at the consolidation level indicates that PLEs were not meant to be
tallied at that level, and that the single-entity approach would permit
significant tax avoidance abuses--are rejected. Pp. 834-838.

Under $ 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,
a taxpayer may carry back its "product liability loss" up to
10 years in order to offset prior years' income. The issue
here is the method for calculating the product liability loss
of an affiliated group of corporations electing to file a consolidated federal income tax return. We hold that the group's
product liability loss must be figured on a consolidated basis
in the first instance, and not by aggregating product liability
losses separately determined company by company.

Opinion of the Court

I
A "net operating loss" results from deductions in excess of
gross income for a given year. 26 U. S. C. $ 172(c).1 Under

$ 172(b)(1)(A), a taxpayer may carry its net operating loss
either backward to past tax years or forward to future tax
years in order to "set off its lean years against its lush years,
and to strike something like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year," Libson Shops,
Inc. v. Koehler, 353 U. S. 382, 386 (1957).

Although the normal carryback period was at the time
three years, in 1978, Congress authorized a special 10-
year carryback for "product liability loss[es]," 26 U. S. C.

$ 172(b)(1)(I), since, it understood, losses of this sort tend
to be particularly "large and sporadic." Joint Committee
on Taxation, General Explanation of the Revenue Act of
1978, 95th Cong., 232 (Comm. Print 1979). The Code defines
"product liability loss," for a given tax year, as the lesser of
(1) the taxpayer's "net operating loss for such year" and
(2) its allowable deductions attributable to product liability
"expenses." 26 U. S. C. $ 172( j)(1). In other words, a taxpayer's product liability loss (PLL) is the total of its product
liability expenses (PLEs), limited to the amount of its net
operating loss (NOL). By definition, then, a taxpayer with
positive annual income, and thus no NOL, may have PLEs
but can have no PLL.2

1 Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V), as in
effect between 1983 and 1986, the tax years here in question.

2 If, for example, a company had $100 in taxable income, $50 in deductible PLEs, and $75 in additional deductions, its NOL would be $25
(i. e., $100\Delta $50\Delta $75\Theta  \Delta $25); it could count only $25 of its $50 in PLEs
as PLL. If the company had $100 in income, $50 in PLEs, and $125 in
additional deductions, its NOL would be $75, and it could count its entire
$50 in PLEs as PLL. And, finally, if the company had $100 in income,
$50 in PLEs, and $40 in additional deductions, it would have positive income and, thus, no NOL and no PLL.

UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

Instead of requiring each member company of "[a]n af-filiated group of corporations" to file a separate tax return,

the Code permits the group to file a single consolidated re-turn, 26 U. S. C. $ 1501, and leaves it to the Secretary of
the Treasury to work out the details by promulgating regu-lations governing such returns, $ 1502. Under Treas. Regs.

$$ 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f),3 an affiliated group's "consolidated taxable income" (CTI), or, alternatively, its "con-solidated net operating loss" (CNOL), is determined by

"taking into account" several items. The first is the "sepa-rate taxable income" (STI) of each group member. A member's STI (whether positive or negative) is computed asthough the member were a separate corporation (

i. e., by
netting income and expenses), but subject to several im-portant "modifications." Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-12. These

modifications require a group member calculating its STI todisregard, among other items, its capital gains and losses,
charitable-contribution deductions, and dividends-receiveddeductions.

Ibid. These excluded items are accounted for
on a consolidated basis, that is, they are combined at the
level of the group filing the single return, where deductionsotherwise attributable to one member (say, for a charitable

contribution) can offset income received by another (from acapital gain, for example). Treas. Regs. $$ 1.1502-11(a)(3)
to (8); 1.1502-21(f)(2) to (6). A consolidated group's CTI orCNOL, therefore, is the sum of each member's STI, plus
or minus a handful of items considered on a consolidatedbasis.

consolidated tax returns for the years 1983 through 1986.In each of these years, AMCA reported CNOL (the lowest

being $85 million and the highest, $140 million) that ex-ceeded the aggregate of its 26 individual members' PLEs
($3.5 million to $6.5 million). This case focuses on thePLEs of five of AMCA's member companies, which, together,
generated roughly $205,000 in PLEs in 1983, $1.6 millionin 1984, $1.3 million in 1985, and $250,000 in 1986. No one
disputes these amounts or their characterization as PLEs.See 208 F. 3d 452, 453 (CA4 2000) ("The parties agree" with
respect to the amount of "the product liability expenses in-curred by the five group members in the relevant years").
Rather, the sole question here is whether the AMCA af-filiated group may include these amounts on its consolidated return, in determining its PLL for 10-year carryback.The question arises because of the further undisputed fact
that in each of the relevant tax years, each of the five compa-nies in question (with minor exceptions not relevant here),
reported a positive STI.AMCA answered this question by following what commentators have called a "single-entity" approach 4 to calcu-lating its "consolidated" PLL. For each tax year, AMCA
(1) calculated its CNOL pursuant to Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-11(a), and (2) aggregated its individual members' PLEs.
Because, as noted above, for each tax year AMCA's CNOLwas greater than the sum of its members' PLEs, AMCA
treated the full amount of the PLEs as consolidated PLLeligible for 10-year carryback. In AMCA's view, the fact
that several member companies throwing off large PLEsalso, when considered separately, generated positive taxable
income was of no significance.From the Government's perspective, however, the fact
that the several affiliated members with PLEs also gen4 Axelrod & Blank, The Supreme Court, Consolidated Returns, and 10-

Opinion of the Court

erated positive separate taxable income is of critical signifi-cance. According to the Government's methodology, which

we will call the "separate-member" approach,5 PLEs in-curred by an affiliate with positive separate taxable income
cannot contribute to a PLL eligible for 10-year carryback.Whereas AMCA compares the group's total income (or loss)
and total PLEs in an effort to determine the group's total
PLL, the Government compares each affiliate's STI andPLEs in order to determine whether each affiliate suffers

a PLL, and only then combines any PLLs of the individualaffiliates to determine a consolidated PLL amount.

In 1986 and 1987, AMCA petitioned the Internal RevenueService for refunds of taxes based on its PLL calculations.
The IRS first ruled in AMCA's favor but was reversed bythe Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation of the
United States Congress, which controls refunds exceeding acertain threshold, 26 U. S. C. $ 6405(a). AMCA then filed
this refund action in the United States District Court for
the Western District of North Carolina. The District Court
agreed with AMCA that an affiliated group's PLL is determined on a single-entity basis, and held that, so long
as the group's consolidated return reflects CNOL in excess
of the group's aggregate PLEs, the total of those expenses
(including those incurred by members with positive separate taxable income) is a PLL that "may be carried back
the full ten years." No. 3:95-CV-341-MU (June 19, 1998),

6 We now reverse.

III
The case for the single-entity approach to calculating anaffiliated group's PLL is straightforward. Section 172( j)(1)

defines a taxpayer's "product liability loss" for a given taxyear as the lesser of its "net operating loss for such year"
and its product liability "expenses." In order to apply thisdefinition, the taxpayer first determines whether it has
taxable income or NOL, and in making that calculation itsubtracts PLEs. If the result is NOL, the taxpayer then
makes a simple comparison between the NOL figure andthe total PLEs. The PLE total becomes the PLL to the
extent it does not exceed NOL. That is, until NOL has beendetermined, there is no PLL.

The first step in applying the definition and methodol-ogy of PLL to a taxpayer filing a consolidated return thus
requires the calculation of NOL. As United Dominion cor-rectly points out, the Code and regulations governing affiliated groups of corporations filing consolidated returns pro-vide only one definition of NOL: "consolidated" NOL, see
Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-21(f ). There is no definition of separateNOL for a member of an affiliated group. Indeed, the fact
that Treasury Regulations do provide a measure of separateNOL in a different context, for an affiliated corporation as
to any year in which it filed a separate return, infra, at 832-834, underscores the absence of such a measure for an affili6 Intermet involved "specified liability losses" (SLLs), not PLLs. The
difference, however, does not matter. The PLL was a statutory predecessor to the SLL, and PLLs were folded into the SLL provision in

$ 11811(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, 104 Stat.
1388-532. Thus, "[i]n all relevant respects, the provisions on [PLLs] and
SLLs are the same." Leatherman, Current Developments for Consolidated Groups, 486 PLI/Tax 389, 393, n. 5 (2000) (hereinafter Leatherman,

ated corporation filing as a group member. Given thisapparently exclusive definition of NOL as CNOL in the

instance of affiliated entities with a consolidated return (andfor reasons developed below, infra, at 834-838) we think it
is fair to say, as United Dominion says, that the concept ofseparate NOL "simply does not exist." Brief for Petitioner
15.7 The exclusiveness of NOL at the consolidated level asCNOL is important here for the following reasons. The
Code's authorization of consolidated group treatment con-tains no indication that for a consolidated group the essential
relationship between NOL and PLL will differ from theirrelationship for a conventional corporate taxpayer. Nor
does any Treasury Regulation purport to change the rela-tionship in the consolidated context. If, then, the relationship is to remain essentially the same, the key to understand-ing it lies in the regulations' definition of net operating loss
exclusively at the consolidated level. Working back fromthat, PLEs should be considered first in calculating CNOL,
and they are: because any PLE of an affiliate affects the cal-culation of its STI, that same PLE necessarily affects the
CTI or CNOL in exactly the same way, dollar for dollar.And because, by definition, there is no NOL measure for a
consolidated return group or any affiliate except CNOL,PLEs cannot be compared with any NOL to produce PLL
until CNOL has been calculated. Then, and only then in thecase of the consolidated filer, can total PLEs be compared

7 In addition to Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-79(a)(3), discussed infra, at 832-834,
two other provisions, 26 U. S. C. $ 1503(f)(2) and the current version
(though not the version applicable between 1983 and 1986) of Treas. Reg.

$ 1502-21(b) (2000), refer to separate group members' NOLs. The parties
here have not emphasized those provisions, and with good reason. Not
only are they inapplicable to the question before us (either substantively,
temporally, or both), but, as one commentator has observed, their references to separate NOLs "ste[m] more from careless drafting than meaningful design." Leatherman, Are Separate Liability Losses Separate for
Consolidated Groups?, 52 Tax. Law. 663, 705 (1999) (hereinafter Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses).

Opinion of the Court
with a net operating loss. In sum, comparable treatment ofPLL in the instances of the usual corporate taxpayer and

group filing a consolidated return can be achieved only if thecomparison of PLEs with a limiting loss amount occurs at the
consolidated level after CNOL has been determined. Thisapproach resting on comparable treatment has a further virtue entitled to some weight in case of doubt: it is (relatively)
easy to understand and to apply.The case for the separate-member approach, advanced

(in one variant) by the Government and adopted (on a dif-ferent rationale) by the Court of Appeals, is not so easily
made. In the analysis of comparable treatment just set
out, of course, there is no NOL below the consolidated level
and hence nothing for comparison with PLEs to produce
PLL at any stage before the CNOL calculation. At the
least, then, a proponent of the separate-member approach
must identify some figure in the consolidated return scheme
that could have a plausible analogy to NOL at the level of
the affiliated corporations. See A. Dubroff, J. Blanchard,
J. Broadbent, & K. Duvall, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations Filing Consolidated Returns $ 41.04[06], p. 41-75
(2d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Dubroff) ("Even if separate entity treatment was appropriate, it is unclear how a member
with [PLEs] would compute its separate NOL"). The Government and the Court of Appeals have suggested different
substitute measures. Neither one works.

The Government has argued that an individual group
member's STI, as determined under Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-12,
is analogous to a "separate" NOL, so that an affiliate's STI
may be compared with its PLEs in order to determine any
separate PLL. An individual member's PLL would be the
amount of its separate PLEs up to the amount of its negative
STI; a member having positive STI could have no PLL.

The Government claims that an STI-based comparison
places the group member closest to the position it would
have occupied if it had filed a separate return. But that

832 UNITED DOMINION INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

is simply not so. We have seen already that the calcula-tion of a group member's STI by definition excludes several

items that an individual taxpayer would normally accountfor in computing income or loss, but which an affiliated
group may tally only at the consolidated level, such as cap-ital gains and losses, charitable-contribution deductions, and
dividends-received deductions. Treas. Regs. $$ 1.1502-12( j)
to (n). Owing to these exclusions, an affiliate's STI will tendto be inflated by eliminating deductions it would have taken

if it had filed separately, or deflated by eliminating an incomeitem like capital gain.

When pushed, the Government concedes that STI is "not
necessarily equivalent to the income or [NOL] figure that
the corporation would have computed if it had filed a separate return." Brief for United States 21, n. 14. But, the
Government claims, "[t]here has never been a taxpayer with
[PLEs] who had a positive [STI] but a negative separate
[NOL]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. In other words, the Government says that the deductions excluded from STI have never
once made a difference and, therefore, that STI is, in fact, a
decent enough proxy for a group member's "separate" NOL.
But whether or not the excluded items have made a difference in the past, or make a difference here, they certainly
could make a difference and, given the potential importance
of some of the deductions involved (a large charitable contribution, for example), it is not hard to see how the difference
could favor the Government.

The Court of Appeals was therefore right to reject the
Government's reliance on STI as a functional surrogate for
an affiliate's "separate" NOL. 208 F. 3d, at 459-460. But
what the Court of Appeals used in place of STI fares no
better. The court relied on Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-79, which
contains a definition of "separate net operating loss" that
the court believed to be "analogous to an individual's `net
operating loss' on a separate return." 208 F. 3d, at 460.
Section 1.1502-79(a)(3) provides that, "[f]or purposes of this

532US3 Unit: $U66 [09-06-02 19:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
subparagraph," the "separate net operating loss of a memberof the group shall be determined under $ 1.1502-12 . . . ,

adjusted for the . . . items taken into account in the com-putation of " the CNOL. As the Court of Appeals said, the
directive of $ 1.1502-79(a)(3) (unlike the definition of STI)"takes into account, for example, [a] member's charitable
contributions" and other consolidated deductions. 208 F. 3d,
at 460-461.But this sounds too good. It is true that, insofar as

$ 1.1502-79(a)(3) accounts for gains and losses that STI doesnot, it gets closer to a commonsense notion of a group member's "separate" NOL than STI does. But the fact that

$ 1.1502-79(a)(3) improves on STI simply by undoing what

$ 1.1502-12 requires in defining STI is suspicious, and the
suspicion turns out to be justified. Section 1.1502-79(a)(3)
unbakes the cake for only one reason, and that reason has
no application here. The definition on which the Court of
Appeals relied applies, by its terms, only "for purposes of "

$ 1.1502-79(a)(3), and context makes clear that the purpose
is to provide a way to allocate CNOL to an affiliate member that seeks to carry back a loss to a "separate return
year," that is, to a year in which the member was not part
of the consolidated group. See Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-79
(titled "Separate return years"); $ 1.1502-79(a) (titled "Carryover and carryback of [CNOL] to separate return years");

$ 1.1502-79(a)(1) ("[i]f a [CNOL] can be carried . . . to a separate return year . . ."). No separate return years are at
issue before us; all NOL carrybacks relevant here apply to
years in which the five corporations were affiliated in the
group. The Court of Appeals thus applied concepts addressing separate return years to a determination for a consolidated return year, without any statutory or regulatory basis
for doing so. Cf. 49 Fed. Reg. 30530 (1984) ("[A]lthough the
consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to individual
members for purposes of carry backs to separate return

Opinion of the Court

separate NOLs of each member"). Hence, while $ 1.1502-79might not distort an affiliate's separate NOL in the same way

that STI does, the facial inapplicability of that regulationonly underscores the exclusive concern of $ 1.1502-11(a) with
consolidated NOL.In sum, neither method for computing PLL on a separatemember basis squares with the notion of comparability asapplied to consolidated return regulations. On the contrary,
by expressly and exclusively defining NOL as CNOL, theregulations support the position that group members' PLEs
should be aggregated and the affiliated group's PLL deter-mined on a consolidated, single-entity basis.

IV
Several objections have been raised to a single-entity ap-proach to calculating PLL that we have not considered

yet. First, the Government insists that a single-entity ruleallows affiliated groups a "double deduction." The Government argues that because PLEs are not included among thespecific items (charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) for
which consolidated, single-entity treatment is required underTreas. Reg. $ 1.1502-12, PLEs are "consumed" or "used up"
in computing members' STIs, which, pursuant to Treas.Regs. $$ 1.1502-11(a) and 1.1502-21(f ), are then used to calculate the group's CTI or CNOL. According to the Govern-ment, to permit the use of PLEs first to reduce an individual
member's STI and then to contribute to an aggregate PLLfor carryback purposes would be tantamount to a double
deduction.The double-deduction argument may have superficial appeal, but any appeal it has rests on a fundamental mis-conception of the function of STI in computing an affiliated
group's tax liability. Calculation of a group member's STIis not in and of itself the basis for any tax event, and there
is no separate tax saving when STI is calculated; that occursonly when deductions on the consolidated return equal in532US3 Unit: $U66 [09-06-02 19:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

835Cite as: 532 U. S. 822 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
come and (if they exceed income and produce a CNOL) arecarried back against prior income. STI is merely an accounting construct devised as an interim step in computinga group's CTI or CNOL; it "has no other purpose."

Intermet, 209 F. 3d, at 906 ("A member's STI is simply a stepalong the way to calculating the group's taxable income or

CNOL"). The fact that a group member's PLEs reduce
its STI, which in turn either reduces the group's CTI or con-tributes to its CNOL "dollar for dollar,"

ibid., is of no other
moment.8 If there were anything wrong in what UnitedDominion proposes to do, it would be wrong in relation to

CNOL and its use for any carryback. Yet, as noted above,no one here disputes that the group members had PLEs in
the total amount claimed or that the AMCA group is entitledto carry back the full amount of its CNOL to offset income
in prior years. The only question is what portion, if any, ofAMCA's CNOL is PLL and, as such, eligible for 10-year,
as opposed to 3-year, carryback treatment. There is no
more of a double deduction with a 10-year carryback than
one for three years.

A second objection was the reason that the Court of
Appeals rejected the single-entity approach. That court
attached dispositive significance to the fact that, while the
Treasury Regulation we have discussed, $ 1.1502-12, specifically provides that several items (capital gains and losses,
charitable-contribution deductions, etc.) shall be accounted
for on a consolidated basis, it does not similarly provide
for accounting for PLEs on a consolidated basis: "The regulations provide for blending the group members' [NOLs],

8 It makes no difference whatsoever whether the affiliate's PLEs are
(1) first netted against each member's income and then aggregated or
(2) first aggregated and then netted against the group's combined income:
under either method, AMCA's CNOL is the same. See Axelrod & Blank
1394 (noting that this conclusion follows from "the associative principle of
arithmetic (which holds that the groupings of items in the case of addition
and subtraction have no effect on the result)").

Opinion of the Court

and they explicitly define [CNOL] without an accompanyingreference to consolidated [PLEs]. This omission . . . makes

clear that blending those expenses is not permitted . . . ."208 F. 3d, at 458.

We think the omission of PLEs from the series of itemsthat $ 1.1502-12 requires to be tallied at the consolidated
level has no such clear lesson, however. The logic that invests the omission with significance is familiar: the men-tion of some implies the exclusion of others not mentioned.

Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and
Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 168 (1993) ("Expressio
unius est exclusio alterius"). But here, as always, the
soundness of that premise is a function of timing: if there
was a good reason to consider the treatment of consolidated
PLL at the time the regulation was drawn, then omitting
PLL from the list of items for consolidated treatment may
well have meant something. But if there was no reason to
consider PLL then, its omission would mean nothing at all.
And in fact there was no reason. When the consolidated
return regulations were first promulgated in 1966, there was
no carryback provision pegged to PLEs or PLLs; those
notions did not become separate carryback items until 1978,
when the 10-year rule was devised. See Revenue Act of
1978, $ 371, 92 Stat. 2859; see also Leatherman, Current Developments 393, n. 5. Omission of PLEs or PLLs from the
series set out for consolidated treatment in the 1966 regulation therefore meant absolutely nothing in 1966. The issue,
then, is the significance, not of omission, but of failure to
include later: has the significance of the earlier regulation
changed solely because the Treasury has never amended it,
even though PLL is now a separate carryback? We think
that is unlikely. The Treasury's relaxed approach to amending its regulations to track Code changes is well documented.
See e. g., Dubroff 41-72, n. 193; Axelrod & Blank 1391; Leatherman, Separate Liability Losses 708-709. The absence of
any amendment to $ 1.1502-12 that might have added PLEs

Opinion of the Court
or PLLs to the list of items for mandatory single-entitytreatment therefore is more likely a reflection of the Treasury's inattention than any affirmative intention on its part tosay anything at all.

Last, the Government warns that "[t]he rule that peti-tioner advocates would permit significant tax avoidance
abuses." Brief for United States 40. Specifically:

"Under petitioner's approach, a corporation that is currently unprofitable but that had substantial income inprior years could (i) acquire a profitable corporation

with product liability expense deductions in the yearof acquisition, (ii) file a consolidated return and (iii)
thereby create an otherwise nonexistent `product liability loss' for the new affiliated group that would allowthe acquiring corporation to claim refunds of the tax it

paid in prior years." Ibid.
The Government suggests, for example, that "a manufac-turing company (with prior profits and current losses) that

has no product liability exposure could purchase a tobaccocompany (with both prior and current profits) that has
significant product liability expenses" and that "[t]he combined entity could . . . assert a ten-year carryback of `productliability losses' even though the tobacco company has always

made a profit and never incurred a `loss' of any type." Id.,at 40-41, n. 27.

There are several answers. First, on the score of taxavoidance, the separate-member approach is no better (and
is perhaps worse) than the single-entity treatment; both en-tail some risk of tax-motivated behavior. See Leatherman,
Separate Liability Losses 681 (Under the separate-member
approach, "[d]espite sound non-tax business reasons, a group
may be disinclined to form a new member or transfer assets
between members, because it may worry that it would lose
the benefit of a ten-year carryback," and "may be encouraged
to transfer assets between members to increase its consoli532US3 Unit: $U66 [09-06-02 19:23:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

dated [PLL], even when those transfers would otherwise beill-advised"). Second, the Government may, as always, address tax-motivated behavior under Internal Revenue Code$ 269, which gives the Secretary ample authority to "disallow
[any] deduction, credit, or other allowance" that results froma transaction "the principal purpose [of] which . . . is evasion
or avoidance of Federal income tax." 26 U. S. C. $ 269(a).And finally, if the Government were to conclude that $ 269
provided too little protection and that it simply could not livewith the single-entity approach, the Treasury could exercise
the authority provided by the Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 1502, andamend the consolidated return regulations.

* * *
Thus, it is true, as the Government has argued, that "[t]heInternal Revenue Code vests ample authority in the Treasury to adopt consolidated return regulations to effect a bind-ing resolution of the question presented in this case." Brief
for United States 19-20. To the extent that the Govern-ment has exercised that authority, its actions point to the
single-entity approach as the better answer. To the extentthe Government disagrees, it may amend its regulations to
provide for a different one.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
This is a close and difficult case, in which neither the stat-ute nor the regulations offer a definitive answer to the crucial textual question. Absent a clear textual anchor, I wouldcredit the Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the
potential for abuse created by the petitioner's reading ofthe statutory scheme and affirm the decision of the Court
of Appeals on that basis.1

1 Justice Thomas accurately points to a tradition of cases construing "revenue-raising laws" against their drafter. See ante this page
(Thomas, J., concurring). However, when the ambiguous provision in
question is not one that imposes tax liability but rather one that crafts
an exception from a general revenue duty for the benefit of some taxpayers, a countervailing tradition suggests that the ambiguity should be resolved in the government's favor. See, e. g., INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U. S. 79, 84 (1992); Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner,

UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting

As the majority accurately reports, during the time rele-vant to this case, $ 172(b)(1)(I) of the Internal Revenue Code

of 1954 allowed any "taxpayer" who "ha[d] a product lia-bility loss" to carry back its excess product liability losses
for 10 years. The resolution of this case turns on whether,when a group of affiliated corporations files a consolidated
tax return, the entire group should be considered the "tax-payer" for the purposes of implementing this provision
or whether each individual corporation should be seen as a"taxpayer."

There is no obvious answer to this question. On the onehand, it is generally accepted that the rationale behind the
consolidated return regulations is to allow affiliated cor-porations that are run as a single entity to elect to be treated
for tax purposes as a single entity. See, e. g., Brief for Peti-tioner 17-19 (collecting sources in which the Internal Revenue Service so stated). On the other hand, it is quite clearthat each corporation in such a group remains in both a legal
and a literal sense a "taxpayer," a status that has importantconsequences. See Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, 286 U. S.
319, 328 (1932) ("The fact is not to be ignored that each oftwo or more corporations joining . . . in a consolidated return is none the less a taxpayer"); 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(14)(defining a "taxpayer" as "any person subject to any internal
revenue tax," where a related provision defines "person"to include corporations). As both the group and the individual corporations are considered "taxpayers" in differentcontexts, the statute presents a genuine ambiguity.

When a provision of the Internal Revenue Code pre-sents a patent ambiguity, Congress, the courts, and the IRS
share a preference for resolving the ambiguity via execu-tive action. See,

e. g., National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc.v. United States, 440 U. S. 472, 477 (1979). This is best

319 U. S. 590, 593 (1943); Deputy, Administratrix v. Du Pont, 308 U. S.

achieved by the issuing of a Treasury Regulation resolving
the ambiguity. Ibid. In this instance, however, the Secretary of the Treasury issued no such regulation. In the absence of such a regulation, the majority has scoured tangentially related regulations, looking for clues to what the
Secretary might intend. For want of a more precise basis
for resolving this case, that approach is sound.

It is at this point, however, that I part company with the
majority's analysis. The fact that the regulations forward
a particular method for calculating a consolidated "net operating loss" (NOL) for a group of affiliated companies, see
Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-21(f ), tells us how the Secretary wants
the NOL to be calculated whenever it is necessary to determine a consolidated NOL, but it does not tell us what provisions of the Code require the calculation of a consolidated
NOL. That is a separate and prior question. Even if we
were to draw some mild significance from the presence of
such a regulation (and the absence, at the time these returns were filed, of a similar regulation for the calculation
of corporation-specific NOL's), the power of that inference
is counterbalanced by the fact that the regulations listing
deductions that must be reported at the consolidated level
makes no mention of product liability expenses. See Treas.
Reg. $ 1.1502-12; see also H. Enterprises Int'l, Inc. v. Commisioner, 105 T. C. 71, 85 (1995) (construing Treas. Reg.

$ 1.1502-80(a) to provide "[w]here the consolidated return
regulations do not require that corporations filing such returns be treated differently from the way separate entities
would be treated, those corporations shall be treated as
separate entities when applying provisions of the Code").
In addition, the subsequent promulgation of a method for
calculating a corporation-specific NOL (albeit for a different purpose), see $ 1.1502-79(a)(3) (defining "separate net
operating loss"), demonstrates that there are no inherent
problems implicit in undertaking such a calculation.

Stevens, J., dissenting

In short, I find no answer to this case in the text of thestatute or in any Treasury Regulation.

2 However, the Government does forward a valid policy concern that militatesagainst petitioner's construction of the statute: the fear of

tax abuse. See Brief for United States 40-42. Put simply,the Government fears that currently unprofitable but previously profitable corporations might receive a substantialwindfall simply by acquiring a corporation with significant
product liability expenses but no product liability losses.See

id., at 40. On a subjective level, I find these concernstroubling. Cf. Woolford Realty Co., 286 U. S., at 330 (rejecting "the notion that Congress in permitting a consolidatedreturn was willing to foster an opportunity for juggling so
facile and so obvious"). More importantly, however, I creditthe Secretary of the Treasury's concerns about the potential
scope of abuse. Perhaps the Court is correct in suggestingthat these concerns can be alleviated through applications
of other anti-abuse provisions of the Tax Code, see ante,at 838, but I am not persuaded of my own ability to make
that judgment. When we deal "with a subject that is highlyspecialized and so complex as to be the despair of judges,"
Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489, 498 (1943), an ounceof deference is appropriate.

I respectfully dissent.3

2 I am also in full agreement with the Court's rejection of the Government's double-deduction argument. See ante, at 834-835.

3 Because I agree with the majority that the calculation contemplated

by Treas. Reg. $ 1.1502-79(a)(3) better approximates the NOL that each
company would have had reported if filing individually than the alternative forwarded by the Government, see ante, at 833, I agree with the
Court of Appeals' decision to adopt that measure and would affirm the
decision below in its entirety.

POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-763. Argued April 23, 2001--Decided June 4, 2001
Petitioner Pollard sued respondent, her former employer, alleging that

she had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on her sex,
in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Finding that
Pollard was subjected to co-worker sexual harassment of which her
supervisors were aware, and that the harassment resulted in a medical leave of absence for psychological assistance and her eventual dismissal for refusing to return to the same hostile work environment, the
District Court awarded her, as relevant here, $300,000 in compensatory
damages--the maximum permitted under 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3). The
court observed that the award was insufficient to compensate Pollard,
but was bound by an earlier Sixth Circuit holding that front pay--money
awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and
reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement--was subject to the damages
cap of $ 1981a(b)(3). The Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Front pay is not an element of compensatory damages under $ 1981a

and thus is not subject to the damages cap imposed by $ 1981a(b)(3).
Pp. 847-854.

(a) Under $ 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as originally enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged
in an unlawful employment practice, the court was authorized to award
such remedies as injunctions, reinstatement, backpay, and lost benefits.
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g)(1). Because this provision closely tracked the
language of $ 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), $ 10(c)'s
meaning before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted provides guidance as to $ 706(g)'s proper meaning. In applying $ 10(c), the National
Labor Relations Board consistently had made "backpay" awards up
to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position
he should have been in had the NLRA violation not occurred, even
if such event occurred after judgment. Consistent with that interpretation, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII
actions awarded this same type of backpay (known today as "front pay"
when it occurs after the judgment) under $ 706(g). After Congress expanded $ 706(g)'s remedies in 1972 to include "any other equitable relief
as the court deems appropriate," courts endorsed a broad view of front
pay, which included front pay awards made in lieu of reinstatement.

844 POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.

Syllabus
By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals had recognized front
pay as a remedy authorized by $ 706(g). In 1991, Congress further expanded the available remedies to include compensatory and punitive
damages, subject to $ 1981a(b)(3)'s cap. Pp. 848-851.

(b) The 1991 Act's plain language makes clear that the newly authorized $ 1981a remedies were in addition to the relief authorized
by $ 706(g). Thus, if front pay was a type of relief authorized under

$ 706(g), it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damages
under $ 1981a and it would not be subject to $ 1981a(b)(3)'s cap. As the
original language of $ 706(g) authorizing backpay awards was modeled
after the same language in the NLRA, backpay awards (now called
front pay awards under Title VII) made for the period between the
judgment date and the reinstatement date were authorized under

$ 706(g). Because there is no logical difference between front pay
awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made
when there is not, front pay awards made in lieu of reinstatement
are authorized under $ 706(g) as well. To distinguish between the two
cases would lead to the strange result that employees could receive
front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when it
is unavailable--whether because of continuing hostility between the
plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries that the discrimination has caused the plaintiff. Thus, the
most egregious offenders could be subject to the least sanctions. The
text of $ 706(g) does not lend itself to such a distinction. Front pay
awards made in lieu of reinstatement fit within $ 706(g)'s authorization
for courts to "order such affirmative action as may be appropriate."
Pp. 852-854.

Petitioner Sharon Pollard sued her former employer, E. I.du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), alleging that

she had been subjected to a hostile work environment basedon her sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. After a trial,the District Court found that Pollard was subjected to coworker sexual harassment of which her supervisors wereaware. The District Court further found that the harassment resulted in a medical leave of absence from her jobfor psychological assistance and her eventual dismissal for
refusing to return to the same hostile work environment.The court awarded Pollard $107,364 in backpay and benefits,
$252,997 in attorney's fees, and, as relevant here, $300,000 incompensatory damages--the maximum permitted under the
statutory cap for such damages in 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3).

846 POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the record
demonstrated that DuPont employees engaged in flagrant
discrimination based on sex and that DuPont managers and
supervisors did not take adequate steps to stop it. 213 F. 3d
933 (CA6 2000).

The issue presented for review here is whether front pay
constitutes an element of "compensatory damages" under 42
U. S. C. $ 1981a and thus is subject to the statutory damages
cap imposed by that section. Although courts have defined
"front pay" in numerous ways, front pay is simply money
awarded for lost compensation during the period between
judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.
For instance, when an appropriate position for the plaintiff
is not immediately available without displacing an incumbent employee, courts have ordered reinstatement upon
the opening of such a position and have ordered front pay
to be paid until reinstatement occurs. See, e. g., Walsdorf v.
Board of Comm'rs, 857 F. 2d 1047, 1053-1054 (CA5 1988);
King v. Staley, 849 F. 2d 1143, 1145 (CA8 1988). In cases
in which reinstatement is not viable because of continuing
hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because of psychological injuries suffered by the
plaintiff as a result of the discrimination, courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement. See, e. g.,
Gotthardt v. National R. R. Passenger Corp., 191 F. 3d 1148,
1156 (CA9 1999); Fitzgerald v. Sirloin Stockade, Inc., 624
F. 2d 945, 957 (CA10 1980). For the purposes of this opinion,
it is not necessary for us to explain when front pay is an
appropriate remedy. The question before us is only whether
front pay, if found to be appropriate, is an element of compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and thus
subject to the Act's statutory cap on such damages.

Here, the District Court observed that "the $300,000.00
award is, in fact, insufficient to compensate plaintiff," 16
F. Supp. 2d 913, 924, n. 19 (WD Tenn. 1998), but it stated that

Opinion of the Court
it was bound by the Sixth Circuit's decision in Hudson v.
Reno, 130 F. 3d 1193 (1997), which held that front pay was
subject to the cap. On appeal, Pollard argued that Hudson
was wrongly decided because front pay is not an element
of compensatory damages, but rather a replacement for the
remedy of reinstatement in situations in which reinstatement would be inappropriate. She also argued that $ 1981a,
by its very terms, explicitly excludes from the statutory cap
remedies that traditionally were available under Title VII,
which she argued included front pay. The Court of Appeals
agreed with Pollard's arguments but considered itself bound
by Hudson. The Sixth Circuit declined to rehear the case
en banc.

The Sixth Circuit's decision in Hudson was one of the first
appellate opinions to decide whether front pay is an element
of compensatory damages subject to the statutory cap set
forth in $ 1981a(b)(3). Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's resolution of this question, the other Courts of Appeals to address it have concluded that front pay is a remedy that is not
subject to the limitations of $ 1981a(b)(3). See, e. g., Pals v.
Schepel Buick & GMC Truck, Inc., 220 F. 3d 495, 499-500
(CA7 2000); Kramer v. Logan County School Dist. No. R-1,
157 F. 3d 620, 625-626 (CA8 1998); Gotthardt, supra, at 1153-
1154; Medlock v. Ortho Biotech, Inc., 164 F. 3d 545, 556
(CA10 1999); EEOC v. W&O, Inc., 213 F. 3d 600, 619, n. 10
(CA11 2000); Martini v. Federal Nat. Mortgage Assn., 178
F. 3d 1336, 1348-1349 (CADC 1999). We granted certiorari
to resolve this conflict. 531 U. S. 1069 (2001).

Plaintiffs who allege employment discrimination on the

Opinion of the Court
of 1964. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g)(1). In the Civil RightsAct of 1991, Congress expanded the remedies available to

these plaintiffs by permitting, for the first time, the re-covery of compensatory and punitive damages. 42 U. S. C.

$ 1981a(a)(1) ("[T]he complaining party may recover com-pensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b)
of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by sec-tion 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"). The amount
of compensatory damages awarded under $ 1981a for "futurepecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience,
mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecu-niary losses," and the amount of punitive damages awarded
under $ 1981a, however, may not exceed the statutory capset forth in $ 1981a(b)(3). The statutory cap is based on
the number of people employed by the respondent. In thiscase, the cap is $300,000 because DuPont has more than 500
employees.The Sixth Circuit has concluded that front pay constitutes
compensatory damages awarded for future pecuniary lossesand thus is subject to the statutory cap of $ 1981a(b)(3). 213
F. 3d, at 945; Hudson, supra, at 1203. For the reasons dis-cussed below, we conclude that front pay is not an element
of compensatory damages within the meaning of $ 1981a, and,therefore, we hold that the statutory cap of $ 1981a(b)(3) is
inapplicable to front pay. A

Under $ 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as origi-nally enacted, when a court found that an employer had intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice,the court was authorized to "enjoin the respondent from
engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and ordersuch affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may
include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring ofemployees, with or without back pay." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-
5(g)(1). This provision closely tracked the language of

532US3 Unit: $U67 [10-25-01 22:12:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

849Cite as: 532 U. S. 843 (2001)
Opinion of the Court

$ 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat.
454, 29 U. S. C. $ 160(c), which similarly authorized orders requiring employers to take appropriate, remedial "affirmative
action." $ 160(c) (authorizing the National Labor Relations
Board to issue an order "requiring such person to cease
and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such
affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with
or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this
subchapter"). See also Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422
U. S. 405, 419, n. 11 (1975). The meaning of this provision
of the NLRA prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, therefore, gives us guidance as to the proper meaning of the same language in $ 706(g) of Title VII. In applying $ 10(c) of the NLRA, the Board consistently had made
awards of what it called "backpay" up to the date the employee was reinstated or returned to the position he should
have been in had the violation of the NLRA not occurred,
even if such event occurred after judgment. See, e. g., Nathanson v. NLRB, 344 U. S. 25, 29-30 (1952); NLRB v.
Reeves Broadcasting & Development Corp., 336 F. 2d 590,
593-594 (CA4 1964); NLRB v. Hill & Hill Truck Line,
Inc., 266 F. 2d 883, 887 (CA5 1959); Berger Polishing, Inc.,
147 N. L. R. B. 21, 40 (1964); Lock Joint Pipe Co., 141
N. L. R. B. 943, 948 (1963). Consistent with the Board's
interpretation of this provision of the NLRA, courts finding unlawful intentional discrimination in Title VII actions
awarded this same type of backpay under $ 706(g). See,
e. g., Culpepper v. Reynolds Metals Co., 442 F. 2d 1078, 1080
(CA5 1971); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 3 FEP
Cases 767, 790 (ND Ga. 1971). In the Title VII context, this
form of "backpay" occurring after the date of judgment is
known today as "front pay."

In 1972, Congress expanded $ 706(g) to specify that a court
could, in addition to awarding those remedies previously
listed in the provision, award "any other equitable relief

850 POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.

Opinion of the Court
as the court deems appropriate." After this amendment
to $ 706(g), courts endorsed a broad view of front pay. See,
e. g., Patterson v. American Tobacco Co., 535 F. 2d 257, 269
(CA4 1976) (stating that where reinstatement is not immediately feasible, backpay "should be supplemented by an
award equal to the estimated present value of lost earnings
that are reasonably likely to occur between the date of judgment and the time when the employee can assume his new
position"); EEOC v. Enterprise Assn. Steamfitters, 542 F.
2d 579, 590 (CA2 1976) (stating that backpay award would
terminate on the date of actual remedying of discrimination);
Bush v. Lone Star Steel Co., 373 F. Supp. 526, 538 (ED Tex.
1974) (ordering backpay from the date the employee would
have been entitled to fill a vacancy but for racial discrimination to the date the employee would in all reasonable
probability reach his rightful place). Courts recognized that
reinstatement was not always a viable option, and that an
award of front pay as a substitute for reinstatement in such
cases was a necessary part of the "make whole" relief mandated by Congress and by this Court in Albemarle. See,
e. g., Shore v. Federal Express Corp., 777 F. 2d 1155, 1158-
1159 (CA6 1985) ("Front pay is . . . simply compensation
for the post-judgment effects of past discrimination." It is
awarded "to effectuate fully the `make whole' purposes of
Title VII"); Brooks v. Woodline Motor Freight, Inc., 852
F. 2d 1061, 1066 (CA8 1988) (stating that front pay was
appropriate given substantial animosity between parties
where "the parties' relationship was not likely to improve,
and the nature of the business required a high degree of
mutual trust and confidence"); Fitzgerald v. Sirloin Stockade, Inc., 624 F. 2d, at 957 (upholding award of front pay
where continuing hostility existed between the parties); Cassino v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 817 F. 2d 1338, 1347 (CA9
1987) (same). By 1991, virtually all of the courts of appeals
had recognized that "front pay" was a remedy authorized

532US3 Unit: $U67 [12-23-02 07:39:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

851Cite as: 532 U. S. 843 (2001)
Opinion of the Court
under $ 706(g).1 In fact, no court of appeals appears to have
ever held to the contrary.2

In 1991, without amending $ 706(g), Congress further expanded the remedies available in cases of intentional employment discrimination to include compensatory and punitive damages. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1). At that time,
Rev. Stat. $ 1977, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981, permitted the recovery
of unlimited compensatory and punitive damages in cases
of intentional race and ethnic discrimination, but no similar
remedy existed in cases of intentional sex, religious, or disability discrimination. Thus, $ 1981a brought all forms of intentional employment discrimination into alignment, at least
with respect to the forms of relief available to successful
plaintiffs. However, compensatory and punitive damages
awarded under $ 1981a may not exceed the statutory limitations set forth in $ 1981a(b)(3), while such damages awarded
under $ 1981 are not limited by statute.

2 The only two Courts of Appeals not to have addressed this issue prior

to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 have since joined the other Circuits in
holding that front pay is a remedy available under $ 706(g). See Selgas
v. American Airlines, Inc., 104 F. 3d 9, 12-13 (CA1 1997); Williams v.
Pharmacia, Inc., 137 F. 3d 944, 951-952 (CA7 1998).

852 POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.

Opinion of the Court

B
In the abstract, front pay could be considered compensa-tion for "future pecuniary losses," in which case it would be

subject to the statutory cap. $ 1981a(b)(3). The term "com-pensatory damages . . . for future pecuniary losses" is not
defined in the statute, and, out of context, its ordinary mean-ing could include all payments for monetary losses after the
date of judgment. However, we must not analyze one termof $ 1981a in isolation. See

Gade v. National Solid WastesManagement Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 99 (1992) (" `[W]e must not

be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law' "). When $ 1981a
is read as a whole, the better interpretation is that frontpay is not within the meaning of compensatory damages in

$ 1981a(b)(3), and thus front pay is excluded from the statu-tory cap.

In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress determined thatvictims of employment discrimination were entitled to

addi-tional remedies. Congress expressly found that "additional

remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawfulharassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace,"
without giving any indication that it wished to curtail pre-viously available remedies. See Civil Rights Act of 1991,
105 Stat. 1071, $ 2. Congress therefore made clear throughthe plain language of the statute that the remedies newly
authorized under $ 1981a were in addition to the reliefauthorized by $ 706(g). Section 1981a(a)(1) provides that,
in intentional discrimination cases brought under Title VII,"the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subjection (b) of [$ 1981a], in
addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent." (Emphasis added.) And $ 1981a(b)(2) states that "[c]ompensatorydamages awarded under [$ 1981a] shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, or any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."

Opinion of the Court
(Emphasis added.) According to these statutory provisions,if front pay was a type of relief authorized under $ 706(g),

it is excluded from the meaning of compensatory damagesunder $ 1981a.

As discussed above, the original language of $ 706(g) au-thorizing backpay awards was modeled after the same
language in the NLRA. This provision in the NLRA hadbeen construed to allow awards of backpay up to the date
of reinstatement, even if reinstatement occurred after judg-ment. Accordingly, backpay awards made for the period between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement,
which today are called front pay awards under Title VII,were authorized under $ 706(g).

As to front pay awards that are made in lieu of reinstate-ment, we construe $ 706(g) as authorizing these awards as
well. We see no logical difference between front pay awardsmade when there eventually is reinstatement and those
made when there is not.3 Moreover, to distinguish between
the two cases would lead to the strange result that em-ployees could receive front pay when reinstatement eventually is available but not when reinstatement is not anoption--whether because of continuing hostility between
the plaintiff and the employer or its workers, or because ofpsychological injuries that the discrimination has caused
the plaintiff. Thus, the most egregious offenders could besubject to the least sanctions. Had Congress drawn such a
line in the statute and foreclosed front pay awards in lieuof reinstatement, we certainly would honor that line. But,
as written, the text of the statute does not lend itself tosuch a distinction, and we will not create one. The statute

3 We note that the federal courts consistently have construed $ 706(g)
as authorizing front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement. See, e. g., Blum
v. Witco Chem. Corp., supra, at 383 ("A front pay . . . award is the monetary equivalent of the equitable remedy of reinstatement"); Williams v.
Pharmacia, Inc., supra, at 952 (stating that "front pay is the functional
equivalent of reinstatement").

854 POLLARD v. E. I. du PONT de NEMOURS & CO.

Opinion of the Court
authorizes courts to "order such affirmative action as maybe appropriate." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g)(1). We conclude

that front pay awards in lieu of reinstatement fit within thisstatutory term.

Because front pay is a remedy authorized under $ 706(g),Congress did not limit the availability of such awards in

$ 1981a. Instead, Congress sought to expand the availableremedies by permitting the recovery of compensatory and
punitive damages in addition to previously available reme-dies, such as front pay.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

No. 00-9199 (00A850). In re Workman. Application for stayof execution of sentence of death, presented to Justice Stevens,
and by him referred to the Court, denied. Petition for writ ofhabeas corpus denied.

Statement of Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souterand Justice Breyer join, respecting the denial of the petition
for writ of habeas corpus.

As Judge Merritt pointed out in his opinion dissenting from theCourt of Appeals' denial of relief last September, see Workman

v. Bell, 227 F. 3d 331, 332 (CA6 2000), this petitioner has raisedserious questions concerning his eligibility for the death penalty.
When this Court reviewed petitioner's applications for relief inFebruary, I was persuaded that those claims were sufficiently
serious to require a full evidentiary hearing before a factfinder.The majority of the Court, however, did not share that opinion.
Workman v. Bell, 531 U. S. 1193. I remain of the view that such

May 14, 2001 532 U. S.
No. 00-8942. Bridgers v. Texas. Ct. Crim. App. Tex. Cer-tiorari denied.

Statement of Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevensand Justice Souter join, respecting the denial of the petition
for writ of certiorari.

After petitioner, Allen Bridgers, was arrested, and prior to hisinterrogation, two detectives from the Fort Lauderdale Police

Department read him the following warnings:

" `You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand?Anything you say can and will be used against you in a

court of law. Do you understand? You have the right tothe presence of an attorney/lawyer prior to any questioning.
Do you understand? If you cannot afford an attorney/lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning
if you so desire. Do you understand?' " App. to Pet. forCert. 3.

Bridgers replied that he understood his rights, and that he wasnot sure whether he wanted an attorney. Bridgers now argues
that the warnings were inadequate under Miranda v. Arizona,384 U. S. 436 (1966), because they did not explain that he had a
right to consult an attorney, not only prior to, but also during,questioning.

Although this Court has declined to demand "rigidity in theform of the required warnings," California v. Prysock, 453 U. S.
355, 359 (1981) (per curiam), the warnings given here say nothingabout the lawyer's presence during interrogation. For that reason, they apparently leave out an essential Miranda element.384 U. S., at 470.

Because this Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, ourdenial expresses no view about the merits of petitioner's claim.
And because the police apparently read the warnings from astandard-issue card, I write to make this point explicit. That is
to say, if the problem purportedly present here proves to be arecurring one, I believe that it may well warrant this Court's
attention.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
Petitioners, Houston residents, filed suit against the city ofHouston and alleged that the city violated the Equal Protection

Clause when it redrew its single-member city council districts in1997. Petitioners argued that the city engaged in racial gerrymandering when it devised the 1997 plan and that the districtsdid not conform to the one-person, one-vote requirements articulated by this Court. The District Court granted summary judg-ment to the city, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Because
petitioners present an important legal question over which Courtsof Appeals disagree, I would grant certiorari.

When drawing its 1997 districting plan, the city faced the chal-lenge of where to place the newly annexed Kingwood suburb, an
overwhelmingly white community located in the northeasternmost point of Houston. Had the city added Kingwood to the
adjacent District B, the city would have been forced to move anumber of persons out of District B into neighboring districts to
avoid making District B disproportionately large. This shiftingof people from one district to another allegedly would have jeopardized the strength of several "minority" districts, those districtscontaining primarily voters who are black or Hispanic. Instead,
at least in part to avoid disrupting these minority districts, thecity made Kingwood a part of District E, a predominantly white
community located in the southeastern corner of Houston. Peti-tioners argue that this placement evidenced racial gerrymander532ORD Unit: $PT2 [08-15-02 17:08:19] PGT: ORDPP (Prelim. Print)

Thomas, J., dissenting1046
ing and that the city engaged in the systemic undersizing of "mi-nority" districts. Simply put, petitioners contend that the city
drew minority districts so that they would contain fewer people,and fewer voters, than would "majority" districts, comprising primarily voters who are white. According to petitioners, this un-dersizing was done directly, by making minority districts smaller
in terms of total population, and indirectly, by roughly equalizingdistrict populations without regard to the

citizen voting age popu-lation. Because each district would have a single representative

in the city council, the alleged effect of this undersizing was todilute the value of votes in districts with larger total populations
and citizen voting age populations, i. e., districts that in this casecomprised majority white populations.

I would grant certiorari on petitioners' one-person, one-voteclaim, which asks what measure of population should be used for
determining whether the population is equally distributed amongthe districts. In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), this
Court held that "the Equal Protection Clause requires that aState make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts,
in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as
is practicable." Id., at 577; see Avery v. Midland County, 390U. S. 474 (1968) (applying

Reynolds' one-person, one-vote holding
to districting for the selection of local governmental representa-tives). Absolute parity of populations among districts has never

been required. But "this Court has recognized that a state legis-lative apportionment scheme with a maximum population deviation exceeding 10% creates a prima facie case of discrimination."
Brown v. Thomson, 462 U. S. 835, 850 (1983) (O'Connor, J., con-curring); see

id., at 842-843 (opinion of the Court) ("Our decisions
have established, as a general matter, that an apportionment planwith a maximum population deviation under 10% falls within this

category of minor deviations. A plan with larger disparities in
population, however, creates a prima facie case of discriminationand therefore must be justified by the State" (citations omitted)).

Having read the Equal Protection Clause to include a "one-person,one-vote" requirement, and having prescribed population variance
that, without additional evidence, often will satisfy the require-ment, we have left a critical variable in the requirement undefined. We have never determined the relevant "population" that
States and localities must equally distribute among their districts.

Such a determination might be dispositive of whether the cityhas violated the Equal Protection Clause. If "population" means
"total population," the districts in the city's 1997 plan had a lessthan 10% population variance. If, however, it means "citizen voting age population," the maximum deviation is allegedly anywherefrom 20% to 32.5%. Pet. for Cert. 3, and n. 4. The Fifth Circuit
in this case held that the decision as to which population figuresto use was "a choice left to the political process." 206 F. 3d 502,
523 (2000). Likewise, the Fourth Circuit has held that the deci-sion whether to use total population or voting age population is
a political choice generally not reviewable by courts. Daly v.Hunt, 93 F. 3d 1212, 1227 (1996) ("This is quintessentially a decision that should be made by the state, not the federal courts, inthe inherently political and legislative process of apportionment").
In contrast, the Ninth Circuit has held that districting based onvoting populations instead of the total population would have
been unconstitutional. Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F. 2d763, 773-776 (1991).

In other contexts, I might be inclined to wait for further conflictto develop among the courts of appeals. In this case, however,
because every jurisdiction in the country will have to accommo-date the 2000 census data in the near future, it behooves us to
address this question as soon as possible. The one-person, one-vote principle may, in the end, be of little consequence if we
decide that each jurisdiction can choose its own measure of popu-lation. But as long as we sustain the one-person, one-vote principle, we have an obligation to explain to States and localities whatit actually means.

Statement of Justice Stevens respecting the denial of thepetition for writ of certiorari.
As I pointed out some years ago, one reason that dissents fromthe denial of certiorari should be disfavored is that they are
seldom answered, and therefore may include a less than com-plete statement of the facts bearing on the question whether
the case merits review.1 The dissent in this case illustrates my

1 "One characteristic of all opinions dissenting from the denial of certiorari is manifest. They are totally unnecessary. They are examples of thepurest form of dicta, since they have even less legal significance than the

orders of the entire Court which, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter reiterated againand again, have no precedential significance at all.

"Another attribute of these opinions is that they are potentially mis-leading. Since the Court provides no explanation of the reasons for denying certiorari, the dissenter's arguments in favor of a grant are not an-swered and therefore typically appear to be more persuasive than most

point because it omits one extremely significant fact and dis-counts another.

Even though the first two lines of the monument's text appearin significantly larger font than the remainder, they are ignored
by the dissenters. Those lines read: "The Ten Command-ments--I AM the LORD thy God." The graphic emphasis
placed on those first lines is rather hard to square with the propo-sition that the monument expresses no particular religious preference--particularly when considered in conjunction with thosefacts that the dissent does acknowledge--namely, that the monument also depicts two Stars of David and a symbol composed ofthe Greek letters Chi and Rho superimposed on each other that
represent Christ.Moreover, the dissent also gives short shrift to relevant details about the monument's origins. At the dedication ceremony,three of the principal speakers were a Catholic priest, a Protestant minister, and a Jewish rabbi.2 235 F. 3d 292, 303 (CA72000). All three spoke not of the " ` "cross cultural . . . significance" ' " of the Ten Commandments, post, at 1060 (opinion ofRehnquist, C. J.), but of the need for every citizen to adopt
their precepts so as to obtain " `redemption from today's strifeand fear,' " 235 F. 3d, at 295. To dismiss that history in favor
of a resolution issued by the Elkhart Common Council on theeve of litigation is puzzling indeed.

The reasons why this case is not one that merits certiorariare explained in detail in Judge Ripple's thoughtful opinion for
the Court of Appeals.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia andJustice Thomas join, dissenting.

Since 1958, a 6-foot granite monument inscribed with the TenCommandments has stood in front of the city of Elkhart's Municiother opinions. Moreover, since they often omit any reference to valid rea-sons for denying certiorari, they tend to imply that the Court has been
unfaithful to its responsibilities or has implicitly reached a decision on themerits when, in fact, there is no basis for such an inference." Singleton v.
Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 944-945 (1978) (Stevens, J., opinion respectingdenial of certiorari).

2 In planning the monument, representatives of Judaism, Protestantism,
and Catholicism developed a nonsectarian version of the Ten Command-ments. Making a religious text nonsectarian, however, does not make it

secular or strip it of its religious significance.

pal Building, on the northeast corner of a lawn shared with twocommemorative structures. The specific text was developed by
representatives of the Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant faiths whosought to create a nonsectarian version of the Commandments.
In addition to the text, the monument depicts an eye within apyramid similar to the one displayed on the one-dollar bill, an
American eagle grasping the American flag, two small Starsof David, and a similarly sized symbol representing Christ: two
Greek letters, Chi and Rho, superimposed on each other.A juvenile court judge, seeking to provide troubled youth with
a common code of conduct, was the original impetus behind theproject. The Fraternal Order of Eagles, a service organization
"dedicated to promoting liberty, truth, and justice," financedthe monument, and although it stands on public property, the
city contributes no time, effort, or money to its maintenance.235 F. 3d 292, 294-295 (CA7 2000). In a recent resolution, responding to a request that the monument be removed and tothreat of litigation, the Elkhart Common Council recognized that
the Ten Commandments " `reflec[t] one of the earliest codes ofhuman conduct.' " Id., at 297. The resolution stated that the
monument's symbols represent the " `cross cultural and historicalsignificance' " of the Commandments, which have had a " `significant impact on the development of the fundamental legal princi-ples of Western Civilization.' " Id., at 312, n. 1 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). It also noted that Elkhart'sMunicipal Building is home to numerous other historical and
cultural objects. Ibid.Nonetheless, in 1998, 40 years after the monument's erection, respondents, residents of Elkhart County, filed suit againstthe city under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that
the monument's presence violated the Establishment Clause.The District Court granted summary judgment for the city, and
a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir-cuit reversed.

That court, applying the oft-criticized framework set out inLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), first considered
whether the city's display of the monument had a secular pur-pose. The court found that it did not. 235 F. 3d, at 301 (citing
Lemon, supra, at 612-613). The court relied in part on Stonev. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per curiam), where we struck

down a state statute requiring the posting of the Ten Command-ments in public schoolrooms, on the ground that the statute had
no secular purpose. Stone's finding of an impermissible purposeis hardly controlling here. In Stone, the posting effectively induced schoolchildren to meditate upon the Commandments dur-ing the schoolday. Id., at 42. We have been "particularly vigilant" in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clausein that context, where the State exerts "great authority and
coercive power" over students through mandatory attendancerequirements. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 583-584
(1987); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union,Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 620, n. 69 (1989).
Those concerns are absent here, where the Ten Commandmentsmonument stands outside the city's Municipal Building.

Stone's unique setting may explain our reluctance to accept inthat case the State's view that its display of the Commandments
had a secular purpose. But we have never determined, in Stoneor elsewhere, that the Commandments lack a secular application.
To be sure, the Ten Commandments are a "sacred text in theJewish and Christian faiths," concerning, in part, "the religious
duties of believers." 449 U. S., at 41-42. Undeniably, however,the Commandments have secular significance as well, because
they have made a substantial contribution to our secular legalcodes. Even Stone noted that "integrated into the school curriculum" the Commandments "may constitutionally be used inan appropriate study of history, civilization, [or] ethics." Id., at
42. And as the Court of Appeals recognized, "[t]he text of theTen Commandments no doubt has played a role in the secular
development of our society and can no doubt be presented bythe government as playing such a role in our civic order." 235
F. 3d, at 302.The council's resolution stated the city's intent to display the
Commandments in precisely that way--to reflect their cultural,historical, and legal significance. We are "normally deferential"
to "articulation[s] of a secular purpose," so long as they are"sincere and not a sham." Aguillard, supra, at 586-587. There
is no evidence of insincerity here, and thus no justification forthe Court of Appeals' refusal to credit the city's stated purpose.
That the city only recently articulated its aims for displayingthe monument is of no moment, for it is only recently in its

40-year history that the monument has come under attack. Thatthe monument bears religious symbols as well as secular ones,
and that speeches by religious leaders accompanied its dedica-tion, do not alter the analysis. Even assuming that these aspects of the monument's appearance and history indicate that ithas some religious meaning, the city is not bound to display only
symbols that are wholly secular, or to convey solely secularmessages. In determining whether a secular purpose exists, we
have simply required that the displays not be "motivated whollyby religious considerations." Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668,
680 (1984). The fact that the monument conveys some religiousmeaning does not cast doubt on the city's valid secular purposes
for its display.Turning to the second prong of Lemon, the Court of Appeals
concluded that "[e]ven if we were to ignore the primary purposebehind displaying the Ten Commandments monument, we would
have to conclude that this particular display has the primary orprincipal effect of advancing religion." 235 F. 3d, at 304 (citing
Allegheny, supra, at 592). In Allegheny, and in Lynch, we rec-ognized the importance of context in evaluating whether displays of symbols with religious meaning send an "unmistakablemessage" of government support for, or endorsement of, religion.
Allegheny, supra, at 598-600; Lynch, supra, at 680.Considering the Ten Commandments monument in the context
in which it appears, it sends no such message. The city hasdisplayed the monument outside the Municipal Building, which
houses the local courts and local prosecutor's office. This loca-tion emphasizes the foundational role of the Ten Commandments
in secular, legal matters. Indeed, a carving of Moses holdingthe Ten Commandments, surrounded by representations of other
historical legal figures, adorns the frieze on the south wall ofour courtroom, and we have said that the carving "signals respect not for great proselytizers but for great lawgivers." Alle-gheny, supra, at 652-653 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). Similarly, the Ten Commandments monu-ment and the surrounding structures convey that the monument
is part of the city's celebration of its cultural and historicalroots, not a promotion of religious faith. To that end, the monument shares the lawn outside the Municipal Building with theRevolutionary War Monument, which honors the Revolutionary
War soldiers buried in Elkhart County, and a structure called

the "Freedom Monument." 235 F. 3d, at 296. Above the en-trance to the building is a bas-relief of an Elk's head, and the
words "DEDICATUM JUSTITIAM." Id., at 295. Consideredin that setting, the monument does not express the city's preference for particular religions or religious belief in general. Itsimply reflects the Ten Commandments' role in the development
of our legal system, just as the war memorial and FreedomMonument reflect the history and culture of the city of Elkhart.
Perhaps that is why, for four decades, no person has challengedthe monument as an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.

I would grant certiorari to decide whether a monument whichhas stood for more than 40 years, and has at least as much civic
significance as it does religious, must be physically removedfrom its place in front of the city's Municipal Building.

ADMIRALTY.

Wrongful death--Negligent breach of maritime duty of care.--General
maritime cause of action recognized in Moragne v. States Marine Lines,
Inc., 398 U. S. 375, 409, for death caused by violation of maritime duties is
available for negligent breach of a maritime duty of care. Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, p. 811.

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. See also Attorney's Fees.

Access to golf tour--Golf cart usage.--Title III of ADA prohibits petitioner from denying golfer Casey Martin equal access to its golf tours
based on a disability preventing him from walking a golf course; allowing
Martin to use a golf cart, despite petitioner's walking requirement, is not
a modification that would "fundamentally alter the nature" of petitioner's
tours. PGA TOUR, Inc. v. Martin, p. 661.

APPEALS.

Federal courts--Failure to sign notice--Dismissal.--A party's failure
to sign a notice of appeal that is timely filed in federal district court does
not require a court of appeals to dismiss appeal. Becker v. Montgomery,
p. 757.

ARBITRATION. See also Federal Arbitration Act.

1. Judicial review of labor-arbitration decision--Rejection of factual
findings.--Ninth Circuit committed reversible error when it rejected an
arbitrator's factual findings and then resolved merits of parties' labor
dispute instead of remanding case for further arbitration proceedings.
Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, p. 504.

2. Tribal sovereign immunity--Enforcement of arbitral awards.--
Under an agreement it proposed and signed, respondent Tribe clearly consented to arbitration and to enforcement of arbitral awards in Oklahoma
state court; Tribe thereby waived its sovereign immunity from petitioner
contractor's state-court suit to enforce its arbitration award. C & L
Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., p. 411.

Catalyst theory--Prevailing party.--"Catalyst theory," which posits
that a plaintiff is a prevailing party if it achieves desired result because
lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in defendant's conduct, is not a
permissible basis for award of attorney's fees under Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human

New Hampshire-Maine boundary--Estoppel.--Because New Hampshire, in an earlier proceeding fixing its boundary with Maine, agreed that
phrase "Middle of the River" in a 1740 decree means middle of Piscataqua
River's main navigation channel, New Hampshire is estopped from asserting now that boundary runs along Maine shore. New Hampshire v.

her in response to protected activities in which she had engaged. Clark
County School Dist. v. Breeden, p. 268.

CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1991.

Front pay--Compensatory damages cap.--Front pay, a remedy authorized under Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964, is not an element of
compensatory damages under Civil Rights Act of 1991 and thus is not
subject to damages cap imposed by 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(3). Pollard v.

I. Compensation Clause.

Federal judges' salaries--Withholding taxes.--Compensation Clause
prevents Government from collecting Social Security, but not Medicare,
taxes from federal judges who held office before Congress extended those
taxes to federal employees; violation was not cured by a 1984 pay increase
for federal judges. United States v. Hatter, p. 557.

II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Death penalty--Jury instructions on mitigating evidence.--Jury instructions at Penry's resentencing for capital murder did not comply with
Court's mandate in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302. Penry v. Johnson,
p. 782.

III. Due Process.

1. Death penalty--Jury instructions.--South Carolina Supreme Court
incorrectly interpreted Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154--where
this Court held that due process requires that a jury be informed of a
capital defendant's parole ineligibility where such defendant's future dangerousness is at issue and only sentencing alternative to death is life imprisonment without parole--when it declared that case inapplicable to

1096 INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
South Carolina's current capital sentencing scheme. Shafer v. South Carolina, p. 36.

2. Retroactive application of judicial decision--"Year and a day"
rule.--Tennessee Supreme Court's retroactive application to petitioner of
its decision abolishing common-law "year and a day" rule--which provided
that no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim died by
defendant's act within a year and a day of such act--did not deny petitioner due process. Rogers v. Tennessee, p. 451.

3. State labor law--Payments on public works project.--Because California law affords respondent public works project subcontractor sufficient
opportunity to pursue its claim for payment in state court, statutory
scheme does not deprive respondent of due process when it authorizes
State to order withholding of such payments from contractor if a subcontractor fails to comply with certain Labor Code requirements; permits
contractor, in turn, to withhold similar sums from subcontractor; and permits contractor, or his assignee, to sue awarding body for alleged breach
of contract. Lujan v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., p. 189.

IV. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Redistricting plan.--District Court's conclusion that North Carolina violated Equal Protection Clause by using race as predominant factor in
drawing its 12th Congressional District's boundaries is based on clearly
erroneous findings. Easley v. Cromartie, p. 234.

V. Freedom of Speech.

1. Illegally intercepted communication--Disclosure of contents.--Respondent news media's disclosure of contents of an illegally intercepted
cell phone conversation about a public issue is protected by First Amendment. Bartnicki v. Vopper, p. 514.

2. Inmate communication--Right to provide legal assistance to fellow
inmates.--Inmates do not have such a special First Amendment right that
enhances protections otherwise available under Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.
78, in which this Court held that restrictions on prisoners' communications
to other inmates are constitutional if restrictions are reasonably related
to legitimate penological interests. Shaw v. Murphy, p. 223.

VI. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

1. Admission of psychiatric evidence--Uncounseled interview.--
Admission into evidence at Penry's capital sentencing hearing of statements from a psychiatric report based on an uncounseled interview with
Penry did not run afoul of Fifth Amendment's privilege against selfincrimination. Penry v. Johnson, p. 782.

1097INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.

2. Effect of innocence assertion.--Ohio Supreme Court erred in holding
that assertion of innocence deprived a witness of her Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination. Ohio v. Reiner, p. 17.

VII. Right to Counsel.

Attachment of right--Factually related charges.--Because Sixth
Amendment right to counsel is "offense specific," it does not necessarily
extend to crimes that are "factually related" to those actually charged.
Texas v. Cobb, p. 162.

VIII. Searches and Seizures.

1. Inventory search incident to arrest--Officer's subjective motivation.--Arkansas Supreme Court's ruling--that evidence obtained during
an inventory search of respondent's car incident to respondent's arrest
should be suppressed because police officer had an improper subjective
motivation for stop--cannot be squared with holding in Whren v. United
States, 517 U. S. 806, that subjective intentions play no role in Fourth
Amendment analysis. Arkansas v. Sullivan, p. 769.

2. State hospital--Maternity patients--Diagnostic tests as evidence
for law enforcement purposes.--A state hospital's performance of drug
tests to obtain evidence of maternity patients' cocaine use for law enforcement purposes is an unreasonable search if patients have not consented to
procedure; interest in using threat of criminal sanctions to deter such use
cannot justify a departure from general rule that an official nonconsensual
search is unconstitutional if not authorized by a valid warrant. Ferguson
v. Charleston, p. 67.

3. Warrantless arrest--Minor criminal offense.--Fourth Amendment
does not forbid a warrantless arrest for a minor criminal offense, such as
a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine. Atwater v.
Lago Vista, p. 318.

CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.

Marijuana--Medical necessity exception.--There is no medical necessity exception to Act's prohibitions on manufacturing and distributing marijuana. United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative,
p. 483.
