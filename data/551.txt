3.  The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that both the state trial court's 
excusal of Juror Z and the State Supreme Court's affirmance were con-
trary  to,  or  an  unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  established  federal 
law.  Pp. 15-22. 

(a)  Contrary  to  the  Ninth  Circuit's  conclusion,  the  State  Supreme 
Court  explicitly  found  that  Juror  Z  was  substantially  impaired.  Even

to these crimes and pleaded guilty to the California offenses, for which he received a sentence of life imprisonment.  The 
State of Washington, however, sought the death penalty and brought Brown to trial.  Based on the jury's verdicts in the 
guilt  and  sentencing  phases  of  the  trial,  Brown  was  sen-tenced to death.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed

Opinion of the Court 
The  harm  caused  by  a  defendant's  failure  to  object  to  a  ju-ror's  excusal  was  described  well  by  a  Washington  appellate 

court in a different case: 

"When  a  challenge  for  cause  is  made,  opposing  counsel 
can object either on the grounds that it is facially insuf-ficient or that the facts needed to support it are not true. 

[Defendant]  did  neither.  Had  [defendant]  objected  im-mediately  to  the  State's  challenge  for  cause,  the  court 
could  have  tried  the  issue  and  determined  the  law  and the  facts.  Because [defendant]  did  not  timely  object  to 
the excusal of Juror 30, the court had no opportunity to 
remedy  whatever  factual  questions  were  in  the  mind of [defendant's] counsel."

offending,  that  requirement  was  consistent  with  the  state sentencing scheme. 

For  the  reasons  explained  above  the  defense's  failure  to object  in  this  case  has  significance  to  our  analysis  even  on 
the assumption that state law did not require an objection to preserve  an  error  for  review  in  the  circumstances  of  this 
case.  The  Supreme  Court  of  Washington,  however,  noted 
Brown's  failure  to  object,  suggesting  it  had  significance  for its own analysis.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION 
BY MS. HUPP: Q  Good  afternoon.  My  name  is  Lin-Marie  Hupp,  and 

I'm one of Cal Brown's attorneys. I  would  like  to  start  off  asking  you  some  questions  about 
your  feelings  about  the  death  penalty.  I  want  to  reinforce what  the  Judge  has  already  told  you,  which  is  there  are  no 
right  or  wrong  answers.  We  just  need  to  get  information about your feelings so we can do our job. 

A  Okay. Q  Can you tell me when it was you first realized this was 
a potential death penalty case? A  Not  until  last  Monday  when  I  was  here  in  the  initial 
jury information session. Q  Okay.  Can you tell me when the Judge read that long 
thing  to  you and basically  told  you  that this was  a potential in  the  case,  can  you  tell  me  what  you  were  thinking  when 
you heard that? A  I  guess  I  wasn't  surprised  when  I  got  the  announce-
ment for jury duty.  And it was more than the standard two weeks that  most  everybody else  goes  to.  I  thought it  must 
be  a  pretty  substantial  case.  In  my  mind  I  tried  to  guess what  it  might  be,  so  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  entered 
into it. Q  Can you give me an idea of what your general feelings 
about the death penalty are?

Appendix to opinion of the Court 
Q  In  addition  to  that  in  Washington  even  premeditated murders are not eligible for a potential death penalty unless 

the  State  also  proves  aggravating  circumstances.  In  this case the State is alleging or is going to try and prove a num-
ber  of  aggravating  circumstances,  four  of  them.  Okay. And  the  ones  that  they  are  going  to  try  and  prove  are  that 
the murder was committed, a premeditated murder was com-
mitted during a rape, a robbery, a kidnapping and that it was done in order to conceal a witness or eliminate a witness. 

Does  that  fall within  the  class  of  cases that  you  think  the death penalty is appropriate? 
A  I think that would be. 
Q  Okay.  Now,  how  about  other  sentencing  options  in  a 
case  like  that,  do  you  think  that  something  other  than  the 
death penalty might be an appropriate sentence? 

A  I think that if a person is temporarily insane or things 
of  that  that  lead  a  person  to  do  things  that  they  would  not 
normally do, I think that would enter into it. 

Q  All  right.  Other  than--well,  maybe  what  we  should 
do--the way  that the  law is  in  Washington, if the  jury  finds 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  somebody  has  committed  a 
premeditated  murder  with  at  least  one  aggravating  circum-
stance,  and  in  this  case  you  have  a  potential  for  the  four, 
then  the  jury  reconvenes  to  consider  whether  or  not  the 
death  penalty  should  be  imposed  or  whether  or  not  a  life 
sentence without parole should be imposed. 

One sort  of aside here, life without  parole  is exactly  what 
it sounds like.  It is a life sentence.  You're not ever eligible 
for parole.  You hear about it in the papers sometimes where 
somebody  has  got  a  life  sentence  and  they're  going  to  be 
eligible for parole in 10 years or 20 years. 

A  I understand. 
Q  Were  you  aware  before  that  Washington  has  got  this 
kind of sentence where it's life without parole where you are 
not ever eligible for parole? 

A  I did not until this afternoon.

Appendix to opinion of the Court 
A  It seemed like there were several years when it wasn't used at all and just recently it has become more prevalent in 

the news anyway.  I don't think it should never happen, and I  don't  think  it  should  happen  10  times  a  week  either.  I'm 
not  sure  what  the  appropriate  number  is  but  I  think  in  se-vere situations, it is appropriate. 

Q  It  sounds  like  you're  a  little  more  comfortable  that  it is 

being used some of the time? A  Yes. 

Q  You weren't happy with the time when it wasn't being used at all? 
A  I  can't  say  I  was  happy  or  unhappy,  I  just  felt  that 
there were times when it would be appropriate. 

Q  Let me ask you, and we may have covered this already, 
but  let  me  ask  you  just  to  make  sure  I  understand.  If  the 
State  were to prove beyond  a  reasonable  doubt that  the  de-
fendant  had  committed  a  premeditated  murder  with  aggra-
vating  circumstances that  I have  laid  out  for you,  rape, rob-
bery,  kidnapping,  to  conceal  or  eliminate  a  witness,  at  least 
one of those, in addition another thing you might hear in this 
trial  is  some  evidence  that  the  defendant  deliberately  in-
flicted  pain  upon the  victim before  she  died  for  some period 
of time. 

If  that  was  the  crime  that  you  heard  about  and  came  to 
a  decision  about  guilty  about,  do  you  think  you  consider  a 
life sentence? 

A  I  could  consider  it  but  I  don't  know  if  I  really  have 
enough information to make a determination. 

Q  Right.  And  it's  real  tough  to  be  asking  you  these 
questions  and  even  tougher  for  you  to  have  to  answer  them 
without any  evidence  before  you.  But you understand that 
this  is  our  only  time  to  do  that  before  you  have  heard  all 
the evidence? 

A  I understand, yes. 
Q  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  law  in  this  state  after,  even 
after you have found somebody guilty of really hideous crime

committed  the  offense,  well,  then  it  wouldn't  be  premedi-
tated.  It  would  be  an  insanity  defense,  and  that  would  all 
get dealt with-- 

MR.  MATTHEWS:  Your  Honor,  again,  I  am  going  to  ob-
ject to the nature of the question. 

THE  COURT:  [Juror  Z],  you  were  the  one  that  actually 
brought  it  up  in  terms  of  the  mental  status  of  the  person. 
You are the one who said temporarily insane when they com-
mitted this kind of crime.  You realize that there are partic-
ular  defenses  that  may  be  available  in  the  actual  criminal 
case itself, the guilt phase. 

But  once  you  get  to  the  penalty  phase,  we're  not  talking 
about  the  crime  in  any way,  and you're  simply  trying to  de-
termine what the appropriate punishment or sanction should 
be  for  a  crime  that  a  person  has  been  found  guilty  of.  At 
that point in time, something like  all sorts of mitigating cir-
cumstances come into it, and mental status can come into it. 
But it would only be evaluated in the light of the mitigating 
circumstances, not a defense.  Do you understand that? 

A  Understand. 
Q  (BY  MS.  HUPP)  To  just  sort  of  follow  up  on  that,  if 
mental  status  came  into  play  and  you  were  presented  with 
some  sort  of  evidence  about  mental  status,  is  that  the  sort 
of evidence you would consider? 

A  Yes, I could. 
Q  How  about  things  like  somebody's  childhood  or  their 
emotional development? 

A  I  could  consider  it.  I  don't  have  strong  feelings  one 
way or the other. 

Q  Okay.  All right.  And, also, when we talk about miti-
gating circumstances, what might be mitigating to you might 
not  matter  much to the  person sitting  next to you  in juror's 
box.  Do  you  think  you  could  discuss  your  feelings  about

Q  You mentioned  on your  questionnaire, and  we do  read 
them, that you're in favor of the death penalty if it is proved 
beyond a shadow of a doubt if a person has killed and would 
kill again.  Do you remember making that statement? 

A  Yes. 
Q  First of all, have you ever been on a jury trial before? 
A  I have not. 
Q  Now,  you  made  this  statement  before  you  read  your 
juror's handbook I imagine? 

A  Yes. 
Q  So,  I  want  to  ask  you,  the  thing  that  bothers  me,  of 
course,  is  the  idea  beyond  a  shadow  of  a  doubt.  The  law 
says  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  and  it  will  be  explained  to 
you  what  it  actually  means.  But  I  want  to  assure  you  it 
doesn't  mean,  I  don't  believe  the  Court  would  instruct  .  .  . 
you  it  means  beyond  all  doubt  or  beyond  any  shadow  of  a 
doubt.  Knowing  that,  would  you  still  require  the  State  to 
prove  beyond  a  shadow  of  a  doubt  that  the  crime  occurred 
knowing that the law doesn't require that much of us? 

A  I  would  have  to  know  the,  I'm  at  a  loss  for  the  words 
here. 

Q  You  can  ask  me  any  questions,  too,  if  you  need  some 
clarification. 

A  I  guess  it  would  have  to  be  in  my  mind  very  obvious 
that the person would reoffend. 

Q  Well, we're not talking about that, sir. 
A  Or was guilty, yes. 
Q  So, we're talking about that? 
A  Yes. 
Q  So,  you  would  be  satisfied  with  a  reasonable  doubt 
standard?  You would be willing to follow the law? 

A  Yes. 
Q  In  other  words,  nothing,  there  is  very  few  things  in 
life absolutely certain? 

A  I understand.

Appendix to opinion of the Court 
in  this  case,  we  have  made  the  election  to  ask  that  the  jury 
if  he  is  found  guilty,  ask  that  the  jury  vote  for  the  death 
penalty. 

And  I'm asking  you  a very  important  thing  and  to  every-
one  in  here,  whether  you,  knowing  that  the  person  would 
never  get  out  for  the  rest  of  his  life,  two  things.  And 
they're  slightly  different.  One,  whether  you  could  consider 
the  death  penalty  and  the  second  thing  I  would  ask  you  is 
whether you could impose the death penalty.  I'm not asking 
a promise or anything. 

But I'm asking you, first,  could you consider it, and if you 
could  consider  it,  do  you  think  under  the  conditions  where 
the man would never get out again you could impose it? 

A  Yes, sir. 
Q  So, this idea of him having to kill again to deserve the 
death  penalty  is  something  that  you  are  not  firm  on,  you 
don't feel that now? 

A  I do feel that way if parole is an option, without parole 
as  an  option.  I  believe  in  the  death  penalty.  Like  I  said, 
I'm  not  sure  that  there  should  be  a  waiting  line  of  people 
happening  every  day  or  every  week  even,  but  I  think  in  se-
vere situations it's an appropriate measure. 

Q  But  in  the  situation  where  a  person  is  locked  up  for 
the rest of his life and there is no chance of him ever getting 
out  again,  which  would  be  the  situation  in  this  case,  do  you 
think you could also consider and vote for the death penalty 
under those circumstances? 

A  I could consider it, yes. 
Q  Then could you impose it? 
A  I  could  if  I  was  convinced  that  was  the  appropriate 
measure. 

MR. MATTHEWS: I have no further questions. 
THE  COURT:  All  right.  [Juror  Z],  there  is  something 
that  I  want  to  clarify  in  response  to  some  of  the  questions 
that were asked of you.

from  existing customers  when  it set the  notice requirement;  the newly 
insured who  gets charged more  owing to  an  erroneous  report  is  in  the 
same boat with the renewal applicant.  Pp. 60-63. 

(b)  An increased rate is not "based in whole or in part on" a credit 
report  under $ 1681m(a)  unless the  report was a  necessary condition  of 
the  increase.  In  common  talk,  "based  on"  indicates  a  but-for  causal 
relationship  and thus a necessary logical condition.  Though some  tex-
tual arguments point another way, it makes more sense to suspect that 
Congress meant to require notice and prompt a consumer challenge only 
when  the  consumer  would  gain  something  if  the  challenge  succeeded. 
Pp. 63-64. 

(c)  In  determining  whether  a  first-time  rate  is  a  disadvantageous 
increase, the baseline is the rate that the applicant would have received 
had  the  company  not  taken  his  credit  score  into  account  (the  "neutral 
score"  rate  GEICO  used  in  Edo's  case).  That  baseline  comports  with 
the  understanding  that  $ 1681m(a)  notice  is  required  only  when  the 
credit report's effect on the initial rate is necessary to put the consumer 
in  a  worse  position  than  other  relevant  facts  would  have  decreed  any-
way.  Congress  was  more  likely  concerned  with  the  practical  question 
whether  the  consumer's  rate  actually  suffered  when  his  credit  report 
was  taken  into  account  than  the  theoretical  question  whether  the  con-
sumer  would  have  gotten  a  better  rate  with  the  best  possible  credit 
score,  the  baseline  suggested  by  the  Government  and  respondent-
plaintiffs.  The Government's objection to this reading is rejected.  Al-
though the rate initially offered for new insurance is an "increase" call-
ing for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, once a consumer has learned 
that  his  credit  report  led  the  insurer  to  charge  more,  he  need  not  be 
told with each renewal if his rate has not changed.  After initial dealing 
between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for "increase" is the 
previous  rate  or  charge,  not  the  "neutral"  baseline  that  applies  at  the 
start.  Pp. 64-67. 

3.  GEICO did not violate the statute, and while Safeco might have, it 
did not act recklessly.  Pp. 67-70. 

(a)  Because the initial rate GEICO offered Edo was what he would 
have received had his credit score not been taken into account, GEICO 
owed him no adverse action notice under $ 1681m(a).  Pp. 67-68. 

(b)  Even if  Safeco violated FCRA  when  it  failed to give  Burr  and 
Massey  notice  on  the  mistaken  belief  that  $ 1681m(a)  did  not  apply  to 
initial  applications,  the  company  was  not  reckless.  The  common  law 
has  generally  understood  "recklessness"  in  the  civil  liability  sphere  as 
conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing "an unjustifia-
bly high risk of harm  that is either  known or  so obvious that it  should 
be  known."  Farmer

Opinion of the Court 
for  willful  liability  remains  unchanged  and  so  must  require knowing  action,  just  as  it  did  originally  in  the  draft  of 

$ 1681n. Perhaps.  But Congress may have scaled the standard for 
actual damages down to simple negligence because it thought gross  negligence,  being  like  reckless  action,  was  covered  by 
willfulness.  Because  this  alternative  reading  is  possible, 
any  inference  from  the  drafting  sequence  is  shaky,  and  cer-tainly  no  match  for  the  following  clue  in  the  text  as  finally 

adopted,  which  points  to  the  traditional  understanding  of willfulness in the civil sphere. 

The  phrase  in  question  appears  in  the  preamble  sentence 
of $ 1681n(a):  "Any  person who willfully fails to comply  with 
any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect 
to any consumer is liable to that consumer . . . ."   Then come 
the  details, in  paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B), spelling out two 
distinct  measures  of  damages  chargeable  against  the  willful 
violator.  As a general matter, the consumer may get either 
actual  damages  or  "damages  of  not  less  than  $100  and  not 
more  than  $1,000."  $ 1681n(a)(1)(A).  But  where  the  of-
fender is liable "for obtaining a consumer report under false 
pretenses or  knowingly without  a  permissible purpose," the 
statute  sets  liability  higher:  "actual  damages  .  .  .  or  $1,000, 
whichever is greater."  $ 1681n(a)(1)(B). 

If the companies were right that "willfully" limits liability 
under  $ 1681n(a)  to  knowing  violations,  the  modifier  "know-
ingly" in $ 1681n(a)(1)(B) would be superfluous and incongru-
ous;  it  would  have  made  no  sense  for  Congress  to  condition 
the higher damages under $ 1681n(a) on knowingly obtaining 
a report without a permissible purpose if the general thresh-
old  of  any  liability  under  the  section  were  knowing  miscon-
duct.  If, on the other hand, "willfully" covers both knowing 
and reckless disregard of the law, knowing violations are sen-
sibly  understood  as  a  more  serious  subcategory  of  willful 
ones, and both the preamble and the subsection have distinct 
jobs  to  do.  See  United

Opinion of the Court 
premium is "an increase in any charge for . . . any insurance, existing or applied for."  15 U. S. C. $ 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i). 

In  Safeco's  case,  the  District  Court  held  that  the  initial rate  for  a  new  insurance  policy  cannot  be  an  "increase"  be-
cause there is no prior dealing.  The phrase "increase in any charge  for  . . . insurance"  is  readily  understood  to  mean  a 
change  in  treatment  for  an  insured,  which  assumes  a  previ-
ous  charge  for  comparison.  See  Webster's  New  Interna-tional  Dictionary  1260  (2d  ed.  1957)  (defining  "increase"  as 

"[a]ddition  or  enlargement  in  size,  extent,  quantity,  num-ber,  intensity,  value,  substance,  etc.;  augmentation;  growth; 
multiplication").  Since  the  District  Court  understood  "in-crease"  to  speak  of  change  just  as  much  as  of  comparative 
size  or  quantity,  it  reasoned  that  the  statute's  "increase" never touches the initial rate offer, where there is no change. 

The Government takes the part of the Court of Appeals in construing "increase" to reach a first-time rate.  It says that 
regular  usage  of  the  term  is  not  as  narrow  as  the  District Court  thought:  the  point  from  which  to  measure  difference 
can  just  as  easily  be  understood  without  referring  to  prior 
individual dealing.  The Government gives the example of a gas  station  owner  who  charges  more  than  the  posted  price 

for  gas  to  customers  he  does  not  like;  it  makes  sense  to  say that  the  owner  increases  the  price  and  that  the  driver  pays 
an  increased  price,  even  if  he  never  pulled  in  there  for  gas before.  See Brief for United States as

Opinion of the Court 
that the "increase" required for "adverse action," 15 U. S. C. $ 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i),  speaks  to  a  disadvantageous  rate  even 

with  no  prior  dealing;  the  term  reaches  initial  rates  for new applicants. 

B 
Although  offering  the  initial  rate  for  new  insurance  can be  an  "adverse  action,"  respondent-plaintiffs  have  another 

hurdle  to  clear,  for  $ 1681m(a)  calls  for  notice  only  when  the adverse  action  is  "based  in  whole or  in  part  on"  a  credit  re-
port.  GEICO  argues  that  in  order  to  have  adverse  action "based  on"  a  credit  report, consideration  of  the  report  must 
be  a  necessary  condition  for  the  increased  rate.  The  Gov-ernment  and  respondent-plaintiffs  do  not  explicitly  take  a 
position on this point. To  the  extent  there  is  any  disagreement  on  the  issue,  we 
accept  GEICO's  reading.  In  common  talk,  the  phrase "based on" indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a 
necessary  logical  condition.  Under  this  most  natural  read-ing  of  $ 1681m(a),  then,  an  increased  rate  is  not  "based  in 
whole or in part on" the credit report unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase. 

As  before,  there  are  textual  arguments  pointing  another way.  The  statute  speaks  in  terms  of  basing  the  action  "in 
part" as  well as  wholly on  the  credit  report,  and this  phras-ing  could  mean  that  adverse  action  is  "based  on"  a  credit 
report  whenever  the  report  was  considered  in  the  rate-setting process, even without being a necessary condition for 
the rate increase.  But there are good reasons to think Con-gress preferred GEICO's necessary-condition reading. 

If  the  statute  has  any  claim  to  lucidity,  not  all  "adverse actions" require notice, only those "based . . . on" information 
in a credit report.  Since the  statute does not explicitly call for  notice  when  a  business  acts  adversely  merely  after  con-
sulting  a  report,  conditioning  the  requirement  on  action "based  .  .  .  on"  a  report  suggests  that  the  duty  to  report 
arises  from  some  practical  consequence  of  reading  the  re-

Opinion of the Court 
first-time applicant to sue), and considering the credit report must  be  a  necessary  condition  for  the  difference.  The  re-

maining  step  in  determining  a  duty  to  notify  in  cases  like these is identifying the  benchmark for determining whether 
a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase.  And in deal-ing with  this  issue,  the pragmatic  reading of "based .  . . on" 
as  a  condition  necessary  to  make  a  practical  difference  car-
ries a helpful suggestion. The  Government  and  respondent-plaintiffs  argue  that  the 

baseline  should  be  the  rate  that  the  applicant  would  have received  with  the  best  possible  credit  score,  while  GEICO 
contends it is what the applicant would have had if the com-pany had not taken his credit score into account (the "neutral 
score"  rate  GEICO  used  in  Edo's  case).  We  think  GEICO has  the  better  position,  primarily  because  its  "increase" 
baseline is more comfortable with the understanding of cau-sation just discussed, which requires notice under $ 1681m(a) 
only  when  the  effect  of  the  credit  report  on  the  initial  rate 
offered is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position 
than  other  relevant  facts  would  have  decreed  anyway.  If 
Congress  was  this  concerned  with  practical  consequences 
when it adopted a "based . . . on" causation standard, it pre-
sumably thought in equally practical terms when it spoke of 
an "increase" that must be defined by a baseline to measure 
from.  Congress  was  therefore  more  likely  concerned  with 
the  practical  question  whether  the  consumer's  rate  actually 
suffered  when  the  company  took  his  credit  report  into  ac-
count  than  the  theoretical  question  whether  the  consumer 
would have gotten a better rate with perfect credit.15 

15 While  it  might  seem  odd,  under  the  current  statutory  structure,  to 
interpret  the  definition  of  "adverse  action"  (in  $ 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i))  in  con-
junction  with  $ 1681m(a),  which  simply  applies  the  notice  requirement  to 
a particular subset of "adverse actions," there are strong indications that 
Congress  intended  these  provisions  to  be  construed  in  tandem.  When 
FCRA  was  initially  enacted,  the  link  between  the  definition  of  "adverse 
action" and  the notice  requirement was  clear, since  "adverse  action"  was

Opinion of the Court 
action to get some attention, we think the cost of closing the loophole would be too high. 

While on the subject of hypernotification, we should add a word  on  another  point  of  practical  significance.  Although 
the  rate  initially  offered  for  new  insurance  is  an  "increase" calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, did Congress 
intend the same baseline to apply if the quoted rate remains the  same  over  a  course  of  dealing,  being  repeated  at  each 
renewal date? We  cannot  believe  so.  Once  a  consumer  has  learned  that 
his  credit  report  led  the  insurer  to  charge  more,  he  has  no need  to  be  told over  again  with  each  renewal if  his  rate  has 
not changed.  For that matter, any other construction would probably stretch the word "increase" more than it could bear. 
Once  the  gas  station  owner  had  charged  the  customer  the above-market price, it would be strange to speak of the same 
price  as  an  increase  every  time  the  customer  pulled  in. Once  buyer  and  seller  have  begun  a  course  of  dealing,  cus-
tomary  usage  does  demand  a  change  for  "increase"  to  make sense.

16  Thus,  after  initial  dealing  between  the  consumer 

and  the  insurer,  the  baseline  for  "increase"  is  the  previous rate  or  charge,  not  the  "neutral"  baseline  that  applies  at 

the start.  IV

In  GEICO's  case,  the  initial  rate  offered  to  Edo  was  the one  he  would  have  received  if  his  credit  score  had  not  been 

16 Consider,  too,  a  consumer  who,  at  the  initial  application  stage,  had  a 
perfect credit score and thus obtained the best insurance rate, but, at the 
renewal stage, was charged at a higher rate (but still lower than the rate 
he would have received had his credit report not been taken into account) 
solely because his credit score fell during the interim.  Although the con-
sumer clearly suffered an "increase" in his insurance rate that was "based 
on" his  credit  score,  he would  not be  entitled  to  an  adverse action  notice 
under the baseline used for initial applications.

Opinion of the Court 

$ 34,  at  213-214.  The  Restatement,  for  example,  defines reckless disregard of a person's physical safety this way: 

"The  actor's  conduct  is  in  reckless  disregard  of  the safety  of  another  if  he  does  an  act  or  intentionally  fails 
to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, know-ing  or  having  reason to  know  of  facts which  would  lead 
a  reasonable  man  to  realize,  not  only  that  his  conduct creates  an  unreasonable  risk  of  physical  harm  to  an-
other,  but  also  that  such  risk  is  substantially  greater than  that  which is  necessary to make his conduct negli-
gent."  2  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  $ 500,  p.  587 
(1963-1964). 

It  is this  high  risk of  harm, objectively  assessed,  that is  the essence  of  recklessness  at  common  law.  See  Prosser  and 

Keeton $ 34, at 213  (recklessness requires "a known or obvi-ous risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that 
harm would follow"). There  being  no  indication  that  Congress  had  something 
different  in  mind,  we  have  no  reason  to  deviate  from  the 
common  law  understanding  in  applying  the  statute.  See

Bathing  Suit  Rule's  prohibition  of  nudity  was  essential  to  protect  the

the court added, she did obtain a preliminary injunction, and therefore 
qualified as a prevailing party to that extent.  Reasoning that the pre-
liminary  injunction  could  not  be  revisited  at  the  second  stage  of  the 
litigation because it had expired, the court awarded plaintiff counsel fees 
covering the first phase of the litigation.  The Florida officials appealed, 
challenging both the preliminary injunction and the counsel fees award. 
The  Eleventh  Circuit  held  first  that  defendants'  challenges  to  the  pre-
liminary  injunction  were  moot.  The  court  then  affirmed  the  counsel 
fees  award,  reasoning  that  the  preliminary  order  allowed  Wyner  to 
present  the  peace  symbol  display  unimpeded  by  adverse  state  action.

Petitioner  presents  a  false  analogy  in  arguing  that,  if  Brecht  applies 
whether  or  not  the  state  appellate  court  conducted  Chapman  review, 
then  Brecht  would  apply  even  if  a  State  eliminated  appellate  review

terrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act  of 1996  (AEDPA),  as inter-
preted in Mitchell v.  Esparza, 540 U. S. 12--require  a different review

prepared to testify that she had heard Hurtz discussing hom-icides bearing some resemblance to the murder  of the  Bells. 

In the trial court's view, the defense had provided insufficient evidence to link the incidents described by Hurtz to the mur-
ders for which petitioner was charged. Following  his  conviction,  petitioner  appealed  to  the  Cali-
fornia  Court  of  Appeal,  arguing  (among  other  things)  that 
the trial court's exclusion of Maples' testimony deprived him of a fair opportunity to defend himself, in violation of 

Cham-
bers v.  Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973) (holding that a com-bination  of  erroneous  evidentiary  rulings  rose  to  the  level 

of  a  due  process  violation).  Without  explicitly  addressing 
petitioner's  Chambers  argument,  the  state  appellate  court 
held  that  the  trial court  had not  abused its  discretion  in ex-
cluding  Maples'  testimony  under  California's  evidentiary 
rules,  adding  that  "no  possible  prejudice"  could  have  re-
sulted in light of the "merely cumulative" nature of the testi-
mony.  People  v.  Fry,  No.  A072396  (Ct.  App.  Cal.,  1st  App. 
Dist., Mar. 30, 2000), App. 97, n. 17.  The court did not spec-
ify  which  harmless-error  standard  it  was  applying  in  con-
cluding  that  petitioner  suffered  "no  possible  prejudice." 
The  Supreme  Court  of  California  denied  discretionary  re-
view,  and  petitioner  did  not  then  seek  a  writ  of  certiorari 
from this Court. 

Petitioner next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in 
the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District 
of  California,  raising  the  aforementioned  due  process  claim 
(among others).  The case was initially assigned to a Magis-
trate  Judge,  who  ultimately  recommended  denying  relief. 
He found the state appellate court's failure to recognize error 
under  Chambers  to  be  "an  unreasonable  application  of 
clearly  established  law  as  set forth  by  the  Supreme  Court," 
App. 180, and disagreed with the state appellate court's find-
ing  of  "no  possible  prejudice."  But  he  nevertheless  con-
cluded  that  "there  ha[d]  been  an  insufficient  showing  that 
the improper exclusion of the testimony of Ms. Maples had a

trict Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's findings and rec-ommendations  in  full,  and  a  divided  panel  of  the  United

II 

A 
In Chapman, supra, a case that reached this Court on di-rect review of a  state-court criminal judgment, we held that 

a  federal  constitutional  error  can  be  considered  harmless only if a court is "able to declare a belief that it was harmless 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt."  Id.,  at  24.  In  Brecht,  supra, we considered whether the Chapman standard of review ap-
plies on collateral review of a state-court criminal judgment under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.  Citing concerns about finality, com-
ity,  and  federalism,  we  rejected  the  Chapman  standard  in favor  of  the  more  forgiving  standard  of  review  applied  to 
nonconstitutional errors on direct appeal from federal convic-tions.  See 

Kotteakos  v.  United  States,  328  U. S.  750  (1946). Under  that  standard,  an  error  is  harmless  unless  it  " `had 

substantial  and  injurious  effect  or  influence  in  determin-ing  the  jury's  verdict.' "  Brecht,  supra,  at  631  (quoting 
Kotteakos,  supra,  at  776).  The  question  in  this  case  is whether  a  federal  court  must  assess  the  prejudicial  impact 
of  the  unconstitutional  exclusion  of  evidence  during  a  state-court  criminal  trial  under 

Brecht  even  if  the  state  appellate court  has  not  found,  as  the  state  appellate  court  in  Brecht 

had found, that the error was harmless  beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman.

1 As this case comes to the Court, we assume (without deciding) that the 
state  appellate  court's  decision  affirming  the  exclusion  of  Maples'  testi-
mony  was  an  unreasonable  application  of  Chambers  v.  Mississippi,  410 
U. S.  284,  302  (1973).  We  also  assume  that  the  state  appellate  court  did 
not determine the harmlessness of the error under the Chapman standard,

Opinion of the Court 
We  begin  with  the  Court's  opinion  in  Brecht.  The  pri-mary reasons it gave for adopting a less onerous standard on 

collateral  review  of  state-court  criminal  judgments  did  not turn  on  whether  the  state  court  itself  conducted  Chapman 
review.  The opinion explained that application of Chapman would "undermin[e] the States' interest in finality," 507 U. S., 
at 637; would "infring[e] upon [the States'] sovereignty over criminal  matters," 

ibid.;  would  undercut  the  historic  limita-tion  of  habeas  relief  to  those  " `grievously  wronged,' "  ibid.; 

and would "impos[e] significant `social costs,' " ibid. (quoting United  States  v.  Mechanik,  475  U. S.  66,  72  (1986)).  Since 
each  of  these  concerns  applies  with  equal  force  whether  or not  the state court reaches  the 

Chapman question, it  would be  illogical  to  make  the  standard  of  review  turn  upon  that 

contingency. The  opinion  in  Brecht clearly  assumed that  the  Kotteakos 
standard  would  apply  in  virtually  all  $ 2254  cases.  It  sug-gested  an  exception  only  for  the  "unusual  case"  in  which 
"a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type, or one that  is  combined with a  pattern  of prosecutorial mis-
conduct,  .  .  .  infect[s]  the  integrity  of  the  proceeding."  507 U. S.,  at  638,  n.  9.  This,  of  course,  has  nothing  to  do  with 
whether  the  state  court  conducted  harmless-error  review. The  concurring  and  dissenting  opinions  shared  the  assump-
tion that Kotteakos would almost always be the standard on collateral  review.  The  former  stated  in  categorical  terms 
that  the  "Kotteakos  standard"  "will  now  apply  on  collateral review"  of  state  convictions,  507  U. S.,  at  643  (

Opinion of the Court 
also  assumed  that  Brecht's  applicability  does  not  turn  on whether  the  state  appellate  court  recognized  the  constitu-

tional error and reached the Chapman question.  See Penry v. 

Johnson,  532  U. S.  782,  795  (2001);  Calderon  v.  Coleman, 
525 U. S. 141, 145 (1998) (per curiam). Petitioner's  contrary  position  misreads  (or  at  least  exag-

gerates  the  significance  of)  a  lone  passage  from  our  Brecht 
opinion.  In that passage, the Court explained: 

"State courts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error and evaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial proc-

ess under Chapman, and state courts often occupy a su-
perior  vantage  point  from  which  to  evaluate  the  effect of trial error.  For these reasons, it scarcely seems logi-

cal  to  require  federal  habeas  courts  to  engage  in  the identical  approach  to  harmless-error  review  that 

Chap-
man  requires  state  courts  to  engage  in  on  direct  re-view."  507 U. S., at 636 (citation omitted). 

But  the  quoted  passage  does  little  to  advance  petitioner's 
position.  To  say  (a)  that  since  state  courts  are  required  to 
evaluate  constitutional  error  under  Chapman  it  makes  no sense  to  establish 

Chapman  as  the  standard  for  federal  ha-
beas  review  is  not  at  all  to  say  (b)  that  whenever  a  state court fails in its responsibility to apply 

Chapman the federal 
habeas standard must change.  It would be foolish to equate the two, in view of the other weighty reasons given in 

Brecht 
for  applying  a  less  onerous  standard  on  collateral  review-- reasons  having  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  state  court 

actually applied Chapman. Petitioner  argues  that,  if 

Brecht  applies  whether  or  not 
the  state  appellate  court  conducted  Chapman  review,  then 
Brecht  would  apply  even  if  a  State  eliminated  appellate  re-
view  altogether.  That  is  not  necessarily  so.  The  federal 
habeas review rule applied to the class of case in which state 
appellate  review  is  available  does  not  have  to  be  the  same 
rule applied to the class of case where it is not.  We have no

Opinion of the Court 
occasion to resolve that hypothetical (and highly unrealistic) question  now.  In  the  case  before  us  petitioner 

did  obtain 
appellate  review  of  his  constitutional  claim;  the  state  court simply  found  the  underlying  claim  weak  and  therefore  did 

not measure its prejudicial impact under Chapman.  The at-tempted  analogy--between  (1)  eliminating  appellate  review 
altogether and (2) providing appellate review but rejecting a 
constitutional  claim  without  assessing  its  prejudicial  impact under 

Chapman--is a false one. 
Petitioner contends that, even if Brecht adopted a categor-ical rule, postBrecht developments require a different stand-
ard  of  review.  Three  years  after  we  decided  Brecht,  Con-
gress  passed,  and  the  President  signed,  the  Antiterrorism 
and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996  (AEDPA),  under 
which a habeas petition may not be granted unless the state 
court's adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary 
to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-
lished  Federal  law,  as  determined  by  the  Supreme  Court 
of  the  United  States . . . ."   28  U.  S.  C. $  2254(d)(1).  In 
Mitchell  v.  Esparza,  540  U. S.  12  (2003)  (per  curiam),  we 
held that, when a state court determines that a constitutional 
violation  is  harmless,  a  federal  court  may  not  award  ha-
beas  relief  under  $ 2254  unless  the  harmlessness  determi-
nation  itself  was  unreasonable.  Petitioner  contends  that 

$ 2254(d)(1),  as  interpreted  in  Esparza,  eliminates  the  re-
quirement  that  a  petitioner  also  satisfy  Brecht's  standard. 
We think not.  That conclusion is not suggested by Esparza, 
which had no reason to decide the point.  Nor is it suggested 
by  the  text  of  AEDPA,  which  sets  forth  a  precondition  to 
the grant of habeas relief ("a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall  
not  be  granted"  unless  the  conditions  of  $ 2254(d)  are  met), 
not  an  entitlement  to  it.  Given  our  frequent  recognition 
that  AEDPA  limited  rather  than  expanded  the  availability 
of  habeas  relief,  see,  e. g.,  Williams  v.  Taylor,  529  U. S.  362, 
412 (2000), it is implausible that, without saying so, AEDPA 
replaced  the  Brecht  standard  of  " `actual  prejudice,' "  507

120  FRY  v.  PLILER 

Opinion of the Court 
U. S.,  at  637  (quoting  United  States  v.  Lane,  474  U. S.  438, 449  (1986)),  with  the  more  liberal  AEDPA/Chapman  stand-

ard  which  requires  only  that  the  state  court's  harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt  determination  be  unreasonable. 
That  said,  it  certainly  makes  no  sense  to  require  formal  ap-plication of 

both tests (AEDPA/Chapman and Brecht) when the latter obviously subsumes the former.  Accordingly, the 

Ninth  Circuit  was  correct  to  apply  the  Brecht  standard  of review  in  assessing  the  prejudicial  impact  of  federal  consti-
tutional error in a state-court criminal trial.2 

B 
Petitioner  argues  that,  even  if  Brecht  provides  the  stand-ard of review, we  must still reverse the judgment below be-

cause  the  exclusion  of  Maples'  testimony  substantially  and injuriously affected the jury's verdict in this case.  That ar-
gument, however, is not fairly encompassed within the ques-tion  presented.  We  granted  certiorari  to  decide  a  question 
that  has  divided  the  Courts  of  Appeals--whether  Brecht  or 
Chapman provides the appropriate standard of review when constitutional  error  in  a  state-court  trial  is  first  recognized 

by  a  federal  court.  Compare,  e. g.,  Bains  v.  Cambra,  204 F.  3d  964,  976-977  (CA9  2000),  with  Orndorff  v.  Lockhart, 
998  F.  2d  1426,  1429-1430  (CA8  1993).  It  is  true  that  the second  sentence  of  the  question  presented  asks:  "Does  it 
matter  which  harmless  error  standard  is  employed?"  Pet. for  Cert.  I.  But  to  ask  whether 

Brecht  makes  any real  dif-ference  is  not  to  ask  whether  the  Ninth  Circuit  misapplied 

2 We  do  not  agree  with  petitioner's  amicus  that  Brecht's  concerns  re-
garding the finality of state-court criminal judgments and the difficulty of 
retrying  a  defendant  years  after  the  crime  "have  been  largely  alleviated 
by [AEDPA]," which "sets strict time limitations on habeas petitions and 
limits  second  or  successive  petitions  as  well."  Brief  for  Innocence  Net-
work 7.  Even cases governed by AEDPA can span a decade, as the nearly 
12-year gap between petitioner's conviction and the issuance of this deci-
sion illustrates.

Opinion of the Court 
Brecht in this particular case.  Petitioner seems to have un-derstood this.  Only in a brief footnote of his petition did he 

hint  that  the  Ninth  Circuit  erred  in  its  application  of  the Brecht standard.  Pet. for Cert. 23, n. 19.

3  Indeed, if appli-

cation  of  the  Brecht  standard  to  the  facts  of  this  case  were encompassed within the question presented, so too would be 

the question of whether there was constitutional error in the first  place.  After  all,  it  would  not  "matter  which  harmless 
error standard is employed" if there were no underlying con-stitutional  error.  Unlike  the  dissenting  Justices,  some  of 
whom  would  reverse  the  decision  below  on  the  ground  that the error was harmful under 

Brecht, and one of whom would vacate  the  decision  below  on  the  ground  that  it  is  unclear 

whether  there  was  constitutional  error  in  the  first  instance, we  read  the  question  presented  to  avoid  these  tangential 
and  factbound  questions,  and  limit  our  review  to  the  ques-tion  whether 

Chapman  or  Brecht  provides  the  governing standard. 

* * * 
We  hold  that  in  $ 2254  proceedings  a  court  must  assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court 

criminal  trial  under  the  "substantial  and  injurious  effect" standard set forth in 

Brecht, supra, whether or not the state 

3 The question presented  included one  additional issue:  "[I]f the Brecht 
standard applies, does the petitioner or the State bear the burden of per-
suasion  on  the  question  of  prejudice?"  Pet.  for  Cert.  I.  We  have  pre-
viously held that, when a court is "in virtual equipoise as to the harmless-
ness of the error" under the Brecht standard, the court should "treat the 
error . . . as if it  affected  the  verdict  . . . ."   O'Neal  v.  McAninch,  513 
U. S. 432, 435 (1995).  The majority opinion below did not refer to O'Neal, 
presumably because the majority harbored no grave doubt as to the harm-
lessness  of  the  error.  Neither  did  the  dissenting  judge  refer  to  O'Neal, 
presumably because she did not think the majority harbored grave doubt 
as  to  the  harmlessness  of  the  error.  Moreover,  the  State  has  conceded 
throughout this $ 2254 proceeding that  it bears  the burden of  persuasion. 
Thus, there is no basis on which to conclude that the court below ignored 
O'Neal.

graph  (A).  Accepting  the  Government's  interpretation--that  "any 
other  person"  refers  only  to  a  person  not  identified  as  a  PRP  in 

$$ 107(a)(1)-(4)--would destroy the symmetry of subparagraphs (A) and 
(B)  and  render  subparagraph  (B)  internally  confusing.  Moreover,  be-
cause  the  statute  defines  PRPs  so  broadly  as  to  sweep  in  virtually  all 
persons  likely  to  incur  cleanup  costs,  accepting  that  interpretation 
would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering 
subparagraph (B) a dead letter.  Pp. 134-137. 

(b)  Contrary  to  the  Government's  argument,  this  interpretation  will 
not create friction between $$ 107(a) and 113(f).  Their two clearly dis-
tinct  remedies  complement  each  other:  Section  113(f)(1)  authorizes  a 
contribution  action  to  PRPs  with  common  liability  stemming  from  an 
action  instituted  under  $ 106  or  $ 107(a),  while  $ 107(a)  permits  cost  re-
covery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself 
incurred cleanup costs.  Thus, at least in the case  of reimbursement, a 
PRP  cannot  choose  $ 107(a)'s  longer  statute  of  limitations  for  recovery 
actions over $ 113(f)'s  shorter one for contribution claims.  Similarly, a 
PRP  could  not  avoid  $ 113(f)'s  equitable  distribution  of  reimbursement 
costs among PRPs by instead choosing to impose joint and several liabil-
ity  under  $ 107(a).  That  choice  of  remedies  simply  does  not  exist,  and 
in  any  event,  a  defendant  PRP  in  a  $ 107(a)  suit  could  blunt  any  such 
distribution by filing a $ 113(f) counterclaim.  Finally, permitting PRPs 
to seek recovery under $ 107(a) will not eviscerate $ 113(f)(2), which pro-
hibits  $ 113(f)  contribution  claims  against  "[a]  person  who  has  resolved 
its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judi-
cially  approved  settlement . . .  ."   Although  that  settlement  bar  does 
not by its terms protect against $ 107(a) cost-recovery liability, a district 
court applying traditional equity rules would undoubtedly consider any 
prior  settlement  in  the  liability  calculus;  the  settlement  bar  continues 
to  provide  significant  protection  from  contribution  suits  by  PRPs  that 
have inequitably reimbursed costs incurred by another party; and settle-
ment  carries  the  inherent  benefit  of  finally  resolving  liability  as  to  the 
United States or a State.  Pp. 137-141.

ment  of  common  liability.  In  either  case,  a  PRP's  right  to contribution under $ 113(f )(1) is contingent upon an inequita-

ble distribution of common liability among liable parties. By contrast, $ 107(a) permits recovery of cleanup costs but 
does  not  create  a  right  to  contribution.  A  private  party may recover under $ 107(a) without any establishment of lia-
bility to a third party.  Moreover, $ 107(a) permits a PRP to recover only the costs it has "incurred" in cleaning up a site.

sider  any  prior  settlement  as  part  of  the  liability  calculus. Cf.  4  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts  $ 886A(2),  p.  337  (1977) 
("No tortfeasor can be required to make contribution beyond his own equitable share of the liability").  Second, the settle-

the costs incurred by another party.  Third, settlement car-ries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the

Because  the  plain  terms  of  $ 107(a)(4)(B)  allow  a  PRP  to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic 
Research  with  a  cause  of  action.  We  therefore  affirm  the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Opinion of the Court 
The  upshot  is  that  a  highly  regulated  firm  cannot  find  a statutory  basis  for  removal  in  the  fact  of  federal  regulation 

alone.  A  private  firm's  compliance  (or  noncompliance)  with federal  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  does  not  by  itself  fall 
within  the  scope  of  the  statutory  phrase  "acting  under"  a federal  "official."  And  that  is  so  even  if  the  regulation  is 
highly  detailed  and  even  if  the  private  firm's  activities  are highly  supervised  and  monitored.  A  contrary  determina-
tion would expand the  scope of the  statute considerably,  po-tentially  bringing  within  its  scope  state-court  actions  filed 
against  private  firms  in  many  highly  regulated  industries. See,

Opinion of the Court 
The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) then pro-
mulgated  a  set  of  regulations  that  included  two  regulations 
at  issue  here.  The  first,  set  forth  in  a  subpart  of  the  pro-
posed  regulations  entitled  "General  Regulations,"  defines 
the statutory term "domestic service employment" as 

"services  of  a  household  nature  performed  by  an  em-

I 
The  National  Labor  Relations  Act  leaves  States  free  to regulate  their  labor  relationships  with  their  public  employ-

ees.  See 49 Stat. 450, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(2).  The labor  laws  of  many  States  authorize  a  union  and  a  govern-
ment  employer  to  enter  into  what  is  commonly  known  as an  agency-shop  agreement.  This  arrangement  entitles  the 
union to levy a fee on employees who are not union members but who are nevertheless represented by the union in collec-
tive bargaining.  See, e.

Opinion of the Court 
The  Supreme  Court  of  Washington's  description  of  $ 760 notwithstanding,  our  campaign-finance  cases  are  not  on 

point.  For  purposes  of  the  First  Amendment,  it  is  entirely immaterial  that  $ 760  restricts  a  union's  use  of  funds  only 
after  those  funds  are  already  within  the  union's  lawful  pos-session  under  Washington  law.  What  matters  is  that 
public-sector  agency  fees  are  in  the  union's  possession  only because  Washington  and  its  union-contracting  government 
agencies  have  compelled  their  employees  to  pay  those  fees. The  cases  upon  which  respondent  relies  deal  with  govern-
mental  restrictions  on  how  a  regulated  entity  may  spend money  that  has  come  into  its  possession  without  the  assist-
ance  of  governmental  coercion  of  its  employees.  See,  e.

(1980)  (applying  overbreadth  doctrine).5  Instead,  respond-ent  has  consistently  argued  simply  that  $ 760  is  unconstitu-

tional as applied to itself.  The only purpose for which it has noted the statute's applicability to private-sector unions is to 
establish  that  the  statute  was  meant  to  be  a  general  limita-tion  on  electoral  speech,  and  not  just  a  condition  on  state 
agencies'  authorization  of  compulsory  agency  fees.  See 
Brief  for  Respondent  24, 48.  That  limited  contention,  how-ever,  is  both  unconvincing  and  immaterial.  The  purpose  of 

the  voters  of  Washington  was  undoubtedly  the  general  one of  protecting  the  integrity  of  elections  by  limiting  electoral 
spending  in  certain  ways.  But  $ 760,  though  applicable  to all unions, served that purpose through very different means 
depending  on  the  type  of  union  involved:  It  conditioned

situated in the United States are in issue."  $ 1605(a)(4). Reviewing  the  District  Court's  decision  under  the  collat-

The  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  the  text  and  purpose  of  the FSIA's  immovable  property  exception  confirmed  that  peti-

therefore  plain  that  a  suit  to  establish  the  validity  of  a  lien implicates "rights in immovable property." 

B 
Our  reading  of  the  text  is  supported  by  two  well-recognized and related purposes of the FSIA: adoption of the 

restrictive  view  of  sovereign  immunity  and  codification  of international  law  at  the  time  of  the  FSIA's  enactment. 
Until  the  middle  of  the  last  century,  the  United  States  fol-lowed "the classical or virtually absolute theory of sovereign 
immunity,"  under  which  "a  sovereign  cannot,  without  his consent, be made  a  respondent in the  courts  of another  sov-
ereign."  Letter  from  Jack  B.  Tate,  Acting  Legal  Adviser, U. S. Dept. of State, to Acting U. S. Attorney General Phillip

Opinion of the Court 
though filed in reliance upon a District Court's order-- deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction. 

I 
In 1999, an Ohio jury convicted petitioner Keith Bowles of murder for his involvement in the beating death of Ollie Gip-

son.  The  jury  sentenced  Bowles  to  15-years-to-life  impris-onment.  Bowles  unsuccessfully  challenged  his  conviction 
and sentence on direct appeal. Bowles  then  filed  a  federal  habeas  corpus  application  on 
September  5,  2002.  On  September  9,  2003,  the  District Court denied Bowles habeas relief.  After the entry of final 
judgment,  Bowles  had  30  days  to  file  a  notice  of  appeal. Fed.  Rule  App.  Proc.  4(a)(1)(A);  28  U. S. C.  $ 2107(a).  He 
failed  to  do  so.  On  December  12,  2003,  Bowles  moved  to reopen  the  period  during  which  he  could  file  his  notice  of 
appeal  pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6),  which  allows district  courts to  extend  the  filing  period  for  14  days  from  the  day  the 
district  court  grants  the  order  to  reopen,  provided  certain conditions are met.  See $ 2107(c). 

On February  10, 2004, the District Court granted Bowles' motion.  But  rather  than  extending  the  time  period  by  14 
days,  as  Rule  4(a)(6)  and  $ 2107(c)  allow,  the  District  Court inexplicably gave Bowles 17 days--until February 27--to file 
his  notice  of  appeal.  Bowles  filed  his  notice  on  February 26--within the 17 days allowed by the District Court's order, 
but  after  the  14-day  period  allowed  by  Rule  4(a)(6)  and $ 2107(c). 

On  appeal,  respondent Russell argued  that Bowles' notice was untimely and that the Court of Appeals therefore lacked 
jurisdiction to hear the case.  The Court of Appeals agreed. It  first  recognized  that  this  Court  has  consistently  held  the 
requirement of filing a timely notice of appeal is "mandatory and  jurisdictional."  432  F.  3d  668,  673  (CA6  2005)  (citing

"(C)  the  court  finds  that  no  party  would  be  preju-diced."  (Emphasis added.) 

1 

It is undisputed that the District Court's order in this case purported to reopen the filing period for more than 14 days. 
Thus, the question before us is whether the Court of Appeals lacked  jurisdiction  to  entertain  an  appeal  filed  outside  the 
14-day  window  allowed  by  $ 2107(c)  but  within  the  longer period granted by the District Court. 

A 
This  Court  has  long  held  that  the  taking  of  an  appeal within the prescribed time is "mandatory and jurisdictional."

(b)  Nothing  in  $ 1447(c)'s  text  supports  the  claim  that  a  case  cannot 
be remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction within the meaning 
of that provision if the case was properly removed in the first instance. 
Indeed,  statutory  history  conclusively  refutes  the  argument  that 

$ 1447(c)  is  implicitly  limited  in  such  a  manner.  When  a  district  court 
remands a properly removed case because it nonetheless lacks subject-
matter jurisdiction, the remand is covered by $ 1447(c) and shielded from 
review by $ 1447(d).  Pp. 230-232. 

(c)  The District  Court  relied upon  a  ground that is  colorably charac-
terized as subject-matter jurisdiction and so $ 1447(d) bars appellate re-
view.  As  an  initial  matter,  it  is  clear  from  the  record  that  the  court 
was purporting to remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Even 
assuming that $ 1447(d) permits appellate courts to look behind a district 
court's  characterization  of  the  basis  for  the  remand,  such  review  is 
hereby  limited  to  ascertaining  whether  the  characterization  was  color-
able.  In this case, the only plausible explanation of the District Court's 
remand  was  that  it  believed  that  it  lacked  the  power  to  adjudicate  the 
claims  against  petitioner  once  it  had  determined  that  petitioner  was 
not  a  foreign  state  and  that  the  other  cross-defendants  had  sovereign 
immunity.  It is unnecessary to determine whether that belief was cor-
rect;  it  was  at  least  debatable.  Petitioner  contends  instead  that  the 
District Court was actually remanding based on Carnegie-Mellon

Opinion of the Court 

II 
The  authority  of  appellate  courts  to  review  district-court orders  remanding  removed  cases  to  state  court  is  substan-

tially limited by statute.  Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1447(d) provides (with  an  exception  for  certain  civil  rights  cases)  that  "[a]n 
order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise."  Deter-
mining  whether  the  Ninth  Circuit  was  permitted  to  review the District Court's remand is, alas, not as easy as one would 
expect  from  a  mere  reading  of  this  text,  for  we  have  inter-preted  $ 1447(d)  to  cover  less  than  its  words  alone  suggest.

$ 1447(c),  they  make  a  three-step  argument  why  the  provi-

that  the  pre-1988  version  of $ 1447(c)  mandated remand  "[i]f 
at any time before final judgment it appear[ed] that the case 
was  removed  improvidently  and  without  jurisdiction,"  28

Indeed,  the  consequence  to  worry  about  would  not  flow from our conclusion, but from the rule that almost all courts 

have  rejected.  Holding  that  the  passenger  in  a  private  car is  not  (without  more)  seized  in  a  traffic  stop  would  invite 
police  officers  to  stop  cars  with  passengers  regardless  of probable  cause  or  reasonable  suspicion  of  anything  illegal.

The fact that evidence  uncovered as a  result  of an arbitrary traffic  stop  would  still be  admissible against  any  passengers 

would  be  a  powerful  incentive  to  run  the  kind  of  "roving patrols"  that  would  still  violate  the  driver's  Fourth  Amend-
ment  right.  See,  e.

(b)  Several  considerations--the  underwriters'  efforts  jointly  to  pro-
mote and sell newly issued securities is central to the proper functioning 
of well-regulated capital markets; the law grants the Securities and Ex-
change  Commission  (SEC)  authority  to  supervise  such  activities;  and 
the SEC  has continuously  exercised  its legal  authority  to regulate this 
type of  conduct--show that  the  first, second,  and fourth  conditions are 
satisfied in this case.  This leaves the third condition: whether there is 
a conflict rising to the level of incompatibility.  Pp. 276-277. 

(c)  The complaints here can be read as attacking the manner in which 
the underwriters jointly seek to collect "excessive" commissions 
through the practices of laddering, tying, and collecting excessive com-
missions,  which  according  to  respondents  the  SEC  itself  has  already 
disapproved  and,  in  all  likelihood,  will  not  approve  in  the  foreseeable 
future.  Nonetheless, certain considerations, taken together, lead to the 
conclusion that securities law and antitrust law are clearly incompatible 
in this context.  Pp. 278-285. 

(1)  First, to permit antitrust actions such as this threatens serious 
securities-related  harm.  For  one  thing,  a  fine,  complex,  detailed  line 
separates  activity  that  the  SEC  permits  or  encourages  from  activity 
that  it  forbids.  And  the  SEC  has  the  expertise  to  distinguish  what 
is  forbidden  from  what  is  allowed.  For  another  thing,  reasonable  but 
contradictory inferences may be drawn from overlapping evidence that 
shows  both  unlawful  antitrust  activity  and  lawful  securities  marketing 
activity.  Further,  there  is  a  serious  risk  that  antitrust  courts,  with 
different nonexpert judges and different nonexpert juries, will produce 
inconsistent results.  Together these factors mean there is no practical 
way  to  confine  antitrust  suits  so  that  they  challenge  only  the  kind  of 
activity  the  investors  seek  to  target,  which  is  presently  unlawful  and 
will likely remain unlawful under the securities law.  Rather, these con-
siderations  suggest  that  antitrust  courts  are  likely  to  make  unusually 
serious  mistakes  in  this  respect.  And  that  threat  means  that  under-
writers  must  act  to  avoid  not  simply  conduct  that  the  securities  law 
forbids, but also joint conduct that the securities law permits or encour-
ages.  Thus, allowing an antitrust lawsuit would threaten serious harm 
to the efficient functioning of the securities market.  Pp. 279-283. 

(2)  Second,  any  enforcement-related  need  for  an  antitrust  lawsuit 
is unusually small.  For one thing, the SEC actively enforces the rules 
and regulations that forbid the conduct in question.  For another, inves-
tors  harmed  by  underwriters'  unlawful  practices  may  sue  and  obtain 
damages  under  the  securities  law.  Finally,  the  fact  that  the  SEC  is 
itself required to take account of competitive considerations when it cre-
ates  securities-related  policy  and  embodies  it  in  rules  and  regulations

Syllabus 
makes it somewhat less necessary to rely on antitrust actions to address 
anticompetitive behavior.  Pp. 283-284. 

(3)  In sum, an antitrust action  in this context is accompanied by a 
substantial risk of injury to the securities markets and by a diminished 
need for antitrust enforcement to address anticompetitive conduct.  To-
gether  these considerations indicate a  serious conflict  between applica-
tion of the antitrust laws and proper enforcement of the securities law. 
The Solicitor General's  proposal  to avoid this  conflict does  not convinc-
ingly address these concerns.  Pp. 284-285.

The underwriting  practices  at issue take  place during the 
course  of  an  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  of  shares  in  a  com-
pany.  An IPO presents an opportunity to raise capital for a 
new enterprise by selling shares to the investing public.  A 
group of underwriters will typically form a syndicate to help 
market the shares.  The syndicate will investigate and esti-
mate likely market demand  for  the shares  at various  prices. 
It  will  then  recommend  to  the  firm  a  price  and  the  number 
of  shares  it  believes  the  firm  should  offer.  Ultimately,  the 
syndicate  will  promise  to  buy  from  the  firm  all  the  newly 
issued  shares  on  a  specified  date  at  a  fixed,  agreed-upon 
price,  which  price  the  syndicate  will  then  charge  investors 
when  it  resells  the  shares.  When  the  syndicate  buys  the 
shares  from  the  issuing  firm,  however,  the  firm  gives  the 
syndicate a price  discount, which  amounts to the  syndicate's 
commission.  See  generally  L.  Loss  &  J.  Seligman,  Funda-
mentals of Securities Regulation 66-72 (4th ed. 2001). 

At  the  heart  of the  syndicate's  IPO  marketing  activity  lie 
its efforts to determine suitable initial share prices and quan-
tities.  At first, the  syndicate  makes a preliminary  estimate 
that  it  submits  in  a  registration  statement  to  the  Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC).  It then conducts a "road 
show" during which syndicate underwriters and representa-
tives of the offering firm meet potential investors and engage 
in a process that the industry calls "bookbuilding."  During 
this time, the underwriters and firm representatives present 
information  to  investors  about  the  company  and  the  stock. 
And  they  attempt  to  gauge  the  strength  of  the  investors' 
interest  in  purchasing  the  stock.  For  this  purpose,  under-

Opinion of the Court 
writers  might  well  ask  the  investors  how  their  interest would  vary  depending  upon  price  and  the  number  of  shares 

that  are  offered.  They  will  learn,  among  other  things, which  investors  might  buy  shares,  in  what  quantities,  at 
what prices, and for how long each is likely to hold purchased shares before selling them to others. 

On  the  basis  of  this  kind  of  information,  the  members  of the  underwriting  syndicate  work  out  final  arrangements 
with the issuing firm, fixing the price per share and specify-ing the number of shares for which the underwriters will be 
jointly  responsible.  As  we  have  said,  after  buying  the shares at a discounted price, the syndicate resells the shares 
to  investors  at  the  fixed  price,  in  effect  earning  its  commis-sion in the process.

In January 2002, respondents, a group of 60 investors, filed two  antitrust  class-action  lawsuits  against  petitioners,  10 

leading  investment  banks.  They  sought  relief  under  $ 1  of the  Sherman  Act,  ch.  647,  26  Stat.  209,  as  amended,  15 
U. S. C. $ 1; $ 2(c) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by  the  Robinson-Patman  Act,  49  Stat.  1527,  15  U. S. C. 

$ 13(c); and state antitrust laws.  App. 1, 14.  The investors stated  that  between  March  1997  and  December  2000  the 
banks  had  acted  as  underwriters,  forming  syndicates  that helped  execute  the  IPOs  of  several  hundred  technology-
related companies.  Id., at 22.  Respondents' antitrust com-plaints allege that the underwriters "abused the . . . practice 
of  combining  into  underwriting  syndicates"  by  agreeing among themselves to impose harmful conditions upon poten-
tial investors--conditions that the investors apparently were willing  to  accept  in  order  to  obtain  an  allocation  of  new 
shares that were in high demand.  Id., at 12. These conditions, according to respondents, consist of a re-
quirement that the investors pay "additional anticompetitive charges"  over  and  above  the  agreed-upon  IPO  share  price 
plus  underwriting  commission.  In  particular,  these  addi-

Opinion of the Court 
tional  charges  took  the  form  of  (1)  investor  promises  "to place  bids  .  .  .  in  the  aftermarket  at  prices  above  the  IPO 

price"  (i. e.,  "laddering"  agreements);  (2)  investor  "commit-ments  to  purchase  other,  less  attractive  securities"  (i. e., 
"tying"  arrangements);  and  (3)  investor  payment  of  "non-competitively  determined"  (

i. e.,  excessive)  "commissions," including the "purchas[e] of an issuer's shares in follow-up or 

`secondary'  public  offerings  (for  which  the  underwriters would  earn  underwriting  discounts)."  Id.,  at  12-13.  The 
complaint added that the underwriters' agreement to engage in some or all of these practices artificially inflated the share 
prices of the securities in question.  Id., at 32. The  underwriters  moved  to  dismiss  the  investors'  com-
plaints  on  the  ground  that  federal  securities  law  impliedly precludes  application  of  antitrust  laws  to  the  conduct  in 
question.  (The  antitrust  laws  at  issue  include  the  commer-cial  bribery  provisions  of  the  Robinson-Patman  Act.)  The 
District  Court  agreed  with  petitioners  and  dismissed  the complaints against them.  See 

In re Initial Public Offering Antitrust  Litigation,  287  F.  Supp.  2d  497,  524-525  (SDNY 

2003)  (IPO  Antitrust).  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sec-ond  Circuit  reversed,  however,  and  reinstated  the  com-
plaints.  426 F. 3d 130, 170, 172 (2005).  We granted the un-derwriters' petition for certiorari.  And we now reverse the 
judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Sometimes  regulatory  statutes  explicitly  state  whether they  preclude  application  of  the  antitrust  laws.  Compare, 

e. g.,  Webb-Pomerene  Act, 15  U. S. C. $ 62  (expressly  provid-ing antitrust immunity), with $ 601(b)(1) of the Telecommuni-
cations  Act  of  1996,  47  U. S. C.  $ 152  (stating  that  antitrust laws remain applicable).  See also

Opinion of the Court 
Telecommunications  Act).  Where  regulatory  statutes  are silent  in  respect  to  antitrust,  however,  courts  must  deter-

mine whether, and in what respects, they implicitly preclude application of the antitrust laws.  Those determinations may 
vary  from  statute  to  statute,  depending  upon  the  relation between  the  antitrust  laws  and  the  regulatory  program  set 
forth in the particular statute, and the relation of the specific 
conduct at issue to both sets of laws.  Compare Gordon, 422 U. S.,  at  689  (finding  implied  preclusion  of  antitrust  laws); 

and  NASD,  422  U. S.,  at  729-730  (same),  with  Otter  Tail 
Power  Co.  v.  United  States,  410  U. S.  366,  374-375  (1973) 
(finding no  implied  immunity);  Philadelphia  Nat. Bank,  374 

U. S., at 352 (same); and Silver, 373 U. S., at 360 (same).  See 
also  Phonetele,  Inc.  v.  American  Tel.  &  Tel.  Co.,  664  F.  2d 
716, 727 (CA9 1981). 

Three  decisions  from  this  Court  specifically  address  the 
relation  of  securities  law  to  antitrust  law.  In  Silver  the 
Court considered a dealer's claim that, by expelling him from 
the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  the  exchange  had  violated 
the  antitrust  prohibition  against  group  "boycott[s]."  373 
U. S.,  at  347.  The  Court  wrote  that,  where  possible,  courts 
should  "reconcil[e]  the  operation  of  both  [i. e.,  antitrust  and 
securities]  statutory  schemes  .  .  .  rather  than  holding  one 
completely  ousted."  Id.,  at  357.  It  also  set  forth  a  stand-
ard, namely, that "[r]epeal [of the  antitrust  laws] is  to be re-
garded  as  implied  only  if  necessary  to  make  the  Securities 
Exchange Act work, and even then only to the minimum ex-
tent  necessary."  Ibid.  And  it  held  that  the  securities  law 
did  not  preclude  application  of  the  antitrust  laws  to  the 
claimed boycott  insofar as the exchange  denied the expelled 
dealer a right to fair procedures.  Id., at 359-360. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the SEC 
lacked  jurisdiction  under  the  securities  law  "to  review  par-
ticular  instances  of  enforcement  of  exchange  rules";  that 
"nothing  [was]  built  into  the  regulatory  scheme  which  per-
forms  the  antitrust  function  of  insuring"  that  rules  that  in-

Opinion of the Court 
jure competition are nonetheless "justified as furthering" le-gitimate regulatory "ends"; that the expulsion "would 

clearly"  violate  "the  Sherman  Act  unless  justified  by  refer-ence  to  the  purposes  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act";  and 
that  it  could  find  no  such  justifying  purpose  where  the  ex-change  took  "anticompetitive  collective  action . . .  

without 
according  fair  procedures."  Id.,  at  357-358,  364  (emphasis 
added). In 

Gordon  the  Court  considered  an  antitrust  complaint 
that  essentially  alleged  "price  fixing"  among  stockbrokers. It  charged  that  members  of  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange 

had agreed to fix their commissions on sales under $500,000. 
And  it  sought  damages  and  an  injunction  forbidding  future 
agreements.  422  U. S.,  at  661,  and  n.  3.  The  lawsuit  was 
filed at a time when regulatory attitudes toward fixed stock-
broker commissions  were changing.  The fixed commissions 
challenged  in  the  complaint  were  applied  during  a  period 
when  the  SEC  approved  of  the  practice  of  fixing  broker-
commission rates.  But Congress and the SEC had both sub-
sequently  disapproved  for  the  future  the  fixing  of  some  of 
those rates.  See id., at 690-691. 

In deciding whether antitrust liability could lie, the Court 
repeated  Silver's  general  standard  in  somewhat  different 
terms:  It  said  that  an  "implied  repeal"  of  the  antitrust  laws 
would be found only "where there is a `plain repugnancy be-
tween  the  antitrust  and regulatory  provisions.' "  422  U. S., 
at 682 (quoting Philadelphia Nat. Bank, supra, at 350-351). 
It then held that the  securities laws impliedly precluded ap-
plication  of  the  antitrust  laws  in  the  case  at  hand.  The 
Court  rested  this  conclusion on  three  sets  of considerations. 
For one thing, the securities law "gave the SEC direct regu-
latory power over exchange rules and practices with respect 
to  the  fixing  of  reasonable  rates  of  commission."  422  U. S., 
at 685 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For another, the 
SEC  had  "taken  an  active  role  in  review  of  proposed  rate 
changes during  the last 15 years,"  and had engaged in "con-

Opinion of the Court 
tinuing  activity"  in  respect  to  the  regulation  of  commission rates. 

Ibid.  Finally,  without  antitrust  immunity,  "the  ex-
changes and their members" would be subject to "conflicting standards." 

Id., at 689. 
This last consideration--the conflict--was complicated due to Congress', and the agency's, changing views about the va-

lidity of fixed commissions.  As far as the past fixing of rates 
was concerned, the  conflict  was clear: The  antitrust  law had forbidden  the  very  thing  that  the  securities  law  had  then 

permitted,  namely,  an  anticompetitive  ratesetting  process. In respect to the future, however, the conflict was less appar-
ent.  That  was  because  the  SEC's  new  (congressionally  au-
thorized) prohibition of (certain) fixed rates would take effect 
in  the  near-term  future.  And  after  that  time  the  SEC  and 
the  antitrust  law  would  both  likely  prohibit  some  of  the 
ratefixing  to  which  the  plaintiff 's  injunction  would  likely 
apply.  See id., at 690-691. 

Despite  the  likely  compatibility  of  the  laws  in  the  future, 
the Court nonetheless expressly found conflict.  The conflict 
arose from the fact that the law permitted the SEC to super-
vise  the  competitive  setting  of  rates  and  to  "reintroduc[e] 
.  .  .  fixed  rates,"  id.,  at  691  (emphasis  added),  under  certain 
conditions.  The  Court  consequently  wrote  that  "failure  to 
imply repeal would render nugatory the legislative provision 
for  regulatory  agency  supervision  of  exchange  commission 
rates."  Ibid.  The upshot is that, in light of potential future 
conflict,  the  Court  found  that  the  securities  law  precluded 
antitrust liability even in respect to a practice that both anti-
trust law and securities law might forbid. 

In  NASD  the  Court  considered  a  Department  of  Justice 
antitrust complaint claiming that mutual fund companies had 
agreed  with  securities  broker-dealers  (1)  to  fix  "resale" 
prices,  i. e.,  the  prices  at  which  a  broker-dealer  would  sell  a 
mutual  fund's  shares  to  an  investor  or  buy  mutual  fund 
shares  from  a  fund  investor  (who  wished  to  redeem  the 
shares); (2) to fix other terms of sale including those related

Opinion of the Court 
to  when,  how,  to  whom,  and  from  whom  the  broker-dealers 
might  sell  and  buy  mutual  fund  shares;  and  (3)  to  prohibit 
broker-dealers  from  freely  selling  to,  and  buying  shares 
from, one another.  See 422 U. S., at 700-703. 

The Court again found "clear repugnancy," and it held that 
the  securities  law,  by  implication,  precluded  all  parts  of  the 
antitrust  claim.  Id.,  at  719.  In  reaching  this  conclusion, 
the  Court  found  that  antitrust  law  (e. g.,  forbidding  resale 
price maintenance) and securities law (e. g., permitting resale 
price  maintenance)  were  in  conflict.  In  deciding  that  the 
latter  trumped  the  former,  the  Court  relied  upon  the  same 
kinds  of  considerations  it  found  determinative  in  Gordon. 
In  respect  to  the  last  set  of  allegations  (restricting  a  free 
market in mutual fund shares among brokers), the Court said 
that  (1)  the  relevant  securities  law  "enables  [the  SEC]  to 
monitor  the  activities  questioned";  (2)  "the  history  of  Com-
mission regulations suggests no laxity in the exercise of this 
authority";  and  hence  (3)  allowing  an  antitrust  suit  to  pro-
ceed that is "so directly related to the SEC's responsibilities" 
would present "a substantial danger that [broker-dealers and 
other  defendants]  would  be  subjected  to  duplicative  and  in-
consistent standards."  NASD, 422 U. S., at 734-735. 

As to the other practices alleged in the complaint (concern-
ing,  e. g.,  resale  price  maintenance),  the  Court  emphasized 
that (1) the securities law "vested in the SEC final authority 
to determine whether and to what extent" the relevant prac-
tices "should be tolerated," id., at 729; (2) although the SEC 
has  not  actively  supervised  the  relevant  practices,  that  is 
only  because  the  statute  "reflects  a  clear  congressional  de-
termination  that,  subject  to  Commission  oversight,  mutual 
funds  should  be  allowed  to  retain  the  initiative  in  dealing 
with  the  potentially  adverse  effects  of  disruptive  trading 
practices,"  id.,  at  727;  and  (3)  the  SEC  has  supervised  the 
funds insofar as its "acceptance of fund-initiated restrictions 
for  more  than  three  decades  .  .  .  manifests  an  informed  ad-

were  appropriate  means  for  combating  the  problems  of  the 
industry,"  id.,  at  728.  The  Court  added  that,  in  these  re-
spects, the SEC had engaged in "precisely the kind of admin-
istrative  oversight  of  private  practices  that  Congress  con-
templated."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
duties,  privileges,  or  standards  of  conduct.  We  also  note (4)  that  in  Gordon  and  NASD  the  possible  conflict  affected 

practices that lie squarely within an area of financial market activity that the securities law seeks to regulate. 

B 
These principles, applied to the complaints before us, con-siderably  narrow  our  legal  task.  For  the  parties  cannot 

reasonably  dispute  the  existence  here  of  several  of  the  con-ditions  that  this  Court  previously  regarded  as  crucial  to 
finding that the securities law impliedly precludes the appli-cation of the antitrust laws. 

First,  the  activities  in  question  here--the  underwriters' efforts  jointly  to  promote  and  to  sell  newly  issued  securi-
ties--is  central  to  the  proper  functioning  of  well-regulated capital  markets.  The  IPO  process  supports  new  firms  that 
seek  to  raise  capital;  it  helps  to  spread  ownership  of  those firms  broadly  among  investors;  it  directs  capital  flows  in 
ways that better correspond to the public's demand for goods and  services.  Moreover,  financial  experts,  including  the 
securities  regulators,  consider  the  general  kind  of  joint  un-derwriting activity at issue in this case, including road shows 
and  bookbuilding  efforts  essential  to  the  successful  market-ing of an IPO.  See Memorandum Amicus Curiae of SEC in 
IPO  Antitrust,  Case  No.  01  CIV  2014  (WHP)  (SDNY), pp. 15, 39-40, App. D to Pet. for Cert. 124a, 138a, 155a-157a 
(hereinafter Brief for SEC).  Thus, the antitrust complaints before  us  concern  practices  that  lie  at  the  very  heart  of  the 
securities marketing enterprise. Second, the law grants the SEC authority to supervise all 
of  the  activities  here  in  question.  Indeed,  the  SEC  pos-sesses  considerable  power  to  forbid,  permit,  encourage,  dis-
courage,  tolerate,  limit,  and  otherwise  regulate  virtually every  aspect of the  practices  in  which underwriters  engage. 
See,  e. g.,  15  U. S. C.  $$ 77b(a)(3),  77j,  77z-2  (granting  SEC power  to  regulate  the  process  of  bookbuilding,  solicitations

of "indications of interest," and communications between un-
derwriting participants and their customers, including those 
that  occur  during  road  shows);  $ 78o(c)(2)(D)  (granting  SEC 
power  to  define  and  prevent  through  rules  and  regulations 
acts and practices that are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipu-
lative);  $ 78i(a)(6)  (similar);  $ 78j(b)  (similar).  Private  indi-
viduals who suffer harm as a result of a violation of pertinent 
statutes  and  regulations  may  also  recover  damages.  See 

$$ 78bb, 78u-4, 77k. 

Third, the SEC has continuously exercised its legal author-
ity to regulate conduct of the general kind now at issue.  It 
has  defined  in  detail,  for  example,  what  underwriters  may 
and may not do and say during their road shows.  Compare, 
e. g.,  Guidance  Regarding  Prohibited  Conduct  in  Connection 
with IPO Allocations, 70 Fed. Reg. 19672 (2005), with Regu-
lation M, 17 CFR $$ 242.100-242.105 (2006).  It has brought 
actions  against  underwriters  who  have  violated  these  SEC 
regulations.  See  Brief  for  SEC  13-14,  App.  D  to  Pet.  for 
Cert.  136a-138a.  And  private  litigants,  too,  have  brought 
securities  actions  complaining  of  conduct  virtually  identical 
to  the  conduct  at  issue  here;  and  they  have  obtained  dam-
ages.  See, e. g., In re Initial Pub. Offering Securities Liti-
gation, 241 F. Supp. 2d 281 (SDNY 2003). 

The preceding considerations show that the first condition 
(legal  regulatory  authority),  the  second  condition  (exercise 
of that authority), and the fourth condition (heartland securi-
ties  activity)  that  were  present  in  Gordon  and  NASD  are 
satisfied in this case as well.  Unlike Silver, there is here no 
question of the existence of appropriate regulatory authority, 
nor  is  there  doubt  as  to  whether  the  regulators  have  exer-
cised  that  authority.  Rather,  the  question  before  us  con-
cerns the third condition: Is there a conflict that rises to the 
level  of  incompatibility?  Is  an  antitrust  suit  such  as  this 
likely  to  prove  practically  incompatible  with  the  SEC's  ad-
ministration of the Nation's securities laws?

Opinion of the Court 

III 

A 
Given the SEC's comprehensive authority to regulate IPO underwriting  syndicates,  its  active  and  ongoing  exercise  of 

that authority, and the undisputed need for joint IPO under-writer  activity,  we  do  not  read  the  complaints  as  attacking 
the bare existence of IPO underwriting syndicates or any of the joint activity that the SEC considers a necessary compo-
nent  of  IPO-related  syndicate  activity.  See  Brief  for  SEC 15, 39-40, App. D to Pet. for Cert. 138a, 155a-157a.  See also 
IPO Antitrust, 287 F. Supp. 2d, at 507 (discussing the history of  syndicate  marketing  of  IPOs);  App.  12  (complaint  attacks 
underwriters  "abus[e]"  of  "the  preexisting  practice  of  com-bining  into  underwriting  syndicates"  (emphasis  added)); 
H. R. Rep. No. 1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.,  6-7 (1934); S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1934) (law must give to secu-
rities agencies freedom to regulate agreements among syndi-cate  members).  Nor  do  we  understand  the  complaints  as 
questioning underwriter agreements to fix the levels of their commissions,  whether  or  not  the  resulting  price  is  "exces-
sive."  See Gordon, 422 U. S., at 688-689 (securities law con-flicts  with,  and  therefore  precludes,  antitrust  attack  on  the 
fixing of  commissions  where the  SEC  has  not  approved, but later might approve, the practice). 

We  nonetheless  can  read  the  complaints  as  attacking  the manner in which the underwriters jointly seek to collect "ex-
cessive"  commissions.  The  complaints  attack  underwriter efforts to collect commissions through certain practices (i. e., 
laddering,  tying,  collecting  excessive  commissions  in  the form  of  later  sales  of  the  issued  shares),  which  according  to 
respondents  the  SEC  itself  has  already  disapproved  and,  in all likelihood, will not approve in the foreseeable future.  In 
respect  to  this  set  of  claims,  they  contend  that  there  is  no possible "conflict" since both securities law and antitrust law 
aim  to  prohibit  the  same  undesirable  activity.  Without  a

Opinion of the Court 
conflict, they add, there is no "repugnance" or "incompatibil-ity,"  and  this  Court  may  not  imply  that  securities  law  pre-

cludes an antitrust suit.  B 

We  accept  the  premises  of  respondents'  argument--that the  SEC  has  full  regulatory  authority  over  these  practices, 
that  it  has  actively  exercised  that  authority,  but  that  the SEC  has  disapproved  (and,  for  argument's  sake,  we  assume 
that it will continue to disapprove) the conduct that the anti-trust  complaints  attack.  Nonetheless,  we  cannot  accept  re-
spondents' conclusion.  Rather, several considerations taken together  lead  us  to  find  that,  even  on  these  prorespondent 
assumptions,  securities  law  and  antitrust  law  are  clearly incompatible. 

First,  to  permit  antitrust  actions  such  as  the  present  one 
still  threatens  serious  securities-related  harm.  For  one thing,  an  unusually  serious  legal  line-drawing  problem  re-

mains  unabated.  In  the  present  context  only  a  fine,  com-plex,  detailed  line  separates  activity  that  the  SEC  permits 
or encourages (for which respondents must concede antitrust immunity)  from  activity  that  the  SEC  must  (and  inevitably 
will)  forbid  (and  which,  on  respondents'  theory,  should  be open to antitrust attack). 

For example, in respect to "laddering" the SEC forbids an underwriter  to  "[s]olici[t]  customers  prior  to  the  completion 
of the distribution regarding whether and at what price and 
in what quantity they intend to place immediate aftermarket orders  for  IPO  stock,"  70  Fed.  Reg.  19675-19676  (emphasis 

deleted); 17  CFR $$ 242.100-242.105.  But  at the  same time the  SEC  permits,  indeed  encourages,  underwriters  (as  part 
of the "bookbuilding" process) to "inquir[e] as to a customer's desired future position in the longer term (for example, three 
to six months), and the price or prices at which the customer 
might accumulate that position without reference to immedi-ate aftermarket activity."  70 Fed. Reg. 19676.

Opinion of the Court 
It  will  often  be  difficult  for  someone  who  is  not  familiar with  accepted  syndicate  practices  to  determine  with  confi-

dence  whether  an  underwriter  has  insisted  that  an  investor buy  more  shares  in  the  immediate  aftermarket  (forbidden), 
or  has  simply  allocated  more  shares  to  an  investor  willing to  purchase  additional  shares  of  that  issue  in  the  long  run 
(permitted).  And  who  but  a  securities  expert  could  say 
whether the  present SEC  rules  set forth a  virtually perma-nent  line,  unlikely  to  change  in  ways  that  would  permit  the 

sorts of "laddering-like" conduct that it now seems to forbid? Cf. 

Gordon, supra, at 690-691. 
Similarly, in respect to "tying" and other efforts to obtain 
an  increased  commission  from  future  sales,  the  SEC  has 
sought  to  prohibit  an  underwriter  "from  demanding  .  .  .  an 
offer from  [its] customers of any payment or other consider-
ation [such as the purchase of a different security] in addition 
to  the  security's  stated  consideration."  69  Fed.  Reg.  75785 
(2004).  But the SEC would permit a firm to "allocat[e] IPO 
shares  to  a  customer  because  the  customer  has  separately 
retained  the  firm  for  other  services,  when  the  customer  has 
not  paid  excessive  compensation  in  relation  to  those  serv-
ices."  Ibid., and n. 108.  The National Association of Secu-
rities Dealers (NASD), over which the SEC exercises super-
visory authority, has also proposed a rule that would prohibit 
a member underwriter from "offering or threatening to with-
hold"  IPO  shares  "as  consideration  or  inducement  for  the 
receipt  of  compensation  that  is  excessive  in  relation  to  the 
services provided."  Id., at 77810.  The NASD would allow, 
however, a customer legitimately to compete for IPO shares 
by increasing the level and quantity of compensation it pays 
to  the  underwriter.  See  ibid.  (describing  NASD  Proposed 
Rule 2712(a)). 

Under  these  standards,  to  distinguish  what  is  forbidden 
from what is allowed requires an understanding of just when, 
in relation to services provided, a commission is "excessive," 
indeed,  so  "excessive"  that  it  will  remain  permanently  for-

Opinion of the Court 
bidden, see Gordon, 422 U. S., at 690-691.  And who but the SEC itself could do so with confidence? 

For another thing, evidence tending to show unlawful anti-trust activity and evidence tending to show lawful securities 
marketing  activity  may  overlap,  or  prove  identical.  Con-sider,  for  instance,  a  conversation  between  an  underwriter 
and  an  investor  about  how  long  an  investor  intends  to  hold 
the  new  shares  (and  at  what price),  say,  a  conversation  that elicits  comments  concerning  both  the  investor's  short  and 

longer term plans.  That exchange might, as a plaintiff sees it, provide evidence of an underwriter's insistence upon "lad-
dering"  or,  as  a  defendant  sees  it,  provide  evidence  of  a 

lawful  effort  to  allocate  shares  to  those  who  will  hold  them 
for  a  longer  time.  See  Brief  for  United  States  as  Amicus 
Curiae 27. 

Similarly, the same somewhat ambiguous conversation 
might help to establish an effort to collect an unlawfully high 
commission  through  atypically  high  commissions  on  later 
sales or through the sales of less popular stocks.  Or it might 
prove  only  that  the  underwriter  allocates  more  popular 
shares  to  investors  who  will  help  stabilize  the  aftermarket 
share  price.  See,  e. g.,  Department  of  Enforcement  v.  Re-
spondent,  Disciplinary  Proc.  No.  CAF030014  (NASD  Hear-
ing Panel, Mar. 3, 2006), pp. 12-13 (redacted decision), called 
for review, Complaint No. CAF030014 (NASD Nat. Adjudica-
tory Council, Apr. 11, 2006). 

Further,  antitrust  plaintiffs  may  bring  lawsuits  through-
out  the  Nation  in  dozens  of  different  courts  with  different 
nonexpert  judges  and  different  nonexpert  juries.  In  light 
of  the  nuanced  nature  of  the  evidentiary  evaluations  neces-
sary  to  separate  the  permissible  from  the  impermissible,  it 
will  prove  difficult  for  those  many  different  courts  to  reach 
consistent  results.  And,  given  the  fact-related  nature  of 
many  such  evaluations,  it  will  also  prove  difficult  to  ensure 
that  the  different  courts  evaluate  similar  fact  patterns  con-
sistently.  The result is an unusually high risk that different

Opinion of the Court 
courts will evaluate similar factual circumstances differently. See Hovenkamp, Antitrust Violations in  Securities Markets, 

28 J. Corp. L. 607, 629 (2003) ("Once regulation of an industry is entrusted to jury trials, the outcomes of antitrust proceed-
ings will be inconsistent with one another . . . ").  Now  consider  these  factors  together--the  fine  securities-
related lines separating the permissible from the impermissi-
ble; the need for securities-related expertise (particularly to determine  whether  an  SEC  rule  is  likely  permanent);  the 

overlapping  evidence  from  which  reasonable  but  contradic-tory  inferences  may  be  drawn;  and  the  risk  of  inconsistent 
court results.  Together these factors mean there is no prac-
tical  way  to  confine  antitrust  suits  so  that  they  challenge 
only activity of the kind the investors seek to target, activity 
that  is  presently  unlawful  and  will  likely  remain  unlawful 
under the securities law.  Rather, these factors suggest that 
antitrust  courts  are  likely  to  make  unusually  serious  mis-
takes in this respect.  And the threat of antitrust mistakes, 
i. e., results that stray outside the narrow bounds that plain-
tiffs  seek  to  set,  means  that  underwriters  must  act  in  ways 
that  will  avoid  not  simply  conduct  that  the  securities  law 
forbids  (and  will  likely  continue  to  forbid),  but  also  a  wide 
range of joint conduct that the securities law permits or en-
courages (but which they fear could lead to an antitrust law-
suit  and  the  risk  of  treble  damages).  And  therein  lies  the 
problem. 

This  kind  of  problem  exists  to  some  degree  in  respect  to 
other antitrust lawsuits.  But here the factors we have men-
tioned  make  mistakes  unusually  likely  (a  matter  relevant  to 
Congress' determination of which institution should regulate 
a particular set of market activities).  And the role that joint 
conduct plays in respect to the marketing of IPOs, along with 
the  important  role  IPOs  themselves  play  in  relation  to  the 
effective  functioning  of  capital  markets,  means  that  the 
securities-related  costs  of  mistakes  is  unusually  high.  It  is 
no  wonder,  then,  that  the  SEC  told  the  District  Court  (con-

sistent with what the Government tells us here) that a "fail-ure  to  hold  that  the  alleged  conduct  was  immunized  would 

threaten to disrupt the full range of the Commission's ability to  exercise  its  regulatory  authority,"  adding  that  it  would 
have  a  "chilling effect" on  "lawful  joint activities  . .  . of  tre-mendous importance  to the economy of the country."  Brief 
for SEC 39-40, App. D to Pet. for Cert. 157a. We  believe  it  fair  to  conclude  that,  where  conduct  at  the 
core  of  the  marketing  of  new  securities  is  at  issue;  where 
securities  regulators  proceed  with  great  care  to  distinguish the  encouraged  and  permissible  from  the  forbidden;  where 

the  threat  of  antitrust  lawsuits,  through  error  and  disin-
centive,  could  seriously  alter  underwriter  conduct  in  unde-
sirable  ways,  to  allow  an  antitrust  lawsuit  would  threaten 
serious  harm  to  the  efficient  functioning  of  the  securities 
markets. 

Second, any enforcement-related need for an antitrust law-
suit is unusually small.  For one thing, the SEC actively en-
forces  the  rules  and  regulations  that  forbid  the  conduct  in 
question.  For  another,  as  we  have  said,  investors  harmed 
by  underwriters'  unlawful  practices  may  bring  lawsuits  and 
obtain damages under the securities law.  See supra, at 276- 
277.  Finally,  the  SEC  is  itself  required  to  take  account  of 
competitive considerations when it creates securities-related 
policy  and  embodies  it  in  rules  and  regulations.  And  that 
fact makes it somewhat less necessary to rely upon antitrust 
actions to address anticompetitive behavior.  See 15 U. S. C. 

$ 77b(b) (instructing the SEC to consider, "in addition to the 
protection of investors, whether the action will promote effi-
ciency,  competition,  and  capital  formation");  $ 78w(a)(2)  (the 
SEC  "shall  consider  among  other  matters  the  impact  any 
such rule or regulation would have on competition"); Trinko, 
540 U. S., at 412 ("[T]he additional benefit to competition pro-
vided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small" where 
other laws and regulatory structures are "designed to deter 
and remedy anticompetitive harm").

Opinion of the Court 
We  also  note  that  Congress,  in  an  effort  to  weed  out  un-meritorious  securities  lawsuits,  has  recently  tightened  the 

procedural  requirements  that  plaintiffs  must  satisfy  when they  file  those  suits.  To  permit  an  antitrust  lawsuit  risks 
circumventing these requirements by permitting plaintiffs to dress  what  is  essentially  a  securities  complaint  in  antitrust 
clothing.  See  generally  Private  Securities  Litigation  Re-
form Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737; Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227. 

In  sum,  an  antitrust  action in  this  context  is  accompanied by a  substantial risk of injury to the  securities  markets and 
by  a  diminished  need  for  antitrust  enforcement  to  address 
anticompetitive  conduct.  Together  these  considerations  in-
dicate a serious conflict between, on the one hand, application 
of  the  antitrust  laws  and,  on  the  other,  proper  enforcement 
of the securities law. 

We are aware that the Solicitor General, while recognizing 
the  conflict,  suggests  a  procedural  device  that  he  believes 
will  avoid  it  (in  effect,  a  compromise  between  the  differing 
positions that the SEC and Antitrust Division of the Depart-
ment  of  Justice  took  in  the  courts  below).  Compare  Brief 
for Dept. of Justice, Antitrust Division, as Amicus Curiae in 
Case  No.  01  CIV  2014,  p.  23  (seeking  no  preclusion  of  the 
antitrust  laws),  with  Brief  for  SEC  39-40,  App.  D  to  Pet. 
for Cert. 155a-157a (seeking total preclusion of the antitrust 
laws).  He asks us to remand this case to the District Court 
so  that  it  can  determine  "whether  respondents'  allegations 
of prohibited conduct can, as a practical matter, be separated 
from  conduct  that  is  permitted  by  the  regulatory  scheme," 
and in doing so, the lower court should decide whether SEC-
permitted  and  SEC-prohibited  conduct  are  "inextricably  in-
tertwined."  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 
9, 26.  The Solicitor General fears that otherwise, we might 
read the law as totally precluding application of the antitrust 
law  to  underwriting  syndicate  behavior,  even  were  under-
writers, say, overtly to divide markets.

TSSAA  accordingly  sanctioned  Brentwood.  After  pro-ceeding  through  two  layers  of  internal  TSSAA  review, 

Brentwood brought this action against TSSAA and its exec-utive  director  in  federal  court  under  Rev.  Stat.  $ 1979,  42 
U. S. C.  $ 1983.  As  relevant  here,  Brentwood  made  two claims: first, that enforcement of the rule was state action in 
violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; and sec-ond,  that  TSSAA's  flawed  adjudication  of  its  appeal  had  de-
prived the school of due process of law.  The District Court granted  relief  to  Brentwood,  but  the  Court  of  Appeals  re-
versed, holding that TSSAA was a private voluntary associa-tion  that  did  not  act  under  color  of  state  law.  We  granted 
certiorari and reversed, holding  that the  District Court was correct on the threshold issue.

baert  acted  with  the  requisite  state  of  mind.  In  evaluating  whether 

the  PSLRA's  pleading  standard  is  met,  the  Circuit  said,  courts  should 
examine all of the complaint's allegations to decide whether collectively 
they establish an inference of scienter; the complaint would survive, the 
court  stated,  if  a  reasonable  person  could  infer  from  the  complaint's 
allegations  that  the  defendant  acted  with  the  requisite  state  of  mind. 

Held:  To  qualify  as  "strong"  within  the  intendment  of  $ 21D(b)(2),  an  in-

ference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable-- 
it  must  be cogent and  at least  as compelling as any  opposing  inference 
of nonfraudulent intent.  Pp. 318-329. 

(a)  Setting a uniform pleading standard for $ 10(b) actions was among 
Congress'  objectives  in  enacting  the  PSLRA.  Designed  to  curb  per-
ceived  abuses  of  the  $ 10(b)  private  action,  the  PSLRA  installed  both 
substantive and procedural controls.  As relevant here, $ 21D(b) of the 
PSLRA  "impose[d]  heightened  pleading  requirements  in  [$ 10(b)  and 
Rule 10b-5]  actions."  Merrill Lynch,  Pierce,  Fenner  &  Smith  Inc.  v. 
Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 81.  In the instant case, the District Court and the 
Seventh  Circuit  agreed  that  the  complaint  sufficiently  specified  Note-
baert's  alleged  misleading  statements  and  the  reasons  why  the  state-
ments  were  misleading.  But  those  courts  disagreed  on  whether  the 
Shareholders,  as  required  by  $ 21D(b)(2),  "state[d]  with  particularity 
facts giving rise to a strong inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scien-
ter],"  $ 78u-4(b)(2).  Congress  did  not  shed  much  light  on  what  facts 
would create a strong inference or how courts could determine the exist-
ence  of  the  requisite  inference.  With  no  clear  guide  from  Congress 
other  than  its  "inten[tion]  to  strengthen  existing  pleading  require-
ments,"  H.  R.  Conf.  Rep.  No.  104-369,  p.  41,  Courts  of  Appeals  have 
diverged in construing the term "strong inference."  Among the uncer-
tainties,  should  courts  consider  competing  inferences  in  determining 
whether  an  inference  of  scienter  is  "strong"?  This  Court's  task  is  to 
prescribe a workable construction of the "strong inference" standard, a 
reading  geared  to  the  PSLRA's  twin  goals:  to  curb  frivolous,  lawyer-
driven litigation, while preserving investors' ability to recover on meri-
torious claims.  Pp. 318-322. 

(b)  The  Court  establishes  the  following  prescriptions:  First,  faced 
with  a  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6)  motion  to  dismiss  a 

$ 10(b)  action, courts  must, as with any  motion to dismiss  for failure to 
plead  a  claim  on  which  relief  can  be  granted,  accept  all  factual  allega-
tions  in  the  complaint  as  true.  See  Leatherman  v.  Tarrant  County 
Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164.  Sec-

Syllabus 
ond, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other 
sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions. 
The  inquiry  is  whether  all of  the  facts  alleged,  taken  collectively,  give 
rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allega-
tion, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.  Third, in determin-
ing whether the pleaded facts give rise to a "strong" inference of scien-
ter,  the  court  must  take  into  account  plausible  opposing  inferences. 
The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative 
inquiry.  But  in  $ 21D(b)(2), Congress  did  not  merely  require  plaintiffs 
to  allege  facts  from  which  an  inference  of  scienter  rationally  could  be 
drawn.  Instead, Congress  required plaintiffs to  plead  with  particular-
ity facts that give rise to a "strong"--i. e., a powerful or cogent--infer-
ence.  To determine whether the plaintiff  has alleged facts  giving  rise 
to the requisite "strong inference," a court must consider plausible, non-
culpable explanations for the defendant's conduct, as well as inferences 
favoring the plaintiff.  The inference that the defendant acted with sci-
enter need not be irrefutable, but it must be more than merely "reason-
able"  or  "permissible"--it  must  be  cogent  and  compelling,  thus  strong 
in light of other explanations.  A complaint will survive only if a reason-
able person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as 
compelling as any plausible opposing inference one could draw from the 
facts alleged.  Pp. 322-324. 

(c)  Tellabs  contends  that  when  competing  inferences  are  considered, 
Notebaert's  evident  lack  of  pecuniary  motive  will  be  dispositive.  The 
Court agrees that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal 
financial gain  may weigh  heavily  in  favor  of  a  scienter  inference.  The 
absence of a motive allegation, however, is not fatal for allegations must 
be  considered  collectively;  the  significance  that  can  be  ascribed  to  an 
allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the complaint's entirety. 
Tellabs also maintains that several  of the Shareholders' allegations are 
too vague or ambiguous  to contribute  to a strong  inference of scienter. 
While  omissions  and  ambiguities  count  against  inferring  scienter,  the 
court's  job is  not to scrutinize each  allegation  in isolation but to  assess 
all the allegations holistically.  Pp. 325-326. 

(d)  The Seventh Circuit was unduly concerned that a court's compara-
tive assessment of plausible inferences would impinge upon the Seventh 
Amendment  right  to  jury  trial.  Congress,  as  creator  of  federal  statu-
tory  claims,  has  power  to  prescribe  what  must  be  pleaded to  state  the 
claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail 
on  the  merits.  It  is  the  federal  lawmaker's  prerogative,  therefore,  to 
allow,  disallow,  or  shape  the  contours  of--including  the  pleading  and

proof  requirements  for--$ 10(b) private  actions.  This  Court  has never 
questioned  that  authority  in  general,  or  suggested,  in  particular,  that 
the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress from establishing whatever 
pleading requirements it finds appropriate for federal statutory claims. 
Provided  that  the  Shareholders  have  satisfied  the  congressionally 
"prescribe[d] . . . means of making an issue," Fidelity & Deposit Co. of 
Md.  v.  United  States,  187  U. S.  315,  320,  the  case  will  fall  within  the 
jury's  authority  to  assess  the  credibility  of  witnesses,  resolve  genuine 
issues of fact, and make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert 
and,  by  imputation,  Tellabs  acted  with  scienter.  Under  this  Court's 
construction of the "strong inference" standard, a plaintiff is not forced 
to plead more than she would be required to prove at trial.  A plaintiff 
alleging fraud  under  $ 10(b)  must  plead  facts rendering an  inference of 
scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.  At trial, 
she  must  then  prove  her  case  by  a  "preponderance  of  the  evidence." 
Pp. 326-329. 

(e)  Neither  the  District  Court  nor  the  Court  of  Appeals  had  the  op-
portunity  to  consider  whether  the  Shareholders'  allegations  warrant 
"a strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the required 
state of mind," 15 U. S. C. $ 78u-4(b)(2), in light of the prescriptions an-
nounced today.  Thus,  the case  is  remanded  for a  determination  under 
this Court's construction of $ 21D(b)(2).  P. 329.

Opinion of the Court 
This  case  concerns  the  latter  requirement.  As  set  out  in $ 21D(b)(2) of the PSLRA, plaintiffs must "state with partic-

ularity  facts  giving  rise  to  a  strong  inference  that  the  de-fendant  acted with  the  required state  of mind."  15  U. S. C. 

$ 78u-4(b)(2). Congress  left  the  key  term  "strong  inference"  undefined, 
and Courts of Appeals  have divided on its meaning.  In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit 
held  that  the  "strong  inference"  standard  would  be  met  if the  complaint  "allege[d]  facts  from  which,  if  true,  a  reason-
able  person  could  infer  that  the  defendant  acted  with  the required  intent."  437  F.  3d 588,  602  (2006).  That  formula-
tion, we conclude, does not capture the stricter demand Con-gress  sought  to  convey  in  $ 21D(b)(2).  It  does  not  suffice 
that  a  reasonable  factfinder  plausibly  could  infer  from  the complaint's  allegations  the  requisite  state  of  mind.  Rather, 
to  determine  whether  a  complaint's  scienter  allegations  can survive threshold inspection for sufficiency, a court governed 
by  $ 21D(b)(2)  must  engage  in  a  comparative  evaluation;  it must  consider,  not  only  inferences  urged  by  the  plaintiff, 
as  the  Seventh  Circuit  did,  but  also  competing  inferences rationally  drawn  from  the  facts  alleged.  An  inference  of 
fraudulent  intent  may  be  plausible,  yet  less  cogent  than other,  nonculpable  explanations  for  the  defendant's  conduct. 
To  qualify  as  "strong"  within  the  intendment  of  $ 21D(b)(2), we  hold,  an  inference  of  scienter  must  be  more  than  merely

Petitioner  Tellabs,  Inc.,  manufactures  specialized  equip-ment  used  in  fiber  optic  networks.  During  the  time  period

Opinion of the Court 
Tellabs and Notebaert (as well as several other Tellabs exec-
utives) of engaging in a scheme to deceive the investing pub-
lic  about  the  true  value  of  Tellabs'  stock.  See  437  F.  3d,  at 
591; App. 94-98.1 

Beginning on December 11, 2000, the Shareholders allege, 
Notebaert  (and  by  imputation  Tellabs)  "falsely  reassured 
public  investors,  in  a  series  of  statements  .  .  .  that  Tellabs 
was  continuing  to  enjoy  strong  demand  for  its  products and 
earning record revenues," when, in fact, Notebaert knew the 
opposite was true.  Id., at 94-95, 98.  From December 2000 
until  the  spring  of  2001,  the  Shareholders  claim,  Notebaert 
knowingly misled the public in four ways.  437 F. 3d, at 596. 
First,  he  made  statements  indicating  that  demand  for  Tel-
labs'  flagship  networking  device,  the  TITAN  5500,  was  con-
tinuing  to grow,  when, in  fact,  demand  for  that product  was 
waning.  Id.,  at  596,  597.  Second,  Notebaert  made  state-
ments  indicating  that  the  TITAN  6500,  Tellabs'  next-
generation networking device, was available for delivery, and 
that demand for that product was strong and growing, when 
in truth the product was not ready for delivery and demand 
was  weak.  Id.,  at  596,  597-598.  Third,  he  falsely  repre-
sented Tellabs' financial results for the fourth quarter of 2000 
(and, in connection with those results, condoned the practice 
of "channel stuffing," under which Tellabs flooded its custom-
ers  with  unwanted  products).  Id.,  at  596,  598.  Fourth, 
Notebaert  made  a  series  of  overstated  revenue  projections, 
when  demand  for  the  TITAN  5500  was  drying  up  and  pro-
duction of the TITAN 6500 was behind schedule.  Id., at 596, 
598-599.  Based on Notebaert's sunny assessments, the 

1 The  Shareholders  brought  suit  against  Tellabs  executives  other  than 
Notebaert,  including  Richard  Birck,  Tellabs'  chairman  and  former  chief 
executive officer.  Because the claims against the other executives, many 
of  which  have  been  dismissed,  are  not  before  us,  we  focus  on  the  allega-
tions as  they relate to  Notebaert.  We refer to  the defendant-petitioners 
collectively as "Tellabs."

Opinion of the Court 
Shareholders  contend,  market  analysts  recommended  that investors buy Tellabs' stock.  See 

id., at 592. 
The first  public glimmer that  business  was not  so healthy came  in  March  2001  when Tellabs  modestly  reduced  its  first 

quarter  sales  projections.  Ibid.  In  the  next  months,  Tel-labs  made  progressively  more  cautious  statements  about  its 
projected  sales.  On  June  19,  2001,  the  last  day  of  the  class 
period,  Tellabs  disclosed  that  demand  for  the  TITAN  5500 had significantly dropped. 

Id., at 593.  Simultaneously, the 
company  substantially  lowered  its  revenue  projections  for the  second  quarter  of  2001.  The  next  day,  the  price  of 

Tellabs  stock,  which  had  reached  a  high  of  $67  during  the 
period, plunged to a low of $15.87.  Ibid. 

On December 3, 2002, the Shareholders filed a class action 
in  the  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  Illinois. 
Ibid.  Their  complaint  stated,  inter  alia,  that  Tellabs  and 
Notebaert  had  engaged  in  securities  fraud  in  violation  of 

$ 10(b)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  48  Stat.  891, 
15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 
(2006), also that Notebaert was a "controlling person" under 

$ 20(a)  of  the  1934  Act,  15  U. S. C.  $ 78t(a),  and  therefore 
derivatively  liable  for  the  company's  fraudulent  acts.  See 
App.  98-101,  167-171.  Tellabs  moved  to  dismiss  the  com-
plaint  on  the  ground  that  the  Shareholders  had  failed  to 
plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA requires. 
The District Court agreed, and therefore dismissed the com-
plaint  without  prejudice.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  80a-117a; 
see  Johnson  v.  Tellabs,  Inc.,  303  F.  Supp.  2d  941,  945  (ND 
Ill. 2004). 

The  Shareholders  then  amended  their  complaint,  adding 
references  to  27  confidential  sources  and  making  further, 
more  specific,  allegations  concerning  Notebaert's  mental 
state.  See 437 F. 3d, at 594; App. 91-93, 152-160.  The Dis-
trict  Court  again  dismissed,  this  time  with  prejudice.  303 
F.  Supp.  2d,  at  971.  The  Shareholders  had  sufficiently 
pleaded  that  Notebaert's  statements  were  misleading,  the

Opinion of the Court 
court determined, id., at 955-961, but they had insufficiently alleged that he acted  with  scienter, 

id.,  at 954-955, 961-969. 
The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit  reversed  in relevant  part.  437  F.  3d,  at  591.  Like  the  District  Court, 

the  Court  of  Appeals  found  that  the  Shareholders  had pleaded  the  misleading  character  of  Notebaert's  statements 
with  sufficient  particularity.  Id.,  at  595-600.  Unlike  the 
District Court,  however,  the  Seventh  Circuit concluded that the  Shareholders  had  sufficiently  alleged  that  Notebaert 

acted with the requisite state of mind.  Id., at 603-605. The  Court  of  Appeals  recognized  that  the  PSLRA  "un-
equivocally raise[d] the bar for pleading scienter" by requir-
ing  plaintiffs  to  "plea[d]  sufficient  facts  to  create  a  strong 
inference of scienter."  Id., at 601 (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  In  evaluating  whether  that  pleading  standard  is 
met, the Seventh Circuit said, "courts [should] examine all of 
the allegations in the complaint and then . . .  decide whether 
collectively they establish such an inference."  Ibid.  "[W]e 
will allow the complaint to survive," the court next and criti-
cally stated, "if it alleges facts from which, if true, a reason-
able  person  could  infer  that  the  defendant  acted  with  the 
required intent . . . .   If  a  reasonable person could not draw 
such  an  inference  from  the  alleged  facts,  the  defendants  are 
entitled to dismissal."  Id., at 602. 

In  adopting  its  standard  for  the  survival  of  a  complaint, 
the  Seventh  Circuit  explicitly  rejected  a  stiffer  standard 
adopted by the Sixth Circuit, i. e., that "plaintiffs are entitled 
only  to  the  most  plausible  of  competing  inferences."  Id., 
at  601,  602  (quoting  Fidel  v.  Farley,  392  F.  3d  220,  227 
(2004)).  The  Sixth  Circuit's  standard,  the  court  observed, 
because  it  involved  an  assessment  of  competing  inferences, 
"could  potentially  infringe  upon  plaintiffs'  Seventh  Amend-
ment  rights."  437  F.  3d,  at  602.  We  granted  certiorari  to 
resolve  the  disagreement  among  the  Circuits  on  whether, 
and  to  what  extent,  a  court  must  consider  competing  infer-
ences  in  determining  whether  a  securities  fraud  complaint

Section  10(b)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  for-bids  the  "use  or  employ,  in  connection  with  the  purchase  or 

sale  of  any  security  .  .  .  ,  [of]  any  manipulative  or  deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and reg-
ulations  as  the  [SEC]  may  prescribe  as  necessary  or  appro-priate  in  the  public  interest  or  for  the  protection  of  inves-
tors."  15  U. S. C.  $ 78j(b).  SEC  Rule  10b-5  implements $ 10(b) by declaring it unlawful: 

"(a)  To  employ any device,  scheme, or artifice  to defraud, 
"(b)  To make any untrue statement of a material fact or  to omit to state  a  material  fact  necessary in order  to 
make the statements made . . . not misleading, or "(c)  To  engage  in  any  act,  practice,  or  course  of  busi-

sale of any security."  17 CFR $ 240.10b-5. 
Section  10(b), this  Court  has  implied  from  the  statute's  text and purpose, affords a right of action to purchasers or sellers

Opinion of the Court 
are "a necessary supplement to Commission action").  To es-tablish liability under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a private plain-

tiff  must  prove  that  the  defendant  acted  with  scienter, "a  mental  state  embracing  intent  to  deceive,  manipulate,  or 
defraud."  Ernst  &  Ernst,  425  U. S., at  193-194,  and  n.  12.3 In an ordinary civil action, the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure require only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing  that  the  pleader  is  entitled  to  relief."  Fed.  Rule 
Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).  Although the rule encourages brevity, the complaint must say enough to give the defendant "fair notice 
of  what  the  plaintiff 's  claim  is  and  the  grounds  upon  which it rests." 

Dura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U. S., at 346 (internal quotation  marks  omitted).  Prior  to  the  enactment  of  the 

PSLRA,  the  sufficiency  of  a  complaint  for  securities  fraud was governed not by Rule 8, but by the heightened pleading 
standard set forth  in Rule  9(b).  See  Greenstone v.  Cambex 
Corp.,  975  F.  2d  22,  25  (CA1  1992)  (Breyer,  J.)  (collecting cases).  Rule  9(b)  applies  to  "all  averments  of  fraud  or 

mistake";  it  requires  that  "the  circumstances  constituting fraud  .  .  .  be  stated  with  particularity"  but  provides  that 
"[m]alice,  intent,  knowledge,  and  other  condition  of  mind  of a person may be averred generally." 

Courts  of  Appeals  diverged  on  the  character  of  the  Rule 9(b) inquiry in $ 10(b)  cases: Could  securities fraud plaintiffs 
allege the requisite mental  state "simply by saying that  sci-enter existed," In re GlenFed, Inc. Securities Litigation, 42 
F.  3d  1541,  1546-1547  (CA9  1994)  (en  banc),  or  were  they required  to  allege  with  particularity  facts  giving  rise  to  an 

3 We  have  previously  reserved  the  question  whether  reckless  behavior 
is sufficient for civil liability under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.  See Ernst & 
Ernst v.  Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976).  Every Court of Ap-
peals that has considered the issue has held that a plaintiff may meet the 
scienter requirement by showing that the defendant acted intentionally or 
recklessly,  though  the  Circuits  differ  on  the  degree  of  recklessness  re-
quired.  See Ottmann, 353 F. 3d, at 343 (collecting cases).  The question 
whether  and  when  recklessness  satisfies  the  scienter  requirement  is  not 
presented in this case.

inference  of  scienter?  Compare  id.,  at  1546  ("We  are  not permitted  to  add  new  requirements  to  Rule  9(b)  simply  be-

cause  we  like  the  effects  of  doing  so."),  with,  e. g.,  Green-stone,  975  F.  2d,  at  25  (were  the  law  to  permit  a  securities 
fraud complaint simply to allege scienter without supporting facts,  "a  complaint  could  evade  too  easily  the  `particularity' 
requirement in Rule 9(b)'s first sentence").  Circuits requir-ing  plaintiffs  to  allege  specific  facts  indicating  scienter  ex-
pressed that requirement variously.  See 5A C. Wright & A. Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure  $ 1301.1, pp. 300-302 
(3d  ed.  2004)  (hereinafter  Wright  &  Miller).  The  Second 
Circuit's  formulation  was  the  most  stringent.  Securities fraud  plaintiffs in  that  Circuit  were required  to  "specifically 

plead  those  [facts]  which  they  assert  give  rise  to  a  strong 
inference  that  the  defendants  had"  the  requisite  state  of mind. 

Ross  v.  A.  H.  Robins  Co.,  607  F.  2d  545,  558  (1979) 
(emphasis  added).  The  "strong  inference"  formulation  was appropriate,  the  Second  Circuit  said,  to  ward  off  allegations 

of  "fraud  by  hindsight."  See,  e. g.,  Shields  v.  Citytrust 
Bancorp,  Inc.,  25  F.  3d  1124,  1129  (1994)  (quoting  Denny  v. 
Barber, 576 F. 2d 465, 470 (CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.)). Setting a uniform pleading standard for $ 10(b) actions was 

among  Congress'  objectives  when  it  enacted  the  PSLRA. Designed  to  curb  perceived  abuses  of  the  $ 10(b)  private  ac-
tion--"nuisance filings, targeting of deep-pocket defendants, vexatious  discovery  requests  and  manipulation  by  class  ac-
tion  lawyers,"  Dabit,  547  U. S.,  at  81  (quoting  H.  R.  Conf. Rep.  No.  104-369,  p.  31  (1995)  (hereinafter  H.  R.  Conf. 
Rep.))--the  PSLRA  installed  both  substantive  and  proce-

conclusion "that private securities litigation [i]s an indispensable tool with 
which  defrauded  investors  can  recover  their  losses"--a  matter  crucial  to 
the  integrity  of  domestic  capital  markets.  See  Merrill  Lynch,  Pierce,

dures for the appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. This innovation aimed to increase the likelihood that institu-

tional investors--parties more likely to balance the interests of  the  class  with  the  long-term  interests  of  the  company-- 
would  serve  as  lead  plaintiffs.  See  id.,  at  33-34;  S.  Rep. No.  104-98,  p.  11  (1995).  Congress  also  "limit[ed]  recover-
able  damages  and  attorney's  fees,  provide[d]  a  `safe  harbor' 
for forward-looking statements, . . . mandate[d] imposition of sanctions  for  frivolous  litigation,  and  authorize[d]  a  stay  of 

discovery  pending  resolution  of  any  motion  to  dismiss." 
Dabit, 547 U. S., at 81.  And in $ 21D(b) of the PSLRA, Con-
gress  "impose[d]  heightened  pleading  requirements  in  ac-
tions  brought  pursuant  to  $ 10(b)  and  Rule  10b-5."  Ibid. 

Under the PSLRA's heightened pleading instructions, any 
private  securities  complaint  alleging  that  the  defendant 
made a false or misleading statement must: (1) "specify each 
statement  alleged  to  have  been  misleading  [and]  the  reason 
or  reasons  why  the  statement  is  misleading,"  15  U. S. C. 

$ 78u-4(b)(1);  and  (2)  "state  with  particularity  facts  giving 
rise  to  a  strong  inference  that  the  defendant  acted  with  the 
required  state  of  mind,"  $ 78u-4(b)(2).  In  the  instant  case, 
as  earlier  stated,  see  supra,  at  317,  the  District  Court  and 
the  Seventh  Circuit  agreed  that  the  Shareholders  met  the 
first  of  the  two  requirements:  The  complaint  sufficiently 
specified  Notebaert's  alleged  misleading  statements  and  the 
reasons  why  the  statements  were  misleading.  303  F.  Supp. 
2d,  at  955-961;  437  F.  3d,  at  596-600.  But  those  courts 
disagreed  on  whether  the  Shareholders,  as  required  by 

$ 21D(b)(2),  "state[d]  with  particularity  facts  giving  rise  to 
a  strong  inference  that  [Notebaert]  acted  with  [scienter]," 

$ 78u-4(b)(2).  See supra, at 317. 

The  "strong  inference"  standard  "unequivocally  raise[d] 
the bar for pleading scienter," 437 F. 3d, at 601, and signaled 
Congress' purpose to promote greater uniformity among the 
Circuits,  see  H.  R.  Conf.  Rep.,  p.  41.  But  "Congress  did 
not  .  . .  throw  much  light  on  what  facts . . .  suffice  to  create

[a  strong]  inference,"  or  on  what  "degree  of  imagination courts  can  use  in  divining  whether"  the  requisite  inference 

exists.  437  F.  3d,  at  601.  While  adopting  the  Second  Cir-cuit's  "strong  inference"  standard,  Congress  did  not  codify 
that Circuit's case law interpreting the standard.  See $ 78u- 4(b)(2).  See also Brief for United States as 

Amicus Curiae 18.  With  no  clear  guide  from  Congress  other  than  its  "in-

ten[tion]  to  strengthen  existing  pleading  requirements," H.  R.  Conf.  Rep.,  p.  41,  Courts  of  Appeals  have  diverged 
again,  this  time  in  construing  the  term  "strong  inference." Among  the  uncertainties,  should  courts  consider  competing 
inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter is "strong"?  See 437 F. 3d, at 601-602 (collecting cases).  Our 
task  is  to  prescribe  a  workable  construction  of  the  "strong inference"  standard,  a  reading  geared  to  the  PSLRA's  twin 
goals:  to  curb  frivolous,  lawyer-driven  litigation,  while  pre-serving  investors'  ability  to  recover  on  meritorious  claims. 

III 

A 

We establish the following prescriptions: First, faced with a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  to  dismiss  a  $ 10(b)  action,  courts 

must,  as  with  any  motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to  plead  a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allega-
tions  in the  complaint as true.  See Leatherman  v.  Tarrant County  Narcotics  Intelligence  and  Coordination  Unit,  507 
U. S. 163, 164 (1993).  On this point, the parties agree.  See Reply  Brief  8;  Brief  for  Respondents  26;  Brief  for  United 
States as Amicus Curiae 8, 20, 21. Second, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, 
as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when rul-ing  on  Rule  12(b)(6)  motions  to  dismiss,  in  particular,  docu-
ments incorporated into the complaint by reference, and mat-ters  of  which  a  court  may  take  judicial  notice.  See  5B 
Wright  &  Miller  $ 1357  (3d  ed.  2004  and  Supp.  2007).  The inquiry,  as  several  Courts  of  Appeals  have  recognized,  is

Opinion of the Court 
whether all of the  facts alleged, taken  collectively, give  rise to  a  strong  inference  of  scienter,  not  whether  any  individ-

ual  allegation,  scrutinized  in  isolation,  meets  that  standard. See, 

e. g.,  Abrams  v.  Baker  Hughes  Inc.,  292  F.  3d  424, 
431  (CA5  2002);  Gompper  v.  VISX,  Inc.,  298  F.  3d  893,  897 (CA9 2002).  See also Brief for United States as 

Amicus Cu-
riae 25. 

Third, in  determining whether the pleaded facts give rise 
to  a  "strong"  inference  of  scienter,  the  court  must take  into 
account plausible opposing inferences.  The Seventh Circuit expressly  declined  to  engage  in  such  a  comparative  inquiry. 

A  complaint  could  survive,  that  court  said,  as  long  as  it  "al-
leges  facts  from  which,  if  true,  a  reasonable  person  could 
infer  that  the  defendant  acted  with  the  required  intent";  in 
other  words,  only  "[i]f  a  reasonable  person  could  not  draw 
such  an  inference  from  the  alleged  facts"  would  the  defend-
ant  prevail  on  a  motion  to  dismiss.  437  F.  3d,  at  602.  But 
in  $ 21D(b)(2),  Congress  did  not  merely  require  plaintiffs  to 
"provide a factual basis for [their] scienter allegations," ibid. 
(quoting  In re Cerner Corp. Securities Litigation,  425 F. 3d 
1079, 1084, 1085 (CA8 2005)), i. e., to allege facts from which 
an inference of scienter rationally could be drawn.  Instead, 
Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts 
that  give  rise  to  a  "strong"--i. e.,  a  powerful  or  cogent-- 
inference.  See American  Heritage Dictionary  1717  (4th  ed. 
2000)  (defining  "strong"  as  "[p]ersuasive,  effective,  and  co-
gent");  16  Oxford  English  Dictionary  949  (2d  ed.  1989)  (de-
fining  "strong"  as  "[p]owerful  to  demonstrate  or  convince" 
(definition  16b));  cf.  7  id.,  at  924  (defining  "inference"  as 
"a conclusion [drawn] from known or assumed facts or state-
ments";  "reasoning  from  something  known  or  assumed  to 
something else which follows from it"). 

The  strength  of  an  inference  cannot  be  decided  in  a  vac-
uum.  The  inquiry  is  inherently  comparative:  How  likely  is 
it  that  one  conclusion,  as  compared  to  others,  follows  from 
the  underlying  facts?  To  determine  whether  the  plaintiff

Opinion of the Court 
has  alleged  facts  that  give  rise  to  the  requisite  "strong  in-ference"  of  scienter,  a  court  must  consider  plausible,  non-

culpable explanations for the defendant's  conduct, as well as inferences  favoring  the  plaintiff.  The  inference  that  the 
defendant  acted  with  scienter  need  not  be  irrefutable,  i. e., of  the  "smoking-gun"  genre,  or  even  the  "most  plausible  of 
competing inferences," Fidel, 392 F. 3d, at 227 (quoting Hel-
wig v.  Vencor, Inc., 251 F. 3d 540, 553 (CA6 2001) (en banc)). Recall  in  this  regard  that  $ 21D(b)'s  pleading  requirements 

are but one constraint  among many the  PSLRA  installed  to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing meritorious actions 
to move forward.  See supra,  at 320-321,  and n. 4.  Yet the inference of scienter must be more than merely "reasonable" 
or  "permissible"--it  must  be  cogent  and  compelling,  thus strong  in light of other explanations.  A  complaint will sur-
vive,  we  hold,  only  if  a  reasonable  person  would  deem  the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any 
opposing  inference  one  could  draw  from  the  facts  alleged.5

Tellabs contends  that when  competing inferences  are  con-sidered,  Notebaert's  evident  lack  of  pecuniary  motive  will 

be  dispositive.  The  Shareholders,  Tellabs  stresses,  did  not allege  that  Notebaert  sold  any  shares  during  the  class  pe-
riod.  See Brief for Petitioners 50 ("The absence of any alle-gations  of  motive  color  all  the  other  allegations  putatively 
giving  rise  to  an  inference  of  scienter.").  While  it  is  true that  motive  can  be  a  relevant  consideration,  and  personal 
financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter infer-ence, we agree  with the  Seventh Circuit that  the  absence of 
a  motive  allegation  is  not  fatal.  See  437  F.  3d,  at  601.  As earlier stated, supra, at 322-323, allegations must be consid-
ered  collectively;  the  significance  that  can  be  ascribed  to  an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the entirety 
of the complaint. Tellabs  also  maintains  that  several  of  the  Shareholders' 
allegations  are  too  vague  or  ambiguous  to  contribute  to  a strong inference of scienter.  For example, the Shareholders 
alleged  that  Tellabs  flooded  its  customers  with  unwanted products,  a  practice  known  as  "channel  stuffing."  See 
supra,  at  315.  But  they  failed,  Tellabs  argues,  to  specify whether  the  channel  stuffing  allegedly  known  to  Notebaert 
was  the  illegitimate  kind  (e. g.,  writing  orders  for  products customers  had  not  requested)  or  the  legitimate  kind  (

e. g., offering  customers  discounts  as  an  incentive  to  buy).  Brief 

for  Petitioners  44-46;  Reply  Brief  8.  See  also  id.,  at  8-9 (complaint  lacks  precise  dates  of  reports  critical  to  distin-
guish  legitimate  conduct  from  culpable  conduct).  But  see 437  F.  3d,  at  598,  603-604  (pointing  to  multiple  particulars 

judgment).  But  the  test  at  each  stage  is  measured  against  a  different 
backdrop.  It  is  improbable  that  Congress,  without  so  stating,  intended 
courts to test pleadings, unaided by discovery, to determine whether there 
is  "no  genuine  issue  as  to  any  material  fact."  See  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc. 
56(c).  And judgment as a matter of law is a post-trial device, turning on 
the question whether a party has produced evidence "legally sufficient" to 
warrant a jury determination in that party's favor.  See Rule 50(a)(1).

alleged  by  the  Shareholders,  including  specifications  as  to timing).  We  agree  that  omissions  and  ambiguities  count 

against  inferring  scienter,  for  plaintiffs  must  "state  with particularity  facts  giving  rise  to  a  strong  inference  that  the 
defendant  acted  with  the  required  state  of  mind."  $ 78u- 4(b)(2).  We reiterate, however, that the court's job is not to 
scrutinize  each  allegation  in  isolation  but  to  assess  all  the allegations holistically.  See 

supra, at 322-323; 437 F. 3d, at 601.  In  sum, the  reviewing court  must ask:  When the  alle-

gations  are  accepted  as  true  and  taken  collectively,  would  a reasonable  person  deem  the  inference  of  scienter  at  least  as 
strong as any opposing inference? 6 

IV 
Accounting for its construction of $ 21D(b)(2), the Seventh Circuit explained that the court "th[ought] it wis[e] to adopt 

an  approach  that  [could  not]  be  misunderstood  as  a  usurpa-tion of the jury's  role."  437 F. 3d, at 602.  In our  view, the 
Seventh  Circuit's  concern  was  undue.7  A  court's  compara-tive  assessment  of  plausible  inferences,  while  constantly  as-

6 The Seventh Circuit held that allegations of scienter made against one 
defendant  cannot  be  imputed  to  all  other  individual  defendants.  437 
F.  3d,  at  602-603.  See  also  id.,  at  603  (to  proceed  beyond  the  pleading 
stage,  the  plaintiff  must  allege  as  to  each  defendant  facts  sufficient  to 
demonstrate a culpable state of mind regarding his or her violations (citing 
Phillips  v.  Scientific-Atlanta,  Inc.,  374  F.  3d  1015,  1018  (CA11  2004))). 
Though there is disagreement among the Circuits as to whether the group 
pleading  doctrine  survived  the  PSLRA,  see,  e. g.,  Southland  Securities 
Corp.  v.  Inspire  Ins.  Solutions  Inc.,  365  F.  3d  353,  364  (CA5  2004),  the 
Shareholders  do  not  contest  the  Seventh  Circuit's  determination,  and  we 
do not disturb it. 

7 The  Seventh  Circuit  raised  the  possibility  of  a  Seventh  Amendment 

problem  on  its  own  initiative.  The  Shareholders  did  not  contend  below 
that  dismissal  of  their  complaint  under  $ 21D(b)(2)  would  violate  their 
right  to  trial  by  jury.  Cf.  Monroe  Employees  Retirement  System  v. 
Bridgestone  Corp.,  399  F.  3d  651,  683,  n.  25  (CA6  2005)  (noting  possible 
Seventh Amendment argument but declining to address it when not raised 
by plaintiffs).

Opinion of the Court 
suming the plaintiff 's allegations to be true, we think it plain, does  not  impinge  upon  the  Seventh  Amendment  right  to 

jury trial.8 Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power 
to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it  has  power  to  determine  what  must  be  proved  to  prevail 
on  the  merits.  It  is  the  federal  lawmaker's  prerogative, 
therefore,  to  allow,  disallow,  or  shape  the  contours  of-- including  the  pleading  and  proof  requirements  for--$ 10(b) 

private  actions.  No  decision  of  this  Court  questions  that authority in general, or suggests, in particular, that the Sev-
enth  Amendment  inhibits  Congress  from  establishing  what-ever  pleading  requirements  it  finds  appropriate  for  federal 
statutory  claims.  Cf.  Swierkiewicz  v.  Sorema  N.  A.,  534 U. S. 506, 512-513 (2002); 

Leatherman, 507 U. S., at 168 (both 
recognizing  that  heightened  pleading  requirements  can  be established  by  Federal  Rule,  citing  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc. 

9(b),  which  requires  that  fraud  or  mistake  be  pleaded  with 
particularity).9 

Our  decision  in  Fidelity  &  Deposit  Co.  of  Md.  v.  United 
States,  187  U. S.  315  (1902),  is  instructive.  That  case  con-
cerned a rule adopted by  the Supreme Court of the District 
of Columbia in 1879 pursuant to rulemaking power delegated 
by Congress.  The rule required defendants, in certain con-

8 In  numerous  contexts,  gatekeeping  judicial  determinations  prevent 
submission  of  claims  to  a  jury's  judgment  without  violating  the  Seventh 
Amendment.  See,  e. g.,  Daubert  v.  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc., 
509 U. S. 579, 589 (1993) (expert testimony can be excluded based on judi-
cial determination of reliability); Neely v.  Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 
U. S.  317,  321  (1967)  (judgment  as  a  matter  of  law);  Pease  v.  RathbunJones Engineering Co., 243 U. S. 273, 278 (1917) (summary judgment). 

9 Any heightened pleading rule, including Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9(b), could 

have the effect of preventing a plaintiff from getting discovery on a claim 
that  might  have  gone  to  a  jury,  had  discovery  occurred  and  yielded  sub-
stantial evidence.  In recognizing Congress' or the Federal Rule makers' 
authority  to  adopt  special  pleading  rules,  we  have  detected  no  Seventh 
Amendment impediment.

tract  actions,  to  file  an  affidavit  "specifically  stating . . . , in  precise  and  distinct  terms,  the  grounds  of  his  defen[s]e." 

Id., at 318 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The defend-ant's  affidavit  was  found  insufficient,  and  judgment  was  en-
tered  for  the  plaintiff,  whose  declaration  and  supporting affidavit  had  been  found  satisfactory. 

Ibid.  This  Court 
upheld  the  District's  rule  against  the  contention  that  it  vio-
lated  the  Seventh  Amendment.  Id.,  at  320.  Just  as  the purpose of $ 21D(b) is to screen out frivolous complaints, the 

purpose  of  the  prescription  at  issue  in  Fidelity  &  Deposit 
Co.  was  to  "preserve  the  court  from  frivolous  defen[s]es," 
ibid.  Explaining why the Seventh Amendment was not im-
plicated,  this  Court  said  that  the  heightened  pleading  rule 
simply "prescribes the  means  of making an  issue," and that, 
when "[t]he issue [was] made as prescribed, the right of trial 
by jury accrues."  Ibid.; accord Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 
300,  310  (1920)  (Brandeis,  J.)  (citing  Fidelity  &  Deposit  Co., 
and reiterating: "It does not infringe the constitutional right 
to  a  trial  by  jury  [in  a  civil  case],  to  require,  with  a  view  to 
formulating  the  issues,  an  oath  by  each  party  to  the  facts 
relied upon.").  See also Walker v.  New Mexico & Southern 
Pacific R. Co., 165 U. S. 593, 596 (1897) (Seventh Amendment 
"does not attempt to regulate matters of pleading"). 

In  the  instant  case,  provided  that  the  Shareholders  have 
satisfied the congressionally "prescribe[d] . . . means of mak-
ing  an  issue,"  Fidelity  &  Deposit  Co.,  187  U. S.,  at  320,  the 
case  will  fall  within  the  jury's  authority  to  assess  the  credi-
bility  of  witnesses,  resolve  any  genuine  issues  of  fact,  and 
make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert and, by 
imputation,  Tellabs  acted  with  scienter.  We  emphasize,  as 
well,  that  under  our  construction  of  the  "strong  inference" 
standard,  a  plaintiff  is  not  forced  to  plead  more  than  she 
would  be  required  to  prove  at  trial.  A  plaintiff  alleging 
fraud in a $ 10(b) action, we hold today, must plead facts ren-
dering an inference of scienter at least as likely as any plau-
sible  opposing  inference.  At  trial,  she  must then  prove  her

sonableness"  presumption  simply  recognizes  these  real-world  circum-
stances.  It  applies  only  on  appellate  review.  The  sentencing  court 
does  not  enjoy  the  presumption's  benefit  when  determining  the  merits 
of  the  arguments by  prosecution  or  defense that a  Guidelines sentence 
should not apply.  Pp. 347-351. 

(b)  Even if the presumption increases the likelihood that the judge, 
not  the  jury,  will  find  "sentencing  facts,"  it  does  not  violate  the  Sixth 
Amendment.  This Court's Sixth Amendment cases do not forbid a sen-
tencing  court  to  take  account  of  factual  matters  not  determined  by  a 
jury  and increase  the  sentence  accordingly to  take  account  of  the  Sen-
tencing Commission's factual findings or recommended sentences.  The 
relevant Sixth Amendment inquiry  is whether  a law forbids  a judge  to 
increase  a  sentence  unless  the  judge  finds  facts  that  the  jury  did  not 
find.  A  nonbinding  appellate  reasonableness  presumption  for  Guide-
lines sentences does not require the sentencing judge to impose a Guide-
lines sentence.  Still less does it forbid the judge to impose a sentence 
higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts stand-
ing  alone.  In  addition,  any  general  conflict  between  $ 3553(a)  and  the 
Guidelines for appellate review purposes is alleviated where judge and 
Commission both determine that the Guidelines sentence is appropriate 
in  the  case  at  hand,  for  that  sentence  likely  reflects  $ 3553(a)'s  factors. 
Pp. 352-356. 

2.  The District  Court properly analyzed the  relevant sentencing fac-
tors, and given the  record, its  ultimate sentence was reasonable.  Sec-
tion  3553(c)  calls  for  the  judge  to  "state"  his  "reasons,"  but  does  not 
insist  on  a  full  opinion  in  every  case.  The  appropriateness  of  brevity 
or  length,  conciseness  or  detail,  when  to  write,  what  to  say,  depends 
upon  circumstances.  The  law  leaves  much,  in  this  respect,  to  the 
judge's  own  professional  judgment.  In  the  present  context,  the  sen-
tencing  judge  should  articulate  enough  to  satisfy  the  appellate  court 
that he has considered the parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis 
for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.  He may say less 
when  his decision  rests  upon  the  Commission's  own  reasoning that  the 
Guidelines  sentence  is  proper  in  the  typical  case,  and  the  judge  has 
found that the case before him is typical.  But where a party presents 
nonfrivolous  reasons  for  imposing  a  different  sentence,  the  judge  will 
normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments. 
Here, the sentencing judge's statement of reasons was brief but legally 
sufficient.  The  record  makes  clear  that  the  judge  listened  to  each  of 
Rita's arguments for a downward departure and considered the support-
ing  evidence  before finding  those  circumstances  insufficient  to  warrant 
a sentence lower than the Guidelines range.  Where, as here, the matter 
is  conceptually  simple  and  the  record  makes  clear  that  the  sentencing

judge considered the evidence and arguments, the law does not require 
a judge to write more extensively.  Pp. 356-359. 

3.  The  Fourth  Circuit,  after  applying  the  presumption,  was  legally 
correct  in  holding  that  Rita's  sentence  was  not  "unreasonable."  Like 
the  District  Court  and  the  Fourth  Circuit,  this  Court  simply  cannot 
say that Rita's special circumstances--his health, fear of retaliation, and 
military  record--are  special  enough,  in  light  of  $ 3553(a),  to  require  a 
sentence  lower  than  the  one  the  Guidelines  provide.  Rita's  argument 
that  the  Guidelines  sentence  is  not  reasonable  under  $ 3553(a)  because 
it  expressly  declines  to  consider  various  personal  characteristics,  such 
as his physical condition, employment record, and military service, was 
not raised below and will not be considered here.  Pp. 359-360.

back the kit.  He subsequently turned over to ATF a differ-ent  kit  that  apparently  did  not  amount  to  a  machinegun. 

App. 23-24, 120; Supp. App. 2-5, 8-10, 13-14. The  investigating  prosecutor  brought  Rita  before  the 
grand  jury,  placed  him  under  oath,  and  asked  him  about these matters.  Rita denied that the Government agent had 
asked  him  for  the  PPSH  kit,  and  also  denied  that  he  had spoken  soon  thereafter  about  the  PPSH  kit  to  someone  at 
InterOrdnance.  App.  19,  120-121;  Supp.  App.  11-12.  The Government  claimed  these  statements  were  false,  charged 
Rita with perjury, making false statements, and obstructing justice,  and,  after  a  jury  trial,  obtained  convictions  on  all 
counts.  App. 7-13, 94, 103. 

B 
The  parties  subsequently  proceeded  to  sentencing.  Ini-tially,  a  probation  officer,  with  the  help  of  the  parties,  and 

after  investigating  the  background  both  of  the  offenses  and of  the  offender,  prepared  a  presentence  report.  See  Fed. 
Rules  Crim.  Proc.  32(c)-(d);  18  U. S. C.  $ 3552(a).  The  com-pleted  report  describes  "offense  characteristics,"  "offender 
characteristics," and other matters that might be relevant to the  sentence,  and  then  calculates  a  Guidelines  sentence. 
The  report  also  sets  forth  factors  potentially  relevant  to  a departure  from  the  Guidelines  or  relevant  to  the  imposition 
of an other-than-Guidelines sentence.  It ultimately makes a sentencing  recommendation  based  on  the  Guidelines.  App. 
115-136. In  respect  to  "offense  characteristics,"  for  example,  the 
report  points  out  that  the  five  counts  of  conviction  all  stem from a single incident. 

Id., at 122.  Hence, pursuant to the Guidelines,  the  report,  in  calculating  a  recommended  sen-

tence, groups the five counts of conviction together, treating them  as  if  they  amounted  to  the  single  most  serious  count 
among  them  (and  ignoring  all  others).  See  USSG  $ 3D1.1. The  single  most  serious  offense  in  Rita's  case  is  "perjury."

Opinion of the Court 
The relevant Guideline, $ 2J1.3(c)(1), instructs the sentencing court  (and  the  probation  officer)  to  calculate  the  Guidelines 

sentence for "perjury . . . in respect to a criminal offense" by applying  the  Guideline  for  an  "accessory  after  the  fact,"  as 
to  that  criminal  offense,  $ 2X3.1.  And  that  latter  Guideline says that  the judge, for  calculation purposes,  should  take as 
a  base  offense  level,  a  level  that  is  "6  levels  lower  than  the 
offense  level  for  the  underlying  offense"  (emphasis  added) (the offense that the perjury may have helped someone com-

mit).  Here  the  "underlying  offense"  consisted  of  InterOrd-nance's possible violation of the machinegun registration law. 
App.  124;  USSG $ 2M5.2  (providing  sentence for  violation of 
22  U. S. C.  $ 2778(b)(2),  importation  of  defense  articles  with-
out authorization).  The base offense level for the gun regis-
tration  crime  is  26.  See  USSG  $ 2M5.2.  Six  levels  less  is 
20.  And 20, says the presentence report, is the base offense 
level  applicable  to  Rita  for  purposes  of  Guidelines  sentence 
calculation.  App. 45. 

The  presentence  report  next  considers  Rita's  "Criminal 
History."  Id., at 125.  Rita was convicted in May 1986, and 
sentenced  to  five  years'  probation  for  making  false  state-
ments in connection with the purchase of firearms.  Because 
this  conviction  took  place  more  than  10  years  before  the 
present offense, it did not count against Rita.  And because 
Rita had no other relevant convictions, the Guidelines consid-
ered him as having no "criminal history points."  Ibid.  The 
report consequently places Rita in criminal history category 
I,  the  lowest  category  for  purposes  of  calculating  a  Guide-
lines' sentence. 

The report goes on to describe other "Offender Character-
istics."  Id.,  at  126.  The  description  includes  Rita's  per-
sonal  and  family  data,  Rita's  physical  condition  (including  a 
detailed description of ailments), Rita's mental and emotional 
health, the lack of any history of substance abuse, Rita's vo-
cational and nonvocational education, and Rita's employment 
record.  It  states  that  he  served  in  the  Armed  Forces  for

over  25  years,  on  active  duty  and  in  the  Reserve.  During 
that  time  he  received  35  commendations,  awards,  or  medals 
of different kinds.  The report analyzes Rita's financial con-
dition.  Id., at 126-132. 

Ultimately, the report calculates the Guidelines sentencing 
range.  Id., at 132.  The Guidelines specify for base level 20, 
criminal  history  category  I,  a  sentence  of  33-to-41  months' 
imprisonment.  Ibid.  The  report  adds  that  there  "appears 
to  be  no  circumstance  or  combination  of  circumstances  that 
warrant  a  departure  from  the  prescribed  sentencing  guide-
lines."  Id., at 133. 

C 

At the sentencing hearing, both Rita and the Government 
presented their sentencing arguments.  Each side addressed 
the  report.  Rita  argued  for  a  sentence  outside  (and  lower 
than) the recommended Guidelines 33-to-41 month range. 

The  judge  made  clear  that  Rita's  argument  for  a  lower 
sentence  could  take  either  of  two  forms.  First,  Rita  might 
argue  within  the  Guidelines'  framework,  for  a  departure 
from  the  applicable  Guidelines  range on  the  ground  that  his 
circumstances  present  an  "atypical  case"  that  falls  outside 
the "heartland" to which the United States Sentencing Com-
mission  intends  each  individual  Guideline  to  apply.  USSG 

$ 5K2.0(a)(2).  Second,  Rita  might  argue  that,  independent 
of  the  Guidelines,  application  of  the  sentencing  factors  set 
forth in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV) warrants 
a lower sentence.  See Booker, 543 U. S., at 259-260. 

Thus,  the  judge  asked  Rita's  counsel,  "Are  you  going  to 
put on evidence to show that [Rita] should be getting a down-
ward departure, or under 3553, your client would be entitled 
to  a  different  sentence  than  he  should  get  under  sentencing 
guidelines?"  App. 52.  And the judge later summarized: 

"[Y]ou're  asking  for  a  departure  from  the  guidelines  or 
a sentence under 3553 that is lower than the guidelines, 
and here are the reasons:

Opinion of the Court 
"One,  he  is  a  vulnerable  defendant  because  he's  been involved  in  [government  criminal  justice]  work  which 

has  caused  people  to  become  convicted  criminals  who are in prison and there may be retribution against him. 

"Two, his military experience . . . ."   Id., at 64-65. 
Counsel agreed, while adding that Rita's poor physical condi-
tion  constituted  a  third  reason.  And  counsel  said  that  he rested his claim for a lower sentence on "[ j]ust [those] three" 

special  circumstances,  "[p]hysical  condition,  vulnerability  in prison and the military service." 

Id., at 65.  Rita presented 
evidence  and  argument  related  to  these  three  factors.  The Government, while not asking for a sentence higher than the 

report's recommended Guidelines range, said that Rita's per-
jury  had  interfered  with  the  Government's  potential  "ob-struction  of  justice"  claim  against  InterOrdnance  and  that 

Rita,  as  a  former  Government  criminal  justice  employee, should  have  known  better  than  to  commit  perjury. 

Id.,  at 
74-77.  The  sentencing  judge  asked  questions  about  each factor. 

After hearing the arguments, the judge concluded that he was "unable to find that the [report's recommended] sentenc-
ing  guideline  range  .  .  .  is  an  inappropriate  guideline  range for that, and under 3553 . . .  the  public needs to be protected 
if it is true, and I must accept as true the jury verdict."  Id., at  87.  The  court  concluded:  "So  the  Court  finds  that  it  is 
appropriate to enter" a sentence at the bottom of the Guide-
lines range, namely, a sentence of imprisonment "for a period of 33 months."

On  appeal,  Rita  argued  that  his  33-month  sentence  was 
"unreasonable" because (1) it did not adequately take account 
of  "the  defendant's  history  and  characteristics,"  and  (2)  it 
"is  greater  than  necessary  to  comply  with  the  purposes  of 
sentencing  set  forth  in  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)(2)."  Brief  for 
Appellant in No. 05-4674 (CA4), pp. i, 8.  The Fourth Circuit

observed  that  it  must  set  aside  a  sentence  that  is  not  "rea-
sonable."  The  Circuit  stated  that  "a  sentence  imposed 
within  the  properly  calculated  Guidelines  range  . . . is  pre-
sumptively  reasonable."  177  Fed.  Appx.,  at  358  (internal 
quotation  marks  and  citations  omitted).  It  added  that 
"while we believe that the appropriate circumstances for im-
posing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on 
the  facts  of  individual  cases,  we  have  no  reason  to  doubt 
that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable 
guideline  range."  The  Fourth  Circuit  then  rejected  Rita's 
arguments  and  upheld  the  sentence.  Ibid.  (internal  quota-
tion marks omitted). 

E 

Rita  petitioned  for  a  writ  of  certiorari.  He  pointed  out 
that  the  Circuits  are  split  as  to  the  use  of  a  presumption  of 
reasonableness  for  within-Guidelines  sentences.  Compare 
United  States  v.  Dorcely,  454  F.  3d  366,  376  (CADC  2006) 
(uses  presumption);  United  States  v.  Green,  436  F.  3d  449, 
457  (CA4  2006)  (same);  United  States  v.  Alonzo,  435  F.  3d 
551,  554  (CA5  2006)  (same);  United  States  v.  Williams,  436 
F. 3d 706, 708 (CA6 2006) (same); United States v.  Mykytiuk,

coln, 413 F. 3d 716, 717 (CA8 2005) (same); and United States

(same),  with  United  States  v.  Jimenez-Beltre,  440  F.  3d  514, 
518 (CA1 2006) (en banc) (does not use presumption); United 
States  v.  Fernandez,  443  F.  3d  19,  27  (CA2  2006)  (same);

(same); and United States v.  Talley, 431 F. 3d 784, 788 (CA11 
2005) (per curiam) (same). 

We  consequently  granted  Rita's  petition.  We  agreed  to 
decide whether a court of appeals may afford a "presumption 
of  reasonableness"  to  a  "within-Guidelines"  sentence.  We 
also  agreed  to  decide  whether  the  District  Court  properly 
analyzed the relevant sentencing factors and whether, given

Opinion of the Court 
the record, the District Court's ultimate choice of a 33-month sentence was "unreasonable." 

II 
The first question is whether a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence 

that  reflects  a  proper  application  of  the  Sentencing  Guide-lines.  We conclude that it can. 

A 
For  one  thing,  the  presumption  is  not  binding.  It  does not,  like  a  trial-related  evidentiary  presumption,  insist  that 

one side, or the other, shoulder a particular burden of persua-sion  or  proof  lest  they  lose  their  case.  Cf., 

e. g.,  Raytheon Co.  v.  Hernandez,  540  U. S.  44,  49-50,  n.  3  (2003)  (citing 

Reeves v.  Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 143 (2000), and McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.  Green, 411 U. S. 
792,  802  (1973)).  Nor  does  the  presumption  reflect  strong judicial  deference  of  the  kind  that  leads  appeals  courts  to 
grant greater factfinding leeway to an expert agency than to a  district  judge.  Rather,  the  presumption  reflects  the  fact 
that,  by  the  time  an  appeals  court  is  considering  a  within-Guidelines sentence on review, 

both the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission will have reached the same con-

clusion  as  to  the  proper  sentence  in  the  particular  case. That  double  determination  significantly  increases  the  likeli-
hood that the sentence is a reasonable one. Further,  the  presumption  reflects  the  nature  of  the 
Guidelines-writing  task  that  Congress  set  for  the  Commis-sion  and  the  manner  in  which  the  Commission  carried  out 
that task.  In instructing both the sentencing judge and the Commission what to do, Congress referred to the basic sen-
tencing  objectives  that  the  statute  sets  forth  in  18  U. S. C. $ 3553(a)  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  IV).  That  provision  tells  the 
sentencing judge to consider (1) offense and offender charac-teristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the basic aims 

551US1 Unit: $U67 [09-28-11 16:16:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
348  RITA  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
of  sentencing,  namely,  (a)  "just  punishment"  (retribution), (b)  deterrence,  (c)  incapacitation,  (d)  rehabilitation;  (3)  the 

sentences  legally  available;  (4)  the  Sentencing  Guidelines; (5) Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to 
avoid  unwarranted  disparities;  and  (7)  the  need  for  restitu-tion.  The  provision  also  tells  the  sentencing  judge  to  "im-
pose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to 
comply  with"  the  basic  aims  of  sentencing  as  set  out  above. Congressional statutes  then tell  the 

Commission  to write 
Guidelines  that  will  carry  out  these  same  $ 3553(a)  objec-tives.  Thus,  28  U. S. C.  $ 991(b)  indicates  that  one  of  the 

Commission's  basic  objectives  is  to  "assure  the  meeting  of 
the  purposes  of  sentencing  as  set  forth  in  [$ 3553(a)(2)]." 
The  provision  adds  that  the  Commission  must  seek  to  "pro-
vide certainty and fairness" in sentencing, to "avoi[d] unwar-
ranted  sentencing  disparities,"  to  "maintai[n]  sufficient  flex-
ibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by 
mitigating  or  aggravating  factors  not  taken  into  account  in 
the  establishment  of  general  sentencing  practices,"  and  to 
"reflect,  to  the  extent  practicable,  [sentencing-relevant]  ad-
vancement  in  [the]  knowledge  of  human  behavior."  Later 
provisions  specifically  instruct  the  Commission  to  write  the 
Guidelines with reference to this statement of purposes, the 
statement  that  itself  refers  to  $ 3553(a).  See  28  U. S. C. 

$$ 994(f), 994(m). 

The  upshot  is  that  the  sentencing  statutes  envision  both 
the sentencing judge and the Commission as carrying out the 
same  basic  $ 3553(a)  objectives,  the  one,  at  retail,  the  other 
at wholesale. 

The Commission has made a serious, sometimes controver-
sial,  effort  to  carry  out  this  mandate.  The  Commission,  in 
describing  its  Guidelines-writing  efforts,  refers  to  these 
same  statutory  provisions.  It  says  that  it  has  tried  to  em-
body  in  the  Guidelines  the  factors  and  considerations  set 
forth  in  $ 3553(a).  The  Commission's  introductory  state-
ment recognizes that Congress "foresees guidelines that will

Opinion of the Court 
further  the  basic  purposes  of  criminal  punishment,  i. e.,  de-terring  crime,  incapacitating  the  offender,  providing  just 

punishment, and rehabilitating the offender."  USSG $ 1A1.1, intro.  to  comment.,  pt.  A,  || 2  (The  Statutory  Mission).  It 
adds  that  Congress  "sought  uniformity  in  sentencing  by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed by differ-
ent  federal  courts  for  similar  criminal  conduct,"  as  well  as 
"proportionality  in  sentencing  through  a  system  that  im-poses appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct 

of  different  severity."  Id.,  || 3,  at  2  (The  Basic  Approach). The  Guidelines  commentary  explains  how,  despite  consid-
erable  disagreement  within  the  criminal  justice  community, 
the  Commission  has  gone  about  writing  Guidelines  that  it 
intends  to  embody  these  ends.  It  says,  for  example,  that 
the  goals  of  uniformity  and  proportionality  often  conflict. 
The commentary describes the difficulties involved in devel-
oping  a  practical  sentencing  system  that  sensibly  reconciles 
the  two  ends.  It  adds  that  a  "philosophical  problem  arose 
when  the  Commission  attempted  to  reconcile  the  differing 
perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment."  Some 
would  emphasize  moral  culpability  and  "just  punishment"; 
others  would  emphasize  the  need  for  "crime  control. " 
Rather than choose among differing practical and philosophi-
cal objectives, the Commission took an "empirical approach," 
beginning  with  an  empirical  examination  of  10,000  presen-
tence reports setting forth what judges had done in the past 
and then  modifying and adjusting past practice in the  inter-
ests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying 
with  congressional  instructions,  and  the  like.  Id.,  || 3,  at  3.  

The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sentenc-
ing Commission examined tens of thousands of sentences and 
worked with the help of many others in the law enforcement 
community  over  a  long  period  of  time  in  an  effort  to  fulfill 
this  statutory  mandate.  They  also  reflect  the  fact  that  dif-
ferent judges (and others) can differ as to how best to recon-
cile the disparate ends of punishment.

350  RITA  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
The Commission's work is  ongoing.  The statutes and the Guidelines  themselves  foresee  continuous  evolution  helped 

by  the  sentencing  courts  and  courts of  appeals  in  that  proc-ess.  The sentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in indi-
vidual  cases,  may  depart  (either  pursuant  to  the  Guidelines or,  since 

Booker,  by  imposing  a  non-Guidelines  sentence). 
The  judges  will  set  forth  their  reasons.  The  courts  of  ap-
peals will determine the reasonableness of the resulting sen-tence.  The Commission will collect and examine the results. 

In  doing  so,  it  may  obtain  advice  from  prosecutors,  defend-ers,  law  enforcement  groups,  civil  liberties  associations,  ex-
perts in penology, and others.  And it can revise the Guide-
lines accordingly.  See generally 28 U. S. C. $ 994(p) and note 
following $ 994 (Commission should review and amend Guide-
lines  as  necessary,  and  Congress  has  power  to  revoke  or 
amend Guidelines); Mistretta v.  United States, 488 U. S. 361, 
393-394  (1989);  USSG  $ 1B1.10(c)  (listing  24  amendments 
promulgated  in  response  to  evolving  sentencing  concerns); 
USSG $ 1A1.1, comment. 

The  result  is  a  set  of  Guidelines  that  seek  to  embody  the 

$ 3553(a)  considerations,  both  in  principle  and  in  practice. 
Given the difficulties of doing so, the abstract and potentially 
conflicting nature of $ 3553(a)'s general sentencing objectives, 
and  the  differences  of  philosophical  view  among  those  who 
work  within  the  criminal  justice  community  as  to  how  best 
to  apply  general  sentencing  objectives,  it  is  fair  to  assume 
that  the  Guidelines,  insofar  as  practicable,  reflect  a  rough 
approximation  of  sentences  that  might  achieve  $ 3553(a)'s 
objectives. 

An  individual  judge  who  imposes  a  sentence  within  the 
range recommended by the Guidelines thus makes a decision 
that  is  fully  consistent  with  the  Commission's  judgment  in 
general.  Despite  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
stance  that  when  the  judge's  discretionary  decision  accords 
with the Commission's view of the appropriate application of 

$ 3553(a)  in  the  mine  run  of  cases,  it  is  probable  that  the 
sentence is reasonable.  Indeed, even the Circuits that have 
declined  to  adopt  a  formal  presumption  also  recognize  that 
a  Guidelines  sentence  will  usually  be  reasonable,  because  it 
reflects  both  the  Commission's  and  the  sentencing  court's 
judgment  as  to  what  is  an  appropriate  sentence  for  a  given 
offender.  See Fernandez, 443 F. 3d, at 27; Cooper, 437 F. 3d, 
at 331; Talley, 431 F. 3d, at 788. 

We  repeat  that  the  presumption  before  us  is  an  appellate 
court  presumption.  Given  our  explanation  in  Booker  that 
appellate  "reasonableness"  review  merely  asks  whether  the 
trial  court  abused  its  discretion,  the  presumption  applies 
only on appellate review.  The sentencing judge, as a matter 
of  process,  will  normally  begin  by  considering  the  presen-
tence  report  and  its  interpretation  of  the  Guidelines.  18 
U. S. C.  $ 3552(a);  Fed.  Rule  Crim.  Proc.  32.  He  may  hear 
arguments  by  prosecution  or  defense  that  the  Guidelines 
sentence  should  not  apply,  perhaps  because  (as  the  Guide-
lines  themselves  foresee)  the  case  at  hand  falls  outside  the 
"heartland"  to  which  the  Commission  intends  individual 
Guidelines  to  apply,  USSG  $ 5K2.0,  perhaps  because  the 
Guidelines  sentence  itself  fails  properly  to  reflect  $ 3553(a) 
considerations,  or  perhaps  because  the  case  warrants  a  dif-
ferent  sentence  regardless,  see  Rule  32(f ).  Thus,  the  sen-
tencing  court  subjects  the  defendant's  sentence  to  the  thor-
ough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing 
procedure.  See  Rules  32(f ),  (h),  (i)(1)(C),  and  (i)(1)(D);  see 
also Burns v.  United States, 501 U. S. 129, 136 (1991) (recog-
nizing  importance  of  notice  and  meaningful  opportunity  to 
be heard at sentencing).  In determining the merits of these 
arguments,  the  sentencing  court  does  not  enjoy  the  benefit 
of  a  legal  presumption  that  the  Guidelines  sentence  should 
apply.  Booker, 543 U. S., at 259-260.

352  RITA  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Rita  and  his  supporting  amici  make  two  further  argu-ments  against  use  of  the  presumption.  First,  Rita  points 

out  that  many  individual  Guidelines  apply  higher  sentences in  the  presence  of  special  facts,  for  example,  brandishing 
a  weapon.  In  many  cases,  the  sentencing  judge,  not  the jury,  will  determine  the  existence  of  those  facts.  A  proGuidelines "presumption of reasonableness" will increase the likelihood  that  courts  of  appeals  will  affirm  such  sentences, 
thereby increasing the likelihood that sentencing judges will impose such sentences.  For that reason, Rita says, the pre-
sumption  raises  Sixth  Amendment  "concerns."  Brief  for Petitioner 28. 

In our view, however, the presumption, even if it increases the likelihood that the judge, not the jury, will find "sentenc-
ing  facts,"  does  not  violate  the  Sixth  Amendment.  This Court's  Sixth  Amendment  cases  do  not  automatically  forbid 
a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not de-termined  by  a  jury  and  to  increase  the  sentence  in  conse-
quence.  Nor  do  they  prohibit  the  sentencing  judge  from taking  account  of  the  Sentencing  Commission's  factual  find-
ings or recommended sentences.  See Cunningham  v.  Cali-
fornia,  549  U. S.  270,  281-282  (2007)  (citing  Booker,  supra, at  243-244;  Blakely  v.  Washington,  542  U. S.  296,  304- 

305  (2004);  Ring  v.  Arizona,  536  U. S.  584,  602  (2002);  and Apprendi v.  New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 471 (2000)). 

The  Sixth  Amendment  question,  the  Court  has  said,  is whether  the  law  forbids  a  judge  to  increase  a  defendant's 
sentence  unless  the  judge  finds  facts  that  the  jury  did  not find  (and  the  offender  did  not  concede).  Blakely,  supra,  at 
303-304  ("When  a  judge  inflicts  punishment  that  the  jury's verdict  alone  does  not  allow,  the  jury  has  not  found  all  the 
facts  which  the  law  makes  essential  to  the  punishment  and the  judge  exceeds  his  proper  authority"  (internal  quotation 
marks  and  citation  omitted));  see  Cunningham,  supra,  at 283-284 (discussing 

Blakely) ("The judge could not have sen-

Opinion of the Court 
tenced Blakely above the standard range without finding the additional fact of deliberate cruelty," "[b]ecause the judge in 

Blakely's case could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of 
that range . . . was the relevant" maximum sentence for Sixth Amendment  purposes); 

Booker,  543  U. S.,  at  244  ("Any  fact 
(other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support 
a  sentence  exceeding  the  maximum  authorized  by  the  facts established  by  a  plea  of  guilty  or  a  jury  verdict  must  be 

admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a rea-sonable  doubt"); 

id.,  at  232  (discussing  Blakely)  ("We  re-
jected  the  State's  argument  that  the  jury  verdict  was  suffi-
cient  to  authorize  a  sentence  within  the  general  10-year 
sentence  for  class  B  felonies,  noting  that  under  Washington 
law,  the  judge  was  required  to  find  additional  facts  in  order 
to  impose  the  greater  90-month  sentence"  (emphasis  in 
original)). 

A nonbinding appellate presumption that a Guidelines sen-
tence is reasonable does not require the  sentencing judge to 
impose that sentence.  Still less does it prohibit the sentenc-
ing  judge  from  imposing  a  sentence  higher  than  the  Guide-
lines  provide  for  the  jury-determined  facts  standing  alone. 
As  far  as  the  law  is  concerned,  the  judge  could  disregard 
the Guidelines and apply the same sentence (higher than the 
statutory  minimum or  the  bottom  of the  unenhanced  Guide-
lines range) in the absence of the special facts (say, gun bran-
dishing)  which,  in  the  view  of  the  Sentencing  Commission, 
would warrant a higher sentence within the statutorily per-
missible  range.  Thus,  our  Sixth  Amendment  cases  do  not 
forbid appellate court use of the presumption.

adopt  a  presumption  of  unreasonableness.  Even  the  Gov-ernment  concedes  that  appellate  courts  may  not  presume 

that  every  variance  from  the  advisory  Guidelines  is  unrea-sonable.  See Brief for United States 34-35.  Several courts 
of appeals have also rejected a presumption of unreasonable-ness.  See, 

e. g., United States v.  Howard, 454 F. 3d 700, 703 
(CA7  2006);  United  States  v.  Matheny,  450  F.  3d  633,  642 
(CA6 2006); United States v.  Myers, 439 F. 3d 415, 417 (CA8 2006); 

United  States  v.  Moreland,  437  F.  3d  424,  433  (CA4 
2006).  However, a number of Circuits adhere to the proposi-tion  that  the  strength  of  the  justification  needed  to  sustain 

an  outside-Guidelines  sentence  varies  in  proportion  to  the 
degree  of  the  variance.  See,  e. g.,  United  States  v.  Smith, 
445  F.  3d  1,  4  (CA1  2006);  Moreland,  supra,  at  434;  United 
States v.  Armendariz, 451 F. 3d 352, 358 (CA5 2006); United

469  F.  3d  896,  907  (CA10  2006);  United  States  v.  Crisp,  454 
F.  3d  1285,  1291-1292  (CA11  2006).  We  will  consider  that 
approach  next  Term  in  Gall  v.  United  States,  No.  06-7949, 
cert. granted, post, p. 1113. 

Second,  Rita  and  his  amici  claim  that  use  of  a  proGuidelines  presumption  on  appeal  conflicts  with  Congress' 
insistence  that sentencing judges apply the  factors set  forth 
in  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV)  (and  that  the  re-
sulting  sentence  be  "sufficient,  but  not  greater  than  neces-
sary, to comply with the purposes" of sentencing set forth in 
that  statute).  We  have  explained  above,  however,  why  we 
believe  that,  where  judge  and  Commission  both  determine 
that  the  Guidelines  sentence  is  an  appropriate  sentence  for 
the  case  at  hand,  that  sentence  likely  reflects  the  $ 3553(a) 
factors  (including  its  "not  greater  than  necessary"  require-
ment).  See supra, at 348.  This circumstance alleviates any 
serious general conflict between $ 3553(a) and the Guidelines, 
for  the  purposes  of  appellate  review.  And,  for  that  reason,

356  RITA  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
we find that nothing in $ 3553(a) renders use of the presump-tion unlawful. 

III 
We  next  turn  to  the  question  whether  the  District  Court properly  analyzed  the  relevant  sentencing  factors.  In  par-

ticular,  Rita  argues  that  the  court  took  inadequate  account of  $ 3553(c)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV),  a  provision  that  requires  a 
sentencing  judge,  "at  the  time  of  sentencing,"  to  "state  in open  court  the  reasons  for  its  imposition  of  the  particular 
sentence."  In  our  view,  given  the  straightforward,  concep-tually simple  arguments  before the  judge, the  judge's  state-
ment of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient. The statute does call for the judge to "state" his "reasons." 
And  that  requirement  reflects  sound  judicial  practice.  Ju-dicial  decisions  are  reasoned  decisions.  Confidence  in  a 
judge's use of reason underlies the public's trust in the judi-cial  institution.  A  public  statement  of  those  reasons  helps 
provide the public with the assurance that creates that trust. That  said,  we  cannot  read  the  statute  (or  our  precedent) 
as insisting upon a full opinion in every case.  The appropri-ateness  of  brevity  or  length,  conciseness  or  detail,  when  to 
write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.  Sometimes a  judicial  opinion  responds  to  every  argument;  sometimes 
it  does  not;  sometimes  a  judge  simply  writes  the  word "granted"  or  "denied"  on  the  face  of  a  motion  while  relying 
upon  context  and  the  parties'  prior  arguments  to  make  the reasons  clear.  The  law  leaves  much,  in  this  respect,  to  the 
judge's own professional judgment. In  the  present  context,  a  statement  of  reasons  is  impor-
tant.  The  sentencing  judge  should  set  forth  enough  to  sat-isfy  the  appellate  court  that  he  has  considered  the  parties' 
arguments  and  has  a  reasoned  basis  for  exercising  his  own legal  decisionmaking  authority.  See, 

e. g.,  United  States  v. 
Taylor, 487  U. S.  326,  336-337  (1988).  Nonetheless,  when  a judge  decides  simply  to  apply  the  Guidelines  to  a  particular 

case,  doing  so  will  not  necessarily  require  lengthy  explana-

Opinion of the Court 
tion.  Circumstances  may  well  make  clear  that  the  judge rests his decision upon the Commission's own reasoning that 

the  Guidelines  sentence  is  a  proper  sentence  (in  terms  of $ 3553(a)  and  other  congressional  mandates)  in  the  typical 
case,  and  that  the  judge  has  found  that  the  case  before  him is  typical.  Unless  a  party  contests  the  Guidelines  sentence 
generally under $ 3553(a)--that is, argues that the Guidelines 
reflect  an  unsound  judgment,  or,  for  example,  that  they  do not  generally  treat  certain  defendant  characteristics  in  the 

proper  way--or  argues  for  departure,  the  judge  normally need say no more.  Cf. $ 3553(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  (Al-
though, often at sentencing a judge will speak at length to a 
defendant,  and  this  practice  may  indeed  serve  a  salutary 
purpose.) 

Where  the  defendant  or  prosecutor  presents  nonfrivolous 
reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge 
will  normally  go  further  and  explain  why  he  has  rejected 
those arguments.  Sometimes the circumstances will call for 
a  brief  explanation;  sometimes  they  will  call  for  a  lengthier 
explanation.  Where  the  judge  imposes  a  sentence  outside 
the  Guidelines,  the  judge  will  explain  why  he  has  done  so. 
To our knowledge, an ordinary explanation of judicial reasons 
as  to  why  the  judge  has,  or  has  not,  applied  the  Guidelines 
triggers  no  Sixth  Amendment  "jury  trial"  requirement. 
Cf.  Booker,  543  U. S.,  at  233  ("For  when  a  trial  judge  exer-
cises  his  discretion  to  select  a  specific  sentence  within  a  de-
fined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determina-
tion  of the  facts  that  the  judge deems  relevant"),  and  id.,  at 
242  (requirement  of  finding,  not  articulation  of  it,  creates 
Sixth Amendment problem). 

By articulating reasons, even if brief, the sentencing judge 
not  only  assures  reviewing  courts  (and  the  public)  that  the 
sentencing  process  is a  reasoned  process  but also  helps  that 
process  evolve.  The  sentencing  judge  has  access  to,  and 
greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individ-
ual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals

Opinion of the Court 
court.  That  being  so,  his  reasoned  sentencing  judgment, resting upon an effort to filter the Guidelines' general advice 

through $ 3553(a)'s list of factors, can provide relevant infor-mation  to  both  the  court  of  appeals  and  ultimately  the  Sen-
tencing  Commission.  The  reasoned  responses  of  these  lat-ter  institutions  to  the  sentencing  judge's  explanation  should 
help  the  Guidelines  constructively  evolve  over  time,  as 
both  Congress  and  the  Commission  foresaw.  See  generally 
supra, at 351. 

In  the  present  case  the  sentencing  judge's  statement  of reasons  was  brief  but  legally  sufficient.  Rita  argued  for  a 

downward  departure  from  the  33-to-41  month  Guidelines 
sentence  on  the  basis  of  three  sets  of  special  circumstances: 
health,  fear  of  retaliation  in  prison,  and  military  record. 
See  App.  40-47.  He  added  that,  in  any  event,  these  same 
circumstances warrant leniency beyond that contemplated by 
the Guidelines. 

The record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened 
to each argument.  The judge considered the supporting evi-
dence.  The  judge  was  fully  aware  of  defendant's  various 
physical  ailments  and  imposed  a  sentence  that  takes  them 
into  account.  The  judge  understood  that  Rita  had  pre-
viously  worked  in  the  immigration  service  where  he  had 
been  involved  in  detecting  criminal  offenses.  And  he  con-
sidered  Rita's  lengthy  military  service,  including  over  25 
years of service, both on active duty and in the Reserve, and 
Rita's receipt of 35 medals, awards, and nominations. 

The  judge  then  simply  found  these  circumstances  insuffi-
cient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range 
of 33 to 45 months.  Id., at 87.  He said that this range was 
not "inappropriate."  (This, of course, is not the legal stand-
ard for imposition of sentence, but taken in context it is plain 
that  the  judge  so  understood.)  He  immediately  added  that 
he  found  that  the  33-month  sentence  at  the  bottom  of  the 
Guidelines  range  was  "appropriate."  Ibid.  He  must  have 
believed that there was not much more to say.

Opinion of the Court 
We acknowledge that the judge might have said more.  He might have added explicitly that he had heard and considered 

the  evidence  and  argument;  that  (as  no  one  before  him  de-nied) he thought the Commission in the Guidelines had deter-
mined a sentence that was proper in the mine run of roughly similar perjury cases; and that he found that Rita's personal 
circumstances here were simply not different enough to war-rant a different sentence.  But context and the record make 
clear  that  this,  or  similar,  reasoning  underlies  the  judge's conclusion.  Where  a  matter  is  as  conceptually  simple  as  in 
the case at hand and the record makes clear that the sentenc-ing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not 
believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively. 

IV 
We  turn  to  the  final  question:  Was  the  Court  of  Appeals, after  applying  its  presumption,  legally  correct  in  holding 

that  Rita's  sentence  (a  sentence  that  applied,  and  did  not depart from, the relevant Sentencing Guideline) was not "un-
reasonable"?  In our  view, the  Court  of  Appeals' conclusion was lawful. 

As  we  previously  said,  see  Part  I,  supra,  the  crimes  at issue  are  perjury  and  obstruction  of  justice.  In  essence 
those offenses involved the making of knowingly false, mate-rial  statements  under  oath  before  a  grand  jury,  thereby  im-
peding  its  criminal  investigation.  The  Guidelines  provide for  a  typical  such  offense  a  base  offense  level  of  20,  6  lev-
els  below  the  level  provided  for  a  simple  violation  of  the crime  being  investigated  (here,  the  unlawful  importation  of 
machineguns).  The  offender,  Rita,  has  no  countable  prior offenses  and  consequently  falls  within  criminal  history 
category  I.  The  intersection  of  base  offense  level  20  and criminal  history  category  I  sets  forth  a  sentencing  range  of 
imprisonment of 33 to 41 months. Rita  argued at sentencing  that  his  circumstances are  spe-
cial.  He  based  this  argument  upon  his  health,  his  fear  of

the school and directed his banner toward the school, making it plainly 
visible to most students.  Under these circumstances, Frederick cannot 
claim he was not at school.  Pp. 400-401. 

(b)  The  Court  agrees  with Morse  that  those who  viewed  the  banner 
would interpret it as advocating or promoting illegal drug use, in viola-
tion  of  school  policy.  At  least  two  interpretations  of  the  banner's 
words--that  they  constitute  an  imperative  encouraging  viewers  to 
smoke  marijuana  or,  alternatively,  that  they  celebrate  drug  use--dem-
onstrate that the sign promoted such use.  This pro-drug interpretation 
gains  further  plausibility  from  the  paucity  of  alternative  meanings  the 
banner might bear.  Pp. 401-403. 

(c)  A  principal  may,  consistent  with  the  First  Amendment,  restrict 
student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed 
as  promoting  illegal  drug  use.  In  Tinker  v.  Des  Moines  Independent 
Community  School  Dist., 393  U. S.  503,  the  Court  declared,  in  holding 
that  a  policy  prohibiting  high  school  students  from  wearing  antiwar 
armbands  violated  the  First  Amendment,  id.,  at  504,  that  student  ex-
pression  may  not  be  suppressed  unless  school  officials  reasonably  con-
clude  that  it  will  "materially  and  substantially  disrupt  the  work  and 
discipline of  the school," id.,  at 513.  The Court  in Bethel  School  Dist. 
No.  403  v.  Fraser,  478  U. S.  675,  however,  upheld  the  suspension  of  a 
student  who  delivered  a  high  school  assembly  speech  employing  "an 
elaborate,  graphic,  and  explicit  sexual  metaphor,"  id.,  at  678.  Analyz-
ing  the  case  under  Tinker,  the  lower  courts  had  found  no  disruption, 
and therefore no basis for discipline.  478 U. S., at 679-680.  This Court 
reversed,  holding that  the school  was "within  its  permissible  authority 
in imposing sanctions . . . in response to [the student's] offensively lewd 
and  indecent  speech."  Id.,  at  685.  Two  basic  principles  may  be  dis-
tilled  from  Fraser.  First,  it  demonstrates  that  "the  constitutional 
rights  of  students  in  public  school  are  not  automatically  coextensive 
with  the  rights  of  adults  in  other  settings."  Id.,  at  682.  Had  Fraser 
delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context, 
he  would  have  been  protected.  See  id.,  at  682-683.  In  school,  how-
ever,  his  First  Amendment  rights  were  circumscribed  "in  light  of  the 
special  characteristics  of  the  school  environment."  Tinker,  supra,  at 
506.  Second,  Fraser  established  that  Tinker's  mode  of  analysis  is  not 
absolute, since the Fraser Court did not conduct the "substantial disrup-
tion" analysis.  Subsequently, the Court has held in the Fourth Amend-
ment context that "while children assuredly do not `shed their constitu-
tional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate,' . . . the nature of those rights 
is what is appropriate for children in school," Vernonia School Dist. 47J 
v.  Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 655-656, and has recognized that deterring drug 
use  by  schoolchildren  is  an  "important--indeed,  perhaps  compelling"

interest,  id.,  at  661.  Drug  abuse  by  the  Nation's  youth  is  a  serious 
problem.  For  example,  Congress  has  declared  that  part  of  a  school's 
job is educating students about the dangers of drug abuse, see, e. g., the 
Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994, and petition-
ers and many other schools have adopted policies aimed at implementing 
this  message.  Student  speech  celebrating  illegal  drug  use  at  a  school 
event,  in  the  presence  of  school  administrators  and  teachers,  poses  a 
particular  challenge  for  school  officials  working  to  protect  those  en-
trusted to their care.  The "special characteristics of the school environ-
ment," Tinker, 393 U. S., at 506, and the governmental interest in stop-
ping  student  drug  abuse  allow  schools  to  restrict  student  expression 
that they reasonably regard as promoting such abuse.  Id., at 508, 509,

trusted to their  care from  speech that can reasonably  be re-garded  as  encouraging  illegal  drug  use.  We  conclude  that 
the  school  officials  in  this  case  did  not  violate  the  First Amendment  by  confiscating  the  pro-drug  banner  and  sus-

I 
On  January  24,  2002,  the  Olympic  Torch  Relay  passed through  Juneau,  Alaska,  on  its  way  to  the  winter  games  in 

Salt  Lake  City,  Utah.  The  torchbearers  were  to  proceed along  a  street  in  front  of  Juneau-Douglas  High  School 
(JDHS)  while  school  was  in  session.  Petitioner  Deborah Morse,  the  school  principal,  decided  to  permit  staff  and  stu-
dents to participate in the Torch Relay as an approved social event  or  class  trip.  App.  22-23.  Students  were  allowed 
to  leave  class  to  observe  the  relay  from  either  side  of  the street.  Teachers  and  administrative  officials  monitored  the 
students' actions. Respondent  Joseph  Frederick, a  JDHS senior, was late  to 
school that day.  When he arrived, he joined  his friends (all but one of whom were JDHS students) across the street from 
the  school  to  watch  the  event.  Not  all  the  students  waited patiently.  Some became rambunctious, throwing plastic cola 
bottles  and  snowballs  and  scuffling  with  their  classmates. As the  torchbearers and camera crews passed by, Frederick 
and his friends unfurled a 14-foot banner bearing the phrase: "BONG  HiTS  4  JESUS."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  70a.  The 
large  banner  was  easily  readable  by  the  students  on  the other side of the street.

398  MORSE  v.  FREDERICK 

Opinion of the Court 
Principal  Morse  immediately  crossed  the  street  and  de-manded  that  the  banner  be  taken  down.  Everyone  but 

Frederick  complied.  Morse confiscated the banner  and told Frederick  to  report  to  her  office,  where  she  suspended  him 
for  10  days.  Morse  later  explained  that  she  told  Frederick to  take  the  banner  down  because  she  thought  it  encouraged 
illegal  drug  use,  in  violation  of  established  school  policy. Juneau School Board Policy No. 5520 states: "The Board spe-
cifically  prohibits  any  assembly  or  public  expression  that .  .  .  advocates  the  use  of  substances  that  are  illegal  to 
minors . . . ."   Id., at 53a.  In addition, Juneau School Board Policy  No.  5850  subjects  "[p]upils  who  participate  in  ap-
proved  social  events  and  class  trips"  to  the  same  student conduct rules that apply during the regular school program. 
Id., at 58a. Frederick  administratively  appealed  his  suspension,  but 
the Juneau School District Superintendent upheld it, limiting it  to  time  served  (eight  days).  In  a  memorandum  setting 
forth his reasons, the superintendent determined that Fred-erick  had  displayed  his  banner  "in  the  midst  of  his  fellow 
students,  during  school  hours,  at  a  school-sanctioned  activ-ity."  Id., at 63a.  He further explained that Frederick "was 
not disciplined because the principal of the school `disagreed' with  his  message,  but  because  his  speech  appeared to  advo-
cate the use of illegal drugs."  Id., at 61a. The superintendent continued: 

"The common-sense understanding of the  phrase `bong hits' is that it is a reference to a means of smoking 
marijuana.  Given  [Frederick's]  inability  or  unwilling-ness  to  express  any  other  credible  meaning  for  the 
phrase, I can only agree with the principal and countless others who saw the banner as advocating the use of ille-
gal  drugs.  [Frederick's]  speech  was  not  political.  He was not advocating the legalization of marijuana or pro-
moting  a  religious  belief.  He  was  displaying  a  fairly silly message promoting illegal drug  usage in the  midst

Opinion of the Court 
of a  school activity, for the benefit of television cameras covering the Torch Relay.  [Frederick's] speech was po-

tentially  disruptive  to  the  event  and  clearly  disruptive of and inconsistent with the school's educational mission 
to  educate  students  about  the  dangers  of  illegal  drugs and to discourage their use." 

Id., at 61a-62a. 

Relying on our decision in Fraser, supra, the superintendent concluded  that  the  principal's  actions  were  permissible  be-

cause Frederick's banner was "speech or action that intrudes upon  the  work  of  the  schools."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  62a 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  The Juneau School Dis-trict Board of Education upheld the suspension. 

Frederick  then  filed  suit  under  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983,  alleging that  the  school  board  and  Morse  had  violated  his  First 
Amendment  rights.  He  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, 
and  attorney's  fees.  The  District  Court  granted  summary judgment  for  the  school  board  and  Morse,  ruling  that  they 
were  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  and  that  they  had  not infringed  Frederick's  First  Amendment  rights.  The  court 
found  that  Morse  reasonably  interpreted  the  banner  as promoting  illegal  drug  use--a  message  that  "directly  con-
travened  the  Board's  policies  relating  to  drug  abuse  pre-vention."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  36a-38a.  Under  the 
circumstances, the court held that "Morse had the authority, if  not  the  obligation,  to  stop  such  messages  at  a  school-
sanctioned activity."  Id., at 37a. The  Ninth  Circuit  reversed.  Deciding  that  Frederick 
acted  during  a  "school-authorized  activit[y],"  and  "pro-ceed[ing]  on  the  basis  that  the  banner  expressed  a  positive 
sentiment about marijuana use," the court nonetheless found a  violation  of  Frederick's  First  Amendment  rights  because 
the  school  punished  Frederick  without  demonstrating  that his  speech  gave  rise  to  a  "risk  of  substantial  disruption." 
439  F.  3d  1114,  1118,  1121-1123  (2006).  The  court  further concluded  that  Frederick's  right  to  display  his  banner  was

Opinion of the Court 
so "clearly established" that a reasonable principal in Morse's position would have understood that her actions were uncon-

stitutional,  and  that  Morse  was  therefore  not  entitled  to qualified immunity.  Id., at 1123-1125. 

We  granted  certiorari  on  two  questions:  whether  Freder-ick had a First Amendment right to wield his banner, and, if 
so,  whether  that  right  was  so  clearly  established  that  the principal  may  be  held  liable  for  damages.  549  U. S.  1075 
(2006).  We resolve the first question against Frederick, and therefore have no occasion to reach the second.

1 

II 
At the outset, we reject Frederick's argument that this is not  a  school  speech  case--as  has  every  other  authority  to 

address  the  question.  See  App.  22-23  (Principal  Morse); App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a (superintendent); 

id., at 69a (school board); 
id.,  at  34a-35a  (District  Court);  439  F.  3d,  at  1117 (Ninth  Circuit).  The  event  occurred  during  normal  school 

hours.  It  was  sanctioned  by  Principal  Morse  "as  an  ap-proved social event or class trip," App. 22-23, and the school 
district's  rules  expressly  provide  that  pupils  in  "approved social  events  and  class  trips  are  subject  to  district  rules  for

Opinion of the Court 
student  conduct,"  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  58a.  Teachers  and administrators  were  interspersed  among  the  students  and 

charged  with  supervising  them.  The  high  school  band  and cheerleaders  performed.  Frederick,  standing  among  other 
JDHS  students  across  the  street  from  the  school,  directed his  banner  toward  the  school,  making  it  plainly  visible  to 
most  students.  Under  these  circumstances,  we  agree  with the superintendent that Frederick cannot "stand in the midst 
of  his  fellow  students,  during  school  hours,  at  a  school-sanctioned  activity  and  claim  he  is  not  at  school." 

Id.,  at 63a.  There  is  some  uncertainty  at  the  outer  boundaries  as 

to  when  courts  should  apply  school  speech  precedents,  see 
Porter  v.  Ascension  Parish  School  Bd.,  393  F.  3d  608,  615, n. 22 (CA5 2004), but not on these facts. 

III 
The  message  on  Frederick's  banner  is  cryptic.  It  is  no doubt offensive to some, perhaps amusing to others.  To still 

others, it probably means nothing at all.  Frederick himself claimed "that the words were just nonsense meant to attract 
television cameras."  439 F. 3d, at 1117-1118.  But Principal Morse  thought  the  banner  would  be  interpreted  by  those 
viewing it as promoting illegal drug use, and that interpreta-tion is plainly a reasonable one. 

As  Morse  later  explained  in  a  declaration,  when  she  saw the  sign,  she  thought  that  "the  reference  to  a  `bong  hit' 
would  be  widely  understood  by  high  school  students  and others  as  referring  to  smoking  marijuana."  App.  24.  She 
further  believed  that  "display  of  the  banner  would  be  con-strued  by  students,  District  personnel,  parents  and  others 
witnessing  the  display  of  the  banner,  as  advocating  or  pro-moting  illegal  drug  use"--in  violation  of  school  policy. 

Id., at  25; see  ibid.  ("I told  Frederick and  the  other members  of 

his  group  to  put  the  banner  down  because  I  felt  that  it  vio-lated the  [school] policy  against  displaying .  . . material that 
advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs").

402  MORSE  v.  FREDERICK 

Opinion of the Court 
We agree with Morse.  At least two interpretations of the words  on  the  banner  demonstrate  that  the  sign  advocated 

the  use  of  illegal  drugs.  First,  the  phrase  could  be  inter-preted as an imperative: "[Take] bong hits . . . "--a message 
equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to "smoke marijuana"  or  "use  an  illegal  drug."  Alternatively,  the 
phrase could be viewed as celebrating  drug use--"bong hits 
[are a good thing]," or "[we take] bong hits"--and we discern no  meaningful  distinction  between  celebrating  illegal  drug 

use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion.  See 

Guiles v.  Marineau, 461 F. 3d 320, 328 (CA2 
2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as 
"a clearly pro-drug banner"). 

The  pro-drug  interpretation  of  the  banner  gains  further 
plausibility  given  the  paucity  of  alternative  meanings  the 
banner might bear.  The best Frederick can come up with is 
that  the  banner  is  "meaningless  and  funny."  439  F.  3d,  at 
1116.  The  dissent  similarly  refers  to  the  sign's  message  as 
"curious," post, at 434 (opinion of Stevens,

Opinion of the Court 
that the  banner is political speech.  But not even Frederick argues  that  the  banner  conveys  any  sort  of  political  or  reli-

gious  message.  Contrary  to  the  dissent's  suggestion,  see post, at 446-448, this is  plainly not  a  case about political de-
bate over the criminalization of drug use or possession. 

IV 
The  question  thus  becomes  whether  a  principal  may,  con-sistent  with  the  First  Amendment,  restrict  student  speech 

at  a  school  event,  when  that  speech  is  reasonably  viewed  as promoting illegal drug use.  We hold that she may. 

In  Tinker,  this  Court  made  clear  that  "First  Amendment rights,  applied  in  light  of  the  special  characteristics  of  the 
school environment, are available to teachers and students." 393  U. S.,  at  506.  Tinker  involved  a  group  of  high  school 
students who decided to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam  War.  School  officials  learned  of  the  plan  and  then 
adopted  a  policy  prohibiting  students  from  wearing  arm-bands.  When  several  students  nonetheless  wore  armbands 
to  school,  they  were  suspended.  Id.,  at  504.  The  students sued,  claiming  that  their  First  Amendment  rights  had  been 
violated, and this Court agreed. Tinker  held  that  student  expression  may  not  be  sup-
pressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will "materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline 
of  the  school."  Id.,  at  513.  The  essential  facts  of  Tinker are quite stark, implicating concerns at the heart of the First 
Amendment.  The  students  sought  to  engage  in  political speech, using  the  armbands  to express  their  "disapproval of 
the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others 
to  adopt  them."  Id.,  at  514.  Political  speech,  of  course,  is "at  the  core  of  what  the  First  Amendment  is  designed  to 
protect."  Virginia  v.  Black,  538  U. S.  343,  365  (2003)  (plu-rality  opinion).  The  only  interest  the  Court  discerned  un-
derlying  the  school's  actions  was  the  "mere  desire  to  avoid

404  MORSE  v.  FREDERICK 

Opinion of the Court 
the  discomfort  and  unpleasantness  that  always  accompany an  unpopular  viewpoint,"  or  "an  urgent  wish  to  avoid  the 

controversy which might result from the expression."  Tin-
ker,  393  U. S.,  at  509,  510.  That  interest  was  not  enough 
to  justify  banning  "a  silent,  passive  expression  of  opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance." 

Id., at 508. 
This  Court's  next  student  speech  case  was  Fraser,  478 U. S.  675.  Matthew  Fraser  was  suspended  for  delivering  a 

speech  before  a  high  school  assembly  in  which  he  employed 
what  this  Court  called  "an  elaborate,  graphic,  and  explicit sexual  metaphor." 

Id.,  at  678.  Analyzing  the  case  under 
Tinker,  the  District  Court  and  Court  of  Appeals  found  no 
disruption,  and  therefore  no  basis  for  disciplining  Fraser. 
478 U. S., at 679-680.  This Court reversed, holding that the 
"School District acted entirely within its permissible author-
ity  in  imposing  sanctions  upon  Fraser  in  response  to  his  of-
fensively lewd and indecent speech."  Id., at 685. 

The  mode  of  analysis  employed  in  Fraser  is  not  entirely 
clear.  The Court was plainly attuned to the content of Fra-
ser's  speech, citing  the  "marked  distinction between  the  po-
litical  `message'  of  the  armbands  in  Tinker  and  the  sexual 
content  of  [Fraser's]  speech."  Id.,  at  680.  But  the  Court 
also reasoned that school boards have the authority to deter-
mine  "what  manner  of  speech  in  the  classroom  or  in  school 
assembly  is  inappropriate."  Id.,  at  683.  Cf.  id.,  at  689 
(Brennan,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment)  ("In  the  present  case, 
school  officials  sought  only  to  ensure  that  a  high  school  as-
sembly  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  There  is  no  sugges-
tion  that  school  officials  attempted  to  regulate  [Fraser's] 
speech  because  they  disagreed  with  the  views  he  sought  to 
express"). 

We  need  not  resolve  this  debate  to  decide  this  case.  For 
present  purposes,  it  is  enough  to  distill  from  Fraser  two 
basic  principles.  First,  Fraser's  holding  demonstrates  that 
"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not 
automatically  coextensive  with  the  rights  of  adults  in  other 

551US2 Unit: $U68 [09-20-11 18:50:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
settings."  Id.,  at  682.  Had  Fraser  delivered  the  same speech in a public forum outside the school context, it would 

have been protected.  See Cohen  v.  California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971); 

Fraser,  supra,  at 682-683.  In  school,  however,  Fra-
ser's  First  Amendment  rights  were  circumscribed  "in  light of  the  special  characteristics  of  the  school  environment." 

Tinker,  supra,  at  506.  Second,  Fraser  established  that  the 
mode of analysis set forth in Tinker is not absolute.  What-ever approach 

Fraser employed, it certainly did not conduct 
the  "substantial  disruption"  analysis  prescribed  by  Tinker, 
supra,  at  514.  See  Kuhlmeier,  484  U. S.,  at  271,  n.  4  (dis-
agreeing  with  the  proposition  that  there  is  "no  difference 
between  the  First  Amendment  analysis  applied  in  Tinker 
and  that  applied  in  Fraser,"  and  noting  that  the  holding 
in  Fraser  was  not  based  on  any  showing  of  substantial 
disruption). 

Our  most  recent  student  speech  case,  Kuhlmeier,  con-
cerned  "expressive  activities  that  students,  parents,  and 
members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the 
imprimatur  of  the  school."  484  U. S.,  at  271.  Staff  mem-
bers  of  a  high  school  newspaper  sued  their  school  when  it 
chose not to publish two of their articles.  The Court of Ap-
peals  analyzed  the  case  under  Tinker,  ruling  in  favor  of  the 
students because it found no evidence of material disruption 
to  classwork  or  school  discipline.  Kuhlmeier  v.  Hazelwood 
School  Dist.,  795  F.  2d  1368,  1375  (CA8  1986).  This  Court 
reversed,  holding  that  "educators  do  not  offend  the  First 
Amendment  by  exercising  editorial  control  over  the  style 
and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive 
activities  so  long  as  their  actions  are  reasonably  related 
to  legitimate  pedagogical  concerns."  Kuhlmeier,  484  U. S., 
at 273. 

Kuhlmeier does not control this case because no one would 
reasonably believe  that Frederick's  banner bore  the  school's 
imprimatur.  The case is nevertheless instructive because it 
confirms  both  principles  cited  above.  Kuhlmeier  acknowl-

406  MORSE  v.  FREDERICK 

Opinion of the Court 
edged  that  schools  may  regulate  some  speech  "even  though 
the  government  could  not  censor  similar  speech  outside  the 
school."  Id.,  at  266.  And,  like  Fraser,  it  confirms  that  the 
rule  of  Tinker  is  not  the  only  basis  for  restricting  student 
speech.2 

Drawing  on  the  principles  applied  in  our  student  speech 
cases,  we  have  held  in  the  Fourth  Amendment  context  that 
"while  children  assuredly  do  not  `shed  their  constitutional 
rights  .  .  .  at  the  schoolhouse  gate,' . . .  the  nature  of 
those  rights  is  what  is  appropriate  for  children  in  school." 
Vernonia  School  Dist.  47J  v.  Acton,  515  U. S.  646,  655-656 
(1995)  (quoting  Tinker,  supra,  at  506).  In  particular,  "the 
school  setting  requires  some  easing  of  the  restrictions  to 
which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject." 
New  Jersey  v.  T.  L.  O.,  469  U. S.  325,  340  (1985).  See 
Vernonia, supra, at 656 ("Fourth Amendment rights, no less 
than  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendment  rights,  are  different 
in public schools than elsewhere . . . "); Board of Ed. of Inde-
pendent  School  Dist.  No.  92  of  Pottawatomie  Cty.  v.  Earls, 
536  U. S.  822,  829-830  (2002)  (" `special  needs'  inhere  in  the 
public  school  context";  "[w]hile  schoolchildren  do  not  shed 
their  constitutional  rights  when  they  enter  the  schoolhouse, 
Fourth Amendment rights . . . are different in public schools 
than  elsewhere;  the  `reasonableness'  inquiry  cannot  disre-
gard  the  schools'  custodial  and  tutelary  responsibility  for 
children"  (quoting  Vernonia,  515  U. S.,  at  656;  citation  and

and the opinion in  Federal  Election  Comm'n  v.  Wisconsin Right  to Life, 
Inc.,  post,  p.  449,  see  post,  at  444-445,  overlooks  what  was  made  clear 
in  Tinker,  Fraser,  and  Kuhlmeier:  Student  First  Amendment  rights  are 
"applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment." 
Tinker,  393  U. S.,  at  506.  See  Fraser,  478  U. S.,  at  682;  Kuhlmeier,  484 
U. S.,  at  266.  And,  as  discussed  above,  supra,  at  402-403,  there  is  no 
serious argument that Frederick's banner is political speech of the sort at 
issue in Wisconsin Right to Life.

Opinion of the Court 
Even  more  to  the  point,  these  cases  also  recognize  that deterring  drug  use  by  schoolchildren  is  an  "important-- 

indeed,  perhaps  compelling"  interest.  Id.,  at  661.  Drug abuse can cause severe and permanent damage to the health 
and well-being of young people: 

"School years are the time when the physical, psycholog-
ical,  and  addictive  effects  of  drugs  are  most  severe. Maturing  nervous  systems  are  more  critically  impaired 

by intoxicants than mature ones are; childhood losses in learning are lifelong and profound; children grow chemi-
cally dependent more quickly than adults, and their rec-
ord of recovery is depressingly poor.  And of course the effects of a drug-infested school are visited not just upon 

the users, but upon the entire student body and faculty, as  the  educational  process  is  disrupted." 

Id.,  at  661- 
662 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 

Just  five  years  ago,  we  wrote:  "The  drug  abuse  problem among our Nation's youth has hardly abated since 

Vernonia 
was  decided  in  1995.  In  fact,  evidence  suggests  that  it  has 
only grown worse."  Earls, supra, at 834, and n. 5. The  problem remains  serious  today.  See  generally 1  Na-

tional  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse,  National  Institutes  of Health,  Monitoring  the  Future:  National  Survey  Results  on 
Drug  Use,  1975-2005,  Secondary  School  Students  (2006). About  half  of  American  12th  graders  have  used  an  illicit 
drug,  as  have  more  than  a  third  of  10th  graders  and  about one-fifth of 8th graders. 

Id., at 99.  Nearly one in four 12th 
graders  has  used  an  illicit  drug  in  the  past  month.  Id.,  at 101.  Some  25%  of  high  schoolers  say  that  they  have  been

408  MORSE  v.  FREDERICK 

Opinion of the Court 
Congress has declared that part of a school's job is educat-
ing  students  about  the  dangers  of  illegal  drug  use.  It  has 
provided  billions  of  dollars  to  support  state  and  local  drug-
prevention programs, Brief for United States as Amicus Cu-
riae  1,  and  required  that  schools  receiving  federal  funds 
under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act 
of 1994 certify that their drug-prevention programs "convey 
a  clear  and  consistent  message  that  .  .  .  the  illegal  use  of 
drugs  [is]  wrong  and  harmful,"  20  U. S. C.  $ 7114(d)(6)  (2000 
ed., Supp. IV). 

Thousands  of  school  boards  throughout  the  country--in-
cluding  JDHS--have  adopted  policies  aimed  at  effectuating 
this  message.  See  Pet.  for  Cert.  17-21.  Those  school 
boards know that peer  pressure is  perhaps  "the  single  most 
important  factor  leading  schoolchildren  to  take  drugs,"  and 
that  students  are  more  likely  to  use  drugs  when  the  norms 
in  school  appear  to  tolerate  such  behavior.  Earls,  supra,

Opinion of the Court 
for  Cert.  53a,  extends  well  beyond  an  abstract  desire  to avoid controversy. 

Petitioners urge us to adopt the broader rule that Freder-ick's speech is proscribable because it is plainly "offensive" as 
that term is used in Fraser.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15.  We  think  this  stretches 

Fraser  too  far;  that  case should  not  be  read  to  encompass  any  speech  that  could  fit 

under some definition of "offensive."  After all, much politi-cal  and  religious  speech  might  be  perceived  as  offensive  to 
some.  The concern here  is not  that Frederick's  speech was offensive,  but  that  it  was  reasonably  viewed  as  promoting 
illegal drug use. Although accusing this decision of doing "serious  violence 
to the First Amendment" by authorizing "viewpoint discrim-ination,"  post,  at  435,  437,  the  dissent  concludes  that  "it 
might  well  be  appropriate  to  tolerate  some  targeted  view-point  discrimination  in  this  unique  setting," 

post,  at  439. Nor  do  we  understand  the  dissent  to  take  the  position  that 

schools  are  required  to  tolerate  student  advocacy  of  illegal drug  use  at  school  events,  even  if  that  advocacy  falls  short 
of inviting "imminent" lawless action.  See ibid. ("[I]t is pos-sible  that  our  rigid  imminence  requirement  ought  to  be  re-
laxed at schools").  And even the dissent recognizes that the issues  here  are  close  enough  that  the  principal  should  not 
be held liable in damages, but should instead enjoy qualified immunity  for  her  actions.  See 

post,  at  434.  Stripped  of rhetorical  flourishes,  then,  the  debate  between  the  dissent 

and  this  opinion  is  less  about  constitutional  first  principles than  about  whether  Frederick's  banner  constitutes  promo-
tion of illegal drug use.  We have explained our view that it does.  The dissent's contrary view on that relatively narrow 
question  hardly  justifies  sounding  the  First  Amendment bugle.

period,  and  the  court  subsequently  dismissed  the  complaint.  This 
Court vacated that judgment, holding that McConnell "did not purport

Life,  Inc.  v.  Federal  Election  Comm'n,  546  U. S.  410,  412  (WRTL  I). 
On  remand,  the  District  Court  granted  WRTL  summary  judgment, 
holding  $ 203  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  the  three  ads.  The  court 
first  found  that  adjudication  was  not  barred  by  mootness  because  the 
controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review.  On the mer-
its, it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads, not express advo-
cacy  or  its  "functional  equivalent"  under  McConnell,  and  held  that  no 
compelling interest justified BCRA's regulation of such ads. 

Held:  The judgment is affirmed.

political  speech,  it  is  subject  to  strict  scrutiny,  see,  e. g.,  McConnell, 
supra,  at  205,  under  which  the  Government  must  prove  that  applying 
BCRA to WRTL's ads furthers a compelling governmental interest and 
is  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  that  interest,  see  First  Nat.  Bank  of 
Boston v.  Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 786.  Given that McConnell, supra, at 
206,  already  ruled  that  BCRA  survives  strict  scrutiny  to  the  extent  it 
regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent, the FEC's bur-
den is not onerous insofar as these ads fit this description.  Pp. 464-465. 

(b)  Contrary to the FEC's contention, McConnell, 540 U. S., at 205- 
206, did not establish an intent-and-effect test for determining if a par-
ticular ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Indeed, McConnell  did  not  adopt  any  test  for  future  as-applied  challenges,  but 
simply  grounded  its  analysis  in  the  evidentiary  record,  which  included 
two  key  studies  that  separated  ads  based  on  whether  they  were  in-
tended  to, or had the effect of,  supporting candidates  for federal office. 
Id.,  at  308-309.  More  importantly,  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424  U. S.  1,  14, 
43-44, rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between dis-
cussions  of  issues  and  candidates,  and  McConnell  did  not  purport  to 
overrule  Buckley  on  this  point--or  even  address  what  Buckley  had  to 
say on the subject.  Pp. 465-469. 

(c)  Because  WRTL's  ads  may  reasonably  be  interpreted  as  some-
thing  other  than  an  appeal  to  vote  for  or  against  a  specific  candidate, 
they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore 
fall outside McConnell's scope.  To safeguard freedom of speech on pub-
lic issues, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA $ 203 
must  be  objective,  focusing  on  the  communication's  substance  rather 
than  on  amorphous  considerations  of  intent  and  effect.  See  Buckley, 
supra, at 43-44.  It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow par-
ties  to  resolve  disputes  quickly  without  chilling  speech  through  the 
threat  of  burdensome  litigation.  See  Virginia  v.  Hicks,  539  U. S.  113, 
119.  And  it  must  eschew  "the  open-ended  rough-and-tumble  of  fac-
tors," which "invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually 
inevitable appeal."  Jerome  B.  Grubart, Inc.  v.  Great  Lakes Dredge  & 
Dock  Co.,  513  U. S.  527,  547.  In  short,  it  must  give  the  benefit  of  any 
doubt  to  protecting  rather  than  stifling  speech.  See  New  York  Times 
Co. v.  Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269-270.  In light of these considerations, 
a  court  should  find  that  an  ad  is  the  functional  equivalent  of  express 
advocacy  only  if  the  ad  is  susceptible  of  no  reasonable  interpretation 
other  than  as  an  appeal  to  vote  for  or  against  a  specific  candidate. 
WRTL's  three  ads  are  plainly  not  the  functional  equivalent  of  express 
advocacy under this test.  First, their content is consistent with that of 
a genuine issue ad: They focus and take a position on a legislative issue 
and exhort the public to adopt that position and to contact public officials 
with  respect  to  the  matter.  Second,  their  content  lacks  indicia  of  ex-

press  advocacy:  They  do  not  mention  an  election,  candidacy,  political 
party, or  challenger;  and they take no position  on a  candidate's  charac-
ter, qualifications, or fitness for office.  Pp. 469-476. 

2.  Because  WRTL's  ads  are  not  express  advocacy  or  its  functional 
equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently com-
pelling to justify burdening WRTL's speech, BCRA $ 203 is unconstitu-
tional as applied to the ads.  The section can be constitutionally applied 
only  if  it  is  narrowly  tailored  to  further  a  compelling  interest.  E. g., 
McConnell, supra, at 205.  None of the interests that might justify reg-
ulating  WRTL's  ads  are  sufficiently  compelling.  Although  the  Court 
has  long  recognized  "the  governmental  interest  in  preventing  corrup-
tion and the  appearance of corruption" in election campaigns,  Buckley, 
424  U. S.,  at  45,  it  has  invoked  this  interest  as  a  reason  for  upholding 
contribution limits, id., at  26-27,  and suggested  that it might also jus-
tify  limits  on  electioneering  expenditures  posing  the  same  dangers  as 
large  contributions,  id.,  at 45.  McConnell  arguably  applied this  inter-
est  to  ads  that  were  the  "functional  equivalent"  of  express  advocacy. 
See 540 U. S., at 204-206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL's ads, this 
interest  must  be  stretched  yet  another  step  to  ads  that  are  not  the 
functional  equivalent  of  express  advocacy.  Issue  ads  like  WRTL's  are 
not equivalent to contributions, and the corruption interest cannot jus-
tify regulating them.  A second possible compelling interest lies in ad-
dressing "the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations 
of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and 
that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corpora-
tion's political ideas."  Austin v.  Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 
U. S.  652,  660.  McConnell  held  that  this  interest  justifies  regulating 
the  "functional  equivalent"  of  campaign  speech,  540  U. S.,  at  205-206. 
This interest cannot be extended further to apply  to genuine  issue ads 
like WRTL's, see, e. g., id., at 206, n. 88, because doing so would call into 
question  this  Court's  holdings  that  the  corporate  identity  of  a  speaker 
does  not  strip  corporations  of  all  free  speech  rights.  WRTL  I  rein-
forced the validity of this point by holding $ 203 susceptible to as-applied 
challenges.  546 U. S., at 412.  Pp. 476-481. 

3.  These cases present no occasion to revisit McConnell's holding that 
a corporation's express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent shortly 
before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equiva-
lent  of  such  express  advocacy.  But  when  it  comes  to  defining  what 
speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject 
to such a ban--the question here--the Court should give the benefit of 
the doubt to speech, not censorship.  Pp. 481-482.

the Court's judgment because he would overrule that part of McConnell 
v.  Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U. S. 93, upholding $ 203(a) of BCRA. 
Pp. 485-504. 

1.  The  pertinent  case  law  begins  with  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424  U. S.  1, 
in which the Court held, inter alia, that a federal limitation on campaign 
expenditures not made in coordination with a candidate's campaign (con-
tained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)) was un-
constitutional, id., at 39-51.  In light of vagueness concerns, the Court 
narrowly  construed  the  independent-expenditure  provision  to  cover 
only  express  advocacy  of  the  election  or  defeat  of  a  clearly  identified 
candidate  for  federal  office  by  use  of  such  magic  words  "as  `vote  for,' 
`elect,' . . .  `vote against,' `defeat,' `reject.' "  Id., at 44, and n. 52.  This 
narrowing construction excluded so-called "issue advocacy" referring to 
a  clearly  identified  candidate's  position  on  an  issue,  but  not  expressly 
advocating  his  election  or  defeat.  Even  as  narrowly  construed,  how-
ever,  the  Court  struck  the  provision  down.  Id.,  at  45-46.  Despite 
Buckley,  some  argued  that  independent  expenditures  by  corporations 
should be treated differently.  A post-Buckley case, First Nat. Bank of 
Boston v.  Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776-777, struck down, on First Amend-
ment  grounds,  a  state  statute  prohibiting  corporations  from  spending 
money  in  connection  with  a  referendum.  The  Court  strayed  far  from 
these  principles,  however,  in  Austin  v.  Michigan  Chamber  of  Com-
merce, 494 U. S. 652, upholding state restrictions on corporations' inde-
pendent  expenditures  in  support  of,  or  in  opposition  to,  candidates  for 
state office, id., at  654-655.  Austin was wrongly decided,  but at  least 
it  was  limited  to  express  advocacy.  Nonexpress  advocacy  was  pre-
sumed  to remain protected under  Buckley  and Bellotti, even when  en-
gaged in by corporations, until McConnell.  McConnell held, inter alia, 
that  the  compelling  governmental  interest  supporting  restrictions  on 
corporate  expenditures  for  express  advocacy--i. e.,  Austin's  perceived 
"corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] 
wealth," 540 U. S., at 205--also justified extending those restrictions to 
ads run during the BCRA blackout period "to the extent . . . [they] are 
the  functional  equivalent  of  express  advocacy,"  id.,  at  206  (emphasis 
added).  McConnell  upheld  BCRA  $ 203(a)  against  a  facial  challenge. 
Subsequently,  in  Wisconsin  Right  to  Life,  Inc.  v.  Federal  Election 
Comm'n, 546 U. S. 410, 412, the Court held that McConnell did not fore-
close as-applied challenges to $ 203.  Pp. 485-491. 

2.  McConnell's  holding concerning $ 203  was wrong.  The  answer to 
whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied chal-
lenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious 
standard  is  McConnell's,  which  asks  whether  an  ad  is  the  "functional 
equivalent  of  express  advocacy,"  540  U. S.,  at  206.  The  fundamental

and  inescapable  problem  with  this  test,  with  the  principal  opinion's 
susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation  standard,  and  with 
other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffec-
tive  to  vindicate  the  fundamental  First  Amendment  rights  at  issue. 
Buckley  itself  compelled  the conclusion  that  such  tests  fall  short  when 
it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertis-
ing that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 43-44. 
The  only  plausible  explanation  for  Buckley's  "highly  strained"  reading 
of  FECA,  McConnell,  supra,  at  280,  is  that  the  Court  there  eschewed 
narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECA's 
text  and  more  effective  at  capturing  campaign  speech  because  those 
tests  were  all  too  vague.  If  Buckley  foreclosed  such  vagueness  in  a 
statutory  test,  it  also  must  foreclose  such  vagueness  in  an  as-applied 
test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would

Glidden  Co.  v.  Zdanok,  370  U. S.  530,  543,  and  it  has  not  hesitated  to

are intimately tied to public  issues involving legislative pro-
posals  and  governmental  actions."  Buckley  v.  Valeo,  424 
U. S. 1, 42 (1976) (per curiam).  Our development of the law 
in  this  area  requires  us,  however,  to  draw  such  a  line,  be-
cause  we  have  recognized  that  the  interests  held  to  justify 
the regulation of campaign speech and its "functional equiva-
lent"  "might  not  apply"  to  the  regulation  of  issue  advocacy. 
McConnell, supra, at 206, and n. 88. 

In  drawing  that  line,  the  First  Amendment  requires  us 
to  err  on  the  side  of  protecting  political  speech  rather  than 
suppressing it.  We conclude that the speech at issue in this 
as-applied challenge is not the "functional equivalent" of ex-
press campaign speech.  We further conclude that the inter-
ests  held  to  justify  restricting  corporate  campaign  speech 
or  its  functional  equivalent  do  not  justify  restricting  issue 
advocacy,  and  accordingly  we  hold  that  BCRA  $ 203  is  un-
constitutional  as  applied  to  the  advertisements  at  issue  in 
these cases. 

I 

Prior  to  BCRA,  corporations  were  free  under  federal  law 
to use independent expenditures to engage in political speech 
so long as that speech did not expressly advocate the election 
or defeat of a  clearly  identified federal candidate.  See Fed-
eral  Election  Comm'n  v.  Massachusetts  Citizens  for  Life, 
Inc.,  479  U. S.  238,  249  (1986)  (MCFL);  Buckley,  supra,  at 
44-45; 2 U. S. C. $$ 441b(a), (b)(2) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV). 

BCRA significantly cut back on corporations' ability to en-
gage  in  political  speech.  BCRA  $ 203,  at  issue  in  these 
cases,  makes  it  a  crime  for  any  labor  union  or  incorporated 
entity--whether  the  United  Steelworkers,  the  American 
Civil Liberties Union, or General Motors--to use its general 
treasury  funds  to  pay  for  any  "electioneering  communica-
tion."  $ 441b(b)(2)  (2000 ed.,  Supp.  IV).  BCRA's  definition 
of  "electioneering  communication"  is  clear  and  expansive. 
It encompasses any broadcast, cable, or satellite communica-
tion  that  refers  to  a  candidate  for  federal  office  and  that  is

On  the  same  day,  WRTL  aired  a  similar  radio  ad  entitled "Loan." 

2  It  had  also  invested  treasury  funds  in  producing 

a  television  ad  entitled  "Waiting," 3  which  is  similar  in  sub-stance and format to "Wedding" and "Loan." 

2 The radio script for "Loan" differs from "Wedding" only in its lead-in. 
"Loan" begins: 

" `LOAN OFFICER: Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Shulman.  We've reviewed 
your  loan  application,  along  with your  credit  report,  the appraisal  on the 
house, the inspections, and well . . .  

" `COUPLE: Yes, yes . . .  we're listening.

decision. 

" `But in Washington it's happening. . . . '  "   466  F.  Supp. 2d, at 198, n. 4. 

The remainder of the script is identical to "Wedding." 

3 In  "Waiting,"  the  images  on  the  television  ad  depict  a  " `middle-aged 

man  being  as  productive  as  possible  while  his  professional  life  is  in 
limbo.' "  Id., at 198, n. 5.  The man reads the morning paper, polishes his 
shoes, scans through  his  Rolodex,  and does  other similar  activities.  The 
television script for this ad reads: 

" `VOICE-OVER:  There  are  a  lot  of  judicial  nominees  out  there  who 
can't go to work.  Their careers are put on hold because a group of Sena-
tors  is  filibustering--blocking  qualified  nominees  from  a  simple  "yes"  or 
"no" vote. 

" `It's politics at work and it's causing gridlock. . . . '  "   Ibid. 

The remainder of the script is virtually identical to "Wedding."

460  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N  v.  WISCONSIN  

RIGHT  TO  LIFE,  INC.  

Opinion of the Court  

WRTL  planned  on  running  "Wedding,"  "Waiting,"  and "Loan"  throughout  August  2004  and  financing  the  ads  with 

funds  from  its  general  treasury.  It  recognized,  however, that as of August 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, 
the  ads  would  be  illegal  "electioneering  communication[s]" under BCRA $ 203. 

Believing  that  it  nonetheless  possessed  a  First  Amend-ment 

right  to  broadcast  these  ads,  WRTL  filed  suit  against the  Federal  Election  Commission  (FEC)  on  July  28,  2004, 

seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  before  a  three-judge  District  Court.  See  note  following  2  U. S. C.  $ 437h 
(2000 ed., Supp. IV); 28 U. S. C. $ 2284.  WRTL alleged that 
BCRA's  prohibition  on  the  use  of  corporate  treasury  funds 
for  "electioneering  communication[s]"  as  defined  in  the  Act 
is  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  "Wedding,"  "Loan,"  and 
"Waiting," as well as any materially similar ads it might seek 
to run in the future. 

Just  before  the  BCRA  blackout  period  was  to  begin,  the 
District  Court  denied  a  preliminary  injunction,  concluding 
that  "the  reasoning  of  the  McConnell  Court  leaves  no  room 
for  the  kind  of  `as  applied'  challenge  WRTL  propounds  be-
fore us."  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this 
ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period. 
The  District  Court  subsequently  dismissed  WRTL's  com-
plaint.  See  id.,  at  47a-48a  ("WRTL's  `as-applied'  challenge 
to  BCRA  [$ 203]  is  foreclosed  by  the  Supreme  Court's  deci-
sion  in  McConnell").  On  appeal,  we  vacated  the  District 
Court's  judgment,  holding  that  McConnell  "did  not  purport 
to  resolve  future  as-applied  challenges"  to  BCRA  $ 203,  and 
remanded  "for  the  District  Court  to  consider  the  merits  of 
WRTL's  as-applied  challenge  in  the  first  instance."  WRTL 
I, 546 U. S., at 412. 

On  remand,  after  allowing  four  Members  of  Congress  to 
intervene  as  defendants,  the  three-judge  District  Court 
granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA $ 203 
unconstitutional  as  applied  to  the  three  advertisements

Opinion of the Court 
WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District  Court  first  found  adjudication  of  the  dispute  not 

barred  by  mootness  because  the  controversy  was  " `capable of repetition, yet evading review.' "  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202. 
Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under 
McConnell, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe "express advocacy"--defined  as  ads  that  expressly  advocate  the  elec-

tion or defeat of a candidate for federal office--and the "func-tional equivalent" of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204. 
Stating  that  it  was  limiting  its  inquiry  to  "language  within the  four  corners"  of  the  ads,  id.,  at  207,  the  District  Court 
concluded that the ads were not express advocacy or its func-tional  equivalent,  but  instead  "genuine  issue  ads," 

id.,  at 205-208.  Then,  reaching  a  question  "left  open  in  McCon-

nell,"  the  court  held  that  no  compelling  interest  justified BCRA's regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL 
sought to run.  Id., at 208-210. One judge dissented, contending that the majority's "plain 
facial  analysis  of  the  text  in  WRTL's  2004  advertisements" ignored "the context in which the text was developed."  Id., 
at  210  (opinion  of  Roberts,  J.).  In  that  judge's  view,  a contextual  analysis  of  the  ads  revealed  "deep  factual  rifts 
between  the  parties  concerning  the  purpose  and  intended effects of the ads" such that neither side was entitled to sum-
mary judgment.  Id., at 210, 211. The  FEC  and  intervenors  filed  separate  notices  of  appeal 
and jurisdictional statements.  We consolidated  the  two ap-peals and set the matter for briefing and argument, postpon-
ing further consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  549 U. S. 1177 (2007).

462  FEDERAL  ELECTION  COMM'N  v.  WISCONSIN 

RIGHT  TO  LIFE,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

477  (1990).  Based  on  these  principles,  the  FEC  argues (though  the  intervenors  do  not)  that  these  cases  are  moot 

because  the  2004  election  has  passed  and  WRTL  "does  not assert  any  continuing  interest  in  running  [its  three]  adver-
tisements,  nor  does  it  identify  any  reason  to  believe  that  a significant  dispute  over  Senate  filibusters  of  judicial  nomi-
nees will  occur in the  foreseeable  future."  Brief for  Appel-
lant FEC 21. As  the  District  Court  concluded,  however,  these  cases  fit 

comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  See 

Los 
Angeles  v.  Lyons, 461  U. S.  95,  109  (1983);  Southern  Pacific 
Terminal  Co.  v.  ICC,  219  U. S.  498,  515  (1911).  The  excep-
tion applies where "(1) the challenged action is in its duration 
too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, 
and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same com-
plaining  party  will  be  subject  to  the  same  action  again." 
Spencer  v.  Kemna,  523  U. S.  1,  17  (1998)  (internal  quotation 
marks and brackets omitted).  Both circumstances are pres-
ent here. 

As  the  District  Court  found,  it  would  be  "entirely  unrea-
sonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have obtained com-
plete judicial review of its claims in time for it to air its ads" 
during the BCRA blackout periods.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202. 
The FEC contends that the 2-year window between elections 
provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights before 
each BCRA blackout period.  But groups like WRTL cannot 
predict what issues will be matters of public concern during 
a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way 
of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on 
judicial  filibusters  during  the  BCRA  blackout  period.  In 
any event, despite BCRA's command that the cases be expe-
dited  "to  the  greatest  possible  extent,"  $ 403(a)(4),  116  Stat. 
113, note following 2 U. S. C. $ 437h (2000 ed., Supp. IV), two 
BCRA  blackout  periods  have  come  and  gone  during  the 
pendency  of  this  action.  "[A]  decision  allowing  the  desired

expenditures  would  be  an  empty  gesture  unless  it  afforded appellants sufficient opportunity prior to the election date to 

communicate  their  views  effectively."  First  Nat.  Bank  of 
Boston v.  Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 774 (1978). 

The  second  prong  of  the  "capable  of  repetition"  exception requires  a  " `reasonable  expectation' "  or  a  " `demonstrated 

probability' " that "the same controversy will recur involving 
the  same  complaining  party."  Murphy  v.  Hunt,  455  U. S. 478,  482  (1982)  (

per  curiam).  Our  cases  find  the  same  con-
troversy  sufficiently  likely  to  recur  when  a  party  has  a  rea-sonable  expectation  that  it  "will  again  be  subjected  to  the 

alleged illegality," Lyons, supra, at 109, or "will be subject to 
the threat of prosecution" under the challenged law, Bellotti, 
supra,  at  774-775  (citing  Weinstein  v.  Bradford,  423  U. S. 
147,  149  (1975)  (per  curiam)).  The  FEC  argues  that  in 
order  to  prove  likely  recurrence  of  the  same  controversy, 
WRTL must establish that it will run ads in the future shar-
ing  all  "the  characteristics  that  the  district  court  deemed 
legally relevant."  Brief for Appellant FEC 23. 

The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the 
" `capable  of  repetition,  yet  evading  review'  doctrine,  in  the 
context  of  election  cases,  is  appropriate  when  there  are  `as 
applied' challenges as well as in the more typical case involv-
ing only facial attacks."  Storer v.  Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 737, 
n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every "legally relevant" 
characteristic  of  an  as-applied  challenge--down  to  the  last 
detail--would effectively overrule this statement by making 
this  exception  unavailable  for  virtually  all  as-applied  chal-
lenges.  History  repeats  itself, but  not  at  the  level  of  speci-
ficity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed 
that it  planned on running " `materially similar' "  future tar-
geted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the black-
out period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to 
believe  that  the  FEC  will  "refrain  from  prosecuting  viola-
tions" of BCRA, Bellotti, supra,  at 775.  Under the circum-
stances,  particularly  where  WRTL  sought  another  prelimi-

amounts to  a convincing reason  for the Judicial Branch  to refrain  from 
providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.  Bush v. Lucas, 462 
U. S.  367,  378.  But  even  absent  an  alternative,  a  Bivens  remedy  is  a 
subject of judgment: "the federal courts must make the kind of remedial 
determination  that  is  appropriate  for  a  common-law  tribunal,  paying 
particular  heed . . .  to  any  special  factors  counselling  hesitation  before 
authorizing  a  new  kind  of  federal  litigation."  462  U. S.,  at  378. 
Pp. 549-550. 

(b)  For purposes of step one, Robbins's difficulties with the Bureau 
can be divided into four categories.  The first, torts or tort-like injuries, 
includes  an  unauthorized  survey  of  the  desired  easement's  terrain  and 
an  illegal  entry  into  Robbins's  lodge.  In  each  instance,  he  had  a  civil 
damages  remedy  for  trespass,  which  he  did  not  pursue.  The  second 
category,  charges  brought  against  Robbins,  includes  administrative 
claims for trespass and other land-use violations, a fine for an unauthor-
ized road  repair, and two criminal charges.  Robbins  had the opportu-
nity to contest all of  the administrative  charges; he fought some of the 
land-use  and  trespass  citations,  and  challenged  the  road  repair  fine  as 
far  as  the  Interior  Board  of  Land  Appeals  (IBLA),  but  did  not  seek 
judicial  review  after  losing  there.  He  exercised  his  right  to  jury  trial 
on  the  criminal  complaints.  The  fact  that  the jury  took 30  minutes to 
acquit  him  tends  to  support  his  baseless-prosecution  charge;  but  the 
federal  trial  judge  did  not  find  the  Government's  case  thin  enough  to 
justify  attorney's  fees,  and  Robbins  appealed  that  ruling  late.  The 
third category, unfavorable agency actions, involved a 1995 cancellation 
of  the  right-of-way  given  to  Robbins's  predecessor  in  return  for  the 
Government's unrecorded easement, a 1995 decision to reduce the SRUP 
from five years to one, and in 1999, the SRUP's termination and a graz-
ing permit's  revocation.  Administrative review  was available  for each 
claim, subject to ultimate judicial review under the Administrative Pro-
cedure  Act.  Robbins  did  not  appeal  the  1995  decisions,  stopped  after 
an IBLA appeal of the SRUP denial, and obtained an IBLA stay of the 
grazing  permit  revocation.  The  fourth  category  includes  three  events 
that  elude  classification.  An  altercation  between  Robbins  and  his 
neighbor  did  not  implicate  the  Bureau,  and  no  criminal  charges  were 
filed.  Bureau  employees'  videotaping  of  ranch  guests  during  a  cattle 
drive,  though  annoying  and  possibly  bad  for  business,  may  not  have 
been unlawful, depending, e. g., on whether the guests were on public or 
private land.  Also, the guests might be the proper plaintiffs in any tort 
action,  and  any  tort  might  be  chargeable  against  the  Government,  not 
its employees.  Likewise up in the air is the significance of an attempt 
to  pressure  a Bureau  of Indian  Affairs employee  to impound Robbins's 
cattle.  An impoundment's legitimacy would have depended on whether 
the cattle were on private or public land, and no impoundment actually

Syllabus 
occurred.  Thus, Robbins  has an administrative,  and  ultimately a  judi-
cial,  process  for  vindicating  virtually  all  of  his  complaints.  This  state 
of law gives him no intuitively meritorious case for a new constitutional 
cause  of  action,  but  neither  does  it  plainly  answer  no  to  the  question 
whether he should have it.  Pp. 551-554. 

(c)  This,  then,  is  a  case  for  Bivens step  two,  for  weighing  reasons 
for  and  against  creating  a  new  cause  of  action,  as  common  law  judges 
have always done.  Robbins concedes that any single action might have 
been brushed aside as a small imposition, but says that in the aggregate 
the campaign against him amounted to coercion to extract the easement 
and should be redressed collectively.  On the other side of the ledger is 
the difficulty in defining a workable cause of action.  Robbins's claim of 
retaliation for exercising his property right to exclude the Government 
does not fit this Court's retaliation cases, which involve an allegation of 
impermissible purpose  and motivation--e. g., an  employee  is fired  after 
speaking out on matters of public concern, Board of Comm'rs, Wabaun-
see  Cty.  v.  Umbehr,  518  U. S.  668,  675--and  whose  outcome  turns  on 
"what for" questions--what was the Government's purpose in firing the 
employee  and would  he have  been  fired  anyway.  Such  questions  have 
definite answers, and this Court has established methods to identify the 
presence of an illicit reason.  Robbins alleges not that the Government's 
means  were  illegitimate  but  that  the  defendants  simply  demanded  too 
much and went too far.  However, a "too much" kind of liability stand-
ard can never be as reliable as a "what for" one.  Most of the offending 
actions are legitimate tactics designed to improve the Government's ne-
gotiating position.  Although the Government is no ordinary landowner, 
in many ways it deals with its neighbors as one owner among the rest. 
So long as defendants had authority to withhold or withdraw Robbins's 
permission  to  use  Government  land  and  to  enforce  the  trespass  and 
land-use rules, they were within their rights to make it plain that Rob-
bins's  willingness  to  give  an  easement  would  determine  how  complai-
sant  they  would  be  about  his  trespasses  on  public  land.  As  for  Rob-
bins's  more  abstract  claim,  recognizing  a  Bivens  action  for  retaliation 
against  those  who  resist  Government  impositions  on  their  property 
rights  would  invite  claims  in  every  sphere  of  legitimate  governmental 
action  affecting  property  interests,  from  negotiating  tax  claim  settle-
ments to enforcing Occupational Safety and Health Administration regu-
lations.  Pp. 554-562. 

2.  RICO  does  not  give  Robbins  a  claim  against  defendants  in  their 
individual  capacities.  Robbins  argues  that  the  predicate  act  for  his 
RICO claim is a violation of the Hobbs Act, which criminalizes interfer-
ence  with  interstate  commerce  by  extortion,  along  with  attempts  or 
conspiracies, 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(a), and defines extortion as "the obtaining

Syllabus 
of  property  from  another,  with  his  consent  .  .  .  under  color  of  official 
right,"  $ 1951(b)(2).  Robbins's  claim  fails  because  the  Hobbs  Act  does 
not apply when the National Government is the intended beneficiary of 
allegedly  extortionate  acts.  That  Act  does  not  speak  explicitly  to  ef-
forts to obtain property for the Government rather than a private party, 
so  the  question  turns  on  the  common  law  conception  of  "extortion," 
which Congress is presumed to have incorporated into the Act in 1946, 
see, e. g., Scheidler v.  National Organization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 
393,  402.  At  common  law,  extortion  "by  the  public  official  was  the 
rough  equivalent  of  what  [is]  now  describe[d]  as  `taking  a  bribe.' " 
Evans v.  United States, 504 U. S. 255, 260.  While public officials were 
not immune  from extortion charges at common law, that crime focused 
on  the  harm  of  public  corruption,  by  selling  public  favors  for  private 
gain, not on the harm caused by overzealous efforts to obtain property 
on the Government's behalf.  The importance of the line between public 
and private beneficiaries is confirmed by this Court's case law, which is 
completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right 
undertaken  for  the  sole  benefit  of  the  Government.  More  tellingly, 
Robbins cites no decision by any court, much less this one, in the Hobbs 
Act's entire 60-year history finding extortion in Government employees' 
efforts to get property for the Government's exclusive benefit.  United 
States v.  Green, 350 U. S. 415, 420, which held that "extortion as defined 
in the [Hobbs Act] in no way depends upon having a direct benefit con-
ferred on the person who obtains the property," does not support Rob-
bins's claim that Congress could not have meant to prohibit extortionate 
acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but ignore them when 
the intended beneficiary is the Government.  Without some other indi-
cation from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that the Hobbs Act 
(let alone RICO) was intended to expose all federal employees to extor-
tion  charges  whenever  they  stretch  in  trying  to  enforce  Government 
property  claims.  Because  defendants'  conduct  does  not  fit  the  tradi-
tional  definition of extortion, it also does  not survive as  a RICO  predi-
cate  offense  on  the  theory  that  it  is  "chargeable  under  [Wyoming]  law 
and  punishable  by  imprisonment  for  more  than  one  year,"  18  U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court 
parcels  intermingled  with  tracts  belonging  to  other  private owners,  the  State  of  Wyoming,  and  the  National  Govern-

ment.  Its natural resources include wildlife and mineral de-posits, and its mountainous western portion, called the upper 
Rock  Creek  area,  is  a  place  of  great  natural  beauty.  In  re-sponse  to  persistent  requests  by  environmentalists  and  out-
door enthusiasts, the Bureau tried to induce the ranch's pre-vious owner, George Nelson, to grant an easement for public 
use  over  South  Fork  Owl  Creek  Road,  which  runs  through the  ranch  and  serves  as  a  main  route  to  the  upper  Rock 
Creek area.  For a while, Nelson refused from fear that the public  would  disrupt  his  guests'  activities,  but  shortly  after 
agreeing to sell the property to Robbins, in March 1994, Nel-son  signed  a  nonexclusive  deed  of  easement  giving  the 
United  States  the  right  to  use  and  maintain  the  road  along a  stretch  of  his  property.  In  return,  the  Bureau  agreed  to 
rent  Nelson  a  right-of-way  to  maintain  a  different  section of  the  road  as  it  runs  across  federal  property  and  connects 
otherwise isolated parts of Robbins's holdings. In  May  1994,  Nelson  conveyed  the  ranch  to  Robbins,  who 
continued to graze cattle and run guest  cattle drives  in reli-ance  on  grazing  permits  and  a  Special  Recreation  Use  Per-
mit (SRUP) issued by the Bureau.  But Robbins knew noth-ing  about  Nelson's grant  of  the  easement across  South  Fork 
Owl Creek Road, which the Bureau had failed to record, and upon  recording  his  warranty  deed  in  Hot  Springs  County, 
Robbins  took  title  to  the  ranch  free  of  the  easement,  by  op-eration  of  Wyoming  law.  See  Wyo.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 34-1-120 
(2005). When  the  Bureau's  employee  Joseph  Vessels 

1  discovered, 

in June 1994, that the Bureau's inaction had cost it the ease-ment, he telephoned Robbins and  demanded  an easement  to 

replace  Nelson's.  Robbins  refused  but  indicated  he  would

consider  granting  one  in  return  for  something.  In  a  later meeting,  Vessels  allegedly  told  Robbins  that  " `the  Federal 

Government  does  not  negotiate,' "  and  talks  broke  down. Brief  for  Respondent  5.  Robbins  says  that  over  the  next 
several  years  the  defendant-petitioners  (hereinafter  defend-ants), who are current and former employees of the Bureau, 
carried on a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at forcing him to regrant the lost easement.

Robbins concedes that any single  one of the offensive  and sometimes illegal actions by the Bureau's officials might have 

been brushed aside as a small imposition, but says that in the aggregate the campaign against him amounted to coercion to 
extract  the  easement  and  should  be  redressed  collectively. The  substance  of  Robbins's  claim,  and  the  degree  to  which 
existing  remedies  available  to  him  were  adequate,  can  be understood and assessed only by getting down to the details, 
which add up to a long recitation.2 In  the  summer  of  1994,  after  the  fruitless  telephone  con-
versation  in  June,  Vessels  wrote  to  Robbins  for  permission to survey his land in the area of the desired easement.  Rob-
bins said no, that it would be a waste of time for the Bureau to  do  a  survey  without  first  reaching  agreement  with  him. 
Vessels  went  ahead  with  a  survey  anyway,  trespassed  on Robbins's  land,  and  later  boasted  about  it  to  Robbins.  Not 
surprisingly, given  the  lack  of damage  to his  property, Rob-bins did not file a trespass complaint in response. 

Mutual  animosity  grew,  however,  and  one  Bureau  em-ployee,  Edward  Parodi,  was  told  by  his  superiors  to  "look 
closer"  and  "investigate  harder"  for  possible  trespasses  and other permit violations by Robbins.  App. 128-129.  Parodi

544  WILKIE  v.  ROBBINS 

Opinion of the Court 
also  heard  colleagues  make  certain  disparaging  remarks 
about  Robbins,  such  as  referring  to  him  as  "the  rich  SOB 
from  Alabama  [who]  got  [the  Ranch]."  Id.,  at  121.  Parodi 
became  convinced  that  the  Bureau  had  mistreated  Robbins 
and described its conduct as "the volcanic point" in his deci-
sion to retire.  Id., at 133. 

Vessels and his supervisor, defendant Charles Wilkie, con-
tinued  to  demand  the  easement,  under  threat  to  cancel  the 
reciprocal maintenance right-of-way that Nelson had negoti-
ated.  When Robbins would not budge, the Bureau canceled 
the right-of-way, citing Robbins's refusal to grant the desired 
easement  and  failure  even  to  pay  the  rental  fee.  Robbins 
did not appeal the cancellation to the Interior Board of Land 
Appeals  (IBLA)  or  seek  judicial  review  under  the  Adminis-
trative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 702. 

In  August  1995,  Robbins  brought  his  cattle  to  a  water 
source on property belonging to his neighbor, LaVonne Pen-
noyer.  An altercation ensued, and Pennoyer struck Robbins 
with  her  truck  while  he  was  riding  a  horse.  Plaintiff-
Appellee's  Supp.  App.  in  No.  04-8016  (CA10),  pp.  676-681

10  id.,  Pl.  Exh.  35a,  at  102-108.  Defendant  Gene  Leone 
fielded  a  call  from  Pennoyer  regarding  the  incident,  encour-
aged her to contact the sheriff, and himself placed calls to the 
sheriff  suggesting  that  Robbins  be  charged  with  trespass. 
After  the  incident,  Parodi  claims  that  Leone  told  him: 
" `I  think  I  finally  got  a  way  to  get  [Robbins's]  permits  and 
get him out of business.' "  App. 125, 126. 

In October 1995, the Bureau claimed various permit viola-
tions  and  changed  the  High  Island  Ranch's  5-year  SRUP  to 
a  SRUP  subject  to  annual  renewal.  According  to  Robbins, 
losing  the  5-year  SRUP  disrupted  his  guest  ranching  busi-
ness, owing to the resulting uncertainty about permission to 
conduct cattle drives.  Robbins declined to seek administra-
tive  review,  however,  in  part  because  Bureau  officials  told

Opinion of the Court 
him  that  the  process  would  be  lengthy  and  that  his  permit would be suspended until the IBLA reached a decision.

Beginning  in  1996, defendants brought administrative charges against Robbins for trespass and other land-use vio-

lations.  Robbins claimed some charges were false, and oth-ers unfairly selective enforcement, and he took all of them to 
be an effort to retaliate for refusing the Bureau's continuing demands for the easement.  He contested a number of these 
charges, but not all of them, administratively. In the spring of 1997, the South Fork Owl Creek Road, the 
only  way  to  reach  the  portions  of  the  ranch  in  the  Rock Creek  area,  became  impassable.  When  the  Bureau  refused 
to  repair  the  section  of  road  across  federal  land,  Robbins took  matters  into  his  own  hands  and  fixed  the  public  road 
himself,  even  though  the  Bureau  had  refused  permission. The Bureau fined Robbins for  trespass, but offered to settle 
the  charge  and  entertain  an  application  to  renew  the  old maintenance right-of-way.  Instead, Robbins appealed to the 
IBLA, which found that Robbins had admitted the unauthor-ized  repairs  when  he  sent  the  Bureau  a  bill  for  reimburse-
ment.  The  Board  upheld  the  fine,  In  re  Robbins,  146 I.  B.  L.  A.  213  (1998),  and  rejected  Robbins's  claim  that  the 
Bureau  was  trying  to  " `blackmail' "  him  into  providing  the easement; it  said  that "[t]he  record  effectively  shows . .  . in-
transigence was the tactic of Robbins, not [the] BLM."  Id., at  219.  Robbins  did  not  seek  judicial  review  of  the  IBLA's 
decision. In July 1997, defendant Teryl Shryack and a colleague en-
tered Robbins's property, claiming the terms of a fence ease-ment  as  authority.  Robbins  accused  Shryack  of  unlawful 

3 According  to  Robbins,  Bureau  officials  neglected  to  mention  his  right 
to seek  a stay  of the Bureau's adverse  action pending  the IBLA's resolu-
tion  of  his  appeal.  See  43  CFR  $ 4.21  (2006).  Such  a  stay,  if  granted, 
would  have  permitted  Robbins  to  continue  to  operate  under  the  5-year 
SRUP.

entry, tore up the written instrument, and ordered her off his property.  Later that month, after a meeting about trespass 

issues  with  Bureau  officials,  Michael  Miller,  a  Bureau  law enforcement officer, questioned Robbins without advance no-
tice  and  without  counsel  about  the  incident  with  Shryack. The  upshot  was  a  charge  with  two  counts  of  knowingly  and 
forcibly  impeding  and  interfering  with  a  federal  employee, 
in  violation  of  18  U. S. C.  $ 111  (2000  ed.  and  Supp.  IV),  a crime  with  a  penalty  of  up  to  one  year  in  prison.  A  jury 

acquitted  Robbins  in  December,  after  deliberating  less  than 30  minutes. 

United  States  v.  Robbins,  179  F.  3d  1268,  1269 
(CA10  1999).  According  to  a  news  story,  the  jurors  "were 
appalled at the actions of the government" and one said that 
"Robbins could not have been railroaded any worse . . . if he  
worked  for  the  Union  Pacific."  CA10  App.  852.  Robbins 
then moved for attorney's fees under the Hyde Amendment, 

$ 617,  111  Stat.  2519,  note  following  18  U. S. C.  $ 3006A,  ar-
guing  that  the  position  of  the  United  States  was  vexatious, 
frivolous, or in bad faith.  The trial judge denied the motion, 
and Robbins appealed too late.  See 179 F. 3d, at 1269-1270. 

In  1998,  Robbins  brought  the  lawsuit  now  before  us, 
though  there  was  further  vexation  to  come.  In  June  1999, 
the Bureau denied Robbins's application to renew his annual 
SRUP, based on an accumulation of land-use penalties levied 
against  him.  Robbins  appealed,  the  IBLA  affirmed,  In  re 
Robbins, 154  I.  B.  L. A. 93  (2000),  and  Robbins did  not  seek 
judicial  review.  Then,  in  August,  the  Bureau  revoked  the 
grazing permit for High Island Ranch, claiming that Robbins 
had  violated  its  terms  when  he  kept  Bureau  officials  from 
passing  over  his  property  to  reach  public  lands.  Robbins 
appealed  to the  IBLA, which stayed the  revocation  pending 
resolution  of  the  appeal.  Order  in  Robbins  v.  Bureau  of 
Land  Management,  IBLA  2000-12  (Nov.  10,  1999),  CA10

Opinion of the Court 
cattle drives away from federal land and through a mountain pass  with  unmarked  property  boundaries.  In  August  2000, 

Vessels  and  defendants  Darrell  Barnes  and  Miller  tried  to catch  Robbins  trespassing  in  driving  cattle  over  a  corner  of 
land  administered  by  the  Bureau.  From  a  nearby  hilltop, they  videotaped  ranch  guests  during  the  drive,  even  while 
the  guests  sought  privacy  to  relieve  themselves.  That  af-ternoon,  Robbins  alleges,  Barnes  and  Miller  broke  into  his 
guest  lodge,  left  trash  inside,  and  departed  without  closing the lodge gates. 

The  next  summer,  defendant  David  Wallace  spoke  with Preston  Smith,  an  employee  of  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs 
who  manages  lands  along  the  High  Island  Ranch's  southern border,  and  pressured  him  to  impound  Robbins's  cattle. 
Smith told Robbins, but did nothing more. Finally,  in  January  2003,  tension  actually  cooled  to  the 
point that Robbins and the Bureau entered into a settlement agreement that, among other things, established a procedure 
for informal resolution of future grazing disputes and stayed 16  pending  administrative  appeals  with  a  view  to  their  ulti-
mate dismissal, provided that Robbins did not violate certain Bureau  regulations  for  a  2-year  period.  The  settlement 
came  apart,  however,  in  January  2004,  when  the  Bureau began formal trespass proceedings against Robbins and uni-
laterally  voided  the  settlement  agreement.  Robbins  tried to  enforce  the  agreement  in  federal  court,  but  a  District 
Court  denied  relief  in  a  decision  affirmed  by  the  Court  of Appeals  in  February  2006. 

Robbins  v.  Bureau  of  Land Management, 438 F. 3d 1074 (CA10). 

C 
In this lawsuit (brought, as we said, in 1998), Robbins asks for  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  as  well  as  declara-

tory  and  injunctive  relief.  Although  he  originally  included the  United  States  as  a  defendant,  he  voluntarily  dismissed 
the  Government,  and  pressed  forward  with  a  RICO  claim

548  WILKIE  v.  ROBBINS 

Opinion of the Court 
charging  defendants  with  repeatedly  trying  to  extort  an 
easement  from  him,  as  well  as  a  similarly  grounded  Bivens 
claim that defendants violated his Fourth and Fifth Amend-
ment rights.  Defendants filed a motion  to dismiss on quali-
fied immunity and failure to state a claim, which the District 
Court  granted,  holding  that  Robbins  inadequately  pleaded 
damages under RICO and that the APA and the Federal Tort 
Claims  Act  (FTCA),  28  U. S. C.  $ 1346,  were  effective  alter-
native remedies that precluded Bivens relief.  The Court of 
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed on both grounds, 300 
F. 3d  1208, 1211  (2002),  although  it  specified that  Bivens  re-
lief  was  available  only  for  those  "constitutional  violations 
committed by individual federal employees unrelated to final 
agency action," 300 F. 3d, at 1212. 

On remand, defendants again moved to dismiss on qualified 
immunity.  As to the RICO claim, the District Court denied 
the  motion;  as  to  Bivens,  it  dismissed  what  Robbins  called 
the  Fourth  Amendment  claim  for  malicious  prosecution  and 
those under the Fifth Amendment for due process violations, 
but it  declined to dismiss  the  Fifth  Amendment claim  of re-
taliation  for  the  exercise  of  Robbins's  right  to  exclude  the 
Government  from  his  property  and  to  refuse  any  grant  of  a 
property interest  without compensation.  After  limited dis-
covery,  defendants  again  moved  for  summary  judgment  on 
qualified  immunity.  The  District  Court  adhered  to  its  ear-
lier denial. 

This  time,  the  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed,  after  dealing 
with collateral order jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory 
appeal of the denial of qualified immunity, 433 F. 3d 755, 761 
(2006)  (citing  Mitchell  v.  Forsyth,  472  U. S.  511,  530  (1985)). 
It held that Robbins had a clearly established right to be free 
from retaliation for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to 
exclude the Government from his private property, 433 F. 3d, 
at  765-767,  and  it  explained  that  Robbins  could  go  forward 
with  the  RICO  claim  because  Government  employees  who

Opinion of the Court 
"engag[e]  in  lawful  actions  with  an  intent  to  extort  a  right-of-way  from  [a  landowner]  rather  than  with  an  intent  to 

merely  carry  out  their  regulatory  duties"  commit  extortion under  Wyoming  law  and  within  the  meaning  of  the  Hobbs 
Act,  18  U. S. C.  $ 1951,  433  F.  3d,  at  768.  The  Court  of  Ap-peals  rejected  the  defense  based  on  a  claim  of  the  Govern-
ment's  legal  entitlement  to  demand  the  disputed  easement: "if  an  official  obtains  property  that  he  has  lawful  authority 
to obtain, but does so in a wrongful manner, his conduct con-stitutes  extortion  under  the  Hobbs  Act." 

Id.,  at  769.  Fi-nally, the Court of Appeals said again  that "Robbins'[s] alle-

gations  involving  individual  action  unrelated  to  final  agency action  are  permitted  under 

Bivens."  Id.,  at  772.  The  ap-peals  court  declined  defendants'  request  "to  determine 

which allegations remain and which are precluded," however, because defendants had not asked the District Court to sort 
them out.  Ibid. We  granted  certiorari,  549  U. S.  1075  (2006),  and  now 
reverse.  II 

The first question is whether to devise a new Bivens dam-ages action  for retaliating against the  exercise of ownership 
rights, in addition to the discrete administrative and judicial remedies  available  to  a  landowner  like  Robbins  in  dealing 
with  the  Government's  employees.4  Bivens,  403  U. S.  388, held  that  the  victim  of  a  Fourth  Amendment  violation  by 
federal  officers  had  a  claim  for  damages,  and  in  the  years following  we  have  recognized  two  more  nonstatutory  dam-
ages remedies, the first for employment discrimination in vi-

4 We  recognized  just  last  Term  that  the  definition  of  an  element  of  the 
asserted cause of action was "directly implicated  by the defense  of quali-
fied immunity and properly before us on interlocutory appeal."  Hartman 
v.  Moore,  547  U. S.  250,  257,  n.  5  (2006).  Because  the  same  reasoning 
applies  to  the  recognition  of  the  entire  cause  of  action,  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals had jurisdiction over this issue, as do we.

olation  of  the  Due  Process  Clause,  Davis  v.  Passman,  442 U. S.  228  (1979),  and  the  second  for  an  Eighth  Amendment 

violation  by  prison  officials,  Carlson  v.  Green,  446  U. S.  14 (1980).  But  we  have  also  held  that  any  freestanding  dam-
ages  remedy  for  a  claimed  constitutional  violation  has  to represent  a  judgment  about  the  best  way  to  implement  a 
constitutional  guarantee;  it  is  not  an  automatic  entitlement 
no  matter  what  other  means  there  may  be  to  vindicate  a protected  interest,  and  in  most  instances  we  have  found 

a  Bivens  remedy  unjustified.  We  have  accordingly  held against applying the 

Bivens model to claims of First Amend-
ment  violations  by  federal  employers,  Bush  v.  Lucas,  462 
U. S. 367 (1983), harm to military personnel through activity 
incident  to  service,  United  States  v.  Stanley,  483  U. S.  669 
(1987); Chappell v.  Wallace, 462 U. S. 296 (1983), and wrong-
ful denials of Social Security disability benefits, Schweiker v. 
Chilicky,  487  U. S.  412  (1988).  We  have  seen  no  case  for 
extending  Bivens  to  claims  against  federal  agencies,  FDIC 

v.  Meyer,  510  U. S.  471  (1994),  or  against  private  prisons, 
Correctional Services  Corp. v.  Malesko,  534  U. S.  61  (2001). 

Whatever  the  ultimate  conclusion,  however,  our  consider-
ation of a Bivens request follows a familiar sequence, and on 
the assumption that a constitutionally recognized  interest is 
adversely  affected  by  the  actions  of  federal  employees,  the 
decision whether to recognize a Bivens remedy may require 
two steps.  In  the  first place,  there is  the  question  whether 
any  alternative,  existing  process  for  protecting  the  interest 
amounts  to  a  convincing  reason  for  the  Judicial  Branch  to 
refrain  from  providing  a  new  and  freestanding  remedy  in 
damages.  Bush, supra, at 378.  But even in the absence of 
an  alternative,  a  Bivens  remedy  is  a  subject  of  judgment: 
"the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determi-
nation that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying 
particular  heed,  however,  to  any  special  factors  counselling 
hesitation  before  authorizing  a  new  kind  of  federal  litiga-
tion."  Bush, supra, at 378.

Opinion of the Court 

A 
In  this  factually  plentiful  case,  assessing  the  significance of any alternative remedies at step one has to begin by cate-

gorizing the difficulties Robbins experienced in dealing with the Bureau.  We think they can be separated into four main 
groups:  torts  or  tort-like  injuries  inflicted  on  him,  charges brought  against  him,  unfavorable  agency  actions,  and  offen-
sive  behavior  by  Bureau  employees  falling  outside  those three categories. 

Tortious harm inflicted on him includes Vessels's unauthor-ized  survey  of  the  terrain  of  the  desired  easement  and  the 
illegal entry into the lodge, and in each instance, Robbins had a civil remedy in damages for trespass.  Understandably, he 
brought  no  such  action  after  learning  about  the  survey, which  was  doubtless  annoying  but  not  physically  damaging. 
For  the  incident  at  the  lodge,  he  chose  not  to  pursue  a  tort remedy,  though  there  is  no  question  that  one  was  available 
to  him  if  he  could  prove  his  allegations.  Cf.  Correctional 
Services  Corp.,  supra,  at  72-73  (considering  availability  of state  tort  remedies  in  refusing  to  recognize  a  Bivens 

remedy). The  charges  brought  against  Robbins  include  a  series  of 
administrative  claims  for  trespass  and  other  land-use  viola-tions,  a  fine  for  the  unauthorized  road  repair  in  1997,  and 
the  two  criminal  charges  that  same  year.  Robbins  had  the opportunity  to  contest  all  of  the  administrative  charges;  he 
did fight some (but not all) of the various  land-use and tres-pass  citations,  and  he  challenged  the  road  repair  fine  as  far 
as  the  IBLA,  though  he  did  not  take  advantage  of  judicial review  when  he  lost  in  that  tribunal.

5  He  exercised  his 

5 There was some uncertainty, if not inconsistency, about the willingness 
of  the  IBLA  to  entertain  the  sorts  of  claims  Robbins  advances  here. 
Compare  In re Robbins,  146 I.  B. L. A.  213, 219 (1998) (rejecting a  claim 
of " `blackmail' " on the merits), with Robbins v.  Bureau of Land Manage-
ment,  170  I.  B.  L.  A.  219,  226  (2006)  (holding  that  "the  trespass  decision 
must be upheld regardless of BLM's motive in issuing the decision").  In

Opinion of the Court 
right  to  jury  trial  on  the  criminal  complaints,  and  although the  rapid  acquittal  tended  to  support  his  charge  of  baseless 

action  by  the  prosecution  (egged  on  by  Bureau  employees), the federal judge who presided at the trial did not think the 
Government's  case  thin  enough  to  justify  awarding  attor-ney's fees, and Robbins's appeal from that  decision was late. 
See  Robbins,  179  F.  3d,  at  1269-1270.  The  trial  judge's  de-nial  of  fees  may  reflect  facts  that  dissuaded  Robbins  from 
bringing a state-law action for malicious prosecution, though it is also possible that a remedy would have been unavailable 
against  federal  officials,  see  Blake  v.  Rupe,  651  P.  2d  1096, 1107  (Wyo.  1982)  ("Malicious  prosecution  is  not  an  action 
available  against  a  law  enforcement  official"). 6  For  each charge, in any event, Robbins had some procedure to defend 
and make good on his  position.  He took advantage of some opportunities,  and  let  others  pass;  although  he  had  mixed 
success, he had the means to be heard. The  more  conventional  agency  action  included  the  1995 
cancellation of the right-of-way in Robbins's favor (originally given in return for the unrecorded easement for the Govern-
ment's  benefit);  the  1995  decision  to  reduce  the  SRUP  from five  years  to  one;  the  termination  of  the  SRUP  in  1999;  and 
the  revocation  of  the  grazing  permit  that  same  year.  Each time,  the  Bureau  claimed  that  Robbins  was  at fault,  and  for 
each  claim,  administrative  review  was  available,  subject  to ultimate  judicial  review  under  the  APA.  Robbins  took  no 

any event, he could have advanced the claims in federal court whether or 
not  the  IBLA  was  willing  to  listen  to  them.  Cf.  In  re  Robbins,  167 
I.  B.  L.  A.  239,  241  (2005)  (noting  that  Robbins  "concede[d]  that  these 
assertions  [of  equal  protection  violations  and  harassment]  are  properly 
cognizable by a court and he raise[d] them only to preserve them as part 
of the record"). 

6 Robbins brought a Fourth Amendment claim for malicious prosecution 

in  this  litigation,  but  the  District  Court  dismissed  it,  Robbins  v.  Bureau 
of  Land  Management,  252  F.  Supp.  2d  1286,  1295-1298  (Wyo.  2003),  and

Opinion of the Court 
appeal from the 1995 decisions, stopped after losing an IBLA appeal  of  the  SRUP  denial,  and  obtained  a  stay  from  the 

IBLA of the Bureau's revocation of the grazing permit. Three  events  elude  classification.  The  1995  incident  in 
which  Robbins's  horse  was  struck  primarily  involved  Rob-
bins and his neighbor, not the  Bureau, and the  sheriff never 
brought criminal charges.  The videotaping  of ranch guests 
during  the  2000  drive,  while  no  doubt  thoroughly  irritating 
and  bad  for  business,  may  not  have  been  unlawful,  depend-
ing,  among  other  things,  upon  the  location  on  public  or  pri-
vate  land  of  the  people  photographed.  Cf.  Restatement 
(Second)  of  Torts  $ 652B  (1976)  (defining  tort  of  intrusion 
upon seclusion).7  Even if a tort was committed, it is unclear 
whether  Robbins,  rather  than  his  guests,  would  be  the 
proper  plaintiff,  or  whether  the  tort  should  be  chargeable 
against  the  Government  (as  distinct  from  employees)  under 
the  FTCA,  cf.  Carlson,  446  U. S.,  at  19-20  (holding  that 
FTCA  and  Bivens  remedies  were  "parallel,  complementary 

causes  of  action"  and  that  the  availability  of  the  former  did 
not  preempt  the  latter).  The  significance  of  Wallace's  2001 
attempt  to pressure  Smith  into  impounding  Robbins's  cattle 
is  likewise  up  in  the  air.  The  legitimacy  of  any  impound-
ment  that  might  have  occurred  would  presumably  have  de-
pended on where particular cattle were on the patchwork of 
private  and  public  lands,  and  in  any  event,  Smith  never 
impounded any. 

In  sum,  Robbins  has  an  administrative,  and  ultimately  a 
judicial,  process  for  vindicating  virtually  all  of  his  com-
plaints.  He  suffered  no  charges  of  wrongdoing  on  his  own 
part  without  an  opportunity  to  defend  himself  (and,  in  the 
case  of  the  criminal  charges,  to  recoup  the  consequent  ex-
pense,  though  a  judge  found  his  claim  wanting).  And  final 
agency action, as in canceling permits, for example, was open

Opinion of the Court 
to administrative and judicial review, as the Court of Appeals realized, 433 F. 3d, at 772. 

This state of the law gives Robbins no intuitively meritori-ous case for recognizing a new constitutional cause of action, 
but neither does it plainly answer no to the question whether he  should  have  it.  Like  the  combination  of  public  and  pri-
vate land ownership around the ranch, the forums of defense and redress open to Robbins are a patchwork, an assemblage 
of  state  and  federal,  administrative  and  judicial  benches applying  regulations,  statutes,  and  common  law  rules.  It 
would be hard to infer that Congress expected the Judiciary to stay its 

Bivens hand, but equally hard to extract any clear lesson  that  Bivens  ought  to  spawn  a  new  claim.  Compare 

Bush,  462  U. S.,  at  388  (refusing  to  create  a  Bivens  remedy when faced with "an elaborate remedial system that has been 
constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy  considerations");  and 

Schweiker,  487  U. S.,  at  426 ("Congress  chose  specific  forms  and  levels  of  protection  for 

the rights of persons affected"), with Bivens, 403 U. S., at 397 (finding  "no  explicit  congressional  declaration  that  persons 
injured  [in  this  way]  may  not  recover  money  damages  from the agents, but must instead be remitted to another remedy, 
equally effective in the view of Congress"). 

B 
This, then, is a case for Bivens step two, for weighing rea-sons  for  and  against  the  creation  of  a  new  cause  of  action, 

the  way  common  law  judges  have  always  done.  See  Bush, 
supra,  at  378.  Here,  the  competing  arguments  boil  down to  one  on  a  side:  from  Robbins,  the  inadequacy  of  discrete, 

incident-by-incident remedies; and from the Government and its  employees,  the  difficulty  of  defining  limits  to  legitimate 
zeal on the  public's behalf  in  situations  where hard  bargain-ing  is  to  be  expected  in  the  back-and-forth  between  public 
and  private  interests  that  the  Government's  employees  en-gage in every day.

Opinion of the Court 

1 
As  we  said,  when  the  incidents  are  examined  one  by  one, 
Robbins's situation does not call for creating a constitutional 
cause of action for want of other means of vindication, so he 
is  unlike  the  plaintiffs  in  cases  recognizing  freestanding 
claims:  Davis  had  no  other  remedy,  Bivens  himself  was  not 
thought to have an effective one, and in Carlson the plaintiff 
had  none  against  Government  officials.  Davis,  442  U. S.,  at 
245  ("For  Davis,  as  for  Bivens,  `it  is  damages  or  nothing' " 
(quoting Bivens, supra, at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judg-
ment)));  Carlson,  supra,  at  23  ("[W]e  cannot  hold  that  Con-
gress  relegated  respondent  exclusively  to  the  FTCA  rem-
edy" against the Government). 

But  Robbins's  argument  for  a  remedy  that  looks  at  the 
course of dealing  as a whole, not  simply as so many  individ-
ual incidents, has the force of the metaphor Robbins invokes, 
"death by a thousand cuts."  Brief for Respondent 40.  It is 
one  thing  to  be  threatened  with  the  loss  of  grazing  rights, 
or  to  be  prosecuted,  or  to  have  one's  lodge  broken  into,  but 
something else to be subjected to this in combination over a 
period  of  six  years,  by  a  series  of  public  officials  bent  on 
making life difficult.  Agency appeals, lawsuits, and criminal 
defense  take money,  and endless  battling  depletes  the  spirit 
along  with  the  purse.  The  whole  here  is  greater  than  the 
sum of its parts. 

2 

On  the  other  side  of  the  ledger  there  is  a  difficulty  in  de-
fining  a  workable  cause  of  action.  Robbins  describes  the 
wrong here as retaliation for standing on his right as a prop-
erty  owner  to  keep  the  Government  out  (by  refusing  a  free 
replacement for the right-of-way it had lost), and the mention 
of  retaliation  brings  with  it  a  tailwind  of  support  from  our 
longstanding  recognition  that  the  Government  may  not  re-
taliate  for  exercising  First  Amendment  speech  rights,  see 
Rankin v.  McPherson, 483 U. S. 378 (1987), or certain others

of  constitutional  rank,  see,  e. g.,  Lefkowitz  v.  Turley,  414 U. S.  70  (1973)  (Fifth  Amendment  privilege  against  self-

incrimination); United States v.  Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968) (Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury). 

But on closer look, the claim against the Bureau's employ-ees  fails  to  fit  the  prior  retaliation  cases.  Those cases  turn 
on an allegation of impermissible purpose and motivation; an employee  who  spoke  out  on  matters  of  public  concern  and 
then  was  fired,  for  example,  would  need  to  "prove  that  the conduct  at  issue  was  constitutionally  protected,  and  that  it 
was  a  substantial  or  motivating  factor  in  the  termination." 
Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v.  Umbehr, 518 U. S. 668, 675  (1996).  In  its  defense,  the  Government  may  respond 

that  the  firing  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  protected  speech, or  that  "it  would  have  taken  the  same  action  even  in  the 
absence of the protected conduct."  Ibid.  In short, the out-come  turns  on  "what  for"  questions:  what  was  the  Govern-
ment's  purpose  in  firing  him  and  would  he  have  been  fired anyway?  Questions  like  these  have  definite  answers,  and 
we have established methods for identifying the presence of an  illicit  reason  (in  competition  with  others),  not  only  in  re-
taliation cases but on claims  of discrimination based on race or  other  characteristics.  See  McDonnell  Douglas  Corp.  v. 
Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973). But  a  Bivens  case  by  Robbins  could  not  be  resolved 
merely  by  answering  a  "what  for"  question  or  two.  All agree that the Bureau's employees intended to convince Rob-
bins  to  grant  an  easement.8  But  unlike  punishing  someone for  speaking  out  against  the  Government,  trying  to  induce 
someone  to  grant  an  easement  for  public  use  is  a  perfectly legitimate  purpose:  as  a  landowner,  the  Government  may 
have, and  in  this  instance  does  have, a  valid interest in  get-

8 This is the "simple" question Robbins presents for review: "[C]an gov-
ernment officials avoid the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against taking 
property  without  just  compensation  by  using  their  regulatory  powers  to 
harass,  punish,  and  coerce  a  private  citizen  into  giving  the  Government 
his property without payment?"  Brief for Respondent 21.

Opinion of the Court 
ting  access  to  neighboring  lands.  The  "what  for"  question thus has a ready answer in terms of lawful conduct. 

Robbins's challenge, therefore, is not to the object the Gov-ernment  seeks  to  achieve,  and  for  the  most  part  his  argu-
ment is not that the means the Government used were neces-sarily  illegitimate;  rather,  he  says  that  defendants  simply 
demanded  too  much  and went  too  far.  But as  soon as  Rob-bins's  claim  is  framed  this  way,  the  line-drawing  difficulties 
it  creates  are  immediately  apparent.  A  "too  much"  kind  of liability standard (if standard at all) can never be as reliable 
a guide to conduct and to any subsequent liability as a "what for"  standard,  and  that  reason  counts  against  recognizing 
freestanding liability in a case like this. The impossibility of fitting Robbins's claim into the simple 
"what for" framework is demonstrated, repeatedly, by recall-ing  the  various  actions  he  complains  about.  Most  of  them, 
such as strictly enforcing rules against trespass or conditions on  grazing  permits,  are  legitimate  tactics  designed  to  im-
prove the Government's negotiating position.  Just as a pri-vate  landowner,  when  frustrated  at  a  neighbor's  stubborn-
ness in refusing an easement, may press charges of trespass every  time  a  cow  wanders  across  the  property  line  or  call 
the  authorities  to  report  every  land-use  violation,  the  Gov-ernment too may stand firm on its rights and use its power to 
protect public property interests.  Though Robbins protests that the Government was trying to extract the easement for 
free  instead  of  negotiating,  that  line  is  slippery  even  in  this case; the Government was not offering to buy the easement, 
but it did have valuable things to offer in exchange, like con-tinued  permission  for  Robbins  to  use  Government  land  on 
favorable  terms  (at  least  to  the  degree  that  the  terms  of  a permit were subject to discretion).

558  WILKIE  v.  ROBBINS 

Opinion of the Court 
It  is  true  that  the  Government  is  no  ordinary  landowner, with its immense economic power, its role as trustee for the 

public, its right to cater to particular segments of the public (like the recreational users who would take advantage of the 
right-of-way to get to remote tracts), and its wide discretion to  bring  enforcement  actions.  But  in  many  ways,  the  Gov-
ernment  deals  with  its  neighbors  as  one  owner  among  the rest  (albeit  a  powerful  one).  Each  may  seek  benefits  from 
the  others,  and  each  may  refuse  to  deal  with  the  others  by insisting  on  valuable  consideration  for  anything  in  return. 
And  as  a  potential  contracting  party,  each  neighbor  is  enti-tled to drive a hard bargain, as even Robbins acknowledges, 
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-32.  That, after all, is what Robbins did  by  flatly  refusing  to  regrant  the  easement  without  fur-
ther  recompense,  and  that  is  what  the  defendant  employees did  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  So  long  as  they  had  au-
thority  to  withhold  or  withdraw  permission  to  use  Govern-ment land and to enforce the trespass and land-use rules (as 
the  IBLA  confirmed  that  they  did  have  at  least  most  of  the time),  they  were  within  their  rights  to  make  it  plain  that 
Robbins's willingness to give the easement would determine how complaisant they would be about his trespasses on pub-
lic  land,  when  they  had  discretion  to  enforce  the  law  to  the letter.

10 

this case, Robbins could not obtain relief without also satisfying an unspec-
ified, and unworkable, "too much" standard.

Opinion of the Court 
Robbins  does  make  a  few  allegations,  like  the  unauthor-ized  survey  and  the  unlawful  entry  into  the  lodge,  that 

charge  defendants  with  illegal  action  plainly  going  beyond 
thing that irritates the defendant official; the question is whether the offi-
cial's  later action against the  plaintiff was taken for a legitimate  purpose 
(firing  to  rid  the  work  force  of  a  substandard  performer,  for example)  or 
for the purpose of punishing for the exercise of a constitutional right (that 
is, retaliation, probably motivated by spite).  The plaintiff's action is over 
and  done  with,  and  the  only  question  is  the  defendant's  purpose,  which 
may be maliciously motivated. 

In  this  case,  however,  the  past  act  or  acts  (refusing  the  right-of-way 
without  compensation)  are  simply  particular  steps  in  an  ongoing  refusal 
to  grant  requests  for  a  right-of-way.  The  purpose  of  the  continuing  re-
quests  is  lawful  (the  Government  still  could  use  the  right-of-way),  and 
there  are  actions  the  Government  may  lawfully  take  to  induce  or  coerce 
Robbins  to  end  his  refusal  (presumably  like  canceling  the  nonpermanent 
reciprocal  right-of-way  originally  given  to  Nelson).  The  action  claimed 
to be retaliatory may gratify malice in the heart of the official who takes 
it,  but the official act  remains an instance  of hard  bargaining intended to 
induce  the  plaintiff  to  come  to  legitimate  terms.  We  do  not  understand 
Robbins  to  contend  that  malice  alone,  as  distinguished  from  malice  com-
bined with the desire to acquire an easement, caused defendants to act the 
way they did.  See Brief for Respondent 21 (accusing defendants of "using 
their regulatory powers to harass, punish, and coerce a private citizen into 
giving  the  Government  his  property  without  payment");  but  cf.  post,  at 
578-579,  n.  3  (Ginsburg,

Opinion of the Court 
hard  bargaining.  If  those  were  the  only  coercive  acts charged,  Robbins  could  avoid  the  "too  much"  problem  by 

fairly describing the Government behavior alleged as illegal-ity  in  attempting  to  obtain  a  property  interest  for  nothing, 
but  that  is  not  a  fair  summary  of  the  body  of  allegations 
before  us,  according  to which  defendants'  improper  exercise 
of  the  Government's  "regulatory  powers"  is  essential  to  the 
claim.  Brief  for  Respondent  21.  (Of  course,  even  in  that 
simpler  case,  the  tort  or  torts  by  Government  employees 
would  be  so clearly  actionable  under  the  general law  that  it 
would  furnish  only  the  weakest  argument  for  recognizing  a 
generally available constitutional tort.)  Rather, the bulk of 
Robbins's charges go to actions that, on their own, fall within 
the Government's enforcement power. 

It would not answer the concerns just expressed to change 
conceptual  gears  and  consider  the  more  abstract  concept  of 
liability  for  retaliatory  or  undue  pressure  on  a  property 
owner  for  standing  firm  on  property  rights;  looking  at  the 

tionally retaliatory, even if it would otherwise have been done in the name 
of  legitimate  hard  bargaining.  The  motive-is-all  test  is  not  the  law  of 
our retaliation precedent.  If a spiteful heart rendered any official efforts 
actionable  as  unconstitutional  retaliation,  our  retaliation  discharge  cases 
would  have  asked  not only  whether  the  plaintiff  was  fired  for  cause  (and 
would  have  been  fired  for  cause  anyway),  but  whether  the  official  who 
discharged  the  plaintiff  tainted  any  legitimate  purpose  with  spitefulness 
in  firing  this  particular,  outspoken  critic.  But  we  have  taken  no  such 
position; to the contrary, we have held that proof that the action was inde-
pendently  justified  on  grounds  other  than  the  improper  one  defeats  the 
claim.  See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.  Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287 (1977). 
Any other approach would have frustrated an employer's legitimate inter-
est  in securing  a  competent  work  force  (comparable  to  the  Government's 
interest as a landowner here), and would have introduced the complication 
of  proving  motive  even  in  cases  in  which  the  action  taken  was  plainly 
legitimate.

Opinion of the Court 
claim  that  way  would  not  eliminate  the  problem  of  degree, and  it  would  raise  a  further  reason  to  balk  at  recognizing  a 

Bivens claim.  For at this high  level of generality, a Bivens action to redress retaliation against those who resist Govern-
ment  impositions  on  their  property  rights  would  invite claims  in  every  sphere  of  legitimate  governmental  action 
affecting  property  interests,  from  negotiating  tax  claim settlements  to  enforcing  Occupational  Safety  and  Health 
Administration  regulations.  Exercising  any  governmental authority  affecting  the  value  or  enjoyment  of  property 

interests  would  fall  within  the  Bivens  regime,  and  across this  enormous  swath  of  potential  litigation  would  hover  the 
difficulty of devising a "too much" standard that could guide an employee's conduct and a judicial factfinder's conclusion.

11 

The point here is not to deny that Government employees sometimes  overreach,  for  of  course  they  do,  and  they  may 

have done  so  here  if  all the  allegations  are  true.  The point 
is  the  reasonable  fear  that  a  general  Bivens  cure  would  be 
worse than the disease.  C 

In sum, defendants were acting in the name of the Bureau, 
which  had  the  authority  to  grant  (and  had  given)  Robbins 
some  use  of  public  lands  under  its  control  and  wanted  a right-of-way in return.  Defendants bargained hard by capi-

talizing on their discretionary authority and Robbins's viola-tions of various permit terms, though truculence was appar-
ent  on  both  sides.  One  of  the  defendants,  at  least,  clearly

Opinion of the Court 
crossed the  line into  impermissible  conduct in  breaking  into Robbins's lodge, although it is not clear from the record that 

any  other  action  by  defendants  was  more  serious  than garden-variety  trespass,  and  the  Government  has  success-
fully  defended  every  decision  to  eliminate  Robbins's  per-mission  to  use  public  lands  in  the  ways  he  had  previously 
enjoyed.  Robbins  had  ready  at  hand  a  wide  variety  of 
administrative  and  judicial  remedies  to  redress  his  injuries. The proposal, nonetheless, to create a new 

Bivens remedy to 
redress  such  injuries  collectively  on  a  theory  of  retaliation for  exercising his  property right  to  exclude, or  on  a  general 

theory  of  unjustifiably  burdening  his  rights  as  a  property 
owner, raises a serious difficulty of devising a workable cause 
of  action.  A  judicial  standard  to  identify  illegitimate  pres-
sure  going  beyond  legitimately  hard  bargaining  would  be 
endlessly  knotty  to  work  out,  and  a  general  provision  for 
tortlike  liability  when  Government  employees  are  unduly 
zealous  in  pressing  a  governmental  interest  affecting  prop-
erty would invite an onslaught of Bivens actions. 

We think accordingly that any damages remedy for actions 
by  Government  employees  who  push  too  hard  for  the  Gov-
ernment's benefit may come better, if at all, through legisla-
tion.  "Congress  is  in  a  far  better  position  than  a  court  to 
evaluate  the  impact  of  a  new  species  of  litigation"  against 
those who act on the public's behalf.  Bush, 462 U. S., at 389. 
And  Congress  can  tailor  any  remedy  to  the  problem  per-
ceived,  thus  lessening  the  risk  of  raising  a  tide  of  suits 
threatening  legitimate  initiative  on  the  part  of  the  Govern-
ment's  employees.  Ibid.  ("[Congress]  may  inform  itself 
through factfinding procedures such as hearings that are not 
available  to  the  courts");  cf.  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U. S. 
800,  814  (1982)  (recognizing  "the  danger  that  fear  of  being 
sued  will  dampen  the  ardor  of  all  but  the  most  resolute,  or 
the most irresponsible public officials, in the unflinching dis-
charge of their duties" (internal quotation marks and brack-
ets omitted)).

Opinion of the Court 

III 
Robbins's  other  claim  is  under  RICO,  which  gives  civil remedies to "[a]ny person injured in his business or property 

by  reason  of  a  violation  of  [18  U. S. C.  $ 1962]."  18  U. S. C. $ 1964(c).  Section  1962(c)  makes  it  a  crime  for  "any  person 
employed  by  or  associated  with  any  enterprise  engaged  in, or  the  activities  of  which  affect,  interstate  or  foreign  com-
merce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of rack-
eteering  activity."  RICO defines  "racketeering activity" to include "any act which is indictable under" the Hobbs Act as 
well as "any act or threat involving . . . extortion . . . , which  is  chargeable  under  State  law  and  punishable  by  imprison-
ment  for  more  than  one  year."  $$ 1961(1)(A)-(B)  (2000  ed., Supp. IV).  The Hobbs Act, finally, criminalizes interference 
with interstate commerce by extortion, along with attempts or conspiracies, $ 1951(a), extortion being defined as "the ob-
taining  of  property  from  another,  with  his  consent,  induced by  wrongful  use  of  actual  or  threatened  force,  violence,  or 
fear, or under color of official right," $ 1951(b)(2). Robbins charges  defendants  with violating  the  Hobbs Act 
by wrongfully trying to get the easement under color of offi-cial  right,  to  which  defendants  reply  with  a  call  to  dismiss 
the RICO claim for two independent reasons: the Hobbs Act does  not  apply  when  the  National  Government  is  the  in-
tended  beneficiary  of  the  allegedly  extortionate  acts;  and  a valid claim of entitlement to the disputed property is a com-
plete defense against extortion.  Because we agree with the first contention, we do not reach the second. 

The  Hobbs  Act  does  not  speak  explicitly  to  efforts  to  ob-tain  property  for  the  Government  rather  than  a  private 
party,  and  that  leaves  defendants'  contention  to  turn  on  the common  law  conception  of  "extortion,"  which  we  presume 
Congress  meant  to  incorporate  when  it  passed  the  Hobbs Act  in  1946.  See  Scheidler  v.  National  Organization  for 
Women,  Inc.,  537  U. S.  393,  402  (2003)  (construing  the  term

ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken"). 

"At  common  law,  extortion  was  a  property  offense  com-mitted  by  a  public  official  who  took  any  money  or  thing  of 
value that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office."

the  Laws  of  England  141  (1769),  and  citing  3  R.  Anderson, Wharton's  Criminal  Law  and  Procedure  $ 1393,  pp.  790- 
791  (1957);  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  In  short, "[e]xtortion  by  the  public  official  was  the  rough  equivalent 
of what we would now describe as `taking a bribe.' "  Evans, 
supra, at 260.  Thus, while Robbins is certainly correct that public  officials  were  not  immune  from  charges  of  extortion 

at  common  law,  see  Brief  for  Respondent  43,  the  crime  of extortion  focused  on  the  harm  of  public  corruption,  by  the 
sale of public favors for private gain, not on the harm caused by  overzealous  efforts  to  obtain  property  on  behalf  of  the 
Government.12 The  importance  of  the  line  between  public  and  private 
beneficiaries for common law and Hobbs Act extortion is con-

12 Although the legislative history of the Hobbs Act is generally "sparse 
and  unilluminating  with  respect  to  the  offense  of  extortion,"  Evans,  504 
U. S., at 264, we know that Congress patterned the Act after two sources 
of law:  "the Penal Code  of New York and the Field Code,  a 19th-century 
model penal code," Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 403.  In borrowing from these 
sources,  the  Hobbs  Act  expanded  the  scope  of  common  law  extortion  to 
include private perpetrators while retaining the core idea of extortion as 
a  species  of  corruption,  akin  to  bribery.  But  Robbins  provides  no  basis 
for believing that Congress thought of broadening the definition of extor-
tion under color of official right beyond its common law meaning.

Opinion of the Court 
firmed by our own case law, which is completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right undertaken 

for  the  sole  benefit  of  the  Government.  See,  e. g.,  McCor-
mick  v.  United  States,  500  U. S.  257,  273  (1991)  (discussing 
circumstances  in  which  public  official's  receipt  of  campaign contributions  constitutes  extortion  under  color  of  official 

right);  Evans,  supra,  at  257  (Hobbs  Act  prosecution  for  ex-
tortion  under  color  of  official  right,  where  public  official  ac-cepted  cash  in  exchange  for  favorable  votes  on  a  rezoning 

application);  United  States  v.  Gillock,  445  U. S.  360,  362 (1980)  (Hobbs  Act  prosecution  for  extortion  under  color  of 
official  right,  where  state  senator  accepted  money  in  ex-
change  for  blocking  a  defendant's  extradition  and  agreeing 
to  introduce  legislation);  cf.  United  States  v.  Deaver,  14  F. 
595, 597 (WDNC 1882) (under the "technical meaning [of ex-
tortion] in the  common law, . .  . [t]he officer must unlawfully 
and  corruptly  receive  such  money  or  article  of  value  for  his 
own  benefit  or  advantage").  More  tellingly  even,  Robbins 
has  cited  no  decision  by  any  court,  much  less  this  one,  from 
the entire 60-year period of the Hobbs Act that found extor-
tion in efforts of Government  employees to get property for 
the exclusive benefit of the Government. 

Of course, there is usually a case somewhere that provides 
comfort  for  just  about  any  claim.  Robbins  musters  two  for 
his  understanding  of  extortion  under  color  of  official  right, 
neither  of  which,  however,  addressed  the  beneficiary  ques-
tion with any care: People v.  Whaley, 6 Cow. 661 (N. Y. 1827), 
and  Willett  v.  Devoy,  170  App.  Div.  203,  155  N.  Y.  S.  920 
(1915).  Whaley  was  about  a  charge  of  extortion  against  a 
justice of the peace who wrongfully ordered a litigant to pay 
compensation  to  the  other  party  as  well  as  a  small  adminis-
trative fee to the court.  Because the case involved illegally 
obtaining property for the benefit of a private third party, it 
does not stand for the proposition that an act for the benefit 
of the Government alone can be extortion.  The second case, 
Willett,  again  from  New  York,  construed  a  provision  of  the

566  WILKIE  v.  ROBBINS 

Opinion of the Court 
State's  Public  Officers  Law.  That  statute  addressed  the problem  of  overcharging  by  public  officers,  see  4  Birdseye's 

Consol.  Laws  of  N.  Y.  Ann.,  Art.  V,  $ 67,  p.  4640  (1909),  and the  court's opinion on  it said  that common law extortion  did 
not  draw  any  distinction  "on  the  ground  that  the  official keeps the fee himself," 170 App. Div., at 204, 155 N. Y. S., at 
921.  But a single, two-page opinion from a state intermedi-ate 

appellate court issued in 1915 is not much indication that the  Hobbs  Act  was  adopted  in  1946  subject  to  the  under-

standing  that  common  law  extortion  was  spacious  enough to  cover  the  case  Robbins  states.  There  is  a  reason  he  is 
plumbing obscurity. 

Robbins points to what we said in United States v.  Green, 
350  U. S.  415,  420  (1956),  that  "extortion  as  defined  in  the 
[Hobbs  Act]  in no  way  depends upon having a  direct benefit 
conferred  on  the  person  who  obtains  the  property."  He  in-
fers  that  Congress  could  not  have  meant  to  prohibit  extor-
tionate acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but 
ignore  them  when  the  intended  beneficiary  is  the  Govern-
ment.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  47-48.  But  Congress 
could very well have meant just that; drawing a line between 
private  and  public  beneficiaries  prevents  suits  (not  just  re-
coveries)  against  public  officers  whose  jobs  are  to  obtain 
property owed to the Government.  So, without some other 
indication from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that 
the  Hobbs  Act  (let  alone  RICO)  was  intended  to  expose  all 
federal  employees,  whether  in  the  Bureau  of  Land  Manage-
ment, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency (OCC), or any other agency, to extor-
tion  charges  whenever  they  stretch  in  trying  to  enforce 
Government  property  claims.  See  Sinclair  v.  Hawke,  314 
F.  3d  934,  944  (CA8  2003)  (OCC  employees  "do  not  become 
racketeers  by  acting  like  aggressive  regulators").  As  we 
just suggested, Robbins does not face up to the real problem 
when  he  says  that  requiring  proof  of  a  wrongful  intent  to 
extort would shield well-intentioned Government employees

Opinion of the Court 
from liability.  It is not just final judgments, but the fear of criminal charges or civil claims for treble damages that could 

well  take  the  starch  out  of  regulators  who  are  supposed  to bargain and press demands vigorously  on behalf of the Gov-
ernment  and  the  public.  This  is  the  reason we  would  want to  see  some  text  in  the  Hobbs  Act  before  we  could  say  that 
Congress meant to go beyond the common law preoccupation with  official  corruption,  to  embrace  the  expansive  notion  of 
extortion Robbins urges on us. He  falls  back  to  the  argument  that  defendants  violated 
Wyoming's blackmail statute, see Wyo. Stat. Ann. $ 6-2-402 (2005),

13  which  he  says  is  a  separate  predicate  offense  for 

purposes of RICO liability.  But even assuming that defend-ants' conduct would be "chargeable under State law and pun-

ishable by imprisonment for more than one year," 18 U. S. C. $ 1961(1)(A),  it  cannot  qualify  as  a  predicate  offense  for  a 
RICO suit unless it is "capable of being generically classified as  extortionate,"  Scheidler,  537  U. S.,  at  409,  410;  accord, 
United States v.  Nardello, 393 U. S. 286, 296 (1969).  For the reasons just given, the conduct alleged does not fit the tradi-
tional  definition  of  extortion,  so  Robbins's  RICO  claim  does not survive on a theory of state-law derivation. 

* * * 
Because  neither  Bivens  nor  RICO  gives  Robbins  a  cause of action, there is no reason to enquire further into the mer-

its of his claim or the asserted defense of qualified immunity. The judgment of the Court of Appeals  for the Tenth Circuit 

13 Section 6-2-402 provides: 
"(a)  A  person  commits  blackmail  if,  with  the  intent  to  obtain  property 
of another or to compel action or inaction by any person against his will, 
the person: . . . . . 

"(ii) Accuses or threatens to accuse a person of a crime or immoral con-
duct  which  would  tend  to  degrade  or  disgrace  the  person  or  subject  him 
to the ridicule or contempt of society."

"limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed `only [at] exercises of 
congressional power' " under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  Valley 
Forge, supra, at 479.  Pp. 603-604. 

5.  The link  between congressional action and  constitutional violation 
that  supported  taxpayer  standing  in  Flast  is  missing  here.  Respond-
ents neither challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation 
nor ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legisla-
tively  created  program  as  unconstitutional.  That  is  because  the  ex-
penditures at issue were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress, but 
under  general  appropriations  to  the  Executive  Branch  to  fund  day-to-
day  activities.  These  appropriations  did  not  expressly  authorize,  di-
rect, or even mention the expenditures in question, which resulted from 
executive  discretion,  not  congressional  action.  The  Court  has  never 
found  taxpayer  standing  under  such  circumstances.  Bowen  v.  Ken-
drick, 487 U. S. 589, 619-620, distinguished.  Pp. 605-609. 

6.  Respondents argue to no avail that distinguishing between money 
spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the 
course of executive discretion is arbitrary because the injury to taxpay-
ers in both situations is the same as that targeted by the Establishment 
Clause  and Flast--the  expenditure  for  the support of  religion of  funds 
exacted  from  taxpayers.  But  Flast  focused  on  congressional  action, 
and the invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Ex-
ecutive Branch expenditures must be declined.  The Court has repeat-
edly  emphasized  that  the  Flast  exception  has  a  "narrow  application," 
DaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U. S.  332,  348,  that  only  "slightly 
lowered"  the  bar  on  taxpayer  standing,  United  States  v.  Richardson, 
418 U. S. 166, 173, and that must be applied with "rigor," Valley Forge, 
supra, at 481.  Pp. 609-610. 

7.  Also rejected is respondents' argument that Executive Branch ex-
penditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extrac-
tions.  Flast  itself  rejected  this  equivalence.  392  U. S.,  at  102.  Be-
cause almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some 
congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to purely ex-
ecutive  expenditures  would  effectively  subject  every  federal  action-- 
be  it  a  conference,  proclamation,  or  speech--to  Establishment  Clause 
challenge  by  any  taxpayer  in  federal  court.  Respondents'  proposed 
rule  would  also  raise  serious  separation-of-powers  concerns,  enlisting 
the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, 
the  speeches,  statements,  and  myriad  daily  activities  of  the  President, 
his staff, and other Executive Branch officials.  Pp. 610-612.

8.  Both the Seventh Circuit and respondents implicitly recognize that 
unqualified  federal  taxpayer  standing  to  assert  Establishment  Clause 
claims would go too far, but neither has identified a workable limitation. 
Taking the Circuit's zero-marginal-cost test literally--i. e., that any mar-
ginal cost greater than zero suffices--taxpayers might well have stand-
ing  to  challenge  some  (and  perhaps  many)  speeches  by  Government 
officials.  At  a  minimum,  that  approach  would  create  difficult  and 
uncomfortable  line-drawing  problems.  Respondents'  proposal  to  re-
quire  an  expenditure  to  be  fairly  traceable  to  the  conduct  alleged  to 
violate  the  Establishment  Clause,  so  that  challenges  to  the  content  of 
any particular speech would be screened out, is too vague and ill defined 
to be accepted.  Pp. 612-614. 

9.  None  of  the  parade  of  horribles  respondents  claim  could  occur  if 
Flast  is  not  extended  to  discretionary  Executive  Branch  expenditures 
has  happened.  In  the  unlikely  event  any  do  take  place,  Congress  can 
quickly  step  in.  And  respondents  make  no  effort  to  show  that  these 
improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs 
possessed  of standing  based  on  grounds  other  than their  taxpayer  sta-
tus.  P. 614. 

10.  This  case  does  not  require  the  Court  to  reconsider  Flast.  The 
Seventh Circuit did not apply Flast; it extended it.  Valley Forge Chris-
tian  Academy  illustrates  that  a  necessary  concomitant  of  stare  decisis 
is that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.  That 
is  the  approach  taken  here.  Flast  is  neither  extended  nor  overruled. 
It is simply left as it was.  Pp. 614-615.

sions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if not, Flast 
should be overturned.  Pp. 618-628. 

2.  Today's  plurality  avails  itself  of  neither  principled  option,  instead 
accepting the Government's  submission that Flast should be  limited to 
challenges  to  expenditures  that  are  expressly  authorized  or  mandated 
by  specific  congressional  enactment.  However,  the  plurality  gives  no 
explanation  as  to  why  the  factual  differences  between  this  case  and 
Flast are material.  (Whether  the challenged government expenditure 
is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment is not rele-
vant to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redress-
ability.)  Yet  the  plurality  is  also  unwilling  to  acknowledge  that  Flast 
erred by relying on purely mental injury.  Pp. 628-631. 

3.  Respondents' legal position is no more coherent than the plurality's. 
They  refuse  to  admit  that  their  argument  logically  implies  that  every 
expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment 
Clause is subject to suit under Flast.  Of course, that position finds no 
support in this Court's precedents or this Nation's history.  Pp. 631-632. 

4.  A  taxpayer's  purely  psychological  displeasure  that  his  funds  are 
being  spent  in  an  allegedly  unlawful  manner  is  never  sufficiently  con-
crete  and  particularized  to  support  Article  III  standing.  See  Lujan 
v.  Defenders  of  Wildlife,  504  U. S.  555,  573-574.  Although  overruling 
precedents  is  a  serious  undertaking,  stare  decisis  should  not  prevent 
the  Court  from  doing  so  here.  Flast  was  inconsistent  with  the  cases 
that  came  before  it  and  undervalued  the  separation-of-powers  function 
of standing.  Its lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered 
the Court's taxpayer-standing doctrine so incomprehensible that appel-
late judges do not know what to make of it.  The case has engendered 
no  reliance  interests.  Few  cases  less  warrant  stare  decisis  effect.  It 
is past time to overturn Flast.  Pp. 633-637.

than  remanding  the  case  for  the  EPA  to  explain  its  decision,  however, 
the  court  reviewed  the  EPA's substantive  construction  of the  statutes. 
It  did  not  dispute  that  Arizona  had  met  CWA  $ 402(b)'s  nine  criteria, 
but nevertheless concluded that ESA  $ 7(a)(2) required the  EPA to de-
termine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize listed species, in 
effect adding a tenth criterion.  The court dismissed the argument that 
the  EPA's  approval  was  not  subject  to  $ 7(a)(2)  because  it  was  not  a 
"discretionary  action"  under  50  CFR  $ 402.03,  $ 7(a)(2)'s  interpretative 
regulation.  The court thus vacated the EPA's transfer decision.

1 

In  February  2002,  Arizona  officials  applied  for  EPA  au-thorization  to  administer  that  State's  NPDES  program.

3 

The  EPA  initiated  consultation  with  the  FWS  to  determine whether  the  transfer  of  permitting  authority  would  ad-

versely affect any listed species. The FWS regional office concluded that the transfer of au-
thority  would  not  cause  any  direct  impact  on  water  quality that  would  adversely  affect  listed  species.  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert.  in  No.  06-340,  p.  564.  However,  the  FWS  office  was concerned  that  the  transfer  could  result  in  the  issuance  of 
more  discharge  permits,  which  would  lead  to  more  develop-
ment,  which  in  turn  could  have  an  indirect  adverse  effect on  the  habitat  of  certain  upland  species,  such  as  the  cactus 

ferruginous  pygmy-owl  and  the  Pima  pineapple  cactus. Specifically,  the  FWS  feared  that,  because  $ 7(a)(2)'s  consul-
tation requirement does not apply to permitting decisions by state  authorities,

4  the  transfer  of  authority  would  empower 

Arizona officials to issue individual permits without consider-
ing and mitigating their indirect impact on these upland spe-
cies.  Id.,

Respondents also  contend  that  if the  case were remanded to  the  EPA,  they  would  raise  additional  challenges--includ-

ing,  for  example,  a  challenge  to  the  EPA's  provision  of  fi-nancial  assistance  to  Arizona  for  the  administration  of  its 
NPDES  program.  However,  as  explained  below,  any  such agency  action  is  separate  and  independent  of  the  agency's 
decision  to  authorize  the  transfer  of  permitting  authority pursuant to $ 402(b).  See n. 11,

1.  The Court has jurisdiction in these cases.  Seattle argues that Par-
ents Involved lacks standing because its current members' claimed inju-
ries are not imminent and are too speculative in that, even if the district 
maintains  its  current  plan  and  reinstitutes  the  racial  tiebreaker,  those 
members  will only be  affected  if their  children  seek  to  enroll in  a high 
school  that  is oversubscribed  and integration  positive.  This argument 
is  unavailing;  the  group's  members  have  children  in  all  levels  of  the 
district's  schools,  and  the  complaint  sought  declaratory  and  injunctive 
relief  on  behalf  of  members  whose  elementary  and  middle  school  chil-
dren may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice in the 
future.  The fact that those children may not be denied such admission 
based  on  their  race  because  of  undersubscription  or  oversubscription 
that  benefits  them  does  not  eliminate  the  injury  claimed.  The  group 
also asserted an interest in not being forced to compete in a race-based 
system  that  might  prejudice  its  members'  children,  an  actionable  form 
of  injury  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  see,  e. g.,  Adarand  Con-
structors,  Inc.  v.  Pen~ a,  515  U. S.  200,  211.  The  fact  that  Seattle  has 
ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dis-
positive, since the district vigorously defends its program's constitution-
ality, and nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign 
students if it prevails.  See Friends of Earth, Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environ-
mental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189.  Similarly, the fact that 
Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the Court's juris-
diction;  Jefferson  County's  racial  guidelines  apply  at  all  grade  levels, 
and  he  may  again  be  subject  to  race-based  assignment  in  middle 
school.  Pp. 718-720. 

2.  The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of showing 
that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means they 
have  chosen--discriminating  among  individual  students  based  on  race 
by  relying  upon  racial  classifications  in  making  school  assignments.

Seattle  schools  were  never  segregated  by  law  nor  subject  to  court-
ordered  desegregation,  and the  desegregation  decree  to which  the  Jef-
ferson  County  schools  were  previously  subject  has  been  dissolved. 
Moreover,  these  cases  are  not  governed  by  Grutter  v.  Bollinger,  539 
U. S. 306, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny purposes, 
a  government  interest  in  student  body  diversity  "in  the  context  of 
higher education" is compelling.  That interest was not focused on race 
alone but encompassed "all factors that may contribute to student body 
diversity," id., at 337, including, e. g., having "overcome personal adver-
sity and family hardship," id., at 338.  Quoting Justice Powell's articula-
tion  of  diversity  in  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Cal.  v.  Bakke,  438  U. S.  265, 
314-315,  the  Grutter Court  noted  that  " `it  is  not  an  interest  in  simple 
ethnic  diversity,  in  which  a specified  percentage of  the student  body  is 
in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,' that can 
justify the use of race," 539 U. S., at 324-325, but " `a far broader array 
of  qualifications  and  characteristics  of  which  racial  or  ethnic  origin  is 
but  a  single  though  important  element,' "  id.,  at  325.  In  the  present 
cases, by  contrast, race  is  not considered as  part  of  a  broader effort  to 
achieve  "exposure  to  widely  diverse  people,  cultures,  ideas,  and  view-
points,"  id.,  at  330;  race,  for  some  students,  is  determinative  standing 
alone.  The  districts  argue  that  other  factors,  such  as  student  prefer-
ences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan 
when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one 
factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it  is  the 
factor.  See  Gratz  v.  Bollinger,  539  U. S.  244,  275.  Even  as  to  race, 
the  plans  here  employ  only  a  limited  notion  of  diversity,  viewing  race 
exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/"other" terms 
in Jefferson County.  The Grutter Court expressly limited its holding-- 
defining  a  specific  type  of broad-based  diversity  and  noting  the  unique 
context  of  higher  education--but  these  limitations  were  largely  disre-
garded by the lower  courts in extending  Grutter to the sort of  classifi-
cations at issue here.  Pp. 720-725. 

(b)  Despite  the  districts'  assertion  that  they  employed  individual 
racial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends, the 
minimal  effect  these  classifications  have  on  student  assignments  sug-
gests  that  other  means  would  be  effective.  Seattle's  racial  tiebreaker 
results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between 
schools.  Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its use of racial classi-
fications  has  had  a  minimal  effect,  and  claims  only  that  its  guidelines 
provide  a  firm  definition  of  the  goal  of  racially  integrated  schools, 
thereby  providing  administrators  with  authority  to  collaborate  with 
principals and staff to maintain schools within the desired range.  Clas-
sifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of

race is an extreme approach in light of this Court's precedents and the 
Nation's history of using race in public schools, and requires more than 
such an amorphous end to justify it.  In Grutter, in contrast, the consid-
eration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minor-
ity  representation  at  the  law  school  there  at  issue.  See  539  U. S.,  at 
320.  While the Court does  not suggest that greater use of  race would 
be  preferable,  the  minimal  impact  of  the  districts'  racial  classifications 
on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using such classifi-
cations.  The districts have also failed to show they considered methods 
other  than  explicit  racial  classifications  to  achieve  their  stated  goals. 
Narrow tailoring requires "serious, good faith consideration of workable 
race-neutral alternatives," id., at 339, and yet in Seattle several alterna-
tive assignment plans--many of which would not have used express ra-
cial  classifications--were  rejected  with  little  or  no  consideration.  Jef-
ferson  County  has  failed  to  present  any  evidence  that  it  considered 
alternatives,  even  though  the  district  already  claims  that  its  goals  are 
achieved  primarily  through  means  other  than  the  racial  classifications.

particular  type  of  racial  balance,  rather  than  working  forward  from 
some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported 
benefits.  This  is  a  fatal  flaw  under  the  Court's  existing  precedent. 
See,  e. g.,  Freeman,  503  U. S.,  at  494.  Accepting  racial  balancing  as  a 
compelling  state  interest  would  justify  imposing  racial  proportionality 
throughout American society, contrary to the Court's repeated admoni-
tions that this is unconstitutional.  While the school districts use vari-
ous verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promote-- 
racial  diversity,  avoidance  of  racial  isolation,  racial  integration--they 
offer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial bal-
ancing.  Pp. 725-733. 

2.  If  the  need  for  the  racial  classifications  embraced  by  the  school 
districts is unclear, even on the districts' own terms, the costs are unde-
niable.  Government  action  dividing  people  by  race  is  inherently  sus-
pect  because  such  classifications  promote  "notions  of  racial  inferiority 
and lead  to  a politics  of  racial  hostility," Richmond  v.  J. A.  Croson  Co., 
488 U. S. 469,  493, "reinforce the belief,  held by too  many for too much 
of  our  history,  that  individuals  should  be  judged  by  the  color  of  their 
skin," Shaw v.  Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 657, and "endorse race-based reason-
ing and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contrib-
uting to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict," Metro Broadcast-
ing, Inc. v.  FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).  When it 
comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard. 
In  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education,  347  U. S.  483,  the  Court  held  that 
segregation  deprived  black  children  of  equal  educational  opportunities 
regardless  of  whether  school  facilities  and  other  tangible  factors  were 
equal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted infe-
riority.  Id., at 493-494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities but 
the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the Court 
relied  to  find  a  constitutional  violation  in  that  case.  Id.,  at  494.  The 
districts  here  invoke  the  ultimate  goal  of  those  who  filed  Brown  and 
subsequent  cases  to  support  their  argument,  but  the  argument  of  the 
plaintiff  in  Brown  was  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  "prevents 
states  from  according  differential  treatment  to  American  children  on 
the  basis  of  their  color  or  race,"  and  that  view  prevailed--this  Court 
ruled  in  its  remedial  opinion  that  Brown  required  school  districts  "to 
achieve  a  system  of  determining  admission  to  the  public  schools  on  a 
nonracial basis."  Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300-301

unyielding  insistence  that  race  cannot  be  a  factor  in  instances  when  it 
may be taken into account.  Pp. 782-798. 

(a)  As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are nar-
rowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government must es-
tablish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual student's race are 
made in a challenged program.  The Jefferson County Board of Educa-
tion  fails  to  meet  this  threshold  mandate  when  it  concedes  it  denied 
Joshua's requested kindergarten transfer on the basis of his race under 
its  guidelines,  yet  also  maintains  that  the  guidelines  do  not  apply  to 
kindergartners.  This  discrepancy  is  not  some  simple  and  straightfor-
ward  error  that  touches  only  upon  the  peripheries  of  the  district's  use 
of  individual  racial  classifications.  As  becomes  clearer  when  the  dis-
trict's  plan  is  further  considered,  Jefferson  County  has  explained  how 
and  when  it  employs  these  classifications  only  in  terms  so  broad  and 
imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  In its briefing it 
fails to make clear--even in the limited respects implicated by Joshua's 
initial assignment and transfer denial--whether in fact it relies on racial 
classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, 
rather  than in  the far-reaching, inconsistent, and ad hoc manner that a 
less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.  When a court sub-
jects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambigu-
ities in favor of the government.  In the Seattle case, the school district 
has  gone  further in  describing  the  methods  and  criteria  used  to  deter-
mine assignment decisions based on individual racial classifications, but 
it  has  nevertheless  failed  to  explain  why,  in  a  district  composed  of 
a  diversity  of  races,  with  only  a  minority  of  the  students  classified 
as  "white,"  it  has  employed  the  crude  racial  categories  of  "white" 
and  "non-white"  as  the  basis  for  its  assignment  decisions.  Far  from 
being  narrowly  tailored,  this  system  threatens  to  defeat  its  own  ends, 
and  the  district  has  provided  no  convincing  explanation  for  its  design. 
Pp. 783-787. 

(b)  The plurality opinion is too dismissive of government's legitimate 
interest  in  ensuring  that  all  people  have  equal  opportunity  regardless 
of  their race.  In administering  public schools,  it  is permissible to con-
sider the schools' racial makeup and adopt general policies to encourage 
a  diverse  student  body,  one  aspect  of  which  is  its  racial  composition. 
Cf. Grutter v.  Bollinger, supra.  School authorities concerned that their 
student bodies' racial compositions interfere with offering an equal edu-
cational opportunity to all are free to devise race-conscious measures to 
address the problem in a general way and without treating each student 
in  different  fashion  based  solely  on  a  systematic,  individual  typing 
by  race.  Such  measures  may  include  strategic  site  selection  of  new 
schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of neighbor-

students  and  faculty  in  a  targeted  fashion;  and  tracking  enrollments, 
performance, and other statistics by race. 

Each  respondent  has  failed  to  provide  the  necessary  support  for  the 
proposition  that  there  is  no  other  way  than  individual  racial  classifica-
tions  to  avoid  racial  isolation  in  their  school  districts.  Cf.  Croson, 
supra,  at  501.  In  these  cases,  the  fact  that  the  number  of  students 
whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is small sug-
gests  that  the  schools  could  have  achieved  their  stated  ends  through 
different  means,  including  the  facially  race-neutral  means  set  forth 
above  or,  if  necessary,  a  more  nuanced,  individual  evaluation  of  school 
needs  and  student  characteristics  that  might  include  race  as  a  compo-
nent.  The  latter  approach  would  be  informed  by  Grutter,  though  the 
criteria  relevant  to  student  placement  would  differ  based  on  the  stu-
dents' age, the parents' needs, and the schools' role.  Pp. 787-790.

Both  cases  present  the  same  underlying  legal  question-- whether a public school that had not operated legally segre-

gated  schools  or  has  been  found  to  be  unitary  may  choose to  classify  students  by  race  and  rely  upon  that  classification 
in  making  school  assignments.  Although  we  examine  the plans  under  the  same  legal  framework,  the  specifics  of  the 
two plans, and the circumstances surrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite different. 

A 
Seattle  School  District  No.  1  operates  10  regular  public high  schools.  In  1998,  it  adopted  the  plan  at  issue  in  this 

case  for  assigning  students  to  these  schools.  App.  in No.  05-908,  pp.  90a-92a.

1  The  plan  allows  incoming  ninth 

graders  to  choose  from  among  any  of  the  district's  high schools,  ranking  however  many  schools  they  wish  in  order 

of preference. Some  schools  are  more  popular  than  others.  If  too  many 
students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs  a  series  of  "tiebreakers"  to  determine  who  will  fill 
the  open  slots  at  the  oversubscribed  school.  The  first  tie-breaker  selects  for  admission  students  who  have  a  sibling 

1 The  plan  was  in  effect  from  1999-2002,  for  three  school  years.  This 
litigation  was  commenced  in  July  2000,  and  the  record  in  the  District 
Court was  closed  before  assignments  for the  2001-2002  school  year  were 
made.  See  Brief  for  Respondents  in  No.  05-908,  p.  9,  n.  9.  We  rely,  as 
did  the  lower  courts,  largely  on  data  from  the  2000-2001  school  year  in 
evaluating the plan.  See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1169-1171 (CA9 2005) (en banc)

currently enrolled in the chosen school.  The next tiebreaker 
depends upon the  racial composition  of the  particular  school 
and the race of the individual student.  In the district's pub-
lic schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are 
white;  the  remaining  59  percent,  comprising  all  other  racial 
groups,  are  classified  by  Seattle  for  assignment  purposes  as 
nonwhite.  Id., at 38a, 103a.2  If an oversubscribed school is 
not  within  10  percentage  points  of  the  district's  overall 
white/nonwhite  racial  balance,  it  is  what  the  district  calls 
"integration positive," and the  district employs a  tiebreaker 
that  selects  for  assignment  students  whose  race  "will  serve 
to bring the school into balance."  Id., at 38a.  See Parents 
Involved  VII,  426  F.  3d  1162,  1169-1170  (CA9  2005)  (en 
banc).3  If  it  is  still  necessary  to  select  students  for  the 
school  after  using  the  racial  tiebreaker,  the  next  tiebreaker 
is  the  geographic  proximity  of  the  school  to  the  student's 
residence.  App. in No. 05-908, at 38a. 

Seattle  has  never  operated  segregated  schools--legally 
separate  schools  for  students  of  different  races--nor  has  it 
ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation.  It none-
theless  employs  the  racial  tiebreaker  in  an  attempt  to  ad-
dress  the  effects  of  racially  identifiable  housing  patterns  on 
school assignments.  Most  white students  live in  the  north-
ern  part  of  Seattle,  most  students  of  other  racial  back-
grounds in the southern part.  Parents Involved VII, supra,

north--Ballard,  Nathan  Hale,  Ingraham,  and  Roosevelt-- 
and five in the south--Rainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seat-

percent Asian-American, 23.1 percent African-American, 10.3 percent La-

sired  racial  composition  was  increased  from  10  to  15  percent.  App.  in

at 38a-39a, 45a. For  the  2000-2001  school  year,  five  of  these  schools  were 
oversubscribed--Ballard,  Nathan  Hale,  Roosevelt,  Garfield, and Franklin--so much so that 82 percent of incoming ninth 
graders ranked one of these schools as their first choice.  Id., 
at 38a.  Three  of the  oversubscribed  schools  were "integra-tion positive" because the school's white enrollment the pre-

vious school year was greater than 51 percent--Ballard, Na-than  Hale,  and  Roosevelt.  Thus,  more  nonwhite  students 
(107, 27, and 82, respectively) who selected one of these three 
schools as a top choice received placement at the school than 
would  have  been  the  case  had  race  not  been  considered, 
and  proximity  been  the  next  tiebreaker.  Id.,  at  39a-40a. 
Franklin was "integration positive" because its nonwhite en-
rollment  the  previous  school  year  was  greater  than  69  per-
cent;  89  more  white  students  were  assigned  to  Franklin  by 
operation  of  the  racial  tiebreaker  in  the  2000-2001  school 
year  than  otherwise  would  have  been.  Ibid.  Garfield  was 
the only oversubscribed school whose composition during the 
1999-2000  school  year  was  within  the  racial  guidelines,  al-
though in previous years Garfield's enrollment had been pre-
dominantly  nonwhite,  and  the  racial  tiebreaker  had  been 
used to give preference to white students.  Id., at 39a.

the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,4 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,5  and the Washington

The  District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  the 
school district, finding that state law did not bar the district's 
use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived strict 
scrutiny  on  the  federal  constitutional  claim  because  it  was 
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.

Opinion of the Court 
The Washington Supreme Court determined that the State Civil Rights Act bars only preferential treatment pro-

grams "where race or gender is used by government to select a  less  qualified  applicant  over  a  more  qualified  applicant," 
and  not  "[p]rograms  which  are  racially  neutral,  such  as  the [district's] open choice plan."

689-690, 663, 72 P. 3d 151, 166, 153 (2003) (en banc) (Parents Involved V).  The state court returned the case to the Ninth 
Circuit for further proceedings.  Id., at 690, 72 P. 3d, at 167. A  panel of the  Ninth Circuit then again  reversed the  Dis-
trict  Court,  this  time  ruling  on  the  federal  constitutional question.  Parents  Involved  VI,  377  F.  3d  949  (2004).  The 
panel  determined  that  while  achieving  racial  diversity  and avoiding  racial  isolation  are  compelling  government  inter-
ests, id., at 964, Seattle's use of the racial tiebreaker was not narrowly tailored to achieve these interests, 

id., at 980.  The Ninth  Circuit  granted  rehearing  en  banc,  395  F.  3d  1168 

(2005),  and  overruled  the  panel  decision,  affirming  the  Dis-trict Court's determination  that Seattle's  plan was  narrowly 
tailored to serve a compelling government interest, Parents Involved  VII,  426  F.  3d,  at  1192-1193.  We  granted  certio-
rari.  547 U. S. 1177 (2006).

Jefferson County Public Schools operates the public school system in metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky.  In 1973 a fed-

finding that the district had achieved unitary status by elimi-nating  "[t]o  the  greatest  extent  practicable"  the  vestiges  of 

its  prior  policy  of  segregation.  Hampton  v.  Jefferson  Cty. 
Bd.  of  Ed.,  102  F.  Supp.  2d  358,  360  (2000).  See  Board  of 
Ed.  of  Oklahoma  City  Public  Schools  v.  Dowell,  498  U. S. 237,  249-250  (1991); 

Green  v.  School  Bd.  of  New  Kent  Cty., 
391 U. S. 430, 435-436 (1968). In  2001,  after  the  decree  had  been  dissolved,  Jefferson 

County  adopted  the  voluntary  student  assignment  plan  at 
issue  in  this  case.  App.  in  No.  05-915,  p.  77.  Approxi-mately 34 percent of the district's 97,000 students are black; 

most  of  the  remaining  66  percent  are  white.  McFarland  v. 
Jefferson  Cty. Public Schools, 330  F. Supp. 2d 834, 839-840, 
and  n.  6  (WD  Ky.  2004)  (McFarland  I ).  The  plan  requires 
all  nonmagnet  schools  to  maintain  a  minimum  black  enroll-
ment  of  15  percent,  and  a  maximum  black  enrollment  of  50 
percent.  App.  in  No.  05-915,  at  81;  McFarland  I,  supra, 
at 842. 

At  the  elementary  school  level,  based  on  his  or  her  ad-
dress, each student is designated a "resides" school to which 
students within  a specific  geographic area  are assigned; ele-
mentary  resides  schools  are  "grouped  into  clusters  in  order 
to  facilitate  integration."  App.  in  No.  05-915,  at  82.  The 
district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two 
ways: Parents of kindergartners, first  graders, and students 
new  to  the  district  may  submit  an  application  indicating  a 
first  and  second  choice  among  the  schools  within  their  clus-
ter;  students  who  do  not  submit  such  an  application  are 
assigned  within  the  cluster  by  the  district.  "Decisions  to 
assign  students  to  schools  within  each  cluster  are  based  on 
available  space  within  the  schools  and  the  racial  guidelines 
in  the  District's  current  student  assignment  plan."  Id.,  at 
38.  If  a  school  has  reached  the  "extremes  of  the  racial 
guidelines,"  a  student  whose  race  would  contribute  to  the 
school's  racial  imbalance  will  not  be  assigned  there.  Id.,  at 
38-39,  82.  After  assignment,  students  at  all  grade  levels

are  permitted  to  apply  to  transfer  between  nonmagnet schools in the district.  Transfers may be requested for any 

number  of  reasons,  and  may  be  denied  because  of  lack  of available  space  or on  the  basis of the  racial guidelines.  Id., 
at 43.7 When  petitioner  Crystal  Meredith  moved  into  the  school 
district in  August 2002, she sought to enroll her  son, Joshua McDonald,  in  kindergarten  for  the  2002-2003  school  year. 
His resides school was only a mile from his new home, but it had no available space--assignments had been made in May, 
and the class was full.  Jefferson County assigned Joshua to another elementary school in his cluster, Young Elementary. 
This  school  was  10  miles  from  home,  and  Meredith  sought to  transfer  Joshua  to  a  school  in  a  different  cluster,  Bloom 
Elementary, which--like his resides school--was only a mile from home.  See Tr. in 

McFarland I, pp. 1-49 through 1-54 
(Dec. 8, 2003).  Space was available at Bloom, and interclus-ter transfers are allowed, but Joshua's transfer was nonethe-

less denied because, in  the  words of Jefferson  County, "[t]he transfer would have an adverse effect on desegregation com-
pliance" of Young.  App. in No. 05-915, at 97.8 Meredith  brought  suit  in  the  Western  District  of  Ken-
tucky,  alleging  violations  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court found that 
Jefferson County had asserted a compelling interest in main-

7 Middle and high school students are designated a single resides school 
and assigned to that school unless it is at the extremes of the racial guide-
lines.  Students may also apply to a magnet school or program, or, at the 
high  school  level,  take  advantage  of  an  open  enrollment  plan  that  allows 
ninth-grade students to apply for admission to any nonmagnet high school. 
App. in No. 05-915, pp. 39-41, 82-83. 

8 It is not clear why the racial guidelines were even applied to Joshua's 

transfer application--the guidelines supposedly do not apply at the kinder-
garten level.  Id.,  at  43.  Neither party disputes,  however, that Joshua's 
transfer application was denied under the racial guidelines, and Meredith's 
objection  is  not  that  the  guidelines  were  misapplied  but  rather  that  race 
was used at all.

taining racially diverse schools, and that the assignment plan was (in all relevant respects) narrowly tailored to serve that 

compelling  interest.  McFarland  I,  supra,  at  837.9  The Sixth  Circuit  affirmed  in  a  per  curiam  opinion  relying  upon 
the reasoning of the District Court, concluding that a written opinion "would serve no useful purpose."

As  a  threshold  matter,  we  must  assure  ourselves  of  our jurisdiction.  Seattle  argues  that  Parents  Involved  lacks 

standing  because  none  of  its  current  members  can  claim  an imminent injury.  Even if the district maintains the current 
plan  and  reinstitutes  the  racial  tiebreaker,  Seattle  argues, Parents Involved members will only be affected if their chil-
dren seek to enroll in a Seattle public high school and choose an  oversubscribed  school  that  is  integration  positive--too 
speculative  a  harm  to  maintain  standing.  Brief  for  Re-spondents in No. 05-908, pp. 16-17. 

This  argument  is  unavailing.  The group's  members  have children in the district's elementary, middle, and  high 
schools, App. in No. 05-908, at 299a-301a; Affidavit of Kath-leen  Brose  Pursuant  to  this  Court's  Rule  32.3  (Lodging  of 
Petitioner  Parents  Involved),  and  the  complaint  sought  de-claratory and injunctive relief on behalf of Parents Involved 
members whose  elementary  and  middle school  children  may be  "denied  admission  to  the  high  schools  of  their  choice 
when  they  apply  for  those  schools  in  the  future,"  App.  in No. 05-908, at 30a.  The fact that it is possible that children 
of  group  members  will  not  be  denied  admission  to  a  school 

9 Meredith  joined  a  pending  lawsuit  filed  by  several  other  plaintiffs. 
See id., at 7-11.  The other plaintiffs all challenged assignments to certain 
specialized schools, and the District Court found these assignments, which 
are  no  longer  at  issue  in  this  case,  unconstitutional.  McFarland  I,  330

Opinion of the Court 
based  on  their  race--because  they  choose  an  undersub-scribed  school  or  an  oversubscribed  school  in  which  their 

race is an advantage--does not eliminate the injury claimed. Moreover,  Parents  Involved  also  asserted  an  interest  in  not 
being "forced to compete for seats at certain high schools in a  system  that  uses  race  as  a  deciding  factor  in  many  of  its 
admissions decisions."  Ibid.  As we have held, one form of 
injury  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  is  being  forced  to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the plain-

Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contrac-
tors of America v.  Jacksonville, 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993), an 
injury  that  the  members  of  Parents  Involved  can  validly 
claim on behalf of their children. 

In  challenging  standing,  Seattle  also  notes  that  it  has 
ceased  using  the  racial  tiebreaker  pending  the  outcome  of 
this  litigation.  Brief  for  Respondents  in  No.  05-908,  at 
16-17.  But  the  district  vigorously  defends  the  constitu-
tionality  of  its  race-based  program,  and  nowhere  suggests 
that if this litigation is resolved in its favor it will not resume 
using race to assign students.  Voluntary cessation does not 
moot a case or controversy unless "subsequent events ma[ke] 
it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could 
not reasonably be expected to recur," Friends of Earth, Inc. 
v.  Laidlaw  Environmental  Services  (TOC),  Inc.,  528  U. S. 
167, 189 (2000) (quoting United States v.  Concentrated Phos-
phate  Export  Assn.,  Inc.,  393  U. S.  199,  203  (1968);  internal 
quotation  marks  omitted),  a  heavy  burden  that  Seattle  has 
clearly not met. 

Jefferson County does not challenge our jurisdiction, Tr. of 
Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, p. 48, but we are nonetheless obliged 
to  ensure  that  it  exists,  Arbaugh  v.  Y &  H Corp.,  546  U. S. 
500,  514  (2006).  Although  apparently  Joshua  has  now  been 
granted  a  transfer  to  Bloom,  the  school  to  which  transfer 
was  denied  under  the  racial  guidelines,  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  in 
No.  05-915,  at  45,  the  racial  guidelines  apply  at  all  grade

Opinion of the Court 
County had "eliminated the vestiges associated with the for-
mer  policy  of  segregation  and  its  pernicious  effects,"  and 
thus had achieved "unitary" status.  Hampton, 102 F. Supp. 
2d, at 360.  Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon 
an  interest  in  remedying  the  effects  of  past  intentional  dis-
crimination in defending its present use  of race in  assigning 
students.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 38. 

Nor  could  it.  We  have  emphasized  that  the  harm  being 
remedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm that 
is traceable to segregation, and that "the Constitution is not 
violated  by  racial  imbalance  in  the  schools,  without  more." 
Milliken  v.  Bradley,  433  U. S.  267,  280,  n.  14  (1977).  See 
also  Freeman,  supra,  at  495-496;  Dowell,  498  U. S.,  at  248; 
Milliken  v.  Bradley,  418  U. S.  717,  746  (1974).  Once  Jef-
ferson  County  achieved  unitary  status,  it  had  remedied  the 
constitutional  wrong  that  allowed  race-based  assignments. 
Any  continued  use  of  race  must  be  justified  on  some  other 
basis.10 

10 The districts point to dicta in a prior opinion in which the Court sug-
gested that, while not constitutionally mandated, it would be constitution-
ally permissible for a school district to seek racially balanced schools as a 
matter of "educational policy."  See Swann v.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. 
of  Ed.,  402  U. S.  1,  16  (1971).  The  districts  also  quote  with  approval  an 
in-chambers  opinion  in  which  then-Justice  Rehnquist  made  a  suggestion 
to the same effect.  See Bustop, Inc. v.  Los Angeles Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S. 
1380, 1383 (1978).  The citations do not carry the significance the districts 
would  ascribe  to  them.  Swann,  evaluating  a  school  district  engaged  in 
court-ordered  desegregation,  had  no  occasion  to  consider  whether  a  dis-
trict's  voluntary  adoption  of  race-based  assignments  in  the  absence  of  a 
finding  of  prior  de  jure  segregation  was  constitutionally  permissible,  an 
issue that  was  again  expressly  reserved  in Washington  v.  Seattle School 
Dist.  No.  1,  458  U. S.  457,  472,  n.  15  (1982).  Bustop,  addressing  in  the 
context of an  emergency injunction application a busing plan imposed by 
the  Superior  Court  of  Los  Angeles  County,  is  similarly  unavailing. 
Then-Justice Rehnquist, in denying emergency relief, stressed that "equi-
table consideration[s]" counseled against preliminary relief.  439 U. S., at 
1383.  The propriety of preliminary relief and resolution of the merits are 
of course "significantly different" issues.  University of Texas v.  Camen-
isch, 451 U. S. 390, 393 (1981).

SEATTLE  SCHOOL  DIST.  NO.  1 

Opinion of the Court 

The  second  government  interest  we  have  recognized  as compelling  for  purposes  of  strict  scrutiny  is  the  interest  in 

diversity in higher education upheld in Grutter, 539 U. S., at 328.  The  specific  interest  found  compelling  in 

Grutter was 
student body  diversity  "in the  context  of  higher education." 
Ibid.  The  diversity  interest  was  not  focused  on  race  alone 
but encompassed "all factors that may contribute to student 
body  diversity."  Id.,  at  337.  We  described  the  various types of diversity that the law school sought: 

"[The  law  school's]  policy  makes  clear  there  are  many 
possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides ex-amples  of  admittees  who  have  lived  or  traveled  widely 

abroad,  are  fluent  in  several  languages,  have  overcome 
personal  adversity  and  family  hardship,  have  excep-tional records of extensive community service, and have 

had  successful  careers  in  other  fields."  Id.,  at  338 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). 

The  Court  quoted  the  articulation  of  diversity  from  Justice 
Powell's  opinion  in  Regents  of  Univ.  of  Cal.  v.  Bakke,  438 
U. S.  265  (1978),  noting  that  "it  is  not  an  interest  in  simple ethnic  diversity,  in  which  a  specified  percentage  of  the  stu-

dent body is  in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic  groups,  that  can  justify  the  use  of  race." 

Grutter, 
supra,  at  324-325  (citing  and  quoting  Bakke,  supra,  at  314- 315  (opinion  of  Powell,  J.);  brackets  and  internal  quotation 

marks  omitted).  Instead,  what  was  upheld  in  Grutter  was consideration  of  "a  far  broader  array  of  qualifications  and 
characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though  important  element."  539  U. S.,  at  325  (quoting 
Bakke,  supra,  at  315  (opinion  of  Powell,  J.);  internal  quota-
tion marks omitted). 

The  entire  gist  of  the  analysis  in  Grutter  was  that  the 
admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant 
as an individual, and not simply as a member of a particular 
racial group.  The classification of applicants by race upheld

Opinion of the Court 
in Grutter was only as part of a "highly individualized, holis-tic review," 539 U. S., at 337.  As the Court explained, "[t]he 

importance of this individualized consideration in the context of  a  race-conscious  admissions  program  is  paramount." 
Ibid.  The  point  of  the  narrow  tailoring  analysis  in  which the 

Grutter  Court  engaged  was  to  ensure  that  the  use  of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment 

of  diversity,  and  not  simply  an  effort  to  achieve  racial  bal-ance,  which  the  Court  explained  would  be  "patently  uncon-
stitutional."  Id., at 330. In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as 
part  of  a  broader  effort  to  achieve  "exposure  to  widely  di-verse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints," 

ibid.; race, for 
some  students,  is  determinative  standing  alone.  The  dis-tricts  argue  that  other  factors,  such  as  student  preferences, 

affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is 
not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a deci-
sion,  as  in  Grutter; it is  the  factor.  Like  the  University  of Michigan  undergraduate  plan  struck  down  in 

Gratz,  539 
U. S., at 275, the plans here "do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants" but instead rely on racial 

classifications  in  a  "nonindividualized,  mechanical"  way,  id., at 276, 280 (O'Connor, J., concurring). 

Even when it comes  to race, the plans  here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/ 
nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/"other" terms in Jeffer-son County.

11  But see Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.  FCC, 497 

U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("We are a Na-tion  not  of  black  and  white  alone,  but  one  teeming  with  di-

11 The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out.  Upon enrolling 
their child with the district, parents are required to identify their child as 
a  member  of  a  particular  racial  group.  If  a  parent  identifies  more  than 
one race on the form, "[t]he application will not be accepted and, if neces-
sary, the enrollment service person taking the application will indicate one 
box."  App. in No. 05-908, at 303a.

vergent  communities  knitted  together  by  various  traditions and  carried  forth,  above  all,  by  individuals").  The  Seattle 

"Board  Statement  Reaffirming  Diversity  Rationale"  speaks of  the  "inherent  educational  value"  in  "[p]roviding  students 
the  opportunity  to  attend  schools  with  diverse  student enrollment,"  App.  in  No.  05-908,  at  128a,  129a.  But  under 
the  Seattle  plan,  a  school  with  50  percent  Asian-American 
students  and  50  percent  white  students  but  no  African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qual-

ify  as  balanced,  while  a  school  with  30  percent  Asian-American,  25  percent  African-American,  25  percent  Latino, 
and  20  percent  white  students  would  not.  It  is  hard  to  un-
derstand  how  a  plan  that  could  allow  these  results  can  be 
viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is 
" `broadly diverse,' " Grutter, supra, at 329. 

Prior to Grutter, the  courts  of  appeals  rejected  as  uncon-
stitutional  attempts  to  implement  race-based  assignment 
plans--such  as  the  plans  at  issue  here--in  primary  and  sec-
ondary  schools.  See,  e. g.,  Eisenberg  v.  Montgomery  Cty. 
Public  Schools,  197  F.  3d  123,  133  (CA4  1999);  Tuttle  v.  Ar-
lington  Cty.  School  Bd.,  195  F.  3d  698,  701  (CA4  1999)  (per 
curiam); Wessmann v.  Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790, 809 (CA1 1998). 
See also Ho v.  San Francisco Unified School Dist., 147 F. 3d 
854,  865  (CA9  1998).  After  Grutter,  however,  the  two 
Courts  of  Appeals  in  these  cases,  and  one  other,  found  that 
race-based  assignments  were  permissible  at  the  elementary 
and  secondary  level,  largely  in  reliance  on  that  case.  See 
Parents Involved VII, 426 F. 3d, at 1166; McFarland II, 416 
F.  3d,  at  514;  Comfort  v.  Lynn  School  Comm.,  418  F.  3d  1, 
13 (CA1 2005) (en banc). 

In  upholding  the  admissions  plan  in  Grutter, though,  this 
Court  relied  upon  considerations  unique  to  institutions  of 
higher education, noting that in light of "the expansive free-
doms  of  speech  and  thought  associated  with  the  university 
environment,  universities  occupy  a  special  niche  in  our  con-
stitutional  tradition."  539  U. S.,  at  329.  See  also  Bakke,

Opinion of the Court 
The  en  banc  Ninth  Circuit  declared  that  "when  a  racially diverse  school  system  is  the  goal  (or  racial  concentration  or 

isolation  is  the  problem),  there  is  no  more  effective  means than  a  consideration  of  race  to  achieve  the  solution." 

Par-
ents  Involved  VII,  supra,  at  1191.  For  the  foregoing  rea-sons,  this  conclusory  argument  cannot  sustain  the  plans. 

However  closely  related  race-based  assignments  may  be  to 
achieving  racial  balance,  that  itself  cannot  be  the  goal, whether  labeled  "racial  diversity"  or  anything  else.  To  the 

extent  the  objective  is  sufficient  diversity  so  that  students see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as mem-
bers of a racial group, using means that treat students solely 
as  members  of  a  racial  group  is  fundamentally  at  cross-
purposes with that end. 

C 
The  districts  assert,  as  they  must,  that  the  way  in  which 
they have employed individual racial classifications is neces-
sary to achieve their stated ends.  The minimal effect these 
classifications  have  on  student  assignments,  however,  sug-
gests  that  other  means  would  be  effective.  Seattle's  racial 
tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number 
of  students  between  schools.  Approximately  307  student 
assignments  were  affected  by  the  racial  tiebreaker  in  2000- 
2001;  the  district  was  able  to  track  the  enrollment  status  of 
293  of  these  students.  App.  in  No.  05-908,  at  162a.  Of 
these,  209  were  assigned  to  a  school  that  was  one  of  their 
choices,  87  of  whom  were  assigned  to  the  same  school  to 
which they would have been assigned without the racial tie-
breaker.  Eighty-four  students  were  assigned  to  schools 
that  they  did  not  list  as  a  choice,  but  29  of  those  students 
would have been assigned to their respective school without 
the  racial  tiebreaker,  and  3  were  able  to  attend  one  of  the 
oversubscribed  schools  due  to  waitlist  and  capacity  adjust-
ments.  Id.,  at  162a-163a.  In  over  one-third  of  the  assign-
ments affected by the racial tiebreaker, then, the use of race 
in the end made no difference, and the district could identify

Opinion of the Court 

only  52  students  who  were  ultimately  affected  adversely  by the  racial  tiebreaker  in  that  it  resulted  in  assignment  to  a 

school they had not listed as a preference and to which they would not otherwise have been assigned. 

As  the  panel  majority  in  Parents  Involved  VI  concluded: 

"[T]he tiebreaker's annual effect is thus merely to shuf-
fle a few handfuls of different minority students between a  few  schools--about  a  dozen  additional  Latinos  into 

Ballard,  a  dozen  black  students  into  Nathan  Hale,  per-haps  two  dozen  Asians  into  Roosevelt,  and  so  on.  The 
District  has  not  met  its  burden  of  proving  these  mar-
ginal  changes . . .  outweigh  the  cost  of  subjecting  hun-dreds  of  students  to  disparate  treatment  based  solely 

upon the color of their skin."  377 F. 3d, at 984-985. 
Similarly,  Jefferson  County's  use  of  racial  classifications has only a minimal effect on the assignment of students.  El-

ementary  school  students  are  assigned  to  their  first- or second-choice  school  95  percent  of  the  time,  and  transfers, 
which account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are only 
denied  35  percent  of  the  time--and  presumably  an  even smaller  percentage  are  denied  on  the  basis  of  the  racial 

guidelines,  given  that  other  factors  may  lead  to  a  denial. 
McFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 844-845, nn. 16, 18.  Jeffer-
son  County  estimates  that  the  racial  guidelines  account  for only  3  percent  of  assignments.  Brief  in  Opposition  in 

No.  05-915,  p.  7,  n.  4;  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  in  No.  05-915,  at  46. As  Jefferson  County  explains,  "the  racial  guidelines  have 
minimal  impact  in  this  process,  because  they  `mostly  in-
fluence  student  assignment  in  subtle  and  indirect  ways.' " 
Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, pp. 8-9. 

While we do not suggest that greater use of race would be 
preferable,  the  minimal  impact  of  the  districts'  racial  classi-
fications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of 
using  racial  classifications.  In  Grutter, the  consideration of 
race  was  viewed  as  indispensable  in  more  than  tripling  mi-

System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 9, and only if they can predict with confidence 
that  the  restraint  would  be  invalidated  in  all  or  almost  all  instances 
under the rule of reason, see Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 
457 U. S. 332, 344.  Pp. 885-887. 

(b)  Because the reasons upon which Dr. Miles relied do not justify a 
per se rule, it is necessary to examine, in the first instance, the economic 
effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum resale prices and to deter-
mine  whether  the  per  se  rule  is  nonetheless  appropriate.  Were  this 
Court  considering  the  issue  as  an  original  matter,  the  rule  of  reason, 
not a per se rule of unlawfulness, would be the appropriate standard to 
judge vertical price restraints.  Pp. 887-899. 

(1)  Economics  literature  is  replete  with  procompetitive  justifica-
tions for a manufacturer's use of resale price maintenance, and the few 
recent studies on the subject also cast doubt on the conclusion that the 
practice meets the criteria for a per se rule.  The justifications for verti-
cal  price  restraints  are  similar  to  those  for  other  vertical  restraints. 
Minimum  resale  price  maintenance  can  stimulate  interbrand  competi-
tion  among  manufacturers  selling  different  brands  of  the  same  type  of 
product by reducing intrabrand competition among retailers selling the 
same  brand.  This  is  important  because  the  antitrust  laws'  "primary 
purpose  .  .  .  is  to  protect  interbrand  competition,"  Khan,  supra,  at  15. 
A  single  manufacturer's  use  of  vertical  price  restraints  tends  to  elimi-
nate  intrabrand  price  competition;  this  in  turn  encourages  retailers  to 
invest  in  services  or  promotional  efforts  that  aid  the  manufacturer's 
position as against rival manufacturers.  Resale price maintenance may 
also  give  consumers  more  options  to  choose  among  low-price,  low-
service  brands;  high-price,  high-service  brands;  and  brands  falling  in 
between.  Absent vertical price restraints, retail services that enhance 
interbrand competition might be underprovided because discounting re-
tailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture 
some of the demand those services generate.  Retail price maintenance 
can  also  increase  interbrand  competition  by  facilitating  market  entry 
for  new  firms  and  brands  and  by  encouraging  retailer  services  that 
would not be provided even absent free riding.  Pp. 889-892. 

(2)  Setting  minimum  resale  prices  may  also  have  anticompetitive 
effects;  and  unlawful  price  fixing,  designed  solely  to  obtain  monopoly 
profits,  is  an ever-present temptation.  Resale price  maintenance may, 
for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel or be used to organize retail 
cartels.  It can also be abused  by a powerful  manufacturer or retailer. 
Thus,  the  potential  anticompetitive  consequences  of  vertical  price  re-
straints must not be ignored or underestimated.  Pp. 892-894. 

(3)  Notwithstanding  the  risks  of  unlawful  conduct,  it  cannot  be 
stated with  any degree of  confidence  that retail price maintenance "al-

Syllabus 
ways or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease out-
put," Business Electronics,  supra,  at 723.  Vertical retail  price agree-
ments have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending 
on the circumstances in which they were formed; and the limited empiri-
cal evidence available does not suggest efficient uses of the agreements 
are infrequent or hypothetical.  A per se rule should not be adopted for 
administrative  convenience  alone.  Such  rules  can  be  counterproduc-
tive, increasing the antitrust system's total cost by prohibiting procom-
petitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage.  And a per se rule 
cannot  be  justified  by  the  possibility  of  higher  prices  absent  a  further 
showing  of  anticompetitive  conduct.  The  antitrust  laws  primarily  are 
designed to protect interbrand competition from which lower prices can 
later result.  Respondent's argument overlooks that, in general, the in-
terests of manufacturers and consumers are aligned with respect to re-
tailer profit margins.  Resale price maintenance has economic dangers. 
If the rule of reason were to apply, courts would have to be diligent in 
eliminating  their  anticompetitive  uses  from  the  market.  Factors  rele-
vant to the inquiry are the number of manufacturers using the practice, 
the  restraint's  source,  and  a  manufacturer's  market  power.  The  rule 
of  reason  is  designed  and  used  to  ascertain  whether  transactions  are 
anticompetitive  or  procompetitive.  This  standard  principle  applies  to 
vertical  price  restraints.  As  courts  gain  experience  with  these  re-
straints  by  applying  the  rule  of  reason  over  the  course  of  decisions, 
they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to 
eliminate  anticompetitive  restraints  from  the  market  and  to  provide 
more guidance to businesses.  Pp. 894-899. 

(c)  Stare  decisis  does  not  compel  continued  adherence  to  the  per  se 
rule here.  Because the Sherman Act is treated as a common-law stat-
ute, its prohibition on "restraint[s] of trade" evolves to meet the dynam-
ics  of  present  economic  conditions.  The  rule  of  reason's  case-by-case 
adjudication  implements  this  common-law  approach.  Here,  respected 
economics  authorities  suggest  that  the  per  se  rule  is  inappropriate. 
And both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission 
recommend replacing the per se rule with the rule of reason.  In addi-
tion,  this  Court has "overruled  [its]  precedents  when subsequent  cases 
have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings."  Dickerson v.  United 
States,  530  U. S.  428,  443.  It  is  not  surprising  that  the  Court  has  dis-
tanced  itself  from  Dr.  Miles'  rationales,  for  the  case  was  decided  not 
long after the Sherman Act was enacted, when the Court had little expe-
rience  with  antitrust  analysis.  Only  eight  years  after  Dr.  Miles,  the 
Court  reined  in  the  decision,  holding  that  a  manufacturer  can  suggest 
resale  prices  and  refuse  to  deal  with  distributors  who  do  not  follow 
them, United States v.  Colgate & Co., 250 U. S.  300, 307-308;  and more

recently the Court has tempered, limited, or overruled once strict verti-
cal  restraint  prohibitions,  see,  e. g.,  GTE  Sylvania,  433  U. S.,  at  57-59. 
The Dr. Miles rule is also inconsistent with a principled framework, for 
it  makes  little  economic  sense  when  analyzed  with  the  Court's  other 
vertical restraint cases.  Deciding that procompetitive effects of resale 
price maintenance are insufficient to overrule Dr. Miles would call into 
question cases such as Colgate and GTE Sylvania.  Respondent's argu-
ments for reaffirming Dr. Miles based on stare decisis do not require a 
different result.  Pp. 899-907.

882  LEEGIN  CREATIVE  LEATHER  PRODUCTS,  INC.  v. 

PSKS,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 

whether the Court should overrule the per se rule and allow resale  price  maintenance  agreements  to  be  judged  by  the 

rule  of  reason,  the  usual  standard  applied  to  determine  if there is a violation of $ 1.  The Court has abandoned the rule 
of  per  se  illegality  for  other  vertical  restraints  a  manufac-turer imposes on its distributors.  Respected economic ana-
lysts, furthermore, conclude that vertical price restraints can have  procompetitive  effects.  We  now  hold  that 

Dr.  Miles should be overruled and that vertical price restraints are to 

be judged by the rule of reason. 

I 
Petitioner,  Leegin  Creative  Leather  Products,  Inc.  (Lee-gin),  designs,  manufactures,  and  distributes  leather  goods 

and  accessories.  In  1991,  Leegin  began  to  sell  belts  under the  brand  name  "Brighton."  The  Brighton  brand  has  now 
expanded  into  a  variety  of  women's  fashion  accessories.  It is sold across the United States in over 5,000 retail establish-
ments,  for  the  most  part  independent,  small  boutiques  and specialty stores.  Leegin's president, Jerry Kohl, also has an 
interest in about 70 stores that sell Brighton products.  Lee-gin asserts that, at least for its products, small retailers treat 
customers  better,  provide  customers  more  services,  and make  their  shopping  experience  more  satisfactory  than  do 
larger,  often  impersonal  retailers.  Kohl  explained:  "[W]e want  the  consumers  to  get  a  different  experience  than  they 
get  in  Sam's  Club  or  in  Wal-Mart.  And  you  can't  get  that kind  of  experience  or  support  or  customer  service  from  a 
store like Wal-Mart."  5 Record 127. Respondent,  PSKS,  Inc.  (PSKS),  operates  Kay's  Kloset,  a 
women's  apparel  store  in  Lewisville,  Texas.  Kay's  Kloset buys from about  75 different manufacturers and at one time 
sold the Brighton brand.  It first started purchasing Brigh-ton  goods  from  Leegin  in  1995.  Once  it  began  selling  the 
brand,  the  store  promoted  Brighton.  For  example,  it  ran Brighton advertisements and had Brighton days in the store.

Opinion of the Court 
Kay's  Kloset  became  the  destination  retailer  in  the  area  to buy  Brighton  products.  Brighton  was  the  store's  most  im-

portant  brand  and  once  accounted  for  40  to  50  percent  of its profits. 

In  1997,  Leegin  instituted  the  "Brighton  Retail  Pricing and Promotion Policy."  4 

id., at 939.  Following the policy, 
Leegin  refused  to  sell  to  retailers  that  discounted  Brighton 
goods  below  suggested  prices.  The  policy  contained  an  ex-ception for products not selling well that the retailer did not 

plan  on  reordering.  In  the  letter  to  retailers  establishing the policy, Leegin stated: 

"In  this  age  of  mega  stores  like  Macy's,  Bloomingdales, 
May  Co.  and others, consumers  are  perplexed  by prom-
ises of product quality and support of product which we believe is lacking in these large stores.  Consumers are 

further confused by the ever popular sale, sale, sale, etc. "We,  at  Leegin,  choose  to  break  away  from  the  pack 
by selling [at] specialty  stores;  specialty  stores  that  can offer  the  customer  great  quality  merchandise,  superb 
service,  and  support  the  Brighton  product  365  days  a year on a consistent basis. 

"We realize that half the equation is Leegin producing great  Brighton  product  and  the  other  half  is  you,  our 
retailer,  creating  great  looking  stores  selling  our  prod-
ucts in a quality manner."  Ibid. 

Leegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufficient mar-gins to provide customers the service central to its distribu-

tion  strategy.  It  also  expressed  concern  that  discounting harmed Brighton's brand image and reputation. 

A  year  after  instituting  the  pricing  policy  Leegin  intro-
duced a marketing strategy known as the "Heart Store Pro-
gram."  See  id.,  at  962-972.  It  offered  retailers  incentives 
to become Heart Stores, and, in exchange, retailers pledged, 
among  other  things,  to  sell  at  Leegin's  suggested  prices. 
Kay's Kloset became a Heart Store soon after Leegin created

Opinion of the Court 

the  program.  After  a  Leegin  employee  visited  the  store and found it unattractive, the  parties appear to have agreed 

that  Kay's  Kloset  would  not  be  a  Heart  Store  beyond  1998. Despite losing this status, Kay's Kloset continued to increase 
its Brighton sales. In  December  2002,  Leegin  discovered  Kay's  Kloset  had 
been  marking  down  Brighton's  entire  line  by  20  percent. 
Kay's  Kloset  contended  it  placed  Brighton  products  on  sale to compete with nearby retailers who also were undercutting 

Leegin's  suggested  prices.  Leegin,  nonetheless,  requested that  Kay's  Kloset  cease  discounting.  Its  request  refused, 
Leegin  stopped  selling  to the  store.  The  loss  of  the  Brigh-
ton  brand  had  a  considerable  negative  impact  on  the  store's 
revenue from sales. 

PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court for 
the  Eastern  District  of  Texas.  It  alleged,  among  other 
claims, that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by "enter-
[ing]  into  agreements  with  retailers  to  charge  only  those 
prices  fixed  by  Leegin."  Id.,  at  1236.  Leegin  planned  to 
introduce expert testimony describing the procompetitive ef-
fects  of  its  pricing  policy.  The  District  Court  excluded  the 
testimony,  relying  on  the  per  se  rule  established  by  Dr. 
Miles.  At trial PSKS argued that the Heart Store program, 
among  other  things,  demonstrated  Leegin  and  its  retailers 
had  agreed  to  fix  prices.  Leegin  responded  that  it  had  es-
tablished  a  unilateral  pricing  policy  lawful  under  $ 1,  which 
applies  only  to  concerted  action.  See  United  States  v.  Col-
gate  &  Co.,  250  U. S.  300,  307  (1919).  The  jury  agreed  with 
PSKS  and  awarded  it  $1.2  million.  Pursuant  to  15  U. S. C. 

$ 15(a),  the  District  Court  trebled  the  damages  and  reim-
bursed  PSKS  for  its  attorney's  fees  and  costs.  It  entered 
judgment against Leegin in the amount of $3,975,000.80. 

The Court  of Appeals  for the  Fifth Circuit affirmed.  171 
Fed.  Appx.  464  (2006)  (per curiam).  On  appeal  Leegin  did 
not  dispute  that  it  had  entered  into  vertical  price-fixing 
agreements with its retailers.  Rather, it contended that the 

551US2 Unit: $U74 [09-20-11 21:22:06] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
rule  of  reason  should  have  applied  to  those  agreements. The  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  this  argument.  Id.,  at  466- 

467.  It  was  correct  to  explain  that  it  remained  bound  by Dr.  Miles  "[b]ecause  [the  Supreme]  Court  has  consistently 
applied  the  per  se  rule  to  [vertical  minimum  price-fixing] agreements."  171 Fed. Appx., at 466.  On this premise the 
Court of Appeals  held that  the  District Court  did  not abuse its  discretion  in  excluding  the  testimony  of  Leegin's  eco-
nomic  expert,  for  the  per  se  rule  rendered  irrelevant  any procompetitive justifications for Leegin's pricing policy. 

Id., at  467.  We  granted  certiorari  to  determine  whether  verti-

cal  minimum  resale  price  maintenance  agreements  should continue  to  be  treated  as  per  se  unlawful.  549  U. S.  1092 
(2006).  II 

Section  1  of  the  Sherman  Act  prohibits  "[e]very  contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States." Ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1.  While $ 1 
could  be  interpreted  to  proscribe  all  contracts,  see,  e. g., Board  of  Trade  of  Chicago  v.  United  States,  246  U. S.  231, 
238  (1918),  the  Court  has  never  "taken  a  literal  approach  to [its]  language," 

Texaco  Inc.  v.  Dagher,  547  U. S.  1,  5  (2006). Rather, the Court has repeated time and again that $ 1 "out-

law[s] only unreasonable restraints."  State Oil Co. v.  Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10 (1997). 

The  rule  of  reason  is  the  accepted  standard  for  testing whether  a  practice  restrains  trade  in  violation  of  $ 1.  See 
Texaco, supra, at 5.  "Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all  of  the  circumstances  of  a  case  in  deciding  whether  a  re-
strictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unrea-sonable  restraint  on  competition."  Continental  T.  V.,  Inc. 
v.  GTE  Sylvania  Inc.,  433  U. S.  36,  49  (1977).  Appropriate factors  to  take  into  account  include  "specific  information 
about the relevant business" and "the restraint's history, na-ture,  and  effect."

Opinion of the Court 

nesses  involved  have  market  power  is  a  further,  significant consideration.  See, 

e. g., Copperweld Corp. v.  Independence 
Tube  Corp.,  467  U. S.  752,  768  (1984)  (equating  the  rule  of reason with "an inquiry into market power and market struc-

ture designed to assess [a restraint's] actual effect"); see also 
Illinois  Tool  Works  Inc.  v.  Independent  Ink,  Inc.,  547  U. S. 
28, 45-46 (2006).  In its design and function the rule  distin-
guishes  between  restraints  with  anticompetitive  effect  that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating com-

petition that are in the consumer's best interest. The  rule  of  reason  does  not  govern  all  restraints.  Some 
types  "are  deemed  unlawful  per  se."  Khan,  supra,  at  10. 
The per se rule, treating categories of restraints as necessar-
ily  illegal,  eliminates  the  need  to  study  the  reasonableness 
of  an  individual  restraint  in  light  of  the  real  market  forces 
at  work,  Business  Electronics  Corp.  v.  Sharp  Electronics 
Corp.,  485  U. S.  717,  723  (1988);  and,  it  must  be  acknowl-
edged,  the  per  se  rule  can  give  clear  guidance  for  certain 
conduct.  Restraints  that  are  per  se  unlawful  include  hori-
zontal  agreements among  competitors  to  fix prices,  see  Tex-
aco, supra, at 5, or to divide markets, see Palmer v.  BRG of 
Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46, 49-50 (1990) (per curiam). 

Resort  to  per  se  rules  is  confined  to  restraints,  like  those 
mentioned, "that would always or almost always tend to re-
strict  competition  and  decrease  output."  Business  Elec-
tronics,  supra,  at  723  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). 
To  justify  a  per  se  prohibition  a  restraint  must  have  "mani-
festly  anticompetitive"  effects,  GTE  Sylvania,  supra,  at  50, 
and  "lack . . . any  redeeming  virtue,"  Northwest  Wholesale 
Stationers,  Inc.  v.  Pacific  Stationery  &  Printing  Co.,  472 
U. S. 284, 289 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

As a consequence, the per se rule is appropriate only after 
courts  have  had  considerable  experience  with  the  type  of 
restraint  at  issue,  see  Broadcast  Music,  Inc.  v.  Columbia 
Broadcasting  System,  Inc.,  441  U. S.  1,  9  (1979),  and  only  if 
courts  can  predict  with  confidence  that  it  would  be  invali-

Opinion of the Court 
dated in  all or almost all instances under the rule  of reason, see Arizona v.  Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 

344  (1982).  It  should  come  as  no  surprise,  then,  that  "we have expressed reluctance to adopt per se rules with regard 
to restraints imposed in the context of business relationships where the economic impact of certain practices is not imme-
diately  obvious."  Khan,  supra,  at  10  (internal  quotation marks  omitted);  see  also 

White  Motor  Co.  v.  United  States, 372  U. S.  253,  263  (1963)  (refusing  to  adopt  a  per  se  rule for 

a vertical nonprice restraint because of the uncertainty con-cerning whether this type of restraint satisfied the demand-
ing standards necessary to apply a per se rule).  And, as we have  stated,  a  "departure  from  the  rule-of-reason  standard 
must  be  based  upon  demonstrable  economic  effect  rather than . . .  upon  formalistic  line  drawing." 

GTE  Sylvania, supra, at 58-59. 

III 
The  Court  has  interpreted  Dr.  Miles  Medical  Co.  v.  John D.  Park  &  Sons  Co.,  220  U. S.  373,  as  establishing  a  per  se 

rule  against  a  vertical  agreement  between  a  manufacturer and  its  distributor  to  set  minimum  resale  prices.  See,  e. g., 
Monsanto Co. v.  Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984).  In 

Dr.  Miles the  plaintiff,  a  manufacturer  of  medi-cines,  sold  its  products  only  to  distributors  who  agreed  to 

resell them at set prices.  The Court found the manufactur-er's control of resale prices to be unlawful.  It relied on the 
common-law rule that "a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily invalid."  220 U. S., at  404-405.  The Court then 
explained that the agreements would advantage the distribu-tors, not the manufacturer, and were analogous to a combina-
tion among competing distributors, which the law treated as void. 

Id., at 407-408. The  reasoning  of  the  Court's  more  recent  jurisprudence 

has  rejected  the  rationales  on  which  Dr.  Miles  was  based. By  relying  on  the  common-law  rule  against  restraints  on 
alienation,  id.,  at  404-405,  the  Court  justified  its  decision

Opinion of the Court 

based  on  "formalistic"  legal  doctrine  rather  than  "demon-strable economic effect," 

GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 58-59. 
The Court in Dr. Miles relied on a treatise published in 1628, but failed to discuss in detail the business reasons that would 

motivate a manufacturer situated in 1911 to make use of ver-tical  price  restraints.  Yet  the  Sherman  Act's  use  of  "re-
straint  of  trade"  "invokes  the  common  law  itself, . . . not  
merely the static content that the common law had assigned to  the  term  in  1890." 

Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  732. 
The  general  restraint  on  alienation,  especially  in  the  age when  then-Justice  Hughes  used  the  term,  tended  to  evoke 

policy  concerns  extraneous  to  the  question  that  controls here.  Usually  associated  with  land,  not  chattels,  the  rule 
arose  from  restrictions  removing  real  property  from  the stream  of  commerce  for  generations.  The  Court  should  be 
cautious  about  putting  dispositive  weight  on  doctrines  from 
antiquity  but  of  slight  relevance.  We  reaffirm  that  "the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrele-

vant  to  the  issue  before  us:  the  effect  of  the  antitrust  laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American econ-
omy  today."  GTE  Sylvania,  supra,  at  53,  n.  21  (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Dr.  Miles,  furthermore,  treated  vertical  agreements  a 
manufacturer  makes  with  its  distributors  as  analogous  to  a 
horizontal  combination  among  competing  distributors.  See 
220  U. S.,  at  407-408.  In  later  cases,  however,  the  Court 
rejected the approach of reliance on rules governing horizon-
tal restraints when defining rules applicable to vertical ones. 
See,  e. g.,  Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  734  (disclaiming 
the  "notion  of  equivalence  between  the  scope  of  horizontal 
per se illegality and that of vertical per se illegality"); Mari-
copa  County,  supra,  at  348,  n.  18  (noting  that  "horizontal 
restraints  are  generally  less  defensible  than  vertical  re-
straints").  Our  recent  cases  formulate  antitrust  principles 
in  accordance  with  the  appreciated  differences  in  economic 
effect  between  vertical  and  horizontal  agreements,  differ-
ences the Dr. Miles Court failed to consider.

Opinion of the Court 
The  reasons  upon  which  Dr. Miles relied  do  not  justify  a 
per  se  rule.  As  a  consequence,  it  is  necessary  to  examine, 
in  the  first  instance,  the  economic  effects  of  vertical  agree-
ments  to  fix  minimum  resale  prices,  and  to  determine 
whether  the  per  se  rule  is  nonetheless  appropriate.  See 
Business Electronics, 485 U. S., at 726. 

A 
Though each side of the debate can find sources to support 
its  position,  it  suffices  to  say  here  that  economics  literature 
is  replete  with  procompetitive  justifications  for  a  manufac-
turer's  use  of  resale  price maintenance.  See,  e. g.,  Brief  for 
Economists  as  Amici  Curiae  16  ("In  the  theoretical  litera-
ture, it  is  essentially undisputed  that minimum  [resale  price 
maintenance] can have procompetitive effects and that under 
a variety of market conditions it is unlikely to have anticom-
petitive effects"); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 
9 ("[T]here is a widespread consensus that permitting a man-
ufacturer to control the price at which its goods are sold may 
promote  interbrand  competition  and  consumer  welfare  in  a 
variety  of ways");  ABA  Section of  Antitrust  Law,  Antitrust 
Law and Economics of Product Distribution 76 (2006) ("[T]he 
bulk of the economic literature on [resale price maintenance] 
suggests  that  [it]  is  more  likely  to  be  used  to  enhance  effi-
ciency  than  for  anticompetitive  purposes");  see  also  H.  Ho-
venkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise: Principle and Execution 
184-191 (2005) (hereinafter Hovenkamp); R. Bork, The Anti-
trust  Paradox  288-291  (1978)  (hereinafter  Bork).  Even 
those  more  skeptical  of  resale  price  maintenance  acknowl-
edge it can have procompetitive effects.  See, e. g., Brief for 
William S. Comanor et al. as Amici Curiae 3 ("[G]iven [the] 
diversity  of  effects  [of  resale  price  maintenance],  one  could 
reasonably take the position that a rule of reason rather than 
a  per  se  approach  is  warranted");  F.  Scherer  &  D.  Ross, 
Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 558 
(3d ed. 1990) (hereinafter Scherer & Ross) ("The overall bal-

Opinion of the Court 

ance between benefits and costs [of resale price maintenance] is probably close"). 

The  few  recent  studies  documenting  the  competitive  ef-fects  of  resale  price  maintenance  also  cast  doubt  on  the 
conclusion  that  the  practice  meets  the  criteria  for  a  per  se rule.  See  Bureau  of  Economics  Staff  Report  to  the  FTC, 
T. Overstreet, Resale Price Maintenance: Economic Theories 
and  Empirical  Evidence  170  (1983)  (hereinafter  Overstreet) (noting that "[e]fficient uses of [resale price maintenance] are 

evidently  not  unusual  or  rare");  see  also  Ippolito,  Resale Price  Maintenance:  Empirical  Evidence  From  Litigation,  34 
J. Law & Econ. 263, 292-293 (1991) (hereinafter Ippolito). 

The  justifications  for  vertical  price  restraints  are  similar 
to  those  for  other  vertical  restraints.  See  GTE  Sylvania, 
433 U. S., at 54-57.  Minimum resale price maintenance can 
stimulate  interbrand  competition--the  competition  among 
manufacturers  selling  different  brands  of  the  same  type  of 
product--by  reducing  intrabrand  competition--the  competi-
tion among retailers selling the same brand.  See id., at 51- 
52.  The  promotion  of  interbrand  competition  is  important 
because "the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to pro-
tect  [this type of] competition."  Khan,  522 U. S., at 15.  A 
single  manufacturer's  use  of  vertical  price  restraints  tends 
to  eliminate  intrabrand  price  competition;  this  in  turn  en-
courages retailers to invest in tangible or intangible services 
or  promotional  efforts  that  aid  the  manufacturer's  position 
as  against  rival  manufacturers.  Resale  price  maintenance 
also has the potential to give consumers more options so that 
they  can  choose  among  low-price,  low-service  brands;  high-
price,  high-service  brands;  and  brands  that  fall  in  between. 

Absent  vertical  price  restraints,  the  retail  services  that 
enhance  interbrand  competition  might  be  underprovided. 
This  is  because  discounting  retailers  can  free  ride  on  retail-
ers  who  furnish  services  and  then  capture  some  of  the  in-
creased  demand  those  services  generate.  GTE  Sylvania, 
supra,  at  55.  Consumers  might  learn,  for  example,  about

Opinion of the Court 
the benefits of a manufacturer's product from a retailer that invests in fine showrooms, offers product demonstrations, or 

hires and trains knowledgeable employees.  R. Posner, Anti-trust  Law  172-173  (2d  ed.  2001)  (hereinafter  Posner).  Or 
consumers might decide to buy the product because they see it  in  a  retail  establishment  that  has  a  reputation  for  selling 
high-quality  merchandise.  Marvel  &  McCafferty,  Resale 
Price  Maintenance  and  Quality  Certification,  15  Rand  J. Econ. 346, 347-349 (1984) (hereinafter Marvel & McCafferty). 

If  the  consumer  can  then  buy  the  product  from  a  retailer that  discounts  because  it  has  not  spent  capital  provid-
ing  services  or  developing  a  quality  reputation,  the  high-
service retailer will lose sales to the discounter, forcing it to 
cut  back  its  services  to  a  level  lower  than  consumers  would 
otherwise  prefer.  Minimum  resale  price  maintenance  alle-
viates  the  problem  because  it  prevents  the  discounter  from 
undercutting  the  service  provider.  With  price  competi-
tion  decreased,  the  manufacturer's  retailers  compete  among 
themselves over services. 

Resale  price  maintenance,  in  addition,  can  increase  inter-
brand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms 
and  brands.  "[N]ew  manufacturers  and  manufacturers  en-
tering  new  markets  can  use  the  restrictions  in  order  to  in-
duce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of 
investment  of  capital  and  labor  that  is  often  required  in  the 
distribution  of  products  unknown  to  the  consumer."  GTE 
Sylvania, supra, at 55; see Marvel & McCafferty 349 (noting 
that  reliance  on  a  retailer's  reputation  "will  decline  as  the 
manufacturer's brand  becomes better  known, so that  [resale 
price maintenance] may be  particularly  important  as a com-
petitive  device  for  new  entrants").  New  products  and  new 
brands  are  essential  to  a  dynamic  economy,  and  if  markets 
can  be  penetrated  by  using  resale  price  maintenance  there 
is a procompetitive effect. 

Resale  price  maintenance  can  also  increase  interbrand 
competition by  encouraging  retailer services  that would not

be provided even absent free riding.  It may be difficult and 
inefficient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a contract 
with  a  retailer  specifying  the  different  services  the  retailer 
must  perform.  Offering  the  retailer  a  guaranteed  margin 
and threatening termination if it does not live up to expecta-
tions  may  be  the  most  efficient  way to  expand  the  manufac-
turer's  market  share  by  inducing  the  retailer's  performance 
and  allowing  it  to  use  its  own  initiative  and  experience  in 
providing valuable services.  See Mathewson & Winter, The 
Law  and  Economics  of  Resale  Price  Maintenance,  13  Rev. 
Indus. Org. 57, 74-75 (1998) (hereinafter Mathewson & Win-
ter);  Klein  &  Murphy,  Vertical  Restraints  as  Contract  En-
forcement  Mechanisms,  31  J.  Law  &  Econ.  265,  295  (1988); 
see  also  Deneckere,  Marvel,  &  Peck,  Demand  Uncertainty, 
Inventories,  and  Resale  Price  Maintenance,  111  Q.  J.  Econ.

beneficial to motivate retailers to stock adequate inventories 
of  a  manufacturer's  goods  in  the  face of  uncertain  consumer 
demand). 

B 

While  vertical  agreements  setting  minimum  resale  prices 
can  have  procompetitive  justifications,  they  may  have  anti-
competitive effects  in  other cases;  and unlawful  price fixing, 
designed solely to obtain monopoly profits, is an ever-present 
temptation.  Resale price maintenance may, for example, fa-
cilitate  a  manufacturer  cartel.  See  Business  Electronics, 
485  U. S.,  at  725.  An  unlawful  cartel  will  seek  to  discover 

if  some  manufacturers  are  undercutting  the  cartel's  fixed 
prices.  Resale  price  maintenance  could  assist  the  cartel  in 
identifying price-cutting manufacturers who benefit from the 
lower prices they offer.  Resale price  maintenance, further-
more,  could  discourage  a  manufacturer  from  cutting  prices 
to  retailers  with  the  concomitant  benefit  of  cheaper  prices 
to  consumers.  See  ibid.;  see  also  Posner  172;  Overstreet 
19-23.

Opinion of the Court 
Vertical  price  restraints  also  "might  be  used  to  organize cartels  at  the  retailer  level." 

Business  Electronics,  supra, 
at 725-726.  A  group  of retailers  might collude  to  fix prices to consumers and then compel a manufacturer to aid the un-

lawful arrangement  with  resale price  maintenance.  In that instance the manufacturer does not  establish the  practice to 
stimulate services or to promote its brand but to give ineffi-
cient  retailers  higher  profits.  Retailers  with  better  distri-bution  systems  and  lower  cost  structures  would  be  pre-

vented  from  charging  lower  prices  by  the  agreement.  See Posner 172; Overstreet  13-19.  Historical examples suggest 
this  possibility  is  a legitimate concern.  See,  e. g.,  Marvel & 
McCafferty,  The  Welfare  Effects  of  Resale  Price  Mainte-
nance, 28 J. Law & Econ. 363, 373 (1985) (hereinafter Marvel) 
(providing an example of the power of the National Associa-
tion  of  Retail  Druggists  to  compel  manufacturers  to  use  re-
sale price maintenance); Hovenkamp 186 (suggesting that the 
retail druggists in Dr. Miles formed a cartel and used manu-
facturers to enforce it). 

A  horizontal  cartel  among  competing  manufacturers  or 
competing retailers that decreases output or reduces compe-
tition  in  order  to  increase  price  is,  and  ought  to  be,  per  se 
unlawful.  See  Texaco,  547  U. S.,  at  5;  GTE  Sylvania,  433 
U. S.,  at  58,  n.  28.  To  the  extent  a  vertical  agreement  set-
ting  minimum  resale  prices  is  entered  upon  to  facilitate 
either  type  of cartel,  it,  too,  would  need  to  be  held  unlawful 
under the  rule  of reason.  This  type of agreement  may also 
be  useful  evidence  for  a  plaintiff  attempting  to  prove  the 
existence of a horizontal cartel. 

Resale  price  maintenance,  furthermore,  can  be  abused  by 
a  powerful  manufacturer  or  retailer.  A  dominant  retailer, 
for example, might request resale price maintenance to fore-
stall innovation in distribution that decreases costs.  A man-
ufacturer might consider it has little choice but to accommo-
date  the  retailer's  demands  for  vertical  price  restraints  if 
the  manufacturer  believes  it  needs  access  to  the  retailer's

distribution  network.  See  Overstreet  31;  8  P.  Areeda  &  H. Hovenkamp,  Antitrust  Law  47  (2d  ed.  2004)  (hereinafter 

Areeda  &  Hovenkamp);  cf.  Toys  "R"  Us,  Inc.  v.  FTC,  221 F. 3d 928, 937-938 (CA7 2000).  A manufacturer with market 
power, by comparison, might use resale price maintenance to give retailers an incentive not to sell the products of smaller 
rivals  or  new  entrants.  See,  e. g.,  Marvel  366-368.  As should be evident, the potential anticompetitive conse-
quences  of  vertical  price  restraints  must  not  be  ignored  or underestimated. 

C 
Notwithstanding  the  risks  of  unlawful  conduct,  it  cannot be  stated  with  any  degree  of  confidence  that  resale  price 

maintenance  "always  or  almost  always  tend[s]  to  restrict competition  and  decrease  output."  Business  Electronics, 
supra,  at  723  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Vertical agreements  establishing  minimum  resale  prices  can  have 
either  procompetitive  or  anticompetitive  effects,  depending upon  the  circumstances  in  which  they  are  formed.  And  al-
though the empirical evidence on the topic is limited, it does not  suggest  efficient  uses  of  the  agreements  are  infrequent 
or hypothetical.  See Overstreet 170; see also id., at 80 (not-ing  that  for  the  majority  of  enforcement  actions  brought  by 
the Federal Trade Commission between 1965 and 1982, "the use of [resale price maintenance] was not likely motivated by 
collusive  dealers  who  had  successfully  coerced  their  suppli-ers");  Ippolito  292  (reaching  a  similar  conclusion).  As  the 
rule  would  proscribe  a  significant  amount  of  procompeti-tive  conduct,  these  agreements  appear  ill  suited  for  per  se 
condemnation. Respondent  contends,  nonetheless,  that  vertical  price  re-
straints should be per se unlawful because of the administra-tive  convenience  of 

per  se  rules.  See,  e. g.,  GTE  Sylvania, 
supra, at 50, n. 16 (noting "per se rules tend to provide guid-ance to the business community and to minimize the burdens 

on  litigants  and  the  judicial  system").  That  argument  sug-

Opinion of the Court 
gests  per  se  illegality  is  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception. This  misinterprets  our  antitrust  law. 

Per  se  rules  may  de-
crease administrative costs, but that is only part of the equa-tion.  Those  rules  can  be  counterproductive.  They  can  in-

crease  the  total  cost  of  the  antitrust  system  by  prohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage. 
See  Easterbrook,  Vertical  Arrangements  and  the  Rule  of 
Reason, 53  Antitrust L.  J. 135,  158  (1984)  (hereinafter East-erbrook).  They  also  may  increase  litigation  costs  by  pro-

moting  frivolous  suits  against  legitimate  practices.  The Court  has  thus  explained  that  administrative  "advantages 
are not sufficient in themselves to justify the creation of per 
se rules," GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 50, n. 16, and has rele-
gated their use to restraints that are "manifestly anticompet-
itive,"  id.,  at  49-50.  Were  the  Court  now  to  conclude  that 
vertical  price  restraints  should  be  per  se  illegal  based  on 
administrative  costs,  we  would  undermine,  if  not  overrule, 
the  traditional  "demanding  standards"  for  adopting  per  se 
rules.  Id., at 50.  Any possible reduction in administrative 
costs cannot alone justify the  Dr. Miles rule. 

Respondent also argues the per se rule is justified because 
a  vertical  price  restraint  can  lead  to  higher  prices  for  the 
manufacturer's goods.  See also Overstreet 160 (noting that 
"price  surveys  indicate  that  [resale  price  maintenance]  in 
most  cases  increased  the  prices  of  products  sold").  Re-
spondent  is  mistaken  in  relying  on  pricing  effects  absent  a 
further  showing  of  anticompetitive  conduct.  Cf.  id.,  at  106 
(explaining that price surveys "do not necessarily tell us any-
thing  conclusive  about  the  welfare  effects  of  [resale  price 
maintenance]  because  the  results  are  generally  consistent 
with  both  procompetitive  and  anticompetitive  theories"). 
For,  as  has  been  indicated  already,  the  antitrust  laws  are 
designed  primarily  to  protect  interbrand  competition,  from 
which  lower  prices  can  later  result.  See  Khan,  522  U. S., 
at  15.  The  Court,  moreover,  has  evaluated  other  vertical 
restraints under the rule of reason even though prices can be

Opinion of the Court 

increased  in the  course  of  promoting procompetitive  effects. See, 

e. g.,  Business  Electronics,  485  U. S.,  at  728.  And  re-
sale  price  maintenance  may  reduce  prices  if  manufacturers have  resorted  to  costlier  alternatives  of  controlling  resale 

prices  that  are  not  per  se  unlawful.  See  infra,  at  902-904; see also Marvel 371. 

Respondent's  argument,  furthermore,  overlooks  that,  in genera

l,  the  interests  of  manufacturers  and  consumers  are aligned  with  respect  to  retailer  profit  margins.  The  differ-

ence between the price a manufacturer charges retailers and the  price  retailers  charge  consumers  represents  part  of  the 
manufacturer's  cost  of  distribution,  which,  like  any  other 
cost,  the  manufacturer  usually  desires  to  minimize.  See 
GTE  Sylvania,  433  U. S.,  at  56,  n.  24;  see  also  id.,  at  56 
("Economists  .  .  .  have  argued  that  manufacturers  have  an 
economic interest in maintaining as much intrabrand compe-
tition  as  is  consistent  with  the  efficient  distribution  of  their 
products").  A  manufacturer  has  no  incentive  to  overcom-
pensate  retailers  with  unjustified  margins.  The  retailers, 
not  the  manufacturer,  gain  from  higher  retail  prices.  The 
manufacturer often loses; interbrand competition reduces its 
competitiveness  and  market  share  because  consumers  will 
"substitute  a  different  brand  of  the  same  product."  Id.,  at 
52, n. 19; see Business Electronics, supra, at 725.  As a gen-
eral  matter,  therefore,  a  single  manufacturer  will  desire  to 
set  minimum  resale  prices  only  if  the  "increase  in  demand 
resulting  from  enhanced  service . . . will  more  than  offset 

a  negative  impact  on  demand  of  a  higher  retail  price." 
Mathewson & Winter 67. 

The implications of respondent's position are far reaching. 
Many  decisions  a  manufacturer  makes  and  carries  out 
through concerted action can lead to higher prices.  A man-
ufacturer might, for example, contract with different suppli-
ers to obtain better inputs that improve product quality.  Or 
it might hire an advertising agency to promote awareness of 
its goods.  Yet no one would think these actions violate  the

Opinion of the Court 
Sherman  Act because  they lead  to higher  prices.  The  anti-trust  laws  do  not  require  manufacturers  to  produce  generic 

goods that consumers do not know about or want.  The man-ufacturer  strives  to  improve  its  product  quality  or  to  pro-
mote  its  brand  because  it  believes  this  conduct  will  lead  to increased demand despite higher prices.  The same can hold 
true for resale price maintenance. Resale  price  maintenance,  it  is  true,  does  have  economic 
dangers.  If  the  rule  of  reason  were  to  apply  to  vertical 
price restraints, courts would have to be diligent in eliminat-ing  their  anticompetitive  uses  from  the  market.  This  is  a 

realistic  objective,  and  certain  factors  are  relevant  to  the 
inquiry.  For  example,  the  number  of  manufacturers  that 
make  use  of  the  practice  in  a  given  industry  can  provide 
important  instruction.  When  only  a  few  manufacturers 
lacking market power adopt the practice, there is little likeli-
hood it is facilitating a manufacturer cartel, for a cartel then 
can be undercut by rival manufacturers.  See Overstreet 22; 
Bork  294.  Likewise,  a  retailer  cartel  is  unlikely  when  only 
a  single  manufacturer  in  a  competitive  market  uses  resale 
price  maintenance.  Interbrand  competition  would  divert 
consumers  to  lower  priced  substitutes  and  eliminate  any 
gains  to  retailers  from  their  price-fixing  agreement  over  a 
single  brand.  See  Posner  172;  Bork  292.  Resale  price 
maintenance  should  be  subject  to  more  careful  scrutiny,  by 
contrast,  if  many  competing  manufacturers  adopt  the  prac-
tice.  Cf. Scherer & Ross 558 (noting that "except when [re-
sale  price  maintenance]  spreads  to  cover  the  bulk  of  an  in-
dustry's output, depriving consumers of a meaningful choice 
between  high-service  and  low-price  outlets,  most  [resale 
price maintenance arrangements]  are probably innocu-
ous");  Easterbrook  162  (suggesting  that  "every  one  of  the 
potentially-anticompetitive  outcomes  of  vertical arrange-
ments depends on the uniformity of the practice"). 

The source of the restraint may also be an important con-
sideration.  If  there  is  evidence  retailers  were  the  impetus

Opinion of the Court 

for  a  vertical  price  restraint,  there  is  a  greater  likelihood that  the  restraint  facilitates  a  retailer  cartel  or  supports  a 

dominant, inefficient retailer.  See Brief for William S. Com-anor et al. as 

Amici Curiae 7-8.  If, by contrast, a manufac-
turer  adopted  the  policy  independent  of  retailer  pressure, the  restraint  is  less  likely  to  promote  anticompetitive  con-

duct.  Cf.  Posner  177  ("It  makes  all  the  difference  whether 
minimum  retail  prices  are  imposed  by  the  manufacturer  in order  to  evoke  point-of-sale  services  or  by  the  dealers  in 

order to obtain monopoly profits").  A manufacturer also has an  incentive  to  protest  inefficient  retailer-induced  price  re-
straints because they can harm its competitive position. 

As a final matter, that a dominant manufacturer or retailer 
can  abuse  resale  price  maintenance  for  anticompetitive  pur-
poses may not be a serious concern unless the relevant entity 
has market power.  If a retailer lacks market power, manu-
facturers  likely  can  sell  their  goods  through  rival  retailers. 
See  also  Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  727,  n.  2  (noting 
"[r]etail market power is rare, because of the usual presence 
of  interbrand  competition  and  other  dealers").  And  if  a 
manufacturer  lacks  market  power,  there  is  less  likelihood  it 
can use the practice to keep competitors away from distribu-
tion outlets. 

The rule  of reason is  designed and used  to eliminate anti-
competitive  transactions  from  the  market.  This  standard 
principle applies to vertical price restraints.  A party alleg-
ing injury from a vertical agreement setting minimum resale 
prices  will  have,  as  a  general  matter,  the  information  and 
resources  available  to  show  the  existence  of  the  agreement 
and  its  scope  of  operation.  As  courts  gain  experience  con-
sidering  the  effects  of  these  restraints  by  applying  the  rule 
of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the 
litigation  structure  to  ensure  the  rule  operates  to  eliminate 
anticompetitive  restraints  from  the  market  and  to  provide 
more  guidance  to  businesses.  Courts  can,  for  example,  de-
vise rules over time for offering proof, or even presumptions

Opinion of the Court 
where justified, to make the rule of reason a fair and efficient way  to  prohibit  anticompetitive  restraints  and  to  promote 

procompetitive ones. For  all  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  think  that  were  the 
Court  considering  the  issue  as  an  original  matter,  the  rule of  reason,  not  a  per  se  rule  of  unlawfulness,  would  be  the 
appropriate standard to judge vertical price restraints. 

IV 
We  do  not  write  on  a  clean  slate,  for  the  decision  in  Dr. 
Miles is  almost  a  century  old.  So  there  is  an  argument  for its retention on the basis of 

stare decisis alone.  Even if Dr. Miles established an erroneous rule, "[s]tare decisis reflects 

a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be set-
tled right."  Khan, 522 U. S., at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And  concerns  about  maintaining  settled  law  are 
strong  when  the  question  is  one  of statutory  interpretation. See, 

e. g., Hohn v.  United States, 524 U. S. 236, 251 (1998). Stare  decisis  is  not  as  significant  in  this  case,  however, 

because the issue before us is the scope of the Sherman Act. 
Khan, supra, at 20 ("[T]he general presumption that legisla-tive  changes  should  be  left  to  Congress  has  less  force  with 

respect  to  the  Sherman  Act").  From  the  beginning  the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a common-law statute. 
See  National  Soc.  of  Professional  Engineers  v.  United 
States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978); see also Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.  Transport Workers, 451  U. S.  77,  98, n. 42  (1981) ("In 

antitrust,  the  federal  courts  .  .  .  act  more  as  common-law courts  than  in  other  areas  governed  by  federal  statute"). 
Just as the common law adapts to modern understanding and greater  experience,  so  too  does  the  Sherman  Act's  prohibi-
tion on "restraint[s] of trade" evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions.  The case-by-case adjudication 
contemplated  by  the  rule  of  reason  has  implemented  this common-law  approach.  See

Opinion of the Court 

Engineers,  supra,  at  688.  Likewise,  the  boundaries  of  the doctrine  of  per  se  illegality  should  not  be  immovable.  For 

"[i]t  would  make  no  sense  to  create  out  of  the  single  term `restraint  of  trade'  a  chronologically  schizoid  statute,  in 
which a `rule of reason' evolves with new circumstances and new  wisdom,  but  a  line  of 

per  se  illegality  remains  forever fixed where it was."  Business Electronics, 485 U. S., at 732. 

A 
Stare  decisis,  we  conclude,  does  not  compel  our  continued adherence to the 

per se rule against vertical price restraints. As  discussed  earlier,  respected  authorities  in  the  economics 

literature suggest the per se rule is inappropriate, and there is now widespread agreement that resale price maintenance 
can have procompetitive effects.  See, e. g., Brief for Econo-mists  as 

Amici  Curiae  16.  It  is  also  significant  that  both the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commis-

sion--the  antitrust  enforcement  agencies  with  the  ability  to assess  the  long-term  impacts  of  resale  price  maintenance-- 
have  recommended  that  this  Court  replace  the  per  se  rule with  the  traditional  rule  of  reason.  See  Brief  for  United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  6.  In  the  antitrust  context  the fact  that  a  decision  has  been  "called  into  serious  question" 
justifies our reevaluation of it.  Khan, supra, at 21. Other  considerations  reinforce  the  conclusion  that 

Dr. Miles  should  be  overturned.  Of  most  relevance,  "we  have 

overruled  our  precedents  when  subsequent  cases  have  un-dermined  their  doctrinal  underpinnings."  Dickerson  v. 
United  States,  530  U. S.  428,  443  (2000).  The  Court's  treat-ment  of  vertical  restraints  has  progressed  away  from  Dr. 
Miles'  strict  approach.  We  have  distanced  ourselves  from the  opinion's  rationales.  See 

supra,  at  887-889;  see  also Khan,  supra,  at  21  (overruling  a  case  when  "the  views  un-

derlying  [it  had  been]  eroded  by  this  Court's  precedent"); Rodriguez  de  Quijas  v.  Shearson/American  Express,  Inc., 
490  U. S.  477,  480-481  (1989)  (same).  This  is  unsurprising, for  the  case  was  decided  not  long  after  enactment  of  the

Opinion of the Court 
Sherman Act when the Court had little experience with anti-
trust analysis.  Only  eight years after Dr. Miles, moreover, 
the  Court  reined  in  the  decision  by  holding  that  a  manufac-
turer  can  announce  suggested  resale  prices  and  refuse  to 
deal with distributors who do not follow them.  Colgate, 250 
U. S., at 307-308. 

In  more  recent  cases  the  Court,  following  a  common-law 
approach,  has  continued  to  temper,  limit,  or  overrule  once 
strict prohibitions on vertical restraints.  In 1977, the Court 
overturned  the  per  se  rule  for  vertical  nonprice  restraints, 
adopting  the  rule  of  reason  in  its  stead.  GTE  Sylvania, 
433  U. S.,  at  57-59  (overruling  United  States  v.  Arnold, 
Schwinn  &  Co.,  388  U. S.  365  (1967));  see  also  433  U. S.,  at 
58, n. 29 (noting "that the advantages of vertical restrictions 
should  not  be  limited  to  the  categories  of  new  entrants  and 
failing  firms").  While  the  Court  in  a  footnote  in  GTE  Syl-
vania suggested that differences between vertical price and 
nonprice  restraints  could  support  different  legal  treatment, 
see  id.,  at  51,  n.  18,  the  central  part  of  the  opinion  relied 
on  authorities  and  arguments  that  find  unequal  treatment 
"difficult  to  justify,"  id.,  at  69-70  (White,  J.,  concurring  in 
judgment). 

Continuing in this direction, in two cases in the 1980's the 
Court defined legal rules to limit the reach of Dr. Miles and 
to  accommodate  the  doctrines  enunciated  in  GTE  Sylvania 
and  Colgate.  See  Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  726- 
728;  Monsanto,  465  U. S.,  at  763-764.  In  Monsanto,  the

should  be  overruled,  see  465  U. S.,  at  769,  the  Court  "de-
cline[d]  to  reach  the  question"  whether  vertical  agreements

ther  party  suggested  otherwise,  id.,  at  761-762,  n.  7.  In

Opinion of the Court 

Business  Electronics  the  Court  further  narrowed  the  scope of 

Dr.  Miles.  It  held  that  the  per  se  rule  applied  only  to 
specific  agreements  over  price  levels  and  not  to  an  agree-ment between a manufacturer and a distributor to terminate 

a  price-cutting  distributor.  485  U. S.,  at  726-727,  735-736. Most recently, in 1997, after examining the issue of vertical 
maximum  price-fixing  agreements  in  light  of  commentary 
and real experience, the Court overruled a 29-year-old prece-dent treating those agreements as 

per se illegal.  Khan, 522 
U. S.,  at 22  (overruling  Albrecht  v.  Herald Co., 390  U. S. 145 (1968)).  It held instead that they should be evaluated under 

the traditional rule of reason.  522 U. S., at 22.  Our contin-
ued  limiting  of  the  reach  of  the  decision  in  Dr.  Miles  and 
our  recent  treatment  of  other  vertical  restraints  justify  the 
conclusion that Dr. Miles should not be retained. 

The  Dr.  Miles  rule  is  also  inconsistent  with  a  principled 
framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed 
with  our  other  cases  on  vertical  restraints.  If  we  were  to 
decide the procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance 
were  insufficient  to  overrule  Dr.  Miles,  then  cases  such  as 
Colgate  and GTE  Sylvania themselves  would be  called  into 
question.  These  later  decisions,  while  they  may  result  in 
less  intrabrand  competition,  can  be  justified  because  they 
permit  manufacturers  to  secure  the  procompetitive  benefits 
associated with vertical price restraints through other meth-
ods.  The other methods, however, could be less efficient for 
a particular manufacturer to establish and sustain.  The end 
result  hinders  competition  and  consumer  welfare  because 
manufacturers  are  forced  to  engage  in  second-best  alterna-
tives  and  because  consumers  are  required  to  shoulder  the 
increased expense of the inferior practices. 

The  manufacturer  has  a  number  of  legitimate  options  to 
achieve  benefits  similar  to  those  provided  by  vertical  price 
restraints.  A manufacturer can exercise its Colgate right to 
refuse to deal with retailers that do not follow its suggested 
prices.  See  250  U. S.,  at  307.  The  economic  effects  of  uni-

Opinion of the Court 
lateral  and  concerted  price  setting  are  in  general  the  same. See, 

e. g., Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762-764.  The problem for 
the manufacturer is that a jury might conclude its unilateral policy was really a vertical agreement, subjecting it to treble 

damages  and  potential  criminal  liability.  Ibid.;  Business 
Electronics,  supra,  at  728.  Even  with  the  stringent  stand-
ards in Monsanto and Business Electronics, this danger can 
lead,  and  has  led,  rational  manufacturers  to  take  wasteful measures.  See, 

e. g.,  Brief  for  PING,  Inc.,  as  Amicus  Cu-
riae 9-18.  A manufacturer might refuse to discuss its pric-ing  policy  with  its  distributors  except  through  counsel 

knowledgeable  of  the  subtle  intricacies  of  the  law.  Or  it 
might  terminate  longstanding  distributors  for  minor  viola-
tions  without  seeking  an  explanation.  See  ibid.  The  in-
creased  costs  these  burdensome  measures  generate  flow  to 
consumers in the form of higher prices. 

Furthermore,  depending  on  the  type  of  product  it  sells,  a 
manufacturer  might  be  able  to  achieve  the  procompetitive 
benefits  of  resale  price  maintenance  by  integrating  down-
stream  and  selling  its  products  directly  to  consumers.  Dr. 
Miles tilts the relative costs of vertical integration and verti-
cal  agreement  by  making  the  former  more  attractive  based 
on the per se rule, not on real market conditions.  See Busi-
ness Electronics, supra, at 725; see generally Coase, The Na-
ture of the Firm, 4 Economica, New Series 386 (1937).  This 
distortion might lead to inefficient integration that would not 
otherwise  take  place,  so  that  consumers  must  again  suffer 
the  consequences  of  the  suboptimal  distribution  strategy. 
And  integration,  unlike  vertical  price  restraints,  eliminates 
all intrabrand competition.  See, e. g., GTE Sylvania, supra, 
at 57, n. 26. 

There  is  yet  another  consideration.  A  manufacturer  can 
impose territorial restrictions on distributors and allow only 
one distributor to sell its goods in a given region.  Our cases 
have recognized, and the economics literature confirms, that 
these  vertical  nonprice  restraints  have  impacts  similar  to

Opinion of the Court 

those  of  vertical  price  restraints;  both  reduce  intrabrand competition  and  can  stimulate  retailer  services.  See,  e. g., 

Business  Electronics,  supra,  at  728;  Monsanto,  supra,  at 762-763;  see  also  Brief  for  Economists  as  Amici  Curiae  17- 
18.  Cf.  Scherer  &  Ross  560  (noting  that  vertical  nonprice restraints  "can  engender  inefficiencies  at  least  as  serious  as 
those  imposed  upon  the  consumer  by  resale  price  mainte-nance");  Steiner,  How  Manufacturers  Deal  with  the  PriceCutting  Retailer:  When  Are  Vertical  Restraints  Efficient? 65  Antitrust  L.  J.  407,  446-447  (1997)  (indicating  that  "anti-
trust  law  should  recognize  that  the  consumer  interest  is often  better served by  [resale  price  maintenance]--contrary 
to its per  se illegality and the rule-of-reason status of verti-cal  nonprice  restraints").  The  same  legal  standard  (

per  se unlawfulness) applies to horizontal market division and hori-

zontal price fixing because both have similar economic effect. There  is  likewise  little  economic  justification  for  the  cur-
rent  differential  treatment  of  vertical  price  and  nonprice restraints.  Furthermore,  vertical  nonprice  restraints  may 
prove  less  efficient  for  inducing  desired  services,  and  they reduce  intrabrand  competition  more  than  vertical  price  re-
straints  by  eliminating  both  price  and  service  competition. See Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae 17-18. 

In  sum,  it  is  a  flawed  antitrust  doctrine  that  serves  the interests  of  lawyers--by  creating  legal  distinctions  that  op-
erate  as  traps  for  the  unwary--more  than  the  interests  of consumers--by  requiring  manufacturers  to  choose  second-
best options to achieve sound business objectives. 

B 
Respondent's  arguments  for  reaffirming  Dr. Miles on  the basis  of  stare  decisis  do  not  require  a  different  result.  Re-

spondent  looks  to  congressional  action  concerning  vertical price  restraints.  In  1937,  Congress  passed  the  MillerTydings  Fair  Trade  Act,  50  Stat.  693,  which  made  vertical price  restraints  legal  if  authorized  by  a  fair  trade  law

Opinion of the Court 
enacted by a State.  Fifteen years later, Congress expanded the  exemption  to  permit  vertical  price-setting  agreements 

between  a  manufacturer  and  a  distributor  to  be  enforced against  other  distributors  not  involved  in  the  agreement. 
McGuire  Act,  66  Stat.  632.  In  1975,  however,  Congress  re-pealed  both  Acts.  Consumer  Goods  Pricing  Act,  89  Stat. 
801.  That  the  Dr.  Miles  rule  applied  to  vertical  price  re-
straints  in  1975,  according  to  respondent,  shows  Congress ratified the rule. 

This  is  not  so.  The  text  of  the  Consumer  Goods  Pricing Act  did  not  codify  the  rule  of 

per  se  illegality  for  vertical 
price  restraints.  It  rescinded  statutory  provisions  that 
made  them  per  se  legal.  Congress  once  again  placed  these 
restraints within the ambit of $ 1 of the Sherman Act.  And, 
as  has  been  discussed,  Congress  intended  $ 1  to  give  courts 
the  ability  "to  develop  governing  principles  of  law"  in  the 
common-law  tradition.  Texas  Industries,  Inc.  v.  Radcliff 
Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 643 (1981); see Business Elec-
tronics, 485 U. S., at 731 ("The changing content of the term 
`restraint of trade' was well recognized at the time the Sher-
man  Act  was  enacted").  Congress  could  have  set  the  Dr. 
Miles rule in stone, but it chose a more flexible option.  We 
respect  its  decision  by  analyzing  vertical  price  restraints, 
like all restraints, in conformance with traditional $ 1 princi-
ples,  including  the  principle  that  our  antitrust  doctrines 
"evolv[e]  with  new  circumstances  and  new  wisdom."  Busi-
ness Electronics, supra, at 732; see also Easterbrook 139. 

The  rule  of  reason,  furthermore,  is  not  inconsistent  with 
the  Consumer  Goods  Pricing  Act.  Unlike  the  earlier  con-
gressional  exemption,  it  does  not  treat  vertical  price  re-
straints  as  per  se  legal.  In  this  respect,  the  justifications 
for  the  prior  exemption  are  illuminating.  Its  goal  "was  to 
allow  the  States  to  protect  small  retail  establishments  that 
Congress  thought  might  otherwise  be  driven  from  the  mar-
ketplace  by  large-volume  discounters."  California  Retail 
Liquor  Dealers  Assn.  v.  Midcal  Aluminum,  Inc.,  445  U. S.

Opinion of the Court 

97, 102 (1980).  The state fair trade laws also appear to have 
been  justified  on  similar  grounds.  See  Areeda  &  Hoven-
kamp 298.  The rationales for these provisions are foreign to 
the Sherman Act.  Divorced from competition and consumer 
welfare,  they  were  designed  to  save  inefficient  small  retail-
ers from their inability to compete.  The purpose of the anti-
trust laws, by contrast, is "the protection of competition, not 
competitors."  Atlantic  Richfield  Co.  v.  USA  Petroleum 
Co.,  495 U. S. 328, 338 (1990) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted).  To  the  extent  Congress  repealed  the  exemption  for 
some vertical price restraints to end its prior practice of en-
couraging  anticompetitive  conduct,  the  rule  of  reason  pro-
motes the same objective. 

Respondent also relies on several congressional appropria-
tions in the mid-1980's in which Congress did not permit the 
Department  of  Justice  or  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to 
use  funds  to  advocate  overturning  Dr.  Miles.  See,  e. g.,  97 
Stat. 1071.  We need not pause long in addressing this argu-
ment.  The conditions on funding are no longer in place, see, 
e. g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21, and they 
were ambiguous at best.  As much as they might show con-
gressional approval for Dr. Miles, they might demonstrate a 
different  proposition:  that  Congress  could  not  pass  legisla-
tion  codifying  the  rule  and  reached  a  short-term  compro-
mise instead. 

Reliance interests do not require us to reaffirm Dr. Miles. 
To be sure, reliance on a judicial opinion is a significant rea-
son  to  adhere  to  it,  Payne  v.  Tennessee,  501  U. S.  808,  828 
(1991),  especially  "in  cases  involving  property  and  contract 
rights," Khan, 522 U. S., at 20.  The reliance interests here, 
however,  like  the  reliance  interests  in  Khan,  cannot  justify 
an  inefficient  rule,  especially  because  the  narrowness  of  the 
rule has allowed manufacturers to set minimum resale prices 
in  other  ways.  And  while  the  Dr.  Miles rule  is  longstand-
ing, resale price maintenance was legal under fair trade laws

Opinion of the Court 
in  a  majority  of  States  for  a  large  part  of  the  past  century up until 1975. 

It  is  also  of  note  that  during  this  time  "when  the  legal environment  in  the  [United  States]  was  most  favorable  for 
[resale  price  maintenance],  no  more  than  a  tiny  fraction  of manufacturers ever employed [resale price maintenance] con-
tracts."  Overstreet  6;  see  also  id.,  at  169  (noting  that  "no more  than  one  percent  of  manufacturers,  accounting  for  no 
more  than  ten  percent  of  consumer  goods  purchases,  ever employed  [resale  price  maintenance]  in  any  single  year  in 
the [United States]"); Scherer & Ross 549 (noting that "[t]he fraction of U. S. retail sales covered by [resale price mainte-
nance]  in  its  heyday  has  been  variously  estimated  at  from  4 to  10  percent").  To  the  extent  consumers  demand  cheap 
goods, judging vertical price restraints under the rule of rea-son  will  not  prevent  the  market  from  providing  them. 
Cf.  Easterbrook  152-153  (noting  that  "S.S.  Kresge  (the  old K-Mart) flourished during the days of manufacturers' great-
est  freedom"  because  "discount  stores  offer  a  combination of  price  and  service  that  many  customers  value"  and  that 
"[n]othing  in  restricted  dealing  threatens  the  ability  of  con-sumers to find low prices"); Scherer & Ross 557 (noting that 
"for the most part, the effects of the [Consumer Goods Pric-ing  Act]  were  imperceptible  because  the  forces  of  competi-
tion had already repealed the [previous antitrust exemption] in their own quiet way"). 

For these reasons  the Court's  decision in  Dr. Miles Medi-cal  Co.  v.  John  D.  Park  &  Sons  Co.,  220  U. S.  373  (1911),  is 
now  overruled.  Vertical  price  restraints  are  to  be  judged according to the rule of reason.

3.  The  Fifth  Circuit  employed  an  improperly  restrictive  test  when 
it  considered  petitioner's  claim  of  incompetency  on  the  merits. 
Pp. 954-962. 

(a)  The  Fifth  Circuit's  incompetency  standard  is  too  restrictive  to 
afford a prisoner Eighth Amendment protections.  Petitioner's experts 
in  the District  Court  concluded  that,  although he claims to understand 
that the State says it wants to execute him for murder, his mental prob-
lems have resulted in the delusion that the stated reason is a sham, and 
that the State actually wants to execute him to stop him from preaching. 
The Fifth Circuit held, based on its earlier decisions, that such delusions 
are  simply  not  relevant  to  whether  a  prisoner  can  be  executed  so  long 
as  he is aware that the State has identified the link between  his  crime 
and  the  punishment  to  be  inflicted.  This  test  ignores  the  possibility 
that  even  if  such  awareness  exists,  gross  delusions  stemming  from  a 
severe  mental  disorder  may put  that  awareness  in  a  context so  far  re-
moved  from  reality  that  the  punishment  can  serve  no  proper  purpose.

health  expert  as  his  own  criticisms  of  the  report  were  "by necessity limited,"

Opinion of the Court 
The  State  acknowledges  that  Ford-based  incompetency claims, as a general matter, are not ripe until after the time 

has  run  to  file  a  first  federal  habeas  petition.  See  Supple-mental  Brief  for  Respondent  6.  The  State  nevertheless 
maintains  that  its  rule  would  not  foreclose  prisoners  from raising

ment  of  a  threshold  preliminary  showing,  for  instance,  will, as  a  general  matter,  be  imposed  before  a  stay  is  granted  or 

the action is allowed to proceed. There is, in addition, no argument that petitioner's actions 
constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in  our  cases.  Cf.

decision  affecting  the  life  or  death  of  a  human  being. Thus, the ascertainment of a prisoner's sanity as a pred-

icate  to  lawful  execution  calls  for  no  less  stringent standards than those demanded in any other aspect of a 
capital proceeding."  477 U. S., at 411-412. 
Justice Powell's concurrence, which also addressed the ques-tion  of  procedure,  offered  a  more  limited  holding.  When 

there  is  no  majority  opinion,  the  narrower  holding  controls. See

mental  illness  of  the  sort  alleged  by  petitioner  might  affect this  analysis.  In  overseeing  the  development  of  the  record 
and  in  making  its  factual  findings,  the  District  Court  found itself  bound  to  analyze  the  question  of  competency  in  the 
terms set by Circuit precedent.  It acknowledged, for exam-
ple,  the  "difficult  issue"  posed  by  the  delusions  allegedly  in-terfering  with  petitioner's  understanding  of  the  reason  be-

hind  his  execution,  401  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  712,  but  it  refrained from making definitive findings of fact with respect to these 
matters, see id.,

there  and  the  applicant's  current  good  standing,  and  (2)  a 
completely executed copy of the form approved by this Court 
and furnished by the Clerk containing (a) the applicant's per-
sonal  statement,  and  (b)  the  statement  of  two  sponsors  en-
dorsing  the  correctness  of  the  applicant's  statement,  stating 
that  the  applicant  possesses  all  the  qualifications  required 
for  admission,  and  affirming  that  the  applicant  is  of  good 
moral  and  professional  character.  Both  sponsors  must  be 
members  of the  Bar of  this  Court  who  personally  know, but 
are not related to, the applicant. 

3.  If the documents submitted demonstrate that the appli-
cant  possesses  the  necessary  qualifications,  and  if  the  appli-
cant has signed the oath or affirmation and paid the required 
fee,  the  Clerk  will  notify  the  applicant  of  acceptance  by  the 
Court  as  a  member  of  the  Bar  and  issue  a  certificate  of  ad-
mission.  An  applicant  who  so  wishes  may  be  admitted  in 
open  court  on  oral  motion  by  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  this 
Court,  provided  that  all  other  requirements  for  admission 
have been satisfied. 

4.  Each  applicant shall sign the  following oath or affirma-
tion:  I,  ...............,  do  solemnly  swear  (or  affirm)  that  as  an 
attorney and as a counselor of this Court, I will conduct my-
self  uprightly  and  according  to  law,  and  that  I  will  support 
the Constitution of the United States. 

5.  The fee for admission to the Bar and a certificate bear-
ing the seal of the Court is $200, payable to the United States 
Supreme  Court.  The  Marshal  will  deposit  such  fees  in  a 
separate fund to be disbursed by the Marshal at the direction 
of the Chief Justice for the costs of admissions, for the benefit 
of the Court and its Bar, and for related purposes. 

6.  The  fee  for  a  duplicate  certificate  of  admission  to  the 
Bar  bearing  the  seal  of  the  Court  is  $15,  and  the  fee  for  a 
certificate  of  good  standing  is  $10,  payable  to  the  United 
States Supreme Court.  The proceeds will be maintained by 
the Marshal as provided in paragraph 5 of this Rule.

conflicts  with  a  decision  by  a  state  court  of  last  resort; or  has  so  far  departed  from  the  accepted  and  usual

of judgment. 4.  A  cross-petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  is  timely  when 
it is  filed with the  Clerk as provided in paragraphs 1,  3, and 5  of  this  Rule,  or  in  Rule  12.5.  However,  a  conditional 
cross-petition (which except for Rule 12.5 would be untimely) will not be granted unless another party's timely petition for 
a writ of certiorari is granted. 5.  For  good  cause,  a  Justice  may extend  the  time  to  file  a 
petition for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding 60 days.  An application to extend the time to file shall set out 
the basis for jurisdiction in this Court, identify the judgment sought to be reviewed, include a copy of the opinion and any 
order respecting rehearing, and set out specific reasons why an  extension  of  time  is  justified.  The  application  must  be 
filed with the Clerk at least 10 days before the date the peti-tion is due, except in extraordinary circumstances.  For the 
time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules 21, 22, 30,  and 33.2.  An  application  to extend the  time to file  a 
petition for a writ of certiorari is not favored.

number of the case, and the date of entry; (iv)  the  judgment  sought  to  be  reviewed  if  the  date 
of  its  entry  is  different  from  the  date  of  the  opinion or  order  required  in  sub-subparagraph  ( i)  of  this 
subparagraph; (v)  material  required  by  subparagraphs  1(f )  or 
1(g)(i); and (vi)  any  other  material  the  petitioner  believes  essen-
tial to understand the petition. 
If the material required by this subparagraph is voluminous, it  may  be  presented  in  a  separate  volume  or  volumes  with 

appropriate covers. 2.  All  contentions  in  support  of  a  petition  for  a  writ  of 
certiorari shall be set out in the body of the petition, as pro-vided  in  subparagraph  1(h)  of  this  Rule.  No  separate  brief 
in  support of  a  petition  for  a writ  of certiorari  may  be  filed, and the Clerk will not file any petition for a writ of certiorari 
to which any supporting brief is annexed or appended. 3.  A  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be  stated 
briefly  and  in  plain  terms  and  may  not  exceed  the  word  or page limitations specified in Rule 33. 

4.  The  failure  of  a  petitioner  to  present  with  accuracy, brevity,  and  clarity  whatever  is  essential  to  ready  and  ade-
quate understanding of the  points requiring consideration is sufficient reason for the Court to deny a petition. 

5.  If the Clerk determines that a petition submitted timely and in good faith is in a form that does not comply with this 
Rule  or  with  Rule  33  or  Rule  34,  the  Clerk  will  return  it with a letter indicating the deficiency.  A corrected petition 
submitted in accordance with Rule 29.2 no more than 60 days after  the  date  of  the  Clerk's  letter  will  be  deemed  timely.

2.  A  brief  in  opposition  should  be  stated  briefly  and  in 
plain terms and may not exceed the word or page limitations 
specified  in  Rule  33.  In  addition  to  presenting  other  argu-
ments for denying the petition, the brief in opposition should 
address  any  perceived  misstatement  of  fact  or  law  in  the 
petition that  bears  on what issues  properly  would be before 
the  Court  if  certiorari  were  granted.  Counsel  are  admon-
ished  that  they  have  an  obligation to  the  Court  to  point  out 
in  the  brief  in  opposition,  and  not  later,  any  perceived  mis-
statement made in  the  petition.  Any objection to consider-
ation  of a question presented based  on what occurred in the 
proceedings  below,  if  the  objection  does  not  go  to  jurisdic-
tion,  may  be  deemed  waived  unless  called  to  the  Court's  at-
tention in the brief in opposition. 

3.  Any  brief  in  opposition  shall  be  filed  within  30  days 
after the  case is placed  on  the docket,  unless  the time is  ex-
tended by the Court or a Justice, or by the Clerk under Rule

writ of certiorari may be filed.  Any objections to the juris-
diction of the Court to grant a petition for a writ of certiorari 
shall be included in the brief in opposition. 

5.  The  Clerk  will  distribute  the  petition  to  the  Court  for 
its  consideration  upon  receiving  an  express  waiver  of  the 
right  to  file  a  brief  in  opposition,  or,  if  no  waiver  or  brief  in

4.  The case  will  be placed  on the  docket when  the  motion for  leave  to  file  and  the  initial  pleading  are  filed  with  the 
Clerk.  The Rule 38(a) docket fee shall be paid at that time. 5.  No  more  than  60  days  after  receiving  the  motion  for 
leave  to  file  and  the  initial  pleading,  an  adverse  party  shall file  40  copies  of  any  brief  in  opposition  to  the  motion,  with 
proof of service as required by Rule 29.  The Clerk will dis-tribute the filed documents to the Court for its consideration 
upon  receiving  an  express  waiver  of  the  right  to  file  a  brief in opposition, or, if no waiver or brief is filed, upon the expi-
ration of the time allowed for filing.  If a brief in opposition is  timely  filed,  the  Clerk  will  distribute  the  filed  documents 
to  the  Court  for  its  consideration  no  less  than  10  days  after the  brief  in  opposition  is  filed.  A  reply  brief  may  be  filed,

or statutes  under which  the  appeal is  taken.  A  copy  of the notice of appeal shall be served on all parties to the proceed-
ing as required by Rule 29, and proof of service shall be filed in the district court together with the notice of appeal. 

2.  All  parties  to  the  proceeding  in  the  district  court  are deemed  parties  entitled  to  file  documents  in  this  Court,  but 
a party having no interest in the outcome of the appeal may so  notify  the  Clerk  of  this  Court  and  shall  serve  a  copy  of 
the  notice  on  all  other  parties.  Parties  interested  jointly, 
severally,  or  otherwise  in  the  judgment  may  appeal  sepa-rately,  or  any  two  or  more  may  join  in  an  appeal.  When 

two or more judgments involving identical or closely related questions are sought to be reviewed on appeal from the same 
court, a notice of appeal for each judgment shall be filed with the  clerk  of  the  district  court,  but  a  single  jurisdictional 
statement covering all the judgments suffices.  Parties who file  no  document  will  not  qualify  for  any  relief  from  this 
Court. 3.  No  more  than  60  days  after  filing  the  notice  of  appeal 
in  the  district  court,  the  appellant  shall  file  40  copies  of  a jurisdictional statement and shall pay the Rule 38 docket fee,

period not exceeding 60 days.  An application to extend the time  to file  a  jurisdictional statement  shall  set  out  the  basis 
for  jurisdiction  in  this  Court;  identify  the  judgment  sought to  be  reviewed;  include  a  copy  of  the  opinion,  any  order  re-
specting rehearing, and the notice of appeal; and set out spe-cific  reasons  why  an  extension  of  time  is  justified.  For  the 
time and manner of presenting the application, see Rules 21, 
22, and 30.  An application to extend the time to file a juris-dictional statement is not favored.

appellee's  motion,  with  notice  to  all  parties,  and  may  make any  just  order  with  respect  to  costs.  If  the  district  court 
has  denied  the  appellee's  motion  to  dismiss  the  appeal,  the appellee  may move this Court to docket and dismiss the ap-
peal by filing an original and 10 copies of a motion presented in  conformity  with  Rules  21  and  33.2.  The  motion  shall  be 
accompanied by proof of service as required by Rule 29, and 
by a certificate from the clerk of the district court, certifying that  a  notice  of  appeal  was  filed  and  that  the  appellee's  mo-

tion to dismiss was denied.  The appellant may not thereaf-ter file a jurisdictional statement without special leave of the 
Court, and  the  Court may allow costs  against  the appellant. 6.  Within  30  days  after  the  case  is  placed  on  this  Court's 
docket,  the  appellee  may  file  a  motion  to  dismiss,  to  affirm, or  in  the  alternative  to  affirm  or  dismiss.  Forty  copies  of

which shall comply fully with Rule 15.  If a party named as a  respondent  does  not  wish  to  respond  to  the  petition,  that 
party may so advise the Clerk and all other parties by letter. 
All persons  served are  deemed respondents  for all purposes in the proceedings in this Court. 

4.  (a)  A  petition  seeking  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2242, 
and in particular  with the provision in  the last paragraph of $ 2242,  which  requires  a  statement  of  the  "reasons  for  not 
making  application  to  the  district  court  of  the  district  in which the applicant is held."  If the relief sought is from the 
judgment  of  a  state  court,  the  petition  shall  set  out  specifi-cally  how  and  where  the  petitioner  has  exhausted  available 
remedies  in  the  state  courts  or  otherwise  comes  within the  provisions of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b).  To  justify the grant-
ing  of  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus,  the  petitioner  must  show 
that  exceptional  circumstances  warrant  the  exercise  of  the Court's discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot 

be obtained in any other form or from any other court.  This writ is rarely granted.

served.  Deferral of the joint appendix is not favored. (b)  If the deferred method is used, the briefs on the merits 
may  refer  to  the  pages  of  the  record.  In  that  event,  the joint appendix shall include in brackets on each page thereof 
the  page  number  of  the  record  where  that  material  may  be

as  required  by  Rule  33.2  within  the  time  provided  by  Rule 25,  with  appropriate  references  to  the  pages  of  the  record. 
In that event, within 10 days after the joint appendix is filed, copies of the brief prepared as required by Rule 33.1 contain-
ing references to the pages of the joint appendix in place of, or  in  addition  to,  the  initial  references  to  the  pages  of  the

tents showing the parts of the record that it contains, in the 
order  in  which  the  parts  are  set  out,  with  references  to  the 
pages of the joint appendix at which each part begins.  The 
relevant  docket  entries  shall  be  set  out  after  the  table  of 
contents, followed by the other parts of the record in chrono-
logical  order.  When  testimony  contained  in  the  reporter's 
transcript of proceedings is set out in the joint appendix, the 
page  of  the  transcript  at  which  the  testimony  appears  shall

that  is  set  out.  Omissions  in  the  transcript  or  in  any  other

4.  (a)  If  the  United  States  or  any  federal  department,  of-fice, agency, officer, or employee is a party to be served, serv-
ice  shall  be  made  on  the  Solicitor  General  of  the  United States, Room 5614, Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania 
Ave.,  N. W., Washington, DC  20530-0001.  When an agency of  the  United  States  that  is  a  party  is  authorized  by  law  to 
appear before this Court on its own behalf, or when an officer or employee of the United States is a party, the agency, offi-
cer,  or  employee  shall  be  served  in  addition  to  the  Solicitor General. 

(b)  In any proceeding in this  Court in which the constitu-tionality  of  an  Act  of  Congress  is  drawn  into  question,  and 
neither the United States nor any federal department, office, 
agency,  officer,  or  employee  is  a  party,  the  initial  document filed  in  this  Court  shall  recite  that  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(a)  may 

apply  and  shall  be  served  on  the  Solicitor  General  of  the United States, Room 5614, Department of Justice, 950 Penn-
sylvania  Ave.,  N.  W.,  Washington,  DC  20530-0001.  In  such a  proceeding  from  any  court  of  the  United  States,  as  de-
fined  by  28  U. S. C.  $ 451,  the  initial  document  also  shall state  whether  that  court,  pursuant  to  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(a), 
certified  to  the  Attorney  General  the  fact  that  the  constitu-
tionality  of  an  Act  of  Congress  was  drawn  into  question. See Rule 14.1(e)(v). 

(c)  In  any  proceeding  in  this Court  in  which  the  constitu-
tionality of any statute of a State is drawn into question, and 
neither the State nor any agency, officer, or employee thereof 

551US2RULE 08-15-11 12:58:45 PGT * USRULES
1236  RULES  OF  THE  SUPREME  COURT 
is a party, the initial document filed in this Court shall recite 
that  28  U. S. C.  $ 2403(b)  may  apply  and  shall  be  served  on 
the  Attorney  General  of  that  State.  In  such  a  proceeding 
from any court of the United States, as defined by 28 U. S. C. 

$ 451,  the  initial  document  also  shall  state  whether  that 
court, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b), certified to the State 
Attorney  General  the  fact  that  the  constitutionality  of  a 
statute  of  that  State  was  drawn  into  question.  See  Rule 
14.1(e)(v). 

5.  Proof  of  service,  when  required  by  these  Rules,  shall 
accompany  the  document  when  it  is  presented  to  the  Clerk 
for  filing  and  shall  be  separate  from  it.  Proof  of  service 
shall contain, or be accompanied by, a statement that all par-
ties  required  to  be  served  have  been  served,  together  with 
a  list  of  the  names,  addresses,  and  telephone  numbers  of 
counsel  indicating  the  name  of  the  party  or  parties  each 
counsel represents.  It is not necessary that service on each 
party required to be served be made in the same manner or 
evidenced  by  the  same  proof.  Proof  of  service  may  consist 
of any one of the following: 

(a)  an  acknowledgment  of  service,  signed  by  counsel  of 
record  for  the  party  served,  and  bearing  the  address  and 
telephone number of such counsel; 

(b)  a  certificate  of  service,  reciting  the  facts  and  circum-
stances  of  service  in  compliance  with  the  appropriate  para-
graph  or  paragraphs  of  this  Rule,  and  signed  by  a  member 
of  the  Bar  of  this  Court  representing  the  party  on  whose 
behalf service is made or by an attorney appointed to repre-
sent that party under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, see 18 
U. S. C.  $ 3006A(d)(6),  or  under  any  other  applicable  federal 
statute; or 

(c)  a  notarized  affidavit  or  declaration  in  compliance  with 
28  U. S. C.  $ 1746,  reciting  the  facts  and  circumstances  of 
service  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  paragraph  or 
paragraphs  of  this  Rule,  whenever  service  is  made  by  any 
person  not  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  this  Court  and  not  an 
attorney appointed  to represent a  party under the  Criminal

served  on  all  other  parties  as  provided  by  Rule  22.  Once denied, such an application may not be renewed. 

4.  An  application  to  extend  the  time  to  file  any  document or  paper  other  than  those  specified  in  paragraph  3  of  this 
Rule  may  be  presented  in  the  form  of  a  letter  to  the  Clerk setting out specific reasons why an extension of time is justi-
fied.  The  letter  shall  be  served  on  all  other  parties  as  re-quired by Rule 29.  The application may be acted on by the 
Clerk  in  the  first  instance,  and  any  party  aggrieved  by  the Clerk's action may request that the application be submitted 
to  a  Justice  or  to  the  Court.  The  Clerk  will  report  action under this paragraph to the Court as instructed.

(d)  Every booklet-format document, shall comply with the word limits  shown  on the  chart in  subparagraph  1(g) of this 
Rule.  The  word  limits  do  not  include  the  questions  pre-sented, the list of parties and the corporate disclosure state-
ment, the table of contents, the table of cited authorities, the 
listing  of  counsel  at  the  end  of  the  document,  or  any  appen-

tions  required  under  Rule  14.1(f ),  if  set  out  in  the  text  of  a 
brief  rather  than  in  the  appendix,  are  also  excluded.  For 
good  cause,  the  Court  or  a  Justice  may  grant  leave  to  file  a 
document  in  excess  of  the  word  limits,  but  application  for 
such  leave  is  not  favored.  An  application  to  exceed  word 
limits shall comply with Rule 22 and must be received by the 
Clerk at least 15 days before the filing date of the document 
in question, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. 

(e)  Every  booklet-format  document,  shall  have  a  suitable 
cover  consisting  of  65-pound  weight  paper  in  the  color  indi-
cated  on  the  chart  in  subparagraph  1(g)  of  this  Rule.  If  a 
separate  appendix  to  any  document  is  filed,  the  color  of  its 
cover shall be the same as that of the cover of the document 
it  supports.  The  Clerk  will  furnish  a  color  chart  upon  re-
quest.  Counsel shall ensure that there is adequate contrast 
between  the  printing  and  the  color  of  the  cover.  A  docu-
ment  filed  by  the  United  States,  or  by  any  other  federal 
party represented by the Solicitor General, shall have a gray 
cover.  A  joint  appendix,  answer  to  a  bill  of  complaint,  mo-
tion for leave to intervene, and any other document not listed 
in subparagraph 1(g) of this Rule shall have a tan cover. 

(f)  Forty copies of a booklet-format document shall be filed.

2.  (a)  A  petitioner  or  appellant  may  file  a  motion  to  dis-miss  the  case,  with  proof  of  service  as  required  by  Rule  29, 
tendering  to  the  Clerk  any  fees  due  and  costs  payable.  No more  than  15  days  after  service  thereof,  an  adverse  party 
may file  an  objection,  limited to the  amount  of damages and costs  in  this Court  alleged  to  be  payable or  to  showing  that 
the moving party does not represent all petitioners or appel-lants.  The  Clerk  will  not  file  any  objection  not  so  limited. 

(b)  When the objection asserts that the moving party does not  represent  all  the  petitioners  or  appellants,  the  party 
moving  for  dismissal  may  file  a  reply  within  10  days,  after which  time  the  matter  will  be  submitted  to  the  Court  for 
its determination. (c)  If no objection is filed--or if upon objection going only 
to the amount of damages and costs in this Court, the party moving  for  dismissal  tenders  the  additional  damages  and 
costs  in  full  within  10  days  of  the  demand  therefor--the Clerk,  without  further  reference  to  the  Court,  will  enter  an 
order  of  dismissal.  If,  after  objection  as  to  the  amount  of damages and costs in  this  Court,  the  moving party does  not 
respond  by  a  tender  within  10  days,  the  Clerk  will  report the matter to the Court for its determination. 

3.  No  mandate  or  other  process  will  issue  on  a  dismissal under this Rule without an order of the Court.
