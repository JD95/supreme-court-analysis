CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1992

UNITED STATES v. IDAHO ex rel. DIRECTOR,IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

certiorari to the supreme court of idaho
No. 92-190. Argued March 29, 1993--Decided May 3, 1993
The McCarran Amendment allows a State to join the United States as a

defendant in a comprehensive water right adjudication. It also provides, however, that "no judgment for costs shall be entered against the
United States in any such suit." Idaho legislation enacted in 1985 and
1986 provided for a state-court adjudication "within the terms of the
McCarran [A]mendment" of all water rights in the Snake River Basin.
The legislation also altered the State's methods for financing such adjudications by requiring all water right claimants to pay a filing fee.
Idaho uses these funds to pay the administrative and judicial expenses
attributable to water right adjudications. After filing a petition under
the 1985 and 1986 legislation naming the United States and all other
Snake River water users as defendants, the State refused to accept the
Federal Government's notices of claims because they were not submitted with the required filing fees. The United States estimates that in
its case the fees could exceed $10 million. The United States then filed
a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the State to accept its
notices without fees, asserting that the McCarran Amendment does not
waive federal sovereign immunity from payment of such fees. The
State District Court granted Idaho summary judgment on this issue,
and the State Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: The McCarran Amendment does not waive the United States' sovereign immunity from fees of the kind sought by Idaho. While "fees"
and "costs" generally mean two different things in the context of lawsuits, the line is blurred, indeed, in the context of this proceeding.

2 UNITED STATES v. IDAHO ex rel. DIRECTOR,

IDAHO DEPT. OF WATER RESOURCES

Syllabus

Whereas Idaho courts used to proportionately tax the "costs" against
all parties to a water right adjudication at the time final judgment was
entered, many of the items formerly taxed as "costs" are now denominated as "fees," and required to be paid into court at the outset. Moreover, although the amendment's language making "the State laws" applicable to the United States submits the Government generally to state
procedural law, as well as to state substantive law of water rights, it
does not subject the United States to payment of the fees in question.
This Court has been particularly alert to require a specific waiver of
sovereign immunity before the United States may be held liable for
monetary exactions in litigation. See, e. g., United States v. Chemical
Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 20-21. The amendment's language is not
sufficiently specific to meet this requirement. Pp. 5-9.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The McCarran Amendment allows a State to join theUnited States as a defendant in a comprehensive water right
adjudication. 66 Stat. 560, 43 U. S. C. $ 666(a). This casearises from Idaho's joinder of the United States in a suit for
the adjudication of water rights in the Snake River. UnderIdaho Code $ 42-1414 (1990), all water right claimants, including the United States, must pay "filing fees" when theysubmit their notices of claims. Idaho collects these fees to
"financ[e] the costs of adjudicating water rights," $ 42-1414;
the United States estimates that in its case the fees couldexceed $10 million. We hold that the McCarran Amendment

does not waive the United States' sovereign immunity from
fees of this kind.Discovered by the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Snake

River--the "Mississippi of Idaho"--is 1,038 miles long andthe principal tributary to the Columbia River. It rises in
the mountains of the Continental Divide in northwest Wyo-ming and enters eastern Idaho through the Palisades Reservoir. Near Heise, Idaho, the river leaves the mountains andmeanders westerly across southern Idaho's Snake River
plain for the entire breadth of the State--some 400 miles.
On the western edge of Idaho, near Weiser, the Snake entersOregon for a while and then turns northward, forming the

Oregon-Idaho boundary for 216 miles. In this stretch, theriver traverses Hells Canyon, the Nation's deepest river
gorge. From the northeastern corner of Oregon, the rivermarks the Washington-Idaho boundary until Lewiston,
Idaho, where it bends westward into Washington and finallyflows into the Columbia just south of Pasco, Washington.
From elevations of 10,000 feet, the Snake descends to 3,000
feet and, together with its many tributaries, provides theonly water for most of Idaho. See generally T. Palmer, The

Snake River (1991).

4 UNITED STATES v. IDAHO ex rel. DIRECTOR,

IDAHO DEPT. OF WATER RESOURCES

Opinion of the Court

This litigation followed the enactment by the Idaho Legis-lature in 1985 and 1986 of legislation providing for the Snake

River Basin Adjudication. That legislation stated that "thedirector of the department of water resources shall petition
the [state] district court to commence an adjudication within
the terms of the McCarran [A]mendment." Idaho Code$ 42-1406A(1) (1990). The 1985 and 1986 legislation also altered Idaho's methods for "financing the costs of adjudicatingwater rights"; it provided that the Director of the Idaho Department of Water Resources shall not accept a "notice ofclaim" from any water claimant unless such notice "is submitted with a filing fee based upon the fee schedule." $ 42-
1414. "Failure to pay the variable water use fee in accordance with the timetable provided shall be cause for the
department to reject and return the notice of claim to the
claimant." Ibid. Idaho uses these funds "to pay the costs
of the department attributable to general water rights adjudications" and "to pay for judicial expenses directly relating
to the Snake river adjudication." $$ 42-1777(1) and (2).

The Director of the Idaho Department of Water Resources
filed a petition in the District Court of the Fifth Judicial
District naming the United States and all other water users
as defendants. The District Court entered an order commencing the adjudication, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Idaho. In re Snake River Basin Water System, 115 Idaho 1, 764 P. 2d 78 (1988), cert. denied sub nom.
Boise-Kuna Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 490 U. S. 1005
(1989). When the United States attempted to submit its notices of claims unaccompanied by filing fees, the director refused to accept them. The United States then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the state court to compel
the director to accept its notices without fees, asserting that
the McCarran Amendment does not waive federal sovereign
immunity from payment of filing fees. The District Court
granted Idaho summary judgment on the immunity issue:
"The ordinary, contemporary and common meaning of the

Opinion of the Court
language of McCarran is that Congress waived all rightsto assert any facet of sovereign immunity in a general adjudication of all water rights . . . which is being conductedin accordance with state law." App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a
(emphasis in original).The Supreme Court of Idaho affirmed by a divided vote.
122 Idaho 116, 832 P. 2d 289 (1992). It concluded that theMcCarran Amendment "express[es] a `clear intent' of congress to subject the United States to all of the state courtprocesses of an `adjudication' of its water rights with the sole
exception of costs." Id., at 121, 832 P. 2d, at 294. The courtalso "decline[d] to read the term judgment for costs as including the term filing fees." Id., at 122, 832 P. 2d, at 295.Whereas "costs" are charges that a prevailing party may recover from its opponent as part of the judgment, "fees arecompensation paid to an officer, such as the court, for services rendered to individuals in the course of litigation."Ibid. Two justices wrote separate dissents, asserting that
the McCarran Amendment does not waive sovereign immu-nity from filing fees. We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 939
(1992), and now reverse.The McCarran Amendment provides in relevant part:

"Consent is given to join the United States as a de-fendant in any suit (1) for the adjudication of rights to
the use of water of a river system or other source, or (2)for the administration of such rights, where it appears
that the United States is the owner of or is in the proc-ess of acquiring water rights by appropriation under
State law, by purchase, by exchange, or otherwise, andthe United States is a necessary party to such suit. The
United States, when a party to any such suit, shall (1)be deemed to have waived any right to plead that the
State laws are inapplicable or that the United States isnot amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and
(2) shall be subject to the judgments, orders, and de-crees of the court having jurisdiction, and may obtain

review thereof, in the same manner and to the same ex-tent as a private individual under like circumstances:

Provided, That no judgment for costs shall be enteredagainst the United States in any such suit." 43
U. S. C. $ 666(a).
According to Idaho, the amendment requires the UnitedStates to comply with

all state laws applicable to generalwater right adjudications. Idaho argues that the first sentence of the amendment, the joinder provision, allows joinderof the United States as a defendant in suits for the adjudication of water rights. It then construes the amendment'ssecond sentence, the pleading provision, to waive the United
States' immunity from all state laws pursuant to which thoseadjudications are conducted. Idaho relies heavily on the
language of the second sentence stating that the UnitedStates shall be "deemed to have waived any right to plead
that the State laws are inapplicable." Because the "filingfees" at issue here are assessed in connection with a comprehensive adjudication of water rights, Idaho contends thatthey fall within the McCarran Amendment's waiver of sovereign immunity.The United States, on the other hand, contends that the
critical language of the second sentence renders it amenableonly to state substantive law of water rights, and not to any
of the state adjective law governing procedure, fees, and thelike. The Government supports its position by arguing that
the phrase "the State laws" in the second sentence must bereferring to the same "State law" mentioned in the first sentence, and that since the phrase in the first sentence isclearly directed to substantive state water law, the phrase in
the second sentence must be so directed as well.There is no doubt that waivers of federal sovereign immunity must be "unequivocally expressed" in the statutory text.See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89,
95 (1990); Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 615(1992); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,

33-34 (1992). "Any such waiver must be strictly construedin favor of the United States,"

Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S.
129, 137 (1991), and not enlarged beyond what the languageof the statute requires,

Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S.
680, 685-686 (1983). But just as " `we should not take it
upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which Con-gress intended[,] . . . [n]either, however, should we assume

the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress in-tended.' "

Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197, 206 (1993)
(quoting United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117-118(1979)).

We are unable to accept either party's contention. The
argument of the United States is weak, simply as a matter
of grammar, because the critical term in the second sentence
is "the State laws," while the corresponding language in the
first sentence is "State law." And such a construction would
render the amendment's consent to suit largely nugatory,
allowing the Government to argue for some special federal
rule defeating established state-law rules governing pleading, discovery, and the admissibility of evidence at trial. We
do not believe that Congress intended to create such a legal
no-man's land in enacting the McCarran Amendment. We
rejected a similarly technical argument of the Government
in construing the McCarran Amendment in United States v.
District Court, County of Eagle, 401 U. S. 520, 525 (1971),
saying "[w]e think that argument is extremely technical;
and we decline to confine [the McCarran Amendment] so
narrowly."

We also reject Idaho's contention. In several of our cases
exemplifying the rule of strict construction of a waiver of
sovereign immunity, we rejected efforts to assess monetary
liability against the United States for what are normal incidents of litigation between private parties. See, e. g.,
United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1,
20-21 (1926) (assessment of costs); Library of Congress v.
Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 323 (1986) (recovery of interest on judg508us1$63z 02-13-97 13:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT

ment); Ohio, supra, at 619-620 (liability for punitive fines).And the McCarran Amendment's "cost proviso," of course,

expressly forbids the assessment of costs against the UnitedStates: "[N]o judgment for costs shall be entered against the
United States."

The Supreme Court of Idaho pointed out in its opinion that"fees" and "costs" mean two different things in the context

of lawsuits, 122 Idaho, at 122, 832 P. 2d, at 295, and we agreewith this observation. "Fees" are generally those amounts
paid to a public official, such as the clerk of the court, by aparty for particular charges typically delineated by statute;
in contrast, "costs" are those items of expense incurred in
litigation that a prevailing party is allowed by rule to tax
against the losing party. See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2666, pp. 173-174
(1983). Before Idaho altered its system for recovering its
expenses in conducting comprehensive water right adjudications in 1985 and 1986, Idaho courts, at the time of entry of
final judgment, used to proportionately tax the "costs" of the
adjudication against all parties to the suit, and not simply
against the losing parties. Idaho Code $ 42-1401 (1948).
When Idaho revised this system, many of the items formerly
taxed as "costs" to the parties at the conclusion of the adjudication were denominated as "fees," and required to be paid
into court at the outset. This suggests that although the
general distinction between fees and costs may be accurate,
in the context of this proceeding the line is blurred, indeed.

While we therefore accept the proposition that the critical
language of the second sentence of the McCarran Amendment submits the United States generally to state adjective
law, as well as to state substantive law of water rights, we
do not believe it subjects the United States to the payment
of the sort of fees that Idaho sought to exact here. The
cases mentioned above dealing with waivers of sovereign immunity as to monetary exactions from the United States in
litigation show that we have been particularly alert to re508us1$63z 02-13-97 13:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
quire a specific waiver of sovereign immunity before theUnited States may be held liable for them. We hold that

the language of the second sentence making "the Statelaws" applicable to the United States in comprehensive
water right adjudications is not sufficiently specific to meetthis requirement.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Idaho is thereforereversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
As the Court points out, ante, at 8, before 1985 "fees" com-parable to those at issue in this litigation were taxed

as "costs" in Idaho. Because I am persuaded that theseexactions are precisely what Congress had in mind when
it excepted judgments for "costs" from its broad waiver ofsovereign immunity from participation in water rights adjudications, I concur in the Court's judgment.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-551. Argued March 30, 1993--Decided May 3, 1993
The so-called Section 8 housing program under the United States Housing

Act of 1937 (Housing Act) authorizes private landlords who rent to lowincome tenants to receive "assistance payments" from the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an amount calculated to
make up the difference between the tenants' rent payments and a "contract rent" agreed upon by the landlords and HUD. Section 1.9b of the
latter parties' "assistance contracts" provides that contract rents are to
be adjusted annually by applying the latest automatic adjustment factors developed by HUD on the basis of particular formulas, while $ 1.9d
specifies that, "[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract,
adjustments as provided in this Section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by the Government . . . ." In the early
1980's, HUD began to conduct independent "comparability studies" in
certain real estate markets where it believed that contract rents, adjusted upward by the automatic adjustment factors, were materially
higher than prevailing market rates for comparable housing, and to use
the private market rents as an independent cap limiting assistance payments. In this litigation, respondent Section 8 landlords allege that

$ 801 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (Reform Act)--which, inter alia, authorizes HUD to limit
future automatic rent adjustments through the use of comparability
studies--violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by
stripping them of their vested rights under the assistance contracts to
annual rent increases based on the automatic adjustment factors alone.
In separate lawsuits, the District Courts each granted summary judgment for respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments
in a consolidated appeal.

Held: This Court need not consider whether $ 801 of the Reform Act unconstitutionally abrogated a contract right to unobstructed formulabased rent adjustments, since respondents have no such right. The assistance contracts do not prohibit the use of comparability studies to
impose an independent cap on such adjustments. Indeed, $ 1.9d's plain

language clearly mandates that contract rents "shall not" be adjusted
so as to exceed materially the rents charged for "comparable unassisted
units" on the private rental market, "[n]otwithstanding" that $ 1.9b
might seem to require such a result. This limitation is consistent with
the Housing Act itself, 42 U. S. C. $ 1437f(c)(2)(C). Moreover, it is clear
that $ 1.9d--which by its own terms clearly envisions some comparison
of assisted and unassisted rents--affords HUD sufficient discretion to
design and implement comparability studies as a reasonable means of
effectuating its mandate, since the section expressly assigns to "the
Government" the determination of whether material rent differences
exist. Respondents' contention that HUD's comparability studies have
been poorly conceived and executed, resulting in faulty and misleading
comparisons, is irrelevant to the question whether HUD had contractual
authority to employ such studies at all. If respondents have been denied formula-based rent increases based on shoddy comparisons, their
remedy is to challenge the particular study, not to deny HUD's authority
to make comparisons. Pp. 17-21.

12 CISNEROS v. ALPINE RIDGE GROUP

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether $ 801 of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act

of 1989, 103 Stat. 2057, violates the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment by abrogating respondents' contract
rights to certain rental subsidies.

I
A

In 1974, Congress amended the United States Housing Actof 1937 (Housing Act) to create what is known as the Section

8 housing program. Through the Section 8 program, Con-gress hoped to "ai[d] low-income families in obtaining a
decent place to live," 42 U. S. C. $ 1437f(a) (1988 ed., Supp.III), by subsidizing private landlords who would rent to lowincome tenants. Under the program, tenants make rentalpayments based on their income and ability to pay; the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) thenmakes "assistance payments" to the private landlords in an
amount calculated to make up the difference between thetenant's contribution and a "contract rent" agreed upon by
the landlord and HUD. As required by the statute, thiscontract rent is, in turn, to be based upon "the fair market
rental" value of the dwelling, allowing for some modestincrease over market rates to account for the additional
expense of participating in the Section 8 program. See$ 1437f(c)(1).

The statute, as originally enacted, further provided thatmonthly rents for Section 8 housing would be adjusted at
least annually as follows:

"(A) The assistance contract shall provide for adjust-ment annually or more frequently in the maximum

monthly rents for units covered by the contract to re-flect changes in the fair market rentals established in
the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling

Opinion of the Court
units or, if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a
reasonable formula.. . . . .

"(C) Adjustments in the maximum rents as hereinbefore provided shall not result in material differences
between the rents charged for assisted and comparable
unassisted units, as determined by the Secretary." 42
U. S. C. $$ 1437f(c)(2)(A) and (C) (1982 ed.).

The respondents in this case are private developers who
entered into long-term contracts with HUD--known as
Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contracts or "assistance contracts"--to lease newly constructed apartment units
to Section 8 tenants. Their contracts established initial contract rents for each unit and provided, consistent with the
statutory authorization, that these rents would be adjusted
regularly, on the basis of a reasonable formula, to keep pace
with changes in rental values in the private housing market.
Section 1.9b of their contracts provides:

"b. Automatic Annual Adjustments

"(1) Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors will be
determined by the Government at least annually; interim revisions may be made as market conditions
warrant. Such Factors and the basis for their determination will be published in the Federal Register. . . .

"(2) On each anniversary date of the Contract, the
Contract Rents shall be adjusted by applying the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor most recently published by the Government. Contract Rents
may be adjusted upward or downward, as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted Contract
Rents be less than the Contract Rents on the effective
date of the Contract." App. to Brief for Petitioners 8a.

The Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors to which the
contracts refer are developed by HUD based upon market

trends recorded by the Consumer Price Index and the Bu-reau of the Census American Housing Surveys.

Section 1.9d of the contracts, in part tracking the languageof $ 8(c)(2)(C) of the Housing Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1437f(c)(2)(C)
(1988 ed., Supp. III), provides:

"d. Overall Limitation. Notwithstanding any otherprovisions of this Contract, adjustments as provided

in this Section shall not result in material differencesbetween the rents charged for assisted and comparable
unassisted units, as determined by the Government;provided that this limitation shall not be construed to
prohibit differences in rents between assisted and com-parable unassisted units to the extent that such differences may have existed with respect to the initial Con-tract Rents." App. to Brief for Petitioners 8a-9a.

In the early 1980's, HUD began to suspect that the assist-ance payments it was making to some landlords under the

Section 8 program were well above prevailing market ratesfor comparable housing. Accordingly, the agency began to
conduct independent "comparability studies" in certain realestate markets where it believed that contract rents, adjusted upward by the automatic adjustment factors, werematerially out of line with market rents. Under these studies, HUD personnel would select between three and fiveother apartment buildings they considered comparable to the
Section 8 building and compare their rents. The privatemarket rents would then serve as an independent cap limiting the rent payments HUD would make under the Section8 contracts.

After several landlords brought suit, the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit ruled in 1988 that the standard assistance contracts described above prohibited the use of compa-rability studies as an independent cap on rents. In

RainierView Associates v. United States, 848 F. 2d 988, the Court of

Opinion of the Court
Appeals reasoned that HUD, having contracted to increaserents automatically each year based upon a reasonable formula (the second of the two alternative approaches permit-ted by $ 8(c)(2)(A) of the Housing Act, see

supra, at 12-13),
could not thereafter limit those increases by means of a
market survey (the first of the two statutory alternatives)."Having made its choice," the court wrote, "HUD cannot

now change its mind." 848 F. 2d, at 991.After this Court denied certiorari to review the

Rainier
View decision, 490 U. S. 1066 (1989), HUD made clear its in-tention not to adhere to that decision's interpretation of its

contracts outside the Ninth Circuit. Faced with the pros-pect of inconsistent application of Government contracts depending solely upon geography, Congress attempted to resolve the matter through amendments to the Housing Act inlate 1989. Section 801 of the Department of Housing and

Urban Development Reform Act (Reform Act), 103 Stat.
2057, amended $ 8(c)(2)(C) of the Housing Act to provide explicitly that HUD may limit automatic rent adjustments in
the future through the use of independent comparability
studies. In an apparent compromise, however, the same
section also sought to restore to Section 8 project owners a
portion of the automatic rent adjustments they had been denied through the use of comparability studies prior to the
enactment of the 1989 amendments. The amendments thus
offered Section 8 project owners a partial retroactive remedy for lost rent attributable to comparability studies while
at the same time affirming HUD's authorization to employ
such studies to cap future rent adjustments.1

1 Section 8(c)(2)(C) of the Housing Act, as amended by $ 801 of the Reform Act, now provides: "(C) Adjustments in the maximum rents under
subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not result in material differences between
the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality,
type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary.
In implementing the limitation established under the preceding sentence,
the Secretary shall establish regulations for conducting comparability

Opinion of the Court

C
In this litigation, respondents have alleged that $ 801 ofthe Reform Act violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth

Amendment by stripping them of their vested rights under
studies for projects where the Secretary has reason to believe that the
application of the formula adjustments under subparagraph (A) would result in such material differences. The Secretary shall conduct such studies upon the request of any owner of any project, or as the Secretary
determines to be appropriate by establishing, to the extent practicable, a
modified annual adjustment factor for such market area, as the Secretary
shall designate, that is geographically smaller than the applicable housing
area used for the establishment of the annual adjustment factor under
subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall establish such modified annual
adjustment factor on the basis of the results of a study conducted by the
Secretary of the rents charged, and any change in such rents over the
previous year, for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality,
type, and age in the smaller market area. Where the Secretary determines that such modified annual adjustment factor cannot be established
or that such factor when applied to a particular project would result in
material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area,
the Secretary may apply an alternative methodology for conducting comparability studies in order to establish rents that are not materially different from rents charged for comparable unassisted units. If the Secretary
or appropriate State agency does not complete and submit to the project
owner a comparability study not later than 60 days before the anniversary
date of the assistance contract under this section, the automatic annual
adjustment factor shall be applied. The Secretary may not reduce the
contract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, for newly constructed,
substantially rehabilitated, or moderately rehabilitated projects assisted
under this section (including projects assisted under this section as in
effect prior to November 30, 1983), unless the project has been refinanced
in a manner that reduces the periodic payments of the owner. Any maximum monthly rent that has been reduced by the Secretary after April 14,
1987, and prior to November 7, 1988, shall be restored to the maximum
monthly rent in effect on April 15, 1987. For any project which has had
its maximum monthly rents reduced after April 14, 1987, the Secretary
shall make assistance payments (from amounts reserved for the original
contract) to the owner of such project in an amount equal to the difference
between the maximum monthly rents in effect on April 15, 1987, and the
reduced maximum monthly rents, multiplied by the number of months

Opinion of the Court
the assistance contracts to annual rent increases based onthe automatic adjustment factors alone. In separate lawsuits, the United States District Courts for the Western Dis-trict of Washington and the Central District of California
each granted summary judgment for respondents. TheCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a consolidated
appeal, affirmed both judgments. Alpine Ridge Group v.
Kemp, 955 F. 2d 1382 (1992). Refusing to reconsider its ear-lier holding in Rainier View, supra, the court first reaffirmed

that the assistance contracts prohibited HUD from cappingrents based on independent comparability studies. See 955
F. 2d, at 1384-1385. The court then held that Congress' at-tempt to authorize such caps through the Reform Act unconstitutionally deprived respondents of their "vested propertyinterest in formula-based rent adjustments pursuant to their
section 8 contracts." Id., at 1387.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 984 (1992), and now
reverse. II

We begin our analysis of respondents' due process claimwith the assistance contracts. Because we find that those
contracts do not prohibit the use of comparability studies toimpose an independent cap on the formula-based rent adjustments, our analysis ends there as well.In our view, respondents' claimed entitlement to formulabased rent adjustments without regard to independent com-parisons to private-market rents is precluded by the plain
language of the assistance contracts. To be sure, $ 1.9b(2)of those contracts provides that the contract rents "shall be
adjusted [annually] by applying the applicable AutomaticAnnual Adjustment Factor most recently published by the
Government." Section 1.9d of the contracts, however, imthat the reduced maximum monthly rents were in effect." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1437f(c)(2)(C) (1988 ed., Supp. III). HUD has now published proposed
regulations governing the future use of comparability studies, as required
by this provision. See 57 Fed. Reg. 49120 (1992).

poses what is labeled an "[o]verall [l]imitation" on theformula-based adjustments provided by $ 1.9b. It provides

that "[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract, adjustments as provided in this Section shall not result
in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by theGovernment" (emphasis added). As we have noted previously in construing statutes, the use of such a "notwith-standing" clause clearly signals the drafter's intention that
the provisions of the "notwithstanding" section override con-flicting provisions of any other section. See

Shomberg v.
United States, 348 U. S. 540, 547-548 (1955). Likewise, the
Courts of Appeals generally have "interpreted similar `notwithstanding' language . . . to supersede all other laws, stating that ` "[a] clearer statement is difficult to imagine." ' "

peradventure that $ 1.9d provides that contract rents "shall
not" be adjusted so as to exceed materially the rents charged
for "comparable unassisted units" on the private rental market--even if other provisions of the contracts might seem to

Opinion of the Court
require such a result. This limitation is plainly consistentwith the Housing Act itself, which provides that "[a]djustments in the maximum rents," whether based on marketsurveys or on a reasonable formula, "shall not result in material differences" between Section 8 rents and the rents
for comparable housing on the private market. 42 U. S. C.$ 1437f(c)(2)(C) (1988 ed., Supp. III).

In its Rainier View decision, the Court of Appeals read$ 1.9d's "overall limitation" as empowering HUD only to
make prospective changes in the automatic adjustment fac-tors where it discovered that those factors were producing
materially inflated rents; under the court's view, $ 1.9d would
not permit "abandonment of the formula method whenever
application of the formula would result in a disparity between section 8 and other rents." 848 F. 2d, at 991. But
this reading of the contract--under which Section 8 project
owners could demand payment of materially inflated rents
until the Secretary could publish revised automatic adjustment factors aimed at curing the overpayment--is almost
precisely backwards. It would entitle project owners to collect the formula-based adjustments promised by $ 1.9b notwithstanding that those adjustments were resulting in the
sort of material differences in rents prohibited by $ 1.9d.

Reading $ 1.9d's "overall limitation" as allowing rent caps
based on comparability studies does not, as the Rainier View
court supposed, "render the formula method authorized by
the statute and elected in the contract a nullity." Ibid.
The rent adjustments indicated by the automatic adjustment
factors remain the presumptive adjustment called for under
the contract. It is only in those presumably exceptional
cases where the Secretary has reason to suspect that the
adjustment factors are resulting in materially inflated rents
that a comparability study would ensue. Because the automatic adjustment factors are themselves geared to reflect
trends in the local or regional housing market, theoretically
it should not be often that the comparability studies would

suggest material differences between Section 8 and private-market rents.

Respondents assert that "the automatic adjustment provi-sion was a central provision of the HAP Contracts and that

the owners would not have signed contracts that expresslycontained the [comparability] provision HUD asks the Court
to imply." Brief for Respondents Acacia Village et al. 22.
They urge us to eschew any interpretation of the contractsthat would allow the displacement of the "automatic" adjustments for which they bargained by a "project-by-projectcomparability process" that "would leave [project owners] at
the mercy of minor HUD officials." Brief for RespondentAlpine Ridge Group 30-31. At bottom, many of respondents' arguments in support of the decision below seem to
circle back to their vigorous contention that HUD's compara-bility studies have been poorly conceived and executed,

resulting in faulty and misleading comparisons. But the integrity with which the agency has carried out its comparability studies is an entirely separate matter from its contractual authority to employ such studies at all. Even if it could
be demonstrated that HUD's studies have been unreliable,
this would in no way suggest that the contract forbids HUD
to cap rents based on accurate and fair comparability studies. If respondents have been denied formula-based rent in2 The Rainier View court also suggested that HUD's own regulations
had interpreted the assistance contracts as barring adjustments to contract rents independent of the published factors. The court quoted 24
CFR $ 888.204 (1987), which states that the agency " `will consider establishing separate or revised Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors for [a]
particular area' " if project owners can demonstrate that application of the
formula would result in Section 8 rents substantially below market rents
for comparable units. See 848 F. 2d, at 991. Although this regulation is
certainly consistent with respondents' view of the contracts, we do not
believe that it is inconsistent with our understanding of the contracts'
plain language: The regulation acknowledges revision of the adjustment
factors as a means of remedying material differences in rents but it does
not foreclose corrective adjustments independent of the factors.

creases based on shoddy comparisons, their remedy is tochallenge the particular study, not to deny HUD's authority

to make comparisons.3In sum, we think that the contract language is plain that
no project owner may claim entitlement to formula-basedrent adjustments that materially exceed market rents for
comparable units. We also think it clear that $ 1.9d--whichby its own terms clearly envisions some comparison "between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unas-sisted units"--affords the Secretary sufficient discretion to
design and implement comparability studies as a reasonablemeans of effectuating its mandate. In this regard, we observe that $ 1.9d expressly assigns to "the Government" thedetermination of whether there exist material differences
between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unas-sisted units. Because we find that respondents have no contract right to unobstructed formula-based rent adjustments,we have no occasion to consider whether $ 801 of the Reform
Act unconstitutionally abrogated such a right.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 92-1. Argued March 1, 1993--Decided May 3, 1993
Under subsection 7(o)(2)(A) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or

Act), a state or local government agency may provide its employees
compensatory time off, or "comp time," instead of the generally mandated overtime pay, so long as, inter alia, it is done pursuant to "(i)
applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or any other
agreement . . . between the . . . agency and representatives of such
employees . . . " or "(ii) in the case of employees not covered by subclause (i), an agreement . . . arrived at between the employer and the
employee before the performance of the work . . . ." Department of
Labor (DOL) regulations provide that, where employees have designated a representative, a comp time agreement must be between that
representative and the agency, 29 CFR $ 553.23(b); according to the Secretary of Labor, the question whether employees have a "representative" is governed by state or local law and practices, 52 Fed. Reg. 2014-
2015. Petitioners are a group of deputy sheriffs in a Texas county who
sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a collective FLSA comp time agreement by way of their designated union representative. Petitioners'
employment terms and conditions are set forth in individual form agreements, which incorporate by reference the county's regulations providing that deputies shall receive comp time for overtime work. Petitioners filed this suit alleging, among other things, that they were "covered"
by subclause (i) of subsection 7(o)(2)(A) by virtue of their union representation, and that the county therefore was precluded from providing
comp time pursuant to individual agreements under subclause (ii). The
District Court disagreed, relying on its conclusion that Texas law prohibits collective bargaining in the public sector, and entered summary
judgment for the county. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Because petitioners are "employees not covered by subclause (i),"

subclause (ii) authorized the individual comp time agreements challenged in this litigation. The phrase "employees . . . covered by subclause (i)" is most sensibly read as referring to employees who have
designated a representative with the authority to negotiate and agree
with their employer on "applicable provisions of a collective bargaining
agreement" authorizing comp time. This reading accords significance

Opinion of the Court
to both the focus on the word "agreement" in subclause (i) and the focus
on "employees" in subclause (ii); is true to subsection 7(o)'s hierarchy,
which favors subclause (i) agreements over individual agreements by
limiting use of the latter to cases in which the former are unavailable;
and is consistent with the DOL regulations, interpreted most reasonably. Although 29 CFR $ 553.23(b), read in isolation, would support
petitioners' view that selection of a representative--even one without
lawful authority to bargain--is sufficient to bring the employees within
subclause (i)'s scope, that interpretation would prohibit entirely the use
of comp time in a substantial portion of the public sector and would be
inconsistent with the Secretary's statement that the "representative"
determination is a local matter. The latter clarification establishes that
when the regulations identify representative selection as the condition
necessary for subclause (i) coverage, they refer only to those representatives with lawful authority to negotiate agreements. In this case,
both lower courts found that Texas law prohibits petitioners' representative from entering into an agreement with their employer. Accordingly, petitioners did not have a representative with such authority.

Opinion of the Court
exception to this rule for state and local governmental agen-cies. Under the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985

(1985 Amendments), public employers may compensate employees who work overtime with extra time off instead of
overtime pay in certain circumstances.2 The question in
this case is whether a public employer in a State that prohibits public sector collective bargaining may take advantage of
that exception when its employees have designated a union
representative.

Because the text of the 1985 Amendments provides the
framework for our entire analysis, we quote the most relevant portion at the outset. Subsection 7(o)(2)(A) states:

2 The relevant portion of the 1985 Amendments, 99 Stat. 790, is codified
at 29 U. S. C. $ 207(o). It provides:
"$ 207. Maximum hours.. . . . .

"(1) Employees of a public agency which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency may receive, in accordance with this subsection and in lieu of overtime compensation, compensatory time off at a rate not less than one and one-half hours for each
hour of employment for which overtime compensation is required by this
section.

"(2) A public agency may provide compensatory time under paragraph
(1) only--

"(A) pursuant to--
"(i) applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any other agreement between the public
agency and representatives of such employees; or

"(ii) in the case of employees not covered by subclause (i), an agreement
or understanding arrived at between the employer and employee before
the performance of the work; and

"(B) if the employee has not accrued compensatory time in excess of
the limit applicable to the employee prescribed by paragraph (3).

"In the case of employees described in clause (A)(ii) hired prior to April
15, 1986, the regular practice in effect on April 15, 1986, with respect to
compensatory time off for such employees in lieu of the receipt of overtime
compensation, shall constitute an agreement or understanding under such
clause (A)(ii). Except as provided in the previous sentence, the provision
of compensatory time off to such employees for hours worked after April
14, 1986, shall be in accordance with this subsection."

"(A) pursuant to--
"(i) applicable provisions of a collective bargaining
agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any other
agreement between the public agency and representatives of such employees; or

Petitioners are a group of employees who sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a collective FLSA compensatory time
agreement by way of a designated representative. The narrow question dispositive here is whether petitioners are "employees not covered by subclause (i)" within the meaning of
subclause (ii), so that their employer may provide compensatory time pursuant to individual agreements under the second subclause.

Congress enacted the FLSA in 1938 to establish nationwide minimum wage and maximum hours standards. Section 7 of the Act encourages compliance with maximum hours
standards by providing that employees generally must be
paid on a time-and-one-half basis for all hours worked in
excess of 40 per week.3

Amendments to the Act in 1966 4 and 1974 5 extended its
coverage to most public employers, and gave rise to a series

compensation of state and local employees.6 Following ourdecision in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), upholding that power, the De-partment of Labor (DOL) announced that it would hold public employers to the standards of the Act effective April 15,1985.

7

In response to the Garcia decision and the DOL announce-ment, both Houses of Congress held hearings and considered

legislation designed to ameliorate the burdens associatedwith necessary changes in public employment practices.
The projected "financial costs of coming into compliance with
the FLSA--particularly the overtime provisions"--werespecifically identified as a matter of grave concern to many

States and localities. S. Rep. No. 99-159, p. 8 (1985). The
statutory provision at issue in this case is the product ofthose deliberations.

In its Report recommending enactment of the 1985Amendments, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources explained that the new subsection 7(o) wouldallow public employers to compensate for overtime hours
with compensatory time off, or "comp time," in lieu of over-time pay, so long as certain conditions were met: The provision of comp time must be at the premium rate of not less
than 11/2 hours per hour of overtime work, and must be pur-suant to an agreement reached prior to performance of the

work. Id., at 10-11. With respect to the nature of the necessary agreement, the issue raised in this case, the Commit-tee stated: "Where employees have a recognized representative, the agreement or understanding must be between that
representative and the employer, either through collective

v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985).

7 See S. Rep. No. 99-159, p. 7 (1985). The Department of Labor also

announced that it would delay enforcement activities until October 15,
1985; that date was later extended to November 1, 1985. Ibid.

bargaining or through a memorandum of understanding orother type of agreement." Id., at 10.

The House Committee on Education and Labor was in sub-stantial agreement with the Senate Committee as to the conditions under which comp time could be made available. SeeH. R. Rep. No. 99-331, p. 20 (1985). On the question of subsection 7(o)'s agreement requirement, the House Committeeexpressed an understanding similar to the Senate Committee's: "Where employees have selected a representative,which need not be a formal or recognized collective bargaining agent as long as it is a representative designated by theemployees, the agreement or understanding must be between the representative and the employer . . . ." Ibid.Where the Senate and House Committee Reports differ is
in their description of the "representative" who, once desig-nated, would require that compensatory time be provided
only pursuant to an agreement between that representativeand the employer. While the Senate Report refers to a
"recognized" representative, the House Report states thatthe representative "need not be a formal or recognized collective bargaining agent." Supra this page. The Confer-ence Report does not comment on this difference, see H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 99-357 (1985), and the 1985 Amendments asfinally enacted do not adopt the precise language of either
Committee Report.The issue is addressed, however, by the Secretary of
Labor, in implementing regulations promulgated pursuant toexpress legislative direction under the 1985 Amendments.

same time, in response to concerns expressed by the State ofMissouri about the impact of the regulation in States where

employee representatives have no authority to enter into en-forceable agreements, the Secretary explained:

"The Department believes that the proposed rule ac-curately reflects the statutory requirement that a CBA
[collective bargaining agreement], memorandum of un-derstanding or other agreement be reached between the
public agency and the representative of the employees
where the employees have designated a representative.
Where the employees do not have a representative, the
agreement must be between the employer and the individual employees. The Department recognizes that
there is a wide variety of State law that may be pertinent in this area. It is the Department's intention that
the question of whether employees have a representative
for purposes of FLSA section 7(o) shall be determined
in accordance with State or local law and practices."
52 Fed. Reg. 2014-2015 (1987) (emphasis added).

Petitioner Moreau is the president of the Harris County
Deputy Sheriffs Union, representing approximately 400 deputy sheriffs in this action against the county and its sheriff,
respondent Klevenhagen. For several years, the union has
represented Harris County deputy sheriffs in various matters, such as processing grievances and handling workers'
compensation claims, but it is prohibited by Texas law from

through a collective bargaining agreement or through a memorandum of
understanding or other type of oral or written agreement. In the absence
of a collective bargaining agreement applicable to the employees, the representative need not be a formal or recognized bargaining agent as long
as the representative is designated by the employees. Any agreement
must be consistent with the provisions of section 7(o) of the Act." 29

entering into a collective-bargaining agreement with the
county.10 Accordingly, the terms and conditions of petitioners' employment are included in individual form agreements
signed by each employee. These agreements incorporate by
reference the county's regulations providing that deputies
shall receive 11/2 hours of compensatory time for each hour
of overtime work.11

Petitioners filed this action in 1986, alleging, inter alia,12
that the county violated the Act by paying for overtime work
with comp time, rather than overtime pay, absent an agreement with their representative authorizing the substitution.
Petitioners contended that they were "covered" by subclause
(i) of subsection 7(o)(2)(A) by virtue of their union represen10 As the Court of Appeals stated: " Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c
prohibits any political subdivision from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization unless the political subdivision
has adopted the Fire and Police Employee Relations Act. Harris County
has not adopted that Act; thus, under article 5154c the County has no
authority to bargain with the Union." 956 F. 2d 516, 519 (CA5 1992).
The court went on to clarify that "Texas law prohibits any bilateral agreement between a city and a bargaining agent, whether the agreement is
labeled a collective bargaining agreement or something else. Under
Texas law, the County could not enter into any agreement with the
Union." Id., at 520 (emphasis in original).

The District Court interpreted Texas law the same way. Merritt v.
Klevenhagen, Civ. Action No. 88-1298 (SD Tex., Sept. 5, 1990), pp. 3-4,
reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. Our decision is premised on the
normal assumption that the Court of Appeals and the District Court have
correctly construed the relevant rules of Texas law. See Bishop v. Wood,
426 U. S. 341, 346, and n. 10 (1976) (citing cases).

12 The District Court granted summary judgment for the county on two

additional claims: that the county failed to include longevity pay in its
overtime pay calculations, and that the county excluded nonmandated
firearms qualification time from the calculation of number of hours worked.
The Court of Appeals affirmed with respect to the former and remanded
for further proceedings with respect to the latter claim. 956 F. 2d, at
520-523. Neither claim is before us today.

tation, and that the county therefore was precluded from
providing comp time pursuant to individual agreements (or
pre-existing practice) 13 under subclause (ii).

The District Court disagreed and entered summary judgment for the county. The court assumed that designation of
a union representative normally would establish that employees are "covered" by subclause (i), and hence render subclause (ii) inapplicable, but went on to hold that subclause (i)
cannot apply in States, like Texas, that prohibit collective
bargaining in the public sector. Merritt v. Klevenhagen,
Civ. Action No. 88-1298 (SD Tex., Sept. 5, 1990), p. 5, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a-20a. Reaching the
same result by an alternative route, the court also reasoned
that petitioners were not "covered" by subclause (i) because
their union was not " `recognized' " by the county, a requirement it grounded in the legislative history of the 1985
Amendments. Id., at 6, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert.
21a.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, but relied on slightly different reasoning. It seemed to agree with an Eleventh Circuit case, Dillard v. Harris, 885 F. 2d 1549 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 878 (1990), that the words "not covered" in
subclause (ii) refer to the absence of an agreement rather
than the absence of a representative. 956 F. 2d 516, 519-520
(CA5 1992). Under that theory, the fact that Texas law prohibits agreements between petitioners' union and the employer means that petitioners can never be "covered" by sub13 Respondents in this case sought to provide comp time pursuant to
both a "regular practice in effect on April 15, 1986," for deputies hired
before that date, and individual agreements, for deputies hired later. Merritt, Civ. Action No. 88-1298, p. 2, reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.
Like subclause (ii) individual agreements, "regular practice" is available
as an option only for employees "not covered by subclause (i)." 29 U. S. C.

$ 207(o)(2); n. 2, supra. Accordingly, our analysis is the same with respect
to both forms of agreement, and we refer to them here collectively as
individual agreements.

clause (i), making subclause (ii) available as an alternativevehicle for provision of comp time.

Because there is conflict among the Circuits over the scopeof subclause (i)'s coverage,

14 we granted certiorari. 506

U. S. 813 (1992). III

Respondents find the language of the statute perfectlyclear. In their view, subclause (ii) plainly authorizes individual agreements whenever public employees have not success-fully negotiated a collective-bargaining agreement under
subclause (i). Petitioners, on the other hand, contend thatambiguity in the statute itself justifies resort to its legislative history and the DOL regulations, and that these secondary sources unequivocally preclude individual comp timeagreements with employees who have designated a representative. We begin our analysis with the relevant statu-tory text.

At least one proposition is not in dispute. Subclause (ii)
authorizes individual comp time agreements only "in the caseof employees not covered by subclause (i)." Our task, therefore, is to identify the class of "employees" covered by sub-clause (i). This task is complicated by the fact that sub14 See, e. g., International Assn. of Fire Fighters, Local 2203 v. West
Adams County Fire Dist., 877 F. 2d 814 (CA10 1989) (employees covered
by subclause (i) upon designation of representative); Abbott v. Virginia
Beach, 879 F. 2d 132 (CA4 1989) (employees covered by subclause (i) upon
designation of recognized representative), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 1051
(1990); Dillard v. Harris, 885 F. 2d 1549 (CA11 1989) (employees covered
by subclause (i) upon entry of agreement regarding compensatory time),
cert. denied, 498 U. S. 878 (1990); Nevada Highway Patrol Assn. v. Nevada, 899 F. 2d 1549 (CA9 1990) (employees covered by subclause (i) upon
designation of representative unless state law prohibits public sector collective bargaining).

Opinion of the Court
clause (i) does not purport to define a category of employees,as the reference in subclause (ii) suggests it would. Instead,

it describes only a category of agreements--those that (a)are bargained with an employee representative, and (b) authorize the use of comp time.

Respondents read this shift in subject from "employees"in subclause (ii) to "agreement" in subclause (i) as susceptible

of just one meaning: Employees are covered by subclause(i) only if they are bound by applicable provisions of a
collective-bargaining agreement. Under this narrow con-struction, subclause (i) would not cover employees who designate a representative if that representative is unable to
reach agreement with the employer, for whatever reason;
such employees would remain "uncovered" and available for
individual comp time agreements under subclause (ii).

We find this reading unsatisfactory. First, while the language of subclauses (i) and (ii) will bear the interpretation
advanced by respondents, we cannot say that it will bear
no other. Purely as a matter of grammar, subclause (ii)'s
reference to "employees" remains unmodified by subclause
(i)'s focus on "agreement," and "employees . . . covered"
might as easily comprehend employees with representatives
as employees with agreements. See International Assn. of
Fire Fighters, Local 2203 v. West Adams County Fire Dist.,
877 F. 2d 814, 816-817, and n. 1 (CA10 1989).

Second, respondents' reading is difficult to reconcile with
the general structure of subsection 7(o). Assuming designation of an employee representative, respondents' theory
leaves it to the employer to choose whether it will proceed
under subclause (i), and negotiate the terms of a collective
comp time agreement with the representative, or instead
proceed under subclause (ii), and deal directly with its employees on an individual basis. If the employer is free to
choose the latter course (as most employers likely would),
then it need only decline to negotiate with the employee representative to render subclause (i) inapplicable and authorize

33Cite as: 508 U. S. 22 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
individual comp time agreements under subclause (ii).15This permissive interpretation of subsection 7(o), however,

is at odds with the limiting phrase of subclause (ii) at issuehere. See supra, at 31. Had Congress intended such an
open-ended authorization of the use of comp time, it surelywould have said so more simply, forgoing the elaborate subclause structure that purports to restrict use of individualagreements to a limited class of employees. Respondents'
broad interpretation of the subsection 7(o) exception is alsoin some tension with the well-established rule that "exemptions from the [FLSA] are to be narrowly construed." See,
e. g., Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., 359 U. S. 290, 295-296 (1959).

At the same time, however, we find equally implausible areading of the statutory text that would deem employees
"covered" by subclause (i) whenever they select a repre-sentative, whether or not the representative has the ability
to enter into the kind of agreement described in that sub-clause. If there is no possibility of reaching an agreement
under subclause (i), then that subclause cannot logically beread as applicable. In other words, "employees . . . covered
by subclause (i)" must, at a minimum, be employees who con-ceivably could receive comp time pursuant to the agreement
contemplated by that subclause.The most plausible reading of the phrase "employees . . .
covered by subclause (i)" is, in our view, neither of the ex-treme alternatives described above. Rather, the phrase is

15 Indeed, even an employer who is party to a collective-bargaining
agreement with its employees may be permitted to take advantage of subclause (ii) under respondents' construction. Because subclause (i) describes only those agreements that authorize the use of comp time, see
supra, at 31-32, a collective-bargaining agreement silent on the subject,
or even one prohibiting use of comp time altogether, would not constitute
a subclause (i) agreement. Accordingly, employees bound by such an
agreement would not be "covered by subclause (i)" under respondents'
theory, and their employer would be free to provide comp time instead of
overtime pay pursuant to individual employee agreements.

Opinion of the Court
most sensibly read as referring to employees who have des-ignated a representative with the authority to negotiate and

agree with their employer on "applicable provisions of a col-lective bargaining agreement" authorizing the use of comp
time. This reading accords significance to both the focus onthe word "agreement" in subclause (i) and the focus on "employees" in subclause (ii). It is also true to the hierarchyembodied in subsection 7(o), which favors subclause (i) agreements over individual agreements by limiting use of the lat-ter to cases in which the former are unavailable.

This intermediate reading of the statutory text is consist-ent also with the DOL regulations, interpreted most reasonably. It is true that 29 CFR $ 553.23(b), read in isolation,would support petitioners' view that selection of a representative by employees--even a representative without lawful authority to bargain with the employer--is sufficient to
bring the employees within the scope of subclause (i) andpreclude use of subclause (ii) individual agreements. See

supra, at 27, and n. 9. So interpreted, however, the regula-tion would prohibit entirely the use of comp time in a substantial portion of the public sector. It would also be incon-sistent with the Secretary's statement that "the question . . .
whether employees have a representative for purposes ofFLSA section 7(o) shall be determined in accordance with
State or local law and practices." See supra, at 28. This

16 So read, we do not understand subsection 7(o) to impose any new
burden upon a public employer to bargain collectively with its employees.
Subsection 7(o) is, after all, an exception to the general FLSA rule mandating overtime pay for overtime work, and employers may take advantage of the benefits it offers "only" pursuant to certain conditions set forth
by Congress. 29 U. S. C. $ 207(o)(2); see n. 2, supra. Once its employees
designate a representative authorized to engage in collective bargaining,
an employer is entitled to take advantage of those benefits if it reaches a
comp time agreement with the representative. It is also free, of course,
to forgo collective bargaining altogether; if it so chooses, it remains in
precisely the same position as any other employer subject to the overtime
pay provisions of the FLSA.

Opinion of the Court
clarification by the Secretary convinces us that when theregulations identify selection of a representative as the condition necessary for coverage under subclause (i), they referonly to those representatives with lawful authority to negotiate agreements.17Thus, under both the statute and the DOL regulations,
employees are "covered" by subclause (i) when they desig-nate a representative who lawfully may bargain collectively
on their behalf--under the statute, because such authorityis necessary to reach the kind of "agreement" described in
subclause (i), and under the regulation, because such author-ity is a condition of "representative" status for subclause (i)
purposes. Because we construe the statute and regulationin harmony, we need not comment further on petitioners'
argument that the Secretary's interpretation of the 1985Amendments is entitled to special deference.

Petitioners in this case did not have a representative au-thorized by law to enter into an agreement with their employer providing for use of comp time under subclause (i).Accordingly, they were "not covered by subclause (i)," and
subclause (ii) authorized the individual agreements chal-lenged in this litigation.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

So ordered.

17 Accordingly, public employers need not fear that they will find themselves dealing with a different representative for each employee, should
each of their employees choose to select his or her own representative.
See Brief for the National Association of Counties et al. as Amici Curiae
17. Unless such individual designations were "in accordance with State
or local law and practices," the designees would not be "representatives"
for purposes of subclause (i).

Syllabus

STINSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-8685. Argued March 24, 1993--Decided May 3, 1993
After petitioner Stinson pleaded guilty to a five-count indictment resulting

from his robbery of a bank, the District Court sentenced him as a career
offender under United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1, which requires, inter alia, that "the instant offense of conviction [be] a crime of violence." The court found that Stinson's offense
of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g), was
a "crime of violence" as that term was then defined in USSG $ 4B1.2(1).
While the case was on appeal, however, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 433, which added a sentence to the $ 4B1.2 commentary that expressly excluded the felon-in-possession offense from
the "crime of violence" definition. The Court of Appeals nevertheless
affirmed Stinson's sentence, adhering to its earlier interpretation that
the crime in question was categorically a crime of violence and holding
that the commentary to the Guidelines is not binding on the federal
courts.

Held: The Guidelines Manual's commentary which interprets or explains a

guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal
statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that
guideline. Pp. 40-48.

(a) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the commentary
added by Amendment 433 is not binding on the federal courts. Commentary which functions to "interpret [a] guideline or explain how it is to
be applied," $ 1B1.7, controls, and if failure to follow, or a misreading of,
such commentary results in a sentence "select[ed] . . . from the wrong
guideline range," Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193, 203, that
sentence would constitute "an incorrect application of the . . . guidelines"
that should be set aside under 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f)(1) unless the error
was harmless, see Williams, supra, at 201. Guideline $ 1B1.7 makes
this proposition clear, and this Court's holding in Williams, supra, at
201, that the Sentencing Commission's policy statements bind federal
courts applies with equal force to the commentary at issue. However,
it does not follow that commentary is binding in all instances. The
standard that governs whether particular interpretive or explanatory
commentary is binding is the one that applies to an agency's interpretation of its own legislative rule: Provided it does not violate the Constitu508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion or a federal statute, such an interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the
regulation it interprets. See, e. g., Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand
Co., 325 U. S. 410, 414. Amended commentary is binding on the courts
even though it is not reviewed by Congress, and prior judicial constructions of a particular guideline cannot prevent the Sentencing Commission from adopting a conflicting interpretation that satisfies the standard adopted herein. Pp. 40-46.

(b) Application of the foregoing principles leads to the conclusion that
federal courts may not use the felon-in-possession offense as the predicate crime of violence for purposes of imposing $ 4B1.1's career offender
provision as to those defendants to whom Amendment 433 applies. Although the guideline text may not compel the Amendment's exclusion
of the offense in question from the "crime of violence" definition, the
commentary is a binding interpretation of the quoted phrase because it
does not run afoul of the Constitution or a federal statute, and it is not
plainly erroneous or inconsistent with $ 4B1.2. P. 47.

(c) The Court declines to address the Government's argument that
Stinson's sentence conformed with the Guidelines Manual in effect when
he was sentenced, and that the sentence may not be reversed on appeal
based upon a postsentence amendment to the Manual's provisions. The
Court of Appeals did not consider this theory, and it is not fairly included in the question this Court formulated in its grant of certiorari.
It is left to be addressed on remand. Pp. 47-48.

38 STINSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Sentencing Guidelines is not binding on the federal courts.We decide that commentary in the Guidelines Manual that

interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless itviolates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.

Petitioner Terry Lynn Stinson entered a plea of guilty toa five-count indictment resulting from his robbery of a Florida bank. The presentence report recommended that peti-tioner be sentenced as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. See United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1 (Nov. 1989). Section 4B1.1 provided that a defendant is a career offender if:

"(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the
time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of con-viction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a

controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant hasat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of
violence or a controlled substance offense."
All concede that petitioner was at least 18 years old when
the events leading to the indictment occurred and that hethen had at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of

violence, thereby satisfying the first and third elements inthe definition of career offender. It is the second element in
this definition, the requirement that the predicate offense be
a crime of violence, that gave rise to the ultimate problemin this case. At the time of his sentencing, the Guidelines

defined "crime of violence" as, among other things, "any of-fense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment
for a term exceeding one year that . . . involves conduct that
presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another." $ 4B1.2(1). The United States District Court for
the Middle District of Florida found that petitioner's conviction for the offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g), was a crime of violence, satisfying
the second element of the career offender definition. Al508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
though the indictment contained other counts, the DistrictCourt relied only upon the felon-in-possession offense in

applying the career offender provision of the Guidelines. Inaccord with its conclusions, the District Court sentenced
petitioner as a career offender.On appeal, petitioner maintained his position that the offense relied upon by the District Court was not a crime ofviolence under USSG $$ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2(1). The Court of
Appeals affirmed, holding that possession of a firearm by afelon was, as a categorical matter, a crime of violence. 943
F. 2d 1268, 1271-1273 (CA11 1991). After its decision, how-ever, Amendment 433 to the Guidelines Manual, which added
a sentence to the commentary to $ 4B1.2, became effective.The new sentence stated that "[t]he term `crime of violence'
does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a fire-arm by a felon."

1 USSG App. C, p. 253 (Nov. 1992). See

$ 4B1.2, comment., n. 2. Petitioner sought rehearing, ar-guing that Amendment 433 should be given retroactive

effect, but the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier inter-pretation of "crime of violence" and denied the petition for
rehearing in an opinion. 957 F. 2d 813 (CA11 1992) (percuriam).

Rather than considering whether the amendment shouldbe given retroactive application, the Court of Appeals held
that commentary to the Guidelines, though "persuasive," isof only "limited authority" and not "binding" on the federal
courts. Id., at 815. It rested this conclusion on the fact

1 Amendment 433 was contrary to a substantial body of Circuit precedent holding that the felon-in-possession offense constituted a crime of
violence in at least some circumstances. See, e. g., United States v.
Williams, 892 F. 2d 296, 304 (CA3 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 939 (1990);

Opinion of the Court
that Congress does not review amendments to the commen-tary under 28 U. S. C. $ 994(p). The Court of Appeals "decline[d] to be bound by the change in section 4B1.2's com-mentary until Congress amends section 4B1.2's language

Courts of Appeals have taken conflicting positions on theauthoritative weight to be accorded to the commentary to

Opinion of the Court
and practices for the Federal criminal justice system,"

$ 991(b)(1). See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,
367-370 (1989). The Commission executed this function by
promulgating the Guidelines Manual. The Manual contains
text of three varieties. First is a guideline provision itself.
The Sentencing Reform Act establishes that the Guidelines
are "for use of a sentencing court in determining the sentence
to be imposed in a criminal case." 28 U. S. C. $ 994(a)(1).
The Guidelines provide direction as to the appropriate type of
punishment--probation, fine, or term of imprisonment--and
the extent of the punishment imposed. $$ 994(a)(1)(A) and
(B). Amendments to the Guidelines must be submitted to
Congress for a 6-month period of review, during which Congress can modify or disapprove them. $ 994(p). The second
variety of text in the Manual is a policy statement. The
Sentencing Reform Act authorizes the promulgation of "general policy statements regarding application of the guidelines" or other aspects of sentencing that would further the
purposes of the Act. $ 994(a)(2). The third variant of text
is commentary, at issue in this case. In the Guidelines Manual, both guidelines and policy statements are accompanied
by extensive commentary. Although the Sentencing Reform Act does not in express terms authorize the issuance
of commentary, the Act does refer to it. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b) (in determining whether to depart from a guidelines range, "the court shall consider only the sentencing
guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the
Sentencing Commission"). The Sentencing Commission has
provided in a Guideline that commentary may serve these
functions: commentary may "interpret [a] guideline or explain how it is to be applied," "suggest circumstances which
. . . may warrant departure from the guidelines," or "provide
background information, including factors considered in
promulgating the guideline or reasons underlying promulgation of the guideline." USSG $ 1B1.7.

42 STINSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
As we have observed, "the Guidelines bind judges andcourts in the exercise of their uncontested responsibility

to pass sentence in criminal cases." Mistretta v. United
States, supra, at 391. See also Burns v. United States, 501
U. S. 129, 133 (1991). The most obvious operation of this
principle is with respect to the Guidelines themselves. TheSentencing Reform Act provides that, unless the sentencing

court finds an aggravating or mitigating factor of a kind, orto a degree, not given adequate consideration by the Commission, a circumstance not applicable in this case, "[t]hecourt shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the
range," established by the applicable guidelines. 18 U. S. C.

$$ 3553(a)(4), (b). The principle that the Guidelines Manual
is binding on federal courts applies as well to policy statements. In Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193, 201
(1992), we said that "[w]here . . . a policy statement prohibits
a district court from taking a specified action, the statement
is an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicable
Guideline." There, the District Court had departed upward
from the Guidelines' sentencing range based on prior arrests
that did not result in criminal convictions. A policy statement, however, prohibited a court from basing a departure
on a prior arrest record alone. USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s. We
held that failure to follow the policy statement resulted in a
sentence "imposed as a result of an incorrect application of
the sentencing guidelines" under 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f)(1) that
should be set aside on appeal unless the error was harmless.
503 U. S., at 201, 203.

In the case before us, the Court of Appeals determined
that these principles do not apply to commentary. 957 F. 2d,
at 814-815. Its conclusion that the commentary now being
considered is not binding on the courts was error. The commentary added by Amendment 433 was interpretive and
explanatory of the Guideline defining "crime of violence."
Commentary which functions to "interpret [a] guideline or
explain how it is to be applied," USSG $ 1B1.7, controls, and

43Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
if failure to follow, or a misreading of, such commentaryresults in a sentence "select[ed] . . . from the wrong guideline range," Williams v. United States, supra, at 203, thatsentence would constitute "an incorrect application of the
sentencing guidelines" under 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f )(1). A
Guideline itself makes this proposition clear. See USSG$ 1B1.7 ("Failure to follow such commentary could constitute

an incorrect application of the guidelines, subjecting the sen-tence to possible reversal on appeal"). Our holding in

Williams dealing with policy statements applies with equalforce to the commentary before us here. Cf. USSG $ 1B1.7

(commentary regarding departures from the Guidelines
should be "treated as the legal equivalent of a policy statement"); $ 1B1.7, comment. ("Portions of [the Guidelines Manual] not labeled as guidelines or commentary . . . are to be
construed as commentary and thus have the force of policy
statements").

It does not follow that commentary is binding in all instances. If, for example, commentary and the guideline it
interprets are inconsistent in that following one will result
in violating the dictates of the other, the Sentencing Reform
Act itself commands compliance with the guideline. See 18
U. S. C. $$ 3553(a)(4), (b). Some courts have refused to follow commentary in situations falling short of such flat inconsistency. Thus, we articulate the standard that governs the
decision whether particular interpretive or explanatory commentary is binding.

Different analogies have been suggested as helpful characterizations of the legal force of commentary. Some we reject. We do not think it helpful to treat commentary as a
contemporaneous statement of intent by the drafters or issuers of the guideline, having a status similar to that of, for
example, legislative committee reports or the advisory committee notes to the various federal rules of procedure and
evidence. Quite apart from the usual difficulties of attributing meaning to a statutory or regulatory command by refer508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT
44 STINSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ence to what other documents say about its proposers' initialintent, here, as is often true, the commentary was issued well

after the guideline it interprets had been promulgated. Theguidelines of the Sentencing Commission, moreover, cannot
become effective until after the 6-month review period for
congressional modification or disapproval. It seems incon-sistent with this process for the Commission to announce

some statement of initial intent well after the review processhas expired. To be sure, much commentary has been issued
at the same time as the guideline it interprets. But neitherthe Guidelines Manual nor the Sentencing Reform Act indicates that the weight accorded to, or the function of, commentary differs depending on whether it represents a contemporaneous or ex post interpretation.

We also find inapposite an analogy to an agency's construction of a federal statute that it administers. Under Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837 (1984), if a statute is unambiguous the statute governs; if, however, Congress' silence or ambiguity has "left a
gap for the agency to fill," courts must defer to the agency's
interpretation so long as it is "a permissible construction of
the statute." Id., at 842-843. Commentary, however, has
a function different from an agency's legislative rule. Commentary, unlike a legislative rule, is not the product of delegated authority for rulemaking, which of course must yield
to the clear meaning of a statute. Id., at 843, n. 9. Rather,
commentary explains the guidelines and provides concrete
guidance as to how even unambiguous guidelines are to be
applied in practice.

Although the analogy is not precise because Congress has
a role in promulgating the guidelines, we think the Government is correct in suggesting that the commentary be
treated as an agency's interpretation of its own legislative
rule. Brief for United States 13-16. The Sentencing Commission promulgates the guidelines by virtue of an express
congressional delegation of authority for rulemaking, see

508us1$66Z 02-13-97 13:36:06 PAGES OPINPGT

45Cite as: 508 U. S. 36 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S., at 371-379, and throughthe informal rulemaking procedures in 5 U. S. C. $ 553, see

28 U. S. C. $ 994(x). Thus, the guidelines are the equivalentof legislative rules adopted by federal agencies. The functional purpose of commentary (of the kind at issue here) is
to assist in the interpretation and application of those rules,which are within the Commission's particular area of concern

and expertise and which the Commission itself has the firstresponsibility to formulate and announce. In these respects
this type of commentary is akin to an agency's interpretationof its own legislative rules. As we have often stated, provided an agency's interpretation of its own regulations does
not violate the Constitution or a federal statute, it must be
given "controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the regulation." Bowles v. Seminole
Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410, 414 (1945). See, e. g., Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359
(1989); Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986); United
States v. Larionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 872-873 (1977); Udall v.
Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1965). See also 2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise $ 7:22, pp. 105-107 (2d ed. 1979).

According this measure of controlling authority to the
commentary is consistent with the role the Sentencing Reform Act contemplates for the Sentencing Commission. The
Commission, after all, drafts the guidelines as well as the
commentary interpreting them, so we can presume that the
interpretations of the guidelines contained in the commentary represent the most accurate indications of how the Commission deems that the guidelines should be applied to be
consistent with the Guidelines Manual as a whole as well as
the authorizing statute. The Commission has the statutory
obligation "periodically [to] review and revise" the guidelines
in light of its consultation with authorities on and representatives of the federal criminal justice system. See 28
U. S. C. $ 994(o). The Commission also must "revie[w] the
presentence report, the guideline worksheets, the tribunal's

sentencing statement, and any written plea agreement,"
Mistretta v. United States, supra, at 369-370, with respect
to every federal criminal sentence. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(w).In assigning these functions to the Commission, "Congress

necessarily contemplated that the Commission would periodically review the work of the courts, and would make what-ever clarifying revisions to the Guidelines conflicting judicial

decisions might suggest." Braxton v. United States, 500U. S. 344, 348 (1991). Although amendments to guidelines
provisions are one method of incorporating revisions, an-other method open to the Commission is amendment of the
commentary, if the guideline which the commentary inter-prets will bear the construction. Amended commentary is
binding on the federal courts even though it is not reviewed
by Congress, and prior judicial constructions of a particularguideline cannot prevent the Commission from adopting a

conflicting interpretation that satisfies the standard we setforth today.

It is perhaps ironic that the Sentencing Commission's own
commentary fails to recognize the full significance of interpretive and explanatory commentary. The commentary to
the Guideline on commentary provides:

"[I]n seeking to understand the meaning of the guidelines courts likely will look to the commentary for guidance as an indication of the intent of those who wrote
them. In such instances, the courts will treat the commentary much like legislative history or other legal material that helps determine the intent of a drafter."
USSG $ 1B1.7, comment.

We note that this discussion is phrased in predictive terms.
To the extent that this commentary has prescriptive content,
we think its exposition of the role of interpretive and explanatory commentary is inconsistent with the uses to which the
Commission in practice has put such commentary and the

Opinion of the Court
command in $ 1B1.7 that failure to follow interpretive and
explanatory commentary could result in reversible error.

We now apply these principles to Amendment 433. We
recognize that the exclusion of the felon-in-possession offense from the definition of "crime of violence" may not be
compelled by the guideline text. Nonetheless, Amendment
433 does not run afoul of the Constitution or a federal statute, and it is not "plainly erroneous or inconsistent" with

$ 4B1.2, Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., supra, at 414.
As a result, the commentary is a binding interpretation of
the phrase "crime of violence." Federal courts may not use
the felon-in-possession offense as the predicate crime of violence for purposes of imposing the career offender provision
of USSG $ 4B1.1 as to those defendants to whom Amendment
433 applies.

The Government agrees that the Court of Appeals erred
in concluding that commentary is not binding on the federal

weight. See Brief for United States 11-19. It suggests,
however, that we should affirm the judgment on an alternative ground. It argues that petitioner's sentence conformed
with the Guidelines Manual in effect when he was sentenced,
id., at 22-29, and that the sentence may not be reversed on
appeal based upon a postsentence amendment to the provisions in the Manual, id., at 19-22. The Government claims
that petitioner's only recourse is to file a motion in District
Court for resentencing, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3582(c)(2).
Brief for United States 33-35. It notes that after the Court
of Appeals denied rehearing in this case, the Sentencing
Commission amended USSG $ 1B1.10(d), p. s., to indicate that
Amendment 433 may be given retroactive effect under

$ 3582(c)(2). See Amendment 469, USSG App. C, p. 296
(Nov. 1992).

We decline to address this argument. In refusing to upset
petitioner's sentence, the Court of Appeals did not consider

Opinion of the Court
the nonretroactivity theory here advanced by the Govern-ment; its refusal to vacate the sentence was based only on

its view that commentary did not bind it. This issue, more-over, is not "fairly included" in the question we formulated
in the grant of certiorari, see 506 U. S. 972 (1992). Cf. thisCourt's Rule 14.1(a). We leave the contentions of the parties on this aspect of the case to be addressed by the Courtof Appeals on remand.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Eleventh Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1043. Argued November 2, 1992--Decided May 3, 1993
Although those who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability, Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, such immunity is withheld
when petitioning activity "ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, is a mere sham to cover . . . an attempt to interfere
directly" with a competitor's business relationships, id., at 144. Petitioner resort hotel operators (collectively, PRE) rented videodiscs to
guests for use with videodisc players located in each guest's room and
sought to develop a market for the sale of such players to other hotels.
Respondent major motion picture studios (collectively, Columbia), which
held copyrights to the motion pictures recorded on PRE's videodiscs
and licensed the transmission of those motion pictures to hotel rooms,
sued PRE for alleged copyright infringement. PRE counterclaimed,
alleging that Columbia's copyright action was a mere sham that cloaked
underlying acts of monopolization and conspiracy to restrain trade in
violation of $$ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The District Court granted
summary judgment to PRE on the copyright claim, and the Court of
Appeals affirmed. On remand, the District Court granted Columbia's
motion for summary judgment on PRE's antitrust claims. Because Columbia had probable cause to bring the infringement action, the court
reasoned, the action was no sham and was entitled to Noerr immunity.
The District Court also denied PRE's request for further discovery on
Columbia's intent in bringing its action. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Noting that PRE's sole argument was that the lawsuit was a
sham because Columbia did not honestly believe its infringement claim
was meritorious, the court found that the existence of probable cause
precluded the application of the sham exception as a matter of law and
rendered irrelevant any evidence of Columbia's subjective intent in
bringing suit.

Held:

1. Litigation cannot be deprived of immunity as a sham unless it is
objectively baseless. This Court's decisions establish that the legality
of objectively reasonable petitioning "directed toward obtaining govern508us1$67M 02-21-97 22:37:48 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus

mental action" is "not at all affected by any anticompetitive purpose
[the actor] may have had." Id., at 140. Thus, neither Noerr immunity
nor its sham exception turns on subjective intent alone. See, e. g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U. S. 492, 503.
Rather, to be a "sham," litigation must meet a two-part definition.
First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits. Only
if challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the
litigant's subjective motivation. Under this second part of the definition a court should focus on whether the baseless suit conceals "an attempt to interfere directly" with a competitor's business relationships,
Noerr, supra, at 144, through the "use [of] the governmental process--
as opposed to the outcome of that process--as an anticompetitive
weapon," Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365,
380. This two-tiered process requires a plaintiff to disprove the challenged lawsuit's legal viability before the court will entertain evidence
of the suit's economic viability. Pp. 55-61.

2. Because PRE failed to establish the objective prong of Noerr's
sham exception, summary judgment was properly granted to Columbia.
A finding that an antitrust defendant claiming Noerr immunity had
probable cause to sue compels the conclusion that a reasonable litigant
in the defendant's position could realistically expect success on the merits of the challenged lawsuit. Here, the lower courts correctly found
probable cause for Columbia's suit. Since there was no dispute over
the predicate facts of the underlying legal proceedings--Columbia had
the exclusive right to show its copyrighted motion pictures publicly--
the court could decide probable cause as a matter of law. A court could
reasonably conclude that Columbia's action was an objectively plausible
effort to enforce rights, since, at the time the District Court entered
summary judgment, there was no clear copyright law on videodisc
rental activities; since Columbia might have won its copyright suit in
two other Circuits; and since Columbia would have been entitled to
press a novel claim, even in the absence of supporting authority, if a
similarly situated reasonable litigant could have perceived some likelihood of success. Pp. 62-65.

3. The Court of Appeals properly refused PRE's request for further
discovery on the economic circumstances of the underlying copyright
litigation, because such matters were rendered irrelevant by the objective legal reasonableness of Columbia's infringement suit. Pp. 65-66.

944 F. 2d 1525, affirmed.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to define the "sham" exception tothe doctrine of antitrust immunity first identified in

EasternRailroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,

Inc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), as that doctrine applies in the liti-gation context. Under the sham exception, activity "ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action" doesnot qualify for Noerr immunity if it "is a mere sham to cover
. . . an attempt to interfere directly with the business rela-tionships of a competitor."

Id., at 144. We hold that litiga-tion cannot be deprived of immunity as a sham unless the

litigation is objectively baseless. The Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit refused to characterize as sham a lawsuit
that the antitrust defendant admittedly had probable causeto institute. We affirm.

viewing. PRE also sought to develop a market for the saleof videodisc players to other hotels wishing to offer in-room

viewing of prerecorded material. Respondents, ColumbiaPictures Industries, Inc., and seven other major motion picture studios (collectively, Columbia), held copyrights to themotion pictures recorded on the videodiscs that PRE purchased. Columbia also licensed the transmission of copy-righted motion pictures to hotel rooms through a wired cable
system called Spectradyne. PRE therefore competed withColumbia not only for the viewing market at La Mancha but
also for the broader market for in-room entertainment services in hotels.

In 1983, Columbia sued PRE for alleged copyright in-fringement through the rental of videodiscs for viewing in

hotel rooms. PRE counterclaimed, charging Columbia withviolations of $$ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1-2,1 and various state-law infrac-tions. In particular, PRE alleged that Columbia's copyright
action was a mere sham that cloaked underlying acts of mo-nopolization and conspiracy to restrain trade.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment onColumbia's copyright claim and postponed further discovery
on PRE's antitrust counterclaims. Columbia did not disputethat PRE could freely sell or lease lawfully purchased videodiscs under the Copyright Act's "first sale" doctrine, see 17U. S. C. $ 109(a), and PRE conceded that the playing of videodiscs constituted "performance" of motion pictures, see 17
U. S. C. $ 101 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). As a result, summaryjudgment depended solely on whether rental of videodiscs

for in-room viewing infringed Columbia's exclusive right to

1 Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits "[e]very contract, combination
. . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States." 15 U. S. C. $ 1. Section 2 punishes "[e]very person who shall
monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any
other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce
among the several States."

"perform the copyrighted work[s] publicly." $ 106(4). Rul-ing that such rental did not constitute public performance,

the District Court entered summary judgment for PRE.228 USPQ 743 (CD Cal. 1986). The Court of Appeals affirmed on the grounds that a hotel room was not a "publicplace" and that PRE did not "transmit or otherwise communicate" Columbia's motion pictures. 866 F. 2d 278 (CA91989). See 17 U. S. C. $ 101 (1988 ed. and Supp. III).

On remand, Columbia sought summary judgment onPRE's antitrust claims, arguing that the original copyright
infringement action was no sham and was therefore entitledto immunity under

Eastern Railroad Presidents Conferencev.
Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., supra. Reasoning that theinfringement action "was clearly a legitimate effort and

therefore not a sham," 1990-1 Trade Cases || 68,971, p. 63,242(CD Cal. 1990), the District Court granted the motion:

"It was clear from the manner in which the case waspresented that [Columbia was] seeking and expecting a
favorable judgment. Although I decided against [Co-lumbia], the case was far from easy to resolve, and it
was evident from the opinion affirming my order thatthe Court of Appeals had trouble with it as well. I find
that there was probable cause for bringing the action,regardless of whether the issue was considered a question of fact or of law." Id., at 63,243.
The court then denied PRE's request for further discoveryon Columbia's intent in bringing the copyright action and

dismissed PRE's state-law counterclaims without prejudice.The Court of Appeals affirmed. 944 F. 2d 1525 (CA9
1991). After rejecting PRE's other allegations of anticom-petitive conduct, see id., at 1528-1529,

Opinion of the Court

PRE's contention that the copyright action was indeed shamand that Columbia could not claim Noerr immunity. The

Court of Appeals characterized "sham" litigation as one oftwo types of "abuse of . . . judicial processes": either " `misrepresentations . . . in the adjudicatory process' " or the pur-suit of " `a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims' " instituted
" `without probable cause, and regardless of the merits.' "944 F. 2d, at 1529 (quoting

California Motor Transport Co.v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 513, 512 (1972)). PRE

neither "allege[d] that the [copyright] lawsuit involved mis-representations" nor "challenge[d] the district court's finding
that the infringement action was brought with probable
cause, i. e., that the suit was not baseless." 944 F. 2d, at1530. Rather, PRE opposed summary judgment solely by

arguing that "the copyright infringement lawsuit [was] asham because [Columbia] did not honestly believe that the
infringement claim was meritorious." Ibid.The Court of Appeals rejected PRE's contention that
"subjective intent in bringing the suit was a question of factprecluding entry of summary judgment."

Ibid. Instead,
the court reasoned that the existence of probable cause "preclude[d] the application of the sham exception as a matter oflaw" because "a suit brought with probable cause does not

fall within the sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doc-trine."

Id., at 1531, 1532. Finally, the court observed that
PRE's failure to show that "the copyright infringement ac-tion was baseless" rendered irrelevant any "evidence of [Columbia's] subjective intent." Id., at 1533. It accordinglyrejected PRE's request for further discovery on Columbia's
intent.
Columbia's other allegedly anticompetitive acts. Id., at 1529. Thus,
whatever antitrust injury Columbia inflicted must have stemmed from the
attempted enforcement of copyrights, and we do not consider whether
Columbia could have made a valid claim of immunity for anticompetitive
conduct independent of petitioning activity. Cf. Continental Ore Co. v.
Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 707-708 (1962).

Opinion of the Court
The Courts of Appeals have defined "sham" in inconsistentand contradictory ways.

3 We once observed that "sham"

might become "no more than a label courts could apply toactivity they deem unworthy of antitrust immunity."

Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U. S.
492, 508, n. 10 (1988). The array of definitions adopted bylower courts demonstrates that this observation was

prescient. II

PRE contends that "the Ninth Circuit erred in holding
that an antitrust plaintiff must, as a threshold prerequisite

3 Several Courts of Appeals demand that an alleged sham be proved
legally unreasonable. See McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 F. 2d 1552,
1560, and n. 12 (CA11 1992); Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 700 F. 2d 785, 809-812 (CA2 1983), cert. denied,
464 U. S. 1073 (1984); Hydro-Tech Corp. v. Sundstrand Corp., 673 F. 2d
1171, 1177 (CA10 1982); Federal Prescription Service, Inc. v. American
Pharmaceutical Assn., 214 U. S. App. D. C. 76, 85, 89, 663 F. 2d 253, 262,
266 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 928 (1982). Still other courts have held
that successful litigation by definition cannot be sham. See, e. g., Eden
Hannon & Co. v. Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., 914 F. 2d 556, 564-565
(CA4 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 947 (1991); South Dakota v. Kansas
City Southern Industries, Inc., 880 F. 2d 40, 54 (CA8 1989), cert. denied
sub nom. South Dakota v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., 493 U. S. 1023
(1990); Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc., 749 F. 2d
154, 161 (CA3 1984).

Other Courts of Appeals would regard some meritorious litigation as
sham. The Sixth Circuit treats "genuine [legal] substance" as raising
merely "a rebuttable presumption" of immunity. Westmac, Inc. v. Smith,
797 F. 2d 313, 318 (1986) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 1035
(1987). The Seventh Circuit denies immunity for the pursuit of valid
claims if "the stakes, discounted by the probability of winning, would be
too low to repay the investment in litigation." Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois
Tool Works, Inc., 694 F. 2d 466, 472 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U. S. 958
(1983). Finally, in the Fifth Circuit, "success on the merits does not . . .
preclude" proof of a sham if the litigation was not "significantly motivated
by a genuine desire for judicial relief." In re Burlington Northern, Inc.,
822 F. 2d 518, 528 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. Union Pacific R. Co. v.
Energy Transportation Systems, Inc., 484 U. S. 1007 (1988).

. . . , establish that a sham lawsuit is baseless as a matter oflaw." Brief for Petitioners 14. It invites us to adopt an

approach under which either "indifference to . . . outcome,"
ibid., or failure to prove that a petition for redress of grievances "would . . . have been brought but for [a] predatory
motive," Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, would expose a defendant toantitrust liability under the sham exception. We decline

PRE's invitation.Those who petition government for redress are generally
immune from antitrust liability. We first recognized in
Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor
Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), that "the Sherman Act
does not prohibit . . . persons from associating together in an
attempt to persuade the legislature or the executive to take
particular action with respect to a law that would produce a
restraint or a monopoly." Id., at 136. Accord, Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 669 (1965). In light of the
government's "power to act in [its] representative capacity"
and "to take actions . . . that operate to restrain trade," we
reasoned that the Sherman Act does not punish "political activity" through which "the people . . . freely inform the government of their wishes." Noerr, 365 U. S., at 137. Nor did
we "impute to Congress an intent to invade" the First
Amendment right to petition. Id., at 138.

Noerr, however, withheld immunity from "sham" activities
because "application of the Sherman Act would be justified"
when petitioning activity, "ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, is a mere sham to cover . . . an
attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships
of a competitor." Id., at 144. In Noerr itself, we found that
a publicity campaign by railroads seeking legislation harmful
to truckers was no sham in that the "effort to influence legislation" was "not only genuine but also highly successful."
Ibid.

In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508 (1972), we elaborated on Noerr in two rele508us1$67M 02-21-97 22:37:49 PAGES OPINPGT

57Cite as: 508 U. S. 49 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
vant respects. First, we extended Noerr to "the approachof citizens . . . to administrative agencies . . . and to courts."

404 U. S., at 510. Second, we held that the complaintshowed a sham not entitled to immunity when it contained
allegations that one group of highway carriers "sought tobar . . . competitors from meaningful access to adjudicatory
tribunals and so to usurp that decisionmaking process" by"institut[ing] . . . proceedings and actions . . . with or without
probable cause, and regardless of the merits of the cases."
Id., at 512 (internal quotation marks omitted). We left un-resolved the question presented by this case--whether litigation may be sham merely because a subjective expectationof success does not motivate the litigant. We now answer
this question in the negative and hold that an objectivelyreasonable effort to litigate cannot be sham regardless of
subjective intent.4Our original formulation of antitrust petitioning immunity

required that unprotected activity lack objective reasonable-ness.

Noerr rejected the contention that an attempt "to in-fluence the passage and enforcement of laws" might lose immunity merely because the lobbyists' "sole purpose . . . wasto destroy [their] competitors." 365 U. S., at 138. Nor were
we persuaded by a showing that a publicity campaign "wasintended to and did in fact injure [competitors] in their relationships with the public and with their customers," sincesuch "direct injury" was merely "an incidental effect of the
. . . campaign to influence governmental action." Id., at 143.

4 California Motor Transport did refer to the antitrust defendants'
"purpose to deprive . . . competitors of meaningful access to the . . .
courts." 404 U. S., at 512. See also id., at 515 (noting a "purpose to eliminate . . . a competitor by denying him free and meaningful access to the
agencies and courts"); id., at 518 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment)
(agreeing that the antitrust laws could punish acts intended "to discourage
and ultimately to prevent [a competitor] from invoking" administrative
and judicial process). That a sham depends on the existence of anticompetitive intent, however, does not transform the sham inquiry into a purely
subjective investigation.

Opinion of the Court

We reasoned that "[t]he right of the people to inform theirrepresentatives in government of their desires with respect

to the passage or enforcement of laws cannot properly bemade to depend upon their intent in doing so."

Id., at 139.
In short, "Noerr shields from the Sherman Act a concerted
effort to influence public officials regardless of intent or pur-pose."

Pennington, 381 U. S., at 670.
Nothing in California Motor Transport retreated fromthese principles. Indeed, we recognized that recourse to

agencies and courts should not be condemned as sham untila reviewing court has "discern[ed] and draw[n]" the "difficult
line" separating objectively reasonable claims from "a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims . . . which leads the
factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial
processes have been abused." 404 U. S., at 513. Our recognition of a sham in that case signifies that the institution of
legal proceedings "without probable cause" will give rise to
a sham if such activity effectively "bar[s] . . . competitors
from meaningful access to adjudicatory tribunals and so . . .
usurp[s] th[e] decisionmaking process." Id., at 512.

Since California Motor Transport, we have consistently
assumed that the sham exception contains an indispensable
objective component. We have described a sham as "evidenced by repetitive lawsuits carrying the hallmark of insubstantial claims." Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410
U. S. 366, 380 (1973) (emphasis added). We regard as sham
"private action that is not genuinely aimed at procuring
favorable government action," as opposed to "a valid effort
to influence government action." Allied Tube & Conduit
Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U. S., at 500, n. 4. And we
have explicitly observed that a successful "effort to influence
governmental action . . . certainly cannot be characterized
as a sham." Id., at 502. See also Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend
Corp., 433 U. S. 623, 645 (1977) (Blackmun, J., concurring
in result) (describing a successful lawsuit as a "genuine
attemp[t] to use the . . . adjudicative process legitimately"

Opinion of the Court
rather than " `a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims' ").Whether applying

Noerr as an antitrust doctrine or invoking it in other contexts, we have repeatedly reaffirmed thatevidence of anticompetitive intent or purpose alone cannot

transform otherwise legitimate activity into a sham. See,
e. g., FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S.411, 424 (1990);

NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458
U. S. 886, 913-914 (1982). Cf. Vendo, supra, at 635-636, n. 6,639, n. 9 (plurality opinion of

Rehnquist, J.); id., at 644, n.,
645 (Blackmun, J., concurring in result). Indeed, by anal-ogy to

Noerr's sham exception, we held that even an "improperly motivated" lawsuit may not be enjoined under the
National Labor Relations Act as an unfair labor practice unless such litigation is "baseless." Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 743-744 (1983). Our decisions therefore establish that the legality of objectively
reasonable petitioning "directed toward obtaining governmental action" is "not at all affected by any anticompetitive
purpose [the actor] may have had." Noerr, 365 U. S., at 140,
quoted in Pennington, supra, at 669.

Our most recent applications of Noerr immunity further
demonstrate that neither Noerr immunity nor its sham exception turns on subjective intent alone. In Allied Tube,
supra, at 503, and FTC v. Trial Lawyers, supra, at 424, 427,
and n. 11, we refused to let antitrust defendants immunize
otherwise unlawful restraints of trade by pleading a subjective intent to seek favorable legislation or to influence governmental action. Cf. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.
Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 101, n. 23
(1984) ("[G]ood motives will not validate an otherwise anticompetitive practice"). In Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365 (1991), we similarly held that
challenges to allegedly sham petitioning activity must be resolved according to objective criteria. We dispelled the notion that an antitrust plaintiff could prove a sham merely by
showing that its competitor's "purposes were to delay [the

plaintiff 's] entry into the market and even to deny it a mean-ingful access to the appropriate . . . administrative and legislative fora." Id., at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted).We reasoned that such inimical intent "may render the manner of lobbying improper or even unlawful, but does notnecessarily render it a `sham.' "

Ibid. Accord, id., at 398(
Stevens, J., dissenting).In sum, fidelity to precedent compels us to reject a purely

subjective definition of "sham." The sham exception so con-strued would undermine, if not vitiate,

Noerr. And despitewhatever "superficial certainty" it might provide, a subjective standard would utterly fail to supply "real `intelligibleguidance.' "

Allied Tube, supra, at 508, n. 10.

III
We now outline a two-part definition of "sham" litigation.First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense

that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect successon the merits. If an objective litigant could conclude that
the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome,the suit is immunized under

part of our definition of sham, the court should focus onwhether the baseless lawsuit conceals "an attempt to inter5 A winning lawsuit is by definition a reasonable effort at petitioning for
redress and therefore not a sham. On the other hand, when the antitrust

fere directly with the business relationships of a competitor,"Noerr, supra, at 144 (emphasis added), through the "use [of]

the governmental process--as opposed to the outcome ofthat process--as an anticompetitive weapon," Omni, 499
U. S., at 380 (emphasis in original). This two-tiered processrequires the plaintiff to disprove the challenged lawsuit's
legal viability before the court will entertain evidence of thesuit's

economic viability. Of course, even a plaintiff who de-feats the defendant's claim to Noerr immunity by demonstrating both the objective and the subjective componentsof a sham must still prove a substantive antitrust violation.
Proof of a sham merely deprives the defendant of immunity;it does not relieve the plaintiff of the obligation to establish
all other elements of his claim.Some of the apparent confusion over the meaning of
"sham" may stem from our use of the word "genuine" to de-note the opposite of "sham." See

Omni, supra, at 382; Al-lied Tube, 486 U. S., at 500, n. 4; Noerr, supra, at 144; Vendo

Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., supra, at 645 (Blackmun, J., con-curring in result). The word "genuine" has both objective
and subjective connotations. On one hand, "genuine" means"actually having the reputed or apparent qualities or character." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 948(1986). "Genuine" in this sense governs Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 56, under which a "genuine issue" is one"that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because [it] may reasonably be resolved in favor of eitherparty." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250

(1986) (emphasis added). On the other hand, "genuine" alsomeans "sincerely and honestly felt or experienced." Webster's Dictionary, supra, at 948. To be sham, therefore, liti-gation must fail to be "genuine" in both senses of the word.

Opinion of the Court

IV
We conclude that the Court of Appeals properly affirmedsummary judgment for Columbia on PRE's antitrust counterclaim. Under the objective prong of the sham exception,the Court of Appeals correctly held that sham litigation must
constitute the pursuit of claims so baseless that no reason-able litigant could realistically expect to secure favorable relief. See 944 F. 2d, at 1529.The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has en-gaged in sham litigation. The notion of probable cause, as
understood and applied in the common-law tort of wrongfulcivil proceedings,

7 requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant lacked probable cause to institute an unsuccessfulcivil lawsuit and that the defendant pressed the action for an

improper, malicious purpose. Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98U. S. 187, 194 (1879);

Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 176 (1992)
(Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); T. Cooley, Law of Torts *181.Cf.

Wheeler v. Nesbitt, 24 How. 544, 549-550 (1861) (related
tort for malicious prosecution of criminal charges). Probable cause to institute civil proceedings requires no more thana "reasonabl[e] belie[f] that there is a chance that [a] claim

representations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when
used in the adjudicatory process." California Motor Transport, 404
U. S., at 512-513. We need not decide here whether and, if so, to what
extent Noerr permits the imposition of antitrust liability for a litigant's
fraud or other misrepresentations. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(3)
(allowing a federal court to "relieve a party . . . from a final judgment" for
"fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party");
Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp.,
382 U. S. 172, 176-177 (1965); id., at 179-180 (Harlan, J., concurring).

7 This tort is frequently called "malicious prosecution," which (strictly

speaking) governs the malicious pursuit of criminal proceedings without
probable cause. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser
and Keeton on Torts $ 120, p. 892 (5th ed. 1984). The threshold for showing probable cause is no higher in the civil context than in the criminal.

e, pp. 454-455 (1977). Because the
absence of probable cause is an essential element of the tort,
the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense. See
Crescent City Live Stock Co. v. Butchers' Union SlaughterHouse Co., 120 U. S. 141, 149 (1887); Wheeler, supra, at 551;
Liberty Loan Corp. of Gadsden v. Mizell, 410 So. 2d 45, 48
(Ala. 1982). Just as evidence of anticompetitive intent can-not affect the objective prong of

Noerr's sham exception, a
showing of malice alone will neither entitle the wrongful civil
proceedings plaintiff to prevail nor permit the factfinder to
infer the absence of probable cause. Stewart, supra, at 194;
Wheeler, supra, at 551; 2 C. Addison, Law of Torts $ 1, || 853,
pp. 67-68 (1876); T. Cooley, supra, at *184. When a court
has found that an antitrust defendant claiming Noerr immunity had probable cause to sue, that finding compels the
conclusion that a reasonable litigant in the defendant's position could realistically expect success on the merits of the
challenged lawsuit. Under our decision today, therefore,
a proper probable-cause determination irrefutably demonstrates that an antitrust plaintiff has not proved the objective prong of the sham exception and that the defendant is
accordingly entitled to Noerr immunity.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly
found that Columbia had probable cause to sue PRE for
copyright infringement. Where, as here, there is no dispute
over the predicate facts of the underlying legal proceeding,
a court may decide probable cause as a matter of law. Crescent, supra, at 149; Stewart, supra, at 194; Nelson v. Miller,
227 Kan. 271, 277, 607 P. 2d 438, 444 (1980); Stone v. Crocker,

of Railroads v. Kastenbaum, 263 U. S. 25, 28 (1923) ("The

perform [its] copyrighted" motion pictures "publicly." 17U. S. C. $ 106(4). Regardless of whether it intended any monopolistic or predatory use, Columbia acquired this statutory
right for motion pictures as "original" audiovisual "worksof authorship fixed" in a "tangible medium of expression."

$ 102(a)(6). Indeed, to condition a copyright upon a demon-strated lack of anticompetitive intent would upset the notion
of copyright as a "limited grant" of "monopoly privileges"intended simultaneously "to motivate the creative activity of
authors" and "to give the public appropriate access to their
work product." Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City
Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 429 (1984).

When the District Court entered summary judgment for
PRE on Columbia's copyright claim in 1986, it was by no
means clear whether PRE's videodisc rental activities intruded on Columbia's copyrights. At that time, the Third
Circuit and a District Court within the Third Circuit had
held that the rental of video cassettes for viewing in on-site,
private screening rooms infringed on the copyright owner's
right of public performance. Columbia Pictures Industries,
Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc., 749 F. 2d 154 (1984); Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Aveco, Inc., 612 F. Supp. 315 (MD
Pa. 1985), aff 'd, 800 F. 2d 59 (1986). Although the District
Court and the Ninth Circuit distinguished these decisions
by reasoning that hotel rooms offered a degree of privacy
more akin to the home than to a video rental store, see 228
USPQ, at 746; 866 F. 2d, at 280-281, copyright scholars
criticized both the reasoning and the outcome of the Ninth
Circuit's decision, see 1 P. Goldstein, Copyright: Principles,

Opinion of the Court
Views, Inc. v. Studio 21, Ltd., 925 F. 2d 1010, 1020, cert. de-nied, 502 U. S. 861 (1991). In light of the unsettled condition

of the law, Columbia plainly had probable cause to sue.Any reasonable copyright owner in Columbia's position
could have believed that it had some chance of winning an
infringement suit against PRE. Even though it did not sur-vive PRE's motion for summary judgment, Columbia's copyright action was arguably "warranted by existing law" or atthe very least was based on an objectively "good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existinglaw." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11. By the time the Ninth Circuit had reviewed all claims in this litigation, it became apparent that Columbia might have won its copyright suit in
either the Third or the Seventh Circuit. Even in the absence of supporting authority, Columbia would have been
entitled to press a novel copyright claim as long as a similarly situated reasonable litigant could have perceived some
likelihood of success. A court could reasonably conclude
that Columbia's infringement action was an objectively plausible effort to enforce rights. Accordingly, we conclude that
PRE failed to establish the objective prong of Noerr's sham
exception.

Finally, the Court of Appeals properly refused PRE's request for further discovery on the economic circumstances of
the underlying copyright litigation. As we have held, PRE
could not pierce Columbia's Noerr immunity without proof
that Columbia's infringement action was objectively baseless
or frivolous. Thus, the District Court had no occasion to
inquire whether Columbia was indifferent to the outcome on
the merits of the copyright suit, whether any damages for
infringement would be too low to justify Columbia's investment in the suit, or whether Columbia had decided to sue
primarily for the benefit of collateral injuries inflicted
through the use of legal process. Contra, Grip-Pak, Inc. v.

bia's economic motivations in bringing suit, which were rendered irrelevant by the objective legal reasonableness of the
litigation. The existence of probable cause eliminated any
"genuine issue as to any material fact," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
56(c), and summary judgment properly issued.

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

So ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring.
The Court holds today that a person cannot incur antitrust
liability merely by bringing a lawsuit as long as the suit is
not "objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits." Ante,
at 60. The Court assumes that the District Court and the
Court of Appeals were finding this very test satisfied when
they concluded that Columbia's suit against PRE for copyright infringement was supported by "probable cause," a
standard which, as the Court explains it in this case, requires
a "reasonabl[e] belie[f] that there is a chance that [a] claim
may be held valid upon adjudication." Ante, at 62-63 (internal quotation marks omitted). I agree that this term, so
defined, is rightly read as expressing the same test that the
Court announces today; the expectation of a reasonable litigant can be dubbed a "reasonable belief," and realistic expectation of success on the merits can be paraphrased as "a
chance of being held valid upon adjudication."

Having established this identity of meaning, however, the
Court proceeds to discuss the particular facts of this case,
not in terms of its own formulation of objective baselessness,
but in terms of "probable cause." Up to a point, this is understandable; the Court of Appeals used the term "probable
cause" to represent objective reasonableness, and it seems
natural to use the same term when reviewing that court's
conclusions. Yet as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 63,
since there is no dispute over the facts underlying the suit

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
at issue here, the question whether that suit was objectivelybaseless is purely one of law, which we are obliged to consider de novo. There is therefore no need to frame the ques-tion in the Court of Appeals's terms. Accordingly, I would
prefer to put the question in our own terms, and to concludesimply that, on the undisputed facts and the law as it stood
when Columbia filed its suit, a reasonable litigant could real-istically have expected success on the merits.

My preference stems from a concern that other courtscould read today's opinion as transplanting every substantive
nuance and procedural quirk of the common-law tort ofwrongful civil proceedings into federal antitrust law. I do
not understand the Court to mean anything of the sort, how-ever, any more than I understand its citation of Rule 11 of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see ante, at 65, to sig-nal the importation of every jot and tittle of the law of attorney sanctions. Rather, I take the Court's use of the term"probable cause" merely as shorthand for a reasonable litigant's realistic expectation of success on the merits, and onthat understanding, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in the judgment.
While I agree with the Court's disposition of this case andwith its holding that "an objectively reasonable effort to litigate cannot be sham regardless of subjective intent," ante,at 57, I write separately to disassociate myself from some of
the unnecessarily broad dicta in the Court's opinion. Specifi-cally, I disagree with the Court's equation of "objectively
baseless" with the answer to the question whether any "rea-sonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits." 1 There might well be lawsuits that fit the latter defi1 Ante, at 60. See also ante, at 62: "[S]ham litigation must constitute

nition but can be shown to be objectively unreasonable, andthus shams. It might not be objectively reasonable to bring

a lawsuit just because some form of success on the merits--no matter how insignificant--could be expected.

2 With that

possibility in mind, the Court should avoid an unnecessarilybroad holding that it might regret when confronted with a

more complicated case.

As the Court recently explained, a "sham" is the use of"the governmental

process--as opposed to the outcome of
that process--as an anticompetitive weapon." Columbia v.
Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365, 380 (1991).
The distinction between abusing the judicial process to re-strain competition and prosecuting a lawsuit that, if successful, will restrain competition must guide any court's decisionwhether a particular filing, or series of filings, is a sham.

The label "sham" is appropriately applied to a case, or series
of cases, in which the plaintiff is indifferent to the outcome
of the litigation itself, but has nevertheless sought to impose
a collateral harm on the defendant by, for example, impairing
his credit, abusing the discovery process, or interfering with
his access to governmental agencies. It might also apply to
a plaintiff who had some reason to expect success on the
merits but because of its tremendous cost would not bother
to achieve that result without the benefit of collateral injuoutcome, the suit is immunized under Noerr . . . ." But see ante, at 62:
"The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes
a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation."
And see ante, at 65: "Columbia's copyright action was arguably `warranted
by existing law' " under the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
11. These varied restatements of the Court's new test make it unclear
whether it is willing to affirm the Court of Appeals by any of these standards individually, or by all of them together.

2 The Court's recent decision in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992)

makes me wonder whether "10 years of litigation and two trips to the
Court of Appeals" to recover "one dollar from one defendant," id., at 116
(O'Connor, J., concurring), would qualify as a reasonable expectation of
"favorable relief" under today's opinion.

ries imposed on its competitor by the legal process alone.Litigation filed or pursued for such collateral purposes is fundamentally different from a case in which the relief soughtin the litigation itself would give the plaintiff a competitive
advantage or, perhaps, exclude a potential competitor from
entering a market with a product that either infringes theplaintiff 's patent or copyright or violates an exclusive franchise granted by a governmental body.The case before us today is in the latter, obviously legitimate, category. There was no unethical or other improperuse of the judicial system; instead, respondents invoked the
federal court's jurisdiction to determine whether they could
lawfully restrain competition with petitioners. The relief
they sought in their original action, if granted, would have
had the anticompetitive consequences authorized by federal
copyright law. Given that the original copyright infringement action was objectively reasonable--and the District
Court, the Court of Appeals, and this Court all agree that it
was--neither the respondents' own measure of their chances
of success nor an alleged goal of harming petitioners provides a sufficient basis for treating it as a sham. We may
presume that every litigant intends harm to his adversary;
moreover, uncertainty about the possible resolution of unsettled questions of law is characteristic of the adversary process. Access to the courts is far too precious a right for us to
infer wrongdoing from nothing more than using the judicial
process to seek a competitive advantage in a doubtful case.
Thus, the Court's disposition of this case is unquestionably
correct.

I am persuaded, however, that all, or virtually all, of the
Courts of Appeals that have reviewed similar claims (involving a single action seeking to enforce a property right) would
have reached the same conclusion. To an unnecessary degree, therefore, the Court has set up a straw man to justify
its elaboration of a two-part test describing all potential
shams. Of the 10 cases cited by the Court as evidence of

widespread confusion about the scope of the "sham" excep-tion to the doctrine of Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127 (1961), andMine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657 (1965), see ante,
at 55, n. 3, 5 share three important characteristics with thiscase: The alleged injury to competition was defined by the
prayer for relief in the antitrust defendant's original action;there was no unethical conduct or collateral harm "external
to the litigation or to the result reached in the litigation"; 3
and there had been no series of repetitive claims. Each ofthose courts concluded, as this Court does today, that allegations of subjective anticompetitive motivation do not makean otherwise reasonable lawsuit a sham.

4

In each of the five other cases cited by the Court, the plain-tiff alleged antitrust violations more extensive than the filing

of a single anticompetitive lawsuit. In three of those casesthe core of the alleged antitrust violation lay in the act of
petitioning the government for relief: One involved the repetitive filing of baseless administrative claims,5 another in3 Omni Resource Development Corp. v. Conoco, Inc., 739 F. 2d 1412,

volved extensive evidence of anticompetitive motivation be-hind the lawsuit that followed an elaborate and unsuccessful

lobbying effort,6 and in the third a collateral lawsuit was onlyone of the many ways in which the antitrust defendant had
allegedly tried to put the plaintiff out of business.7 In each
those claims had become objectively unreasonable supported a jury's sham
finding. AT&T's anticompetitive actions were in fact so far removed from
the act of petitioning the government for relief that Chief Judge Oakes
and Judge Meskill also held, in reliance on Continental Ore Co. v. Union
Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962), and Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579 (1976) (plurality opinion), that tariff filings with
the Federal Communications Commission were acts of private commercial
activity in the marketplace rather than requests for governmental action,
and thus were not even arguably protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Litton Systems, 700 F. 2d, at 806-809.

6 Westmac, Inc. v. Smith, 797 F. 2d 313 (CA6 1986), cert. denied, 479

U. S. 1035 (1987). Although the Sixth Circuit did hold that the genuine
substance of an anticompetitive lawsuit creates a rebuttable presumption
of objective reasonableness, given the facts of that case--in which the
antitrust plaintiff had presented strong evidence that the defendants'
lawsuit, which followed a long and unsuccessful lobbying effort, had been
motivated solely for the anticompetitive harm the judicial process would
inflict on it--that modest reservation was probably wise. Evidence of
anticompetitive animus in Westmac was in fact so great that Chief Judge
Merritt thought that the plaintiff had successfully rebutted the presumptive reasonableness of defendants' lawsuit. The delay from the defendants' combined lobbying and litigation attack had allegedly sent the
plaintiff into bankruptcy, and memos from one defendant to its attorney
had stated, " `If this [lobbying activity] doesn't succeed, start a lawsuit--
bonds won't sell,' " 797 F. 2d, at 318, and (in a statement repeated to a
codefendant), " `if nothing else, we'll delay sale of the bonds,' " id., at 322
(Merritt, C. J., dissenting) (emphasis omitted). In any event, the Sixth
Circuit rule--to the extent that it would apply in a case as simple as this
one--would result in the same conclusion we reach here.

conspiracy to lobby, boycott, and sue it (in state licensing boards, state
legislatures, the marketplace, and both state and federal courts) out of
existence. In spite of those allegations, the Court of Appeals found that

of these cases the court showed appropriate deference to ouropinions in Noerr and Pennington, in which we held that

the act of petitioning the government (usually in the form oflobbying) deserves especially broad protection from antitrust liability. The Court can point to nothing in these threeopinions that would require a different result here. The two
remaining cases--in which the Courts of Appeals did statethat a successful lawsuit could be a sham--did not involve
lobbying, but did contain much broader and more compli-cated allegations than petitioners presented below.

8 Like

the three opinions described above, these decisions shouldnot be expected to offer guidance, nor be blamed for spawning confusion, in a case alleging that the filing of a singlelawsuit violated the Sherman Act.

Even in this Court, more complicated cases, in which, forexample, the alleged competitive injury has involved something more than the threat of an adverse outcome in a single
the defendant's actions, which primarily consisted in lobbying for the abolition of plaintiff's mail-order prescription business, were immune under
Noerr-Pennington.

8 In Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F. 2d 466 (1982)

(Posner, J.), cert. denied, 461 U. S. 958 (1983), the antitrust defendant's
alleged violations of several provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts
included much more than the filing of a single lawsuit; they encompassed
a broad scheme of monopolizing the entire relevant market by: purchasing
patents; threatening to file many other, patently groundless lawsuits; acquiring a competitor; dividing markets; and filing a fraudulent patent application. In In re Burlington Northern, Inc., 822 F. 2d 518 (CA5 1987),
cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1007 (1988), the plaintiffs alleged, and produced
evidence to support their theory, that the defendant had filed suit solely
to cause them a delay of crippling expense, and the defendants had either
brought or unsuccessfully defended a succession of related lawsuits involving plaintiff's right to compete. In both of these cases the Courts of
Appeals ably attempted to balance strict enforcement of the antitrust laws
with possible abuses of the judicial process. That they permitted some
reliance on subjective motivation--as even we have done in cases alleging

lawsuit, have produced less definite rules. Repetitive fil-ings, some of which are successful and some unsuccessful,

may support an inference that the process is being misused.California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404
U. S. 508 (1972). In such a case, a rule that a single merito-rious action can never constitute a sham cannot be dispositive. Moreover, a simple rule may be hard to apply whenthere is evidence that the judicial process has been used as
part of a larger program to control a market and to interferewith a potential competitor's financing without any interest
in the outcome of the lawsuit itself, see Otter Tail Power Co.v.

United States, 410 U. S. 366, 379, n. 9 (1973); Westmac,
Inc. v. Smith, 797 F. 2d 313, 322 (CA6 1986) (Merritt, C. J.,dissenting). It is in more complex cases that courts have

required a more sophisticated analysis--one going beyond amere evaluation of the merits of a single claim.

In one such case Judge Posner made the following obser-vations about the subtle distinction between suing a competitor to get damages and filing a lawsuit only in the hope thatthe expense and burden of defending it will make the defendant abandon its competitive behavior:

"But we are not prepared to rule that the difficulty ofdistinguishing lawful from unlawful purpose in litigation

between competitors is so acute that such litigation cannever be considered an actionable restraint of trade, provided it has some, though perhaps only threadbare, basisin law. Many claims not wholly groundless would never
be sued on for their own sake; the stakes, discounted bythe probability of winning, would be too low to repay
the investment in litigation. Suppose a monopolistbrought a tort action against its single, tiny competitor;
the action had a colorable basis in law; but in fact themonopolist would never have brought the suit--its
chances of winning, or the damages it could hope to getif it did win, were too small compared to what it would
have to spend on the litigation--except that it wanted to

use pretrial discovery to discover its competitor's tradesecrets; or hoped that the competitor would be required

to make public disclosure of its potential liability in thesuit and that this disclosure would increase the interest
rate that the competitor had to pay for bank financing;
or just wanted to impose heavy legal costs on the com-petitor in the hope of deterring entry by other firms.

In these examples the plaintiff wants to hurt a competi-tor not by getting a judgment against him, which would
be a proper objective, but just by the maintenance ofthe suit, regardless of its outcome. See

City of Gainesville v. Florida Power & Light Co., 488 F. Supp. 1258,
1265-66 (S.D. Fla. 1980).

"Some students of antitrust law would regard all of
our examples of anticompetitive litigation as fanciful,
and in all the evidentiary problems of disentangling real
from professed motives would be acute. Concern with
the evidentiary problems may explain why some courts
hold that a single lawsuit cannot provide a basis for an
antitrust claim (see Fischel, Antitrust Liability for
Attempts to Influence Government Action: The Basis
and Limits of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 45
U. Chi. L. Rev. 80, 109-10 (1977))--an issue we need not
face here since three improper lawsuits are alleged, and
it can make no difference that they were not all against
Grip-Pak. Still, we think it is premature to hold that
litigation, unless malicious in the tort sense, can never
be actionable under the antitrust laws. The existence
of a tort of abuse of process shows that it has long been
thought that litigation could be used for improper purposes even when there is probable cause for the litigation; and if the improper purpose is to use litigation as
a tool for suppressing competition in its antitrust sense,
see, e. g., Products Liability Ins. Agency, Inc. v.

Crum & Forster Ins. Cos., 682 F. 2d 660, 663-64 (7th Cir.
1982), it becomes a matter of antitrust concern. This is

not to say that litigation is actionable under the anti-trust laws merely because the plaintiff is trying to get a

monopoly. He is entitled to pursue such a goal throughlawful means, including litigation against competitors.
The line is crossed when his purpose is not to win afavorable judgment against a competitor but to harass
him, and deter others, by the process itself--regardlessof outcome--of litigating. The difficulty of determining
the true purpose is great but no more so than in manyother areas of antitrust law."

Grip-Pak, Inc. v. IllinoisTool Works, Inc., 694 F. 2d 466, 472 (1982).

It is important to remember that the distinction between"sham" litigation and genuine litigation is not always, or only,
the difference between lawful and unlawful conduct; objec-tively reasonable lawsuits may still break the law. For example, a manufacturer's successful action enforcing resaleprice maintenance agreements,

9 restrictive provisions in a

license to use a patent or a trademark,10 or an equipmentlease,

11 may evidence, or even constitute, violations of the

antitrust laws. On the other hand, just because a sham law-suit has grievously harmed a competitor does not necessarily

mean that it has violated the Sherman Act. See Spectrum
Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U. S. 447, 455-459 (1993).The rare plaintiff who successfully proves a sham must still

satisfy the exacting elements of an antitrust demand. Seeante, at 61.

"objectively baseless," and why allegations of improper sub9 Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911);

UNITED STATES v. PADILLA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-207. Argued March 24, 1993--Decided May 3, 1993
Police arrested Luis Arciniega, after finding cocaine in a car he drove, and

subsequently arrested respondents, Donald Simpson--the car's owner--
his wife, and Xavier, Maria, and Jorge Padilla, charging them with, inter
alia, conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Respondents moved to suppress the evidence discovered during
the investigation, claiming that it was the fruit of an unlawful investigatory stop of the car. The District Court ruled that all respondents were
entitled to challenge the stop and search because they were involved in
a joint venture for transportation that had control of the contraband,
reasoning that the Simpsons retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car, and that the Padillas had supervisory roles and joint
control over the operation. It concluded that the police did not have
reasonable suspicion to make the stop and thus the evidence should be
suppressed. Applying its rule that a co-conspirator's participation in
an operation or arrangement that indicates joint control and supervision
of the place searched establishes standing to challenge the search, the
Court of Appeals affirmed as to the Simpsons and Xavier Padilla, and
remanded for further findings whether Jorge and Maria Padilla shared
any responsibility for the enterprise.

Held: The Court of Appeals' rule squarely contradicts this Court's rule

that a defendant can urge the suppression of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment only if that defendant demonstrates that
his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the challenged search
or seizure. See, e. g., Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 164, 171-172.
Expectations of privacy and property interests govern the analysis of
Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. Participants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectations or interests, but the conspiracy itself neither adds nor detracts from them. On remand, the court
must consider whether each respondent had either a property interest
that was interfered with by the stop of the car or a reasonable expectation of privacy that was invaded by the search thereof.

Per Curiam.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuithas adopted what it terms a "coconspirator exception" to the

rule regarding who may challenge the constitutionality ofa search or seizure. Under its reasoning, a co-conspirator
obtains a legitimate expectation of privacy for FourthAmendment purposes if he has either a supervisory role in
the conspiracy or joint control over the place or propertyinvolved in the search or seizure. This "exception," apparently developed in a series of earlier decisions of the Courtof Appeals, squarely contradicts the controlling case from
this Court. We therefore reject it.While patrolling Interstate Highway 10 in Casa Grande,
Arizona, Officer Russel Fifer spotted a Cadillac travelingwestbound at approximately 65 miles per hour. Fifer followed the Cadillac for several miles because he thought thedriver acted suspiciously as he passed the patrol car. Fifer
ultimately stopped the Cadillac because it was going tooslowly. Luis Arciniega, the driver and sole occupant of the
car, gave Fifer his driver's license and an insurance carddemonstrating that respondent Donald Simpson, a United
States customs agent, owned the Cadillac. Fifer and RobertWilliamson, an officer who appeared on the scene to assist
Fifer, believed that Arciniega matched the drug courier pro-file. Acting on this belief, they requested and received Arci*John Wesley Hall, Jr., filed a brief for the National Association of

niega's permission to search the vehicle. The officers found560 pounds of cocaine in the trunk and immediately arrested Arciniega.After agreeing to make a controlled delivery of the cocaine, Arciniega made a telephone call to his contact from
a motel in Tempe, Arizona. Respondents Jorge and MariaPadilla drove to the motel in response to the telephone call,

but were arrested as they attempted to drive away in theCadillac. Like Arciniega, Maria Padilla agreed to cooperate
with law enforcement officials. She led them to the house inwhich her husband, respondent Xavier Padilla, was staying.
The ensuing investigation linked Donald Simpson and hiswife, respondent Maria Sylvia Simpson, to Xavier Padilla.

Respondents were charged with conspiracy to distributeand possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of

21 U. S. C. $ 846, and possession of cocaine with intent to dis-tribute, in violation of $ 841(a)(1). Xavier Padilla was also
charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,
in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 848 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). Respondents moved to suppress all evidence discovered in the
course of the investigation, claiming that the evidence was
the fruit of the unlawful investigatory stop of Arciniega's vehicle. The United States District Court for the District of
Arizona ruled that all respondents were entitled to challenge
the stop and search because they were involved in "a joint
venture for transportation . . . that had control of the contraband." App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a. The District Court reasoned that, as owners, the Simpsons retained a reasonable

revealed that Warren Strubbe was also involved in the conspiracy. Although Strubbe technically is a respondent in this case, see this Court's
Rule 12.4, the Court of Appeals found that he could not challenge the stop
and search of the Cadillac. Strubbe did not file a petition challenging
that decision, and we therefore do not address that aspect of the court's
opinion.

Id., at 23a. On the merits, the District Court ruled thatOfficer Fifer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Arciniega,

and granted respondents' motion to suppress.The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part,

and remanded. The court began its analysis by stating thatin order "[t]o contest the legality of a search and seizure,
the defendants must establish that they had a `legitimateexpectation of privacy' in the place searched or the property
seized." 960 F. 2d 854, 858-859 (CA9 1992) (quoting Rakasv.

Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143-144 (1978)). The court thenrecited its co-conspirator rule: "[A] coconspirator's participation in an operation or arrangement that indicates joint con-trol and supervision of the place searched establishes standing." 960 F. 2d, at 859 (citations omitted).Relying on a line of cases from the Ninth Circuit, the court
held that "because Xavier Padilla and Donald and MariaSimpson have demonstrated joint control and supervision
over the drugs and vehicle and engaged in an active partici-pation in a formalized business arrangement, they have
standing to claim a legitimate expectation of privacy in theproperty searched and the items seized." Id., at 860-861.
Donald Simpson established an expectation of privacy "notsimply because [he] owned the car" but also because "he had
a coordinating and supervisory role in the operation. Hewas a critical player in the transportation scheme who was
essential in getting the drugs across the border." Id., at860. Maria Simpson established a privacy interest because
she "provided a communication link" between her husband,Xavier Padilla, and other members of the conspiracy, and
"held a supervisory role tying everyone together and over-seeing the entire operation."

Ibid. Xavier Padilla estab-lished an expectation of privacy because he "exhibited sub2 The Government did not challenge this finding on appeal and does not

stantial control and oversight with respect to the purchase[and] the transportation through Arizona."

Ibid. The
court expressly stated that it did not matter that Padilla wasnot present during the stop, or that he could not exclude

others from searching the Cadillac. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals could not tell from the recordwhether Jorge and Maria Padilla "shared any responsibility

for the enterprise," or whether they were "mere employeesin a family operation."

Id., at 861. As a result, the court
remanded to the District Court for further findings on thatissue.

The Ninth Circuit appears to stand alone in embracing the
"coconspirator exception." 3 We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 506 U. S. 952 (1992), and now reverse. It
has long been the rule that a defendant can urge the suppression of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment only if that defendant demonstrates that his Fourth
Amendment rights were violated by the challenged search or
seizure. Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 171-172
(1969); Rakas v. Illinois, supra, at 131, n. 1, 133-134; Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98, 106 (1980). We applied this
principle to the case of co-conspirators in Alderman, in
which we said:

"The established principle is that suppression of the
product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated

3 The First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and District of Columbia Circuits have declined to adopt an exception for co-conspirators or
codefendants. See United States v. Soule, 908 F. 2d 1032, 1036-1037 (CA1

In Rakas, supra, a police search of a car yielded a box ofrifle shells found in the glove compartment and a sawed-off
rifle found under the passenger seat. We held that petition-ers, who were passengers in the car and had no ownership
interest in the rifle shells or sawed-off rifle, and no legitimateexpectation of privacy in the area searched, had suffered no
invasion of their Fourth Amendment rights. See also Rawlings, supra; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62-64(1992) (decided since the Court of Appeals rendered its decision in the present case).The "coconspirator exception" developed by the Ninth Circuit is, therefore, not only contrary to the holding of Alderman, but at odds with the principle discussed above. Expec-tations of privacy and property interests govern the analysis

of Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. Partici-pants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectations
or interests, but the conspiracy itself neither adds to nor de-tracts from them. Neither the fact, for example, that Maria
Simpson was the "communication link" between her husbandand the others, nor the fact that Donald Simpson and Xavier
Padilla were in charge of transportation for the conspirators,has any bearing on their respective Fourth Amendment
rights.We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The case is remanded so that the court may considerwhether each respondent had either a property interest protected by the Fourth Amendment that was interfered withby the stop of the automobile driven by Arciniega, or a reasonable expectation of privacy that was invaded by thesearch thereof. Alderman, supra; Rakas, supra; Rawlings,
supra; Soldal, supra. It is so ordered.

CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. et al. v. MORTONINTERNATIONAL, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 92-114. Argued March 3, 1993--Decided May 17, 1993
Since its 1987 decisions in Vieau v. Japax, Inc., 823 F. 2d 1510, and Fonar

Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 821 F. 2d 627, the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from all
Federal District Courts in patent litigation, has followed the practice
of routinely vacating declaratory judgments regarding patent validity
following a determination of noninfringement of the patent. Adhering
to that practice in this and a similar case brought by respondent, the
Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts' findings that the particular
defendants had not infringed respondent's two patents on chemical compounds used in polyvinyl chloride, and then vacated the entry of judgments, on the defendants' counterclaims, declaring the patents invalid.
A third such case is still pending. Petitioners, the alleged infringers in
this case, sought certiorari on the ground that the Federal Circuit has
erred in applying a per se rule to what should be a discretionary matter.
Respondent did not oppose the grant of certiorari, but instead pointed
out that it also has an interest in having the validity issue adjudicated,
in that its patents have been effectively stripped of any power in the
marketplace by the Federal Circuit's refusals of substantive review on
the two invalidity findings.

Held: The Federal Circuit's affirmance of a finding that a patent has not

been infringed is not per se a sufficient reason for vacating a declaratory
judgment holding the patent invalid. Pp. 89-103.

(a) The Vieau and Fonar opinions indicate that the practice of vacating such declaratory judgments is limited to cases in which the Federal
Circuit is convinced that the finding of noninfringement has entirely
resolved the controversy between the litigants by resolving the initial
complaint brought by the patentee. The Federal Circuit has concluded
that in such cases the declaratory judgment is "moot" in a jurisdictional
sense, a conclusion that it considers dictated by this Court's earlier opinions in Electrical Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U. S. 241,
and Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U. S. 359. Pp. 89-92.

(b) While both Electrical Fittings and Altvater are consistent with
the Federal Circuit practice at issue, neither case required it. Electrical Fittings did not involve a declaratory judgment, and Altvater does

508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT
84 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.

Syllabus
not necessarily answer the question whether, in the absence of an ongoing infringement dispute between the parties, an invalidity adjudication
would be moot. Pp. 93-95.

(c) This case did not become moot when the Federal Circuit affirmed
the District Court's noninfringement finding. The practice at issue concerns the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. Where, as here, the District
Court has jurisdiction (established independently from its jurisdiction
over the patentee's infringement charge) to consider an invalidity counterclaim, so does the Federal Circuit, which is not a court of last resort
and is entitled to presume, absent further information, that federal jurisdiction continues. If, before the Federal Circuit had decided this
case, either party had advised it of a material change in circumstances
that entirely terminated their controversy, it would have been proper
either to dismiss the appeal or to vacate the District Court's entire judgment. In fact, however, there was no such change. The Federal Circuit's decision to rely on one of two possible alternative grounds (noninfringement rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power to decide the
second question, particularly when its decree was subject to review by
this Court. Even if it may be good practice to decide no more than is
necessary to determine an appeal, it is clear that the Federal Circuit
has jurisdiction to review the declaratory judgment of invalidity. Accordingly, the practice at issue is not supported by Article III's "case or
controversy" requirement. Pp. 95-98.

(d) The Federal Circuit's practice cannot be supported on other
grounds. Although the court's interest in the efficient management of
its docket might support a rule requiring that the infringement issue
always be addressed before validity, there are even more important
countervailing concerns, including the successful litigant's interest in
preserving the value of its hard-won declaratory judgment; the public's
strong interests in the finality of judgments in patent litigation and in
resolving validity questions; and the patentee's interests in having the
validity issue correctly adjudicated and in avoiding the loss of its patent's practical value that may be a consequence of routine vacatur. The
practice in question denies the patentee appellate review, prolongs the
life of invalid patents, encourages endless litigation (or at least uncertainty) over the validity of outstanding patents, and thereby vitiates the
rule announced in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of
Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313. Pp. 99-102.

(e) It would be an abuse of discretion not to decide the validity issue
in this case. Although factors in an unusual case might justify the Federal Circuit's refusal to reach the merits of a validity determination, and
that determination might therefore be appropriately vacated, neither
the finding of noninfringement alone, nor anything else in the record,

justifies such a result here. The patents at issue have been the subject
of three separate lawsuits, and both parties have asked the Federal Circuit to resolve their ongoing validity dispute. Pp. 102-103.

Opinion of the Court
United States District Court for the District of South Caro-lina alleging that petitioners, Cardinal Chemical Company

and its affiliates (Cardinal), had infringed those patents.Cardinal filed an answer denying infringement and a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that the patents are in-valid. While this case was pending in the District Court,
Morton filed two other actions against other alleged in-fringers of the same patents. One was filed in the Eastern
District of Louisiana, the other in the District of Delaware.The defendants in both cases, like Cardinal, filed counterclaims for declaratory judgments that the patents were in-valid. Of the three, the Louisiana case was tried first and,
in 1988, resulted in a judgment for the defendant finding noinfringement and declaring the patents invalid.

2 On appeal,

the Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of no infringementbut vacated the judgment of invalidity.

3 The Delaware case

is still pending.In 1990 this case proceeded to a 5-day bench trial. The

South Carolina District Court concluded, as had the Louisi-ana District Court, that the patentee had failed to prove infringement and that the defendant-counterclaimant hadproved by clear and convincing evidence that both patents
were invalid.4 Accordingly, the court mandated two sepa2 Morton Thiokol, Inc. v. Witco Chemical Corp., No. 84-5685 (ED La.,

not clearly erroneous and on that basis we affirm the portion of the judgment of the district court that determined that the patents are not infringed and dismissed the suit. We therefore find it unnecessary to reach
the district court's determination that the patents are invalid, and vacate
the portion of the judgment that so determined." 11 USPQ 2d, at 1153,

skilled in the art is unable to ascertain the claimed structures in order to
avoid infringement . . . . Therefore, this court concludes that the lan508us1$69I 02-13-97 13:58:53 PAGES OPINPGT

rate judgments: one dismissing the action for infringementwith prejudice, and another on the counterclaim, declaring

the patents invalid.5Again, Morton appealed to the Federal Circuit, challenging both the dismissal of its infringement claim and the judg-ment of invalidity. Cardinal filed a cross-appeal contending
that it was entitled to an award of fees pursuant to 35 U. S. C.$ 285 and that Morton should be sanctioned for prosecuting
a frivolous appeal. The defendant in the third, Delaware,case filed a brief

amicus curiae urging the court to affirmthe judgment of invalidity.

6 Again, however, after affirming

the dismissal of the infringement claim, the Federal Circuitvacated the declaratory judgment. It explained:

"Since we have affirmed the district court's holdingthat the patents at issue have not been infringed, we
need not address the question of validity. Vieau v.
Japax, Inc., 823 F. 2d 1510, 1517, 3 USPQ 2d 1094, 1100

Both parties then filed petitions for rehearing, arguingthat the court should have decided the validity issue instead
of vacating the District Court's declaratory judgment; 7 theyalso filed suggestions for rehearing en banc, urging the
Court of Appeals to reconsider its post-1987 practice of rou-tinely vacating a declaratory judgment of invalidity whenever noninfringement is found. Over the dissent of three ofits judges, the court declined those suggestions.

Vieau decision either legallyor as a `policy'. . . . The parties can now look only to the

Supreme Court for correction." 967 F. 2d 1571, 1578 (CAFed. 1992).

Cardinal filed a petition for certiorari asserting that theFederal Circuit errs in applying a

not oppose the grant of certiorari, but instead pointed outthat it also had an interest in having the validity issue adjudicated.9 It explained that, after the Federal Circuit had

9 Because both parties agree that we should reject the Federal Circuit's

practice, it might be thought that they lack the adversarial posture required by Article III. Although both Morton and Cardinal do agree on
the correct answer to the question presented, they do so only so that they
can reach their true dispute: the validity of Morton's two patents, a subject
on which they are in absolute disagreement. Further, it is clear that no
collusion between the parties has brought them here; if anything has
dulled the adverseness between them, it is the Federal Circuit practice
that is the subject of this case. Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 939

"If Morton were to proceed against another infringer,
the district court, in all likelihood would accept the
twice-vacated invalidity holdings, just as the district
court below adopted wholesale the [Louisiana] district
court's invalidity holdings, without any independent
evaluation as to whether those holdings were correct.
Further, any future accused infringer would, in all likelihood, argue for an award of attorney's fees as Cardinal
has done here, on the ground that Morton should have
known better than sue on an `invalid patent' . . . .

zero--effectively not enforceable and viewed with a
jaundiced eye by competitors and district courts alike.

Because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over
appeals from all United States District Courts in patent litigation, the rule that it applied in this case, and has been
applying regularly since its 1987 decision in Vieau v. Japax,
Inc., 823 F. 2d 1510, is a matter of special importance to the
entire Nation. We therefore granted certiorari. 506 U. S.

I

The Federal Circuit's current practice of routinely vacating declaratory judgments regarding patent validity following a determination of noninfringement originated in two

of whether Chadha should be deported). The Federal Circuit's improper
finding of mootness cannot itself moot this case.

Opinion of the Court
cases decided by different panels of that court on the sameday. In Vieau, the patentee had appealed adverse rulings

on damages, infringement, and validity and the alleged in-fringer had filed a cross-appeal asserting that the District
Court should have declared the patent invalid. After af-firming the District Court's finding of noninfringement, the
Federal Circuit concluded:

"Our disposition on the issue of infringement rendersmoot the appeal of the propriety of a directed verdict on

the issues of damages and willful infringement. Thereis no indication that Japax's cross-appeal on invalidity
extends beyond the litigated claims or the accused de-vices found to be noninfringing. Accordingly, we also
dismiss the cross-appeal as moot. The judgment en-tered by the district court with respect to each of the
mooted issues is therefore vacated. It is affirmed withrespect to infringement." 823 F. 2d, at 1517.

Judge Bennett filed a concurring opinion, fleshing out thisperfunctory holding and explaining that there was no need
to review the declaratory judgment of invalidity in the ab-sence of any "continuing dispute (such as the presence or
threat of further litigation) regarding other claims or otheraccused devices that remains unresolved by the finding of
noninfringement." 10In the second case, Fonar Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson,
821 F. 2d 627 (CA Fed. 1987), the District Court had heldthat the patent was not infringed and that the defendant10 Vieau, 823 F. 2d, at 1520. He added: "It is the burden of the party
seeking the declaratory judgment to illustrate, either in its briefs or at
oral argument, the continued existence of a case or controversy should a
decision of noninfringement be made by this court in deciding the appeal.
See International Medical Prosthetics, 787 F. 2d at 575, 229 USPQ at 281
(burden is on declaratory plaintiff to establish that jurisdiction existed at,
and has continued since, the time the complaint was filed). This requirement avoids having this court unnecessarily address what might turn out
to be a hypothetical situation." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
counterclaimant had failed to prove invalidity. On appeal,
the court affirmed the noninfringement holding, and vacated
the judgment on the counterclaim as moot. In his opinion
for the panel, Chief Judge Markey explained:

"There being no infringement by J & J of any asserted
claim, there remains no case or controversy between the
parties. We need not pass on the validity or enforceability of claims 1 and 2. . . . [C]f. Altvater v. Freeman,
319 U. S. 359, 363-65 . . . (1943) (`To hold a patent valid
if it is not infringed is to decide a hypothetical case,'
but a counterclaim for invalidity is not mooted where
counterclaim deals with additional patent claims and
devices not involved in the complaint and with license
issues.).. . . . .

"The judgment that J & J has not proven claims 1 and
2 invalid or unenforceable is vacated and the appeal from
that judgment is dismissed as moot." Id., at 634.

A footnote emphasized that there was no longer any dispute between the parties beyond the specific charge of infringement that had been resolved by the finding of noninfringement.11

The three opinions in Vieau and Fonar indicate that the
Federal Circuit's practice of vacating declaratory judgments
of patent validity (or invalidity) is limited to cases in which
the court is convinced that the finding of noninfringement
has entirely resolved the controversy between the litigants

11 "The record contains no assertion that J & J infringes the '832 patent
by any methods other than those found not to infringe, or that J & J's
machines infringe the nonasserted apparatus claims. J & J's counterclaim
merely repeated the affirmative defenses of invalidity and unenforceability
and the verdict form, with no objection by J & J, dealt only with the
asserted claims. J & J's motion for JNOV dealt only with claims 1 and
2." Fonar, 821 F. 2d, at 634, n. 2.

Opinion of the Court

II
In Electrical Fittings, the District Court held one claim
of a patent valid but not infringed.14 The patentee was content with that judgment, but the successful defendant appealed, seeking a reversal of the finding of validity. The
Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal based on the rule that
a prevailing party may not appeal from a judgment in its
favor. We reversed, and held that although the defendant
could not compel the appellate court to revisit the finding of
validity (which had become immaterial to the disposition of
the case), it could demand that the finding of validity be vacated. That finding, we explained, "stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated. We think the petitioners
were entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated,
and that the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, as we
have held this Court has, to entertain the appeal, not for the
purpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the reformation of the decree." Electrical Fittings, 307 U. S., at 242
(footnotes omitted).

Our command that the validity decision be eliminated was
similar to the Federal Circuit's mandate in the Fonar case
(both cases suggest that an appellate court should vacate
unnecessary decisions regarding patent validity), but the two
cases are critically different. The issue of invalidity in Electrical Fittings was raised only as an affirmative defense to
the charge that a presumptively valid patent had been infringed,15 not (as in Fonar, and as here) as a basis for a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity.
An unnecessary ruling on an affirmative defense is not the

14 "Instead of dismissing the bill without more, it entered a decree adjudicating claim 1 valid but dismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement." 307 U. S., at 242.

15 Under 35 U. S. C. $ 282, all patents are presumed valid. Although

that presumption is obviously resurrected after the Federal Circuit vacates a finding of invalidity, Morton's current situation makes clear that
the revived presumption lacks some of its earlier strength.

94 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.

Opinion of the Court
same as the necessary resolution of a counterclaim for a
declaratory judgment.

In Altvater, as here, the defendant did file a counterclaim
seeking a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid.
The District Court found no infringement, but also granted
the declaratory judgment requested by the defendant. The
Court of Appeals affirmed the noninfringement holding but,
reasoning that the validity issue was therefore moot, vacated
the declaratory judgment. We reversed. Distinguishing
our holding in Electrical Fittings, we wrote:

"To hold a patent valid if it is not infringed is to decide
a hypothetical case. But the situation in the present
case is quite different. We have here not only bill and
answer but a counterclaim. Though the decision of noninfringement disposes of the bill and answer, it does not
dispose of the counterclaim which raises the question
of validity. . . . [T]he issue of validity may be raised by
a counterclaim in an infringement suit. The requirements of case or controversy are of course no less strict
under the Declaratory Judgments Act (48 Stat. 955, 28
U. S. C. $ 400) than in case of other suits. But we are of
the view that the issues raised by the present counterclaim were justiciable and that the controversy between
the parties did not come to an end on the dismissal of
the bill for non-infringement, since their dispute went
beyond the single claim and the particular accused devices involved in that suit." 319 U. S., at 363-364 (footnotes omitted; citations omitted).

Presumably because we emphasized, in the last clause
quoted, the ongoing nature of the Altvater parties' dispute,
the Federal Circuit has assumed that a defendant's counterclaim under the Declaratory Judgment Act should always be

95Cite as: 508 U. S. 83 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
vacated unless the parties' dispute extends beyond the termsof the patentee's charge of infringement.

16

While both of our earlier cases are consistent with theFederal Circuit practice established in Vieau and Fonar, neither one required it. Electrical Fittings did not involve adeclaratory judgment, and

Altvater does not necessarily an-swer the question whether, in the absence of an ongoing dispute between the parties over infringement, an adjudicationof invalidity would be moot. We now turn to that question.

III
Under its current practice, the Federal Circuit uniformlydeclares that the issue of patent validity is "moot" if it affirms the District Court's finding of noninfringement and if,as in the usual case, the dispute between the parties does
not extend beyond the patentee's particular claim of infringe-ment. That practice, and the issue before us, therefore concern the jurisdiction of an intermediate appellate court--notthe jurisdiction of either a trial court or this Court. In the
trial court, of course, a party seeking a declaratory judgmenthas the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case
or controversy. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.227, 240-241 (1937).

17

In patent litigation, a party may satisfy that burden, andseek a declaratory judgment, even if the patentee has not

filed an infringement action. Judge Markey has described

"the sad and saddening scenario that led to enactmentof the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act), 28 U. S. C.

$ 2201. In the patent version of that scenario, a patentowner engages in a

danse macabre, brandishing a Dam16 See Vieau, 823 F. 2d, at 1518-1521 (Bennett, J., concurring); Fonar,
821 F. 2d, at 634, and n. 2.

17 As we have noted, the Declaratory Judgment Act affords the district

court some discretion in determining whether or not to exercise that jurisdiction, even when it has been established. See Brillhart v. Excess Ins.
Co. of America, 316 U. S. 491, 494-496 (1942).

Opinion of the Court
oclean threat with a sheathed sword. . . . Before the Act,competitors victimized by that tactic were rendered

helpless and immobile so long as the patent owner re-fused to grasp the nettle and sue. After the Act, those
competitors were no longer restricted to an in terroremchoice between the incurrence of a growing potential liability for patent infringement and abandonment of theirenterprises; they could clear the air by suing for a judgment that would settle the conflict of interests. Thesole requirement for jurisdiction under the Act is that
the conflict be real and immediate, i. e., that there be atrue, actual `controversy' required by the Act."

Arrowhead Industrial Water, Inc. v. Ecolochem, Inc., 846 F. 2d731, 734-735 (CA Fed. 1988) (citations omitted).

Merely the desire to avoid the threat of a "scarecrow" patent,in Learned Hand's phrase,

18 may therefore be sufficient to

establish jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act.If, in addition to that desire, a party has actually been

charged with infringement of the patent, there is, necessarily, a case or controversy adequate to support jurisdiction ofa complaint, or a counterclaim, under the Act. In this case,

therefore, it is perfectly clear that the District Court hadjurisdiction to entertain Cardinal's counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of invalidity.It is equally clear that the Federal Circuit, even after affirming the finding of noninfringement, had jurisdiction toconsider Morton's appeal from the declaratory judgment of
invalidity. A party seeking a declaratory judgment of inva-lidity presents a claim independent of the patentee's charge
of infringement. If the District Court has jurisdiction (es-tablished independently from its jurisdiction over the patentee's charge of infringement) to consider that claim, sodoes (barring any intervening events) the Federal Circuit.

Opinion of the Court
There are two independent bases for this conclusion.
First, the Federal Circuit is not a court of last resort. If
that court had jurisdiction while the case was pending before
it, the case remains alive (barring other changes) when it
comes to us. The Federal Circuit's determination that the
patents were not infringed is subject to review in this Court,
and if we reverse that determination, we are not prevented
from considering the question of validity merely because a
lower court thought it superfluous. As a matter of practice,
the possibility that we would grant certiorari simply to review that court's resolution of an infringement issue is extremely remote, but as a matter of law we could do so, and
if we did, we could also reach the declaratory judgment, as
long as the parties continued to dispute the issue of validity,
as they do here.19 As this case demonstrates, nothing prevents us, as a jurisdictional matter, from reviewing the Federal Circuit's disposition (even its vacatur) of the District
Court's resolution of the declaratory judgment counterclaim.

19 Commenting on Electrical Fittings, in Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank
v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 335 (1980), we wrote: "Although the Court limited
the appellate function to reformation of the decree, the holding relevant
to the instant case was that the federal courts retained jurisdiction over
the controversy notwithstanding the District Court's entry of judgment
in favor of petitioners. This Court had the question of mootness before
it, yet because policy considerations permitted an appeal from the District
Court's final judgment and because petitioners alleged a stake in the outcome, the case was still live and dismissal was not required by Art. III.
The Court perceived the distinction between the definitive mootness of a
case or controversy, which ousts the jurisdiction of the federal courts and
requires dismissal of the case, and a judgment in favor of a party at an
intermediate stage of litigation, which does not in all cases terminate the
right to appeal." See also 959 F. 2d, at 953 (Lourie, J., concurring) ("[B]ecause this court is not a court of last resort, a holding of either invalidity
or noninfringement by our court does not render the case moot because
it is not over. Therefore, when both infringement and validity issues
are presented on appeal, we can base our affirmance on both grounds,
thereby leaving a complete judgment available for review by the Supreme Court").

98 CARDINAL CHEMICAL CO. v. MORTON INT'L, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Second, while the initial burden of establishing the trialcourt's jurisdiction rests on the party invoking that jurisdiction, once that burden has been met courts are entitled topresume, absent further information, that jurisdiction continues. If a party to an appeal suggests that the contro-versy has, since the rendering of judgment below, become
moot, that party bears the burden of coming forward withthe subsequent events that have produced that alleged result. See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633(1953).

20 In this case Cardinal properly invoked the original

jurisdiction of the District Court, and Morton properly invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit.That court unquestionably had the power to decide all the

issues raised on Morton's appeal. If, before the court haddecided the case, either party had advised it of a material
change in circumstances that entirely terminated the party's
controversy, it would have been proper either to dismiss theappeal or to vacate the entire judgment of the District

Court. Cf. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36,39 (1950). In fact, however, there was no such change
in this case. The Federal Circuit's decision to rely onone of two possible alternative grounds (noninfringement
rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power to decidethe second question, particularly when its decree was subject to review by this Court. Even if it may be good practice to decide no more than is necessary to determine anappeal, it is clear that the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction to

review the declaratory judgment of invalidity. The case didnot become moot when that court affirmed the finding of
noninfringement.

20 To the extent that the Federal Circuit, relying on Judge Bennett's
concurrence in Vieau, see n. 10, infra, would have imposed the burden on
Cardinal to show that jurisdiction over its counterclaim, once established
in the District Court, continued to attach before the Court of Appeals, it
would therefore have been in error. Bearing the initial burden of establishing jurisdiction is different from establishing that it has disappeared.

IV
The Federal Circuit's practice is therefore neither compelled by our cases nor supported by the "case or contro-versy" requirement of Article III. Of course, its practice

might nevertheless be supported on other grounds. Thecourts of appeals have significant authority to fashion
rules to govern their own procedures. See, e. g., OrtegaRodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 244, 246, 249-250
(1993); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U. S. 140, 146-148 (1985). Justas we have adhered to a practice of deciding cases on statutory rather than constitutional grounds when both alternatives are available, see, e. g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.
Florida Gulf Coast Building and Construction Trades
Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), there might be a sufficient
reason always to address the infringement issue before passing on the patent's validity. If, for example, the validity issues were generally more difficult and time consuming to
resolve, the interest in the efficient management of the
court's docket might support such a rule.

Although it is often more difficult to determine whether a
patent is valid than whether it has been infringed, there are
even more important countervailing concerns. Perhaps the
most important is the interest of the successful litigant in
preserving the value of a declaratory judgment that, as Chief
Judge Nies noted, "it obtained on a valid counterclaim at
great effort and expense." 21 A company once charged with

21 967 F. 2d 1521, 1577 (CA Fed. 1992) (Nies, C. J., dissenting from denial
of rehearing en banc). As she added in a footnote: "Nor should we be
unmindful of the expense and effort of the district court. Judge Avern
Cohn of the Eastern District of Michigan (the Vieau trial judge) stated,
in a panel discussion at our most recent Judicial Conference: `I took six
months to write a JNOV, found the patent invalid and not infringed and
was very proud of my work product. And when I read that court of
appeals opinion and found that my finding of invalidity had been vacated,
there was no case or controversy, I was in a state of shock for ten minutes.'

Opinion of the Court
infringement must remain concerned about the risk of sim-ilar charges if it develops and markets similar products in

the future. Given that the burden of demonstrating thatchanged circumstances provide a basis for vacating the judgment of patent invalidity rests on the party that seeks suchaction, there is no reason why a successful litigant should
have any duty to disclose its future plans to justify retentionof the value of the judgment that it has obtained.

22

Moreover, our prior cases have identified a strong publicinterest in the finality of judgments in patent litigation. In

Sinclair & Carroll Co. v. Interchemical Corp., 325 U. S. 327(1945), we approved of the District Court's decision to consider the question of validity even though it had found thata patent had not been infringed. Criticizing the contrary
approach taken by other courts, we stated that "of the twoquestions, validity has the greater public importance, Cover
v. Schwartz, 133 F. 2d 541 [(CA2 1943)], and the DistrictCourt in this case followed what will usually be the better
practice by inquiring fully into the validity of this patent."Id., at 330.

We also emphasized the importance to the public at largeof resolving questions of patent validity in

Blonder-TongueLaboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S.

313 (1971). In that case we overruled Triplett v. Lowell,297 U. S. 638 (1936), which had held that a determination of
patent invalidity does not estop the patentee from relitigat-ing the issue in a later case brought against another alleged
infringer. We also commented at length on the wasteful
cial Conference of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit 65 (April 30, 1992)." Id., at 1577, n. 9.

22 Altvater cannot be read to require such a disclosure. In that case,

the counterclaimant was a licensee, and there was no question but that its
obligations to the patentee would continue unless the patent were found
invalid. Our holding did not depend on that fact, however, and we nowhere stated that a counterclaimant could seek the affirmance of a declaratory judgment only if it ensured that its future actions would continue to
violate the patentee's alleged rights.

consequences of relitigating the validity of a patent after ithas once been held invalid in a fair trial,

23 and we noted the

danger that the opportunity to relitigate might, as a practicalmatter, grant monopoly privileges to the holders of invalid

patents.24 As this case demonstrates, the Federal Circuit'spractice of routinely vacating judgments of validity after
finding noninfringement creates a similar potential for reliti-gation and imposes ongoing burdens on competitors who are
convinced that a patent has been correctly found invalid.Indeed, as Morton's current predicament illustrates, see
supra, at 89, the Federal Circuit's practice injures not only

23 "In any lawsuit where a defendant, because of the mutuality principle,
is forced to present a complete defense on the merits to a claim which the
plaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior action, there is an arguable
misallocation of resources. To the extent the defendant in the second suit
may not win by asserting, without contradiction, that the plaintiff had
fully and fairly, but unsuccessfully, litigated the same claim in the prior
suit, the defendant's time and money are diverted from alternative uses--
productive or otherwise--to relitigation of a decided issue. And, still assuming that the issue was resolved correctly in the first suit, there is
reason to be concerned about the plaintiff's allocation of resources. Permitting repeated litigation of the same issue as long as the supply of unrelated
defendants holds out reflects either the aura of the gaming table or `a lack
of discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the lower courts,
hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.' Kerotest

24 "In each successive suit the patentee enjoys the statutory presumption of validity, and so may easily put the alleged infringer to his expensive
proof. As a consequence, prospective defendants will often decide that
paying royalties under a license or other settlement is preferable to the
costly burden of challenging the patent." Id., at 338.

"The tendency of Triplett to multiply the opportunities for holders of
invalid patents to exact licensing agreements or other settlements from
alleged infringers must be considered in the context of other decisions of
this Court. Although recognizing the patent system's desirable stimulus
to invention, we have also viewed the patent as a monopoly which, although sanctioned by law, has the economic consequences attending other
monopolies. A patent yielding returns for a device that fails to meet the
congressionally imposed criteria of patentability is anomalous." Id., at

Opinion of the Court
the alleged infringer and the public; it also may unfairly de-prive the patentee itself of the appellate review that is a

component of the one full and fair opportunity to have thevalidity issue adjudicated correctly. If, following a finding
of noninfringement, a declaratory judgment on validity isroutinely vacated, whether it invalidated the patent (as in
Vieau) or upheld it (as in Fonar), the patentee may have lostthe practical value of a patent that should be enforceable
against different infringing devices. The Federal Circuit'spractice denies the patentee such appellate review, prolongs
the life of invalid patents, encourages endless litigation (orat least uncertainty) over the validity of outstanding patents, and thereby vitiates the rule announced in Blonder-Tongue.

25

In rejecting the Federal Circuit's practice we acknowledgethat factors in an unusual case might justify that court's refusal to reach the merits of a validity determination--a de-termination which it might therefore be appropriate to vacate. A finding of noninfringment alone, however, does notjustify such a result. Nor does anything else in the record
of this case. The two patents at issue here have been thesubject of three separate lawsuits, and both parties have

urged the Federal Circuit to resolve their ongoing disputeover the issue of validity; it would be an abuse of discretion

not to decide that question in this case. Accordingly, thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is
remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I agree that the Federal Circuit erred in holding that the
invalidity claim became moot once it was determined thatthe patent had not been infringed. Moreover, though the

Federal Circuit had discretion to reach (or not to reach) re-spondent's appeal of the declaratory judgment ruling, it was
an abuse of discretion to decline to reach it for that erroneous
"mootness" reason--constituting, in effect, a failure to exercise any discretion at all. I therefore join the judgment of
the Court, and all of its opinion except Part IV.

In Part IV the Court determines that, upon remand, the
Federal Circuit may not, "on other grounds," ante, at 99 (emphasis added), continue its practice of declining review in
these circumstances, set out in Vieau v. Japax, Inc., 823 F. 2d
1510 (1987). That point is much less tied to general principles of law with which I am familiar, and much more related
to the peculiarities of patent litigation, with which I deal
only sporadically. It need not be reached to decide this case,
and I am unwilling to reach it because of the lack of adversary presentation.

The lack of adversariness was frankly acknowledged at
oral argument. See, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 25, 37 ("On the
limited issue before this Court, where there is a declaratory
judgment held, we do not have any difference whatsoever").
Petitioners and respondent disagree only as to some hypothetical applications of the Federal Circuit's reviewing authority--applications clearly outside the facts of this case--

and are in utter agreement concerning the invalidity of the
Vieau practice. The briefs starkly reflect this uniformity:
Respondent's brief, in a mere 10 pages of argument, essen-tially incorporates by reference much of petitioners' brief,

which in turn largely reflects Chief Judge Nies' dissent from
the denial of en banc review below. Brief for Respondent8-9. (Not surprisingly, petitioners did not bother to file a

reply brief responding to their own echo.) Amici likewiseall weighed in on the single side in this case, one of them
even identifying its submission as "in support of petition-ers & respondents." Brief for Federal Circuit Bar Association as Amicus Curiae. While this harmony is heartwarming and even (since it reduces the number and length of
briefs) environmentally sound, it may encourage us to make
bad law.

In the past, when faced with a complete lack of adversariness, we have appointed an amicus to argue the unrepresented side. See, e. g., Toibb v. Radloff, 501 U. S. 157, 160,
n. 4 (1991); Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574,
585, n. 9, 599, n. 24 (1983); Granville-Smith v. GranvilleSmith, 349 U. S. 1, 4 (1955). Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.
919, 939-940 (1983). The wisdom of that course is shown by
Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 210 (1968). That
case, like this one, involved a Court of Appeals' refusal to
decide--the Third Circuit's determination that it lacked jurisdiction to review the INS's denial of petitioner's application for a stay of deportation. And in that case, as in this
one, both parties agreed that the Court of Appeals should
have decided the case. We appointed an amicus to defend
the judgment below, id., at 210, n. 9, and ended up affirming
the determination rejected by the parties.

I agree with the Court that the parties' total agreement
as to disposition of this case poses no constitutional barrier
to its resolution. Ante, at 88-89, n. 9. For prudential reasons, however, I would frame the resolution more narrowly.
I can say with confidence that the question of the validity of

Opinion of Scalia, J.
the patent is not moot, so that mootness was an impermissi-ble ground for failing to decide validity. It seems to me that

is enough for us to determine for the moment. If supposedmootness was in fact the only support for the Vieau policy,
the Federal Circuit will abandon it and we will never see theissue again. If, however, there is some other support, we
should hear about it from counsel before we reject the policyout of hand.

The issue of discretionary refusal (as opposed to the issueof mootness) is, it seems to me, more than usually deserving
of adversary presentation. It involves the practicalities ofthe Federal Circuit's specialized patent jurisdiction, rather
than matters of statutory or constitutional interpretationwith which we are familiar. The opinions of the Federal
Circuit do not discuss the practical benefits of the Vieaupractice, nor can we find them discussed in the opinions of
other courts, the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction over patentappeals being exclusive, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1295(a). One must
suspect, however, that some practical benefits exist, sincedespite the fragility of the "mootness" jurisdictional justification that we reject today, Vieau has enlisted the supportof the experienced judges on the Federal Circuit--who denied en banc review despite criticism of Vieau in Chief JudgeNies' opinion dissenting from the denial, 967 F. 2d 1571
(1992), and in Judge Lourie's panel concurrence, 959 F. 2d948, 952 (1992).

For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court,and join all of its opinion except Part IV.

Syllabus

McNEIL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 92-6033. Argued April 19, 1993--Decided May 17, 1993
Four months after petitioner McNeil, proceeding without counsel, filed this

Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit for money damages arising from
his alleged injury by the United States Public Health Service, he submitted a claim for such damages to the Department of Health and
Human Services, which promptly denied the claim. The District Court
subsequently dismissed McNeil's complaint as premature under an
FTCA provision, 28 U. S. C. $ 2675(a), which requires that a claimant
exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing suit. The Court
of Appeals affirmed, although decisions in other Circuits have permitted
a prematurely filed FTCA action to proceed if no substantial progress
has taken place in the litigation before the administrative remedies are
exhausted.

Held: An FTCA action may not be maintained when the claimant failed

to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit, but did so
before substantial progress was made in the litigation. Section
2675(a)'s unambiguous text--which commands that an "action shall not
be instituted . . . unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim
to the appropriate . . . agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency"--requires rejection of McNeil's contention that his
action was timely because it was commenced when he lodged his complaint with the District Court. The complaint was filed too early, since
McNeil's claim had not previously been presented to the Public Health
Service nor "finally denied" by that agency. Also unpersuasive is McNeil's argument that his action was timely because it should be viewed
as having been "instituted" on the date when his administrative claim
was denied. In its statutory context, the normal interpretation of the
word "institute" is synonymous with the words "begin" and "commence." The most natural reading of the statute indicates that Congress intended to require complete exhaustion of Executive remedies
before invocation of the judicial process. Moreover, given the clarity
of the statutory text, it is certainly not a "trap for the unwary."

Allen E. Shoenberger, by appointment of the Court, 507U. S. 906, argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.

William K. Kelley argued the cause for the United States.With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Bryson, Acting Assistant Attorney General Schiffer, Deputy
Solicitor General Mahoney, Mark B. Stern, and Henry D.Gabriel.*

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that an "ac-tion shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United

States for money damages" unless the claimant has first ex-hausted his administrative remedies.

1 The question presented is whether such an action may be maintained whenthe claimant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies

prior to filing suit, but did so before substantial progress wasmade in the litigation.

On March 6, 1989, petitioner, proceeding without counsel,lodged a complaint in the United States District Court for

"An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States
for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or
death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee
of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the
agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail. The failure of
an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is
filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a
final denial of the claim for purposes of this section."

3-7.Four months later, on July 7, 1989, petitioner submitted a
claim for damages to the Department of Health and HumanServices.

2 The Department denied the claim on July 21,

1989. On August 7, 1989, petitioner sent a letter to the Dis-trict Court enclosing a copy of the Department's denial of his

administrative claim and an affidavit in support of an earliermotion for appointment of counsel. Petitioner asked that
the court accept the letter "as a proper request, whereasplaintiff can properly commence his legal action accordingly."
Id., at 10.For reasons that are not entirely clear, the United States
was not served with a copy of petitioner's complaint untilJuly 30, 1990.

3 Id., at 2. On September 19, 1990, the

United States moved to dismiss the complaint on the groundthat petitioner's action was barred by the 6-month statute of

limitation.4 The motion was based on the assumption that

2 Petitioner sought damages of $500,000 in his administrative claim, not
the $20 million for which he prayed in his earlier federal court action.
Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2675(b), a claimant is barred from seeking in federal court "any sum in excess of the amount of the claim presented to the
federal agency." That is, had petitioner properly filed an action in district
court after his administrative claim was denied, he would have been limited in his recovery to $500,000.

3 Entries in the District Court docket indicate that plaintiff had previously filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, that later
in August he filed a motion for appointment of counsel, and that he ultimately paid a filing fee that caused the District Court to dismiss the
motion for leave to file in forma pauperis as moot. In all events, in
April 1990, the District Court ordered service to be effected by a United
States Marshal "because plaintiff is incarcerated and proceeding pro se."

Opinion of the Court
the complaint had been filed on April 15, 1990, when peti-tioner paid the court filing fees, and that that date was more

than six months after the denial of petitioner's administra-tive claim. In response to the motion, petitioner submitted
that the complaint was timely because his action had beencommenced on March 6, 1989, the date when he actually
lodged his complaint and the Clerk assigned it a docketnumber.

The District Court accepted March 6, 1989, as the opera-tive date of filing, but nonetheless granted the Government's
motion to dismiss. Petitioner's suit was not out of time, theDistrict Court reasoned, but, rather, premature. The court
concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain an action"commenced before satisfaction of the administrative exhaustion requirement under $ 2675(a)." Id., at 21.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.
The court explained:

"According to 28 U. S. C. $ 2401(b), a tort claim againstthe United States must be `begun within six months

after the date of mailing . . . of notice of final denial ofthe claim by the agency to which it was presented.'
The administrative denial was mailed on July 21, 1989,so McNeil had between then and January 21, 1990, to
begin his action. The complaint filed in March 1989 wastoo early. This left two options. Perhaps the document filed in March 1989 loitered on the docket, spring-ing into force when the agency acted. Or perhaps the
request for counsel in August 1989, during the six-monthperiod, marks the real `beginning' of the action. The
district court rejected both options, and McNeil, withthe assistance of counsel appointed by this court, renews
the arguments here.. . . . .

fresh suit within six months after July 21, 1989, heloses." 964 F. 2d 647, 648-649 (1992).

The court reviewed the materials filed in August 1989 andconcluded that the District Court had not committed plain
error in refusing to construe them as having commenced anew action.

Because decisions in other Circuits permit a prematurelyfiled FTCA action to proceed if no substantial progress has

taken place in the litigation before the administrative reme-dies are exhausted, see

resolve the conflict. 506 U. S. 1074 (1993).

II
As the case comes to us, we assume that the Court of Ap-peals correctly held that nothing done by petitioner after the

denial of his administrative claim on July 21, 1989, consti-tuted the commencement of a new action. The narrow question before us is whether his action was timely either be5 In dissent, Judge Ripple expressed the opinion that petitioner had
properly raised the issue in the District Court and on appeal, 964 F. 2d,
at 649, n. 1, and that in any event it was "clear that the plaintiff, a prisoner
proceeding pro se, attempted to refile the action after the denial of the
administrative claim." Id., at 649. Our grant of certiorari did not encompass the question whether a new action had been filed in August and
we therefore express no opinion as to the correctness of the Court of
Appeals' ruling on that issue.

6 Decisions in the Fifth and Ninth Circuits agree with the position taken

in the Seventh Circuit in this case. See Gregory v. Mitchell, 634 F. 2d
199, 204 (CA5 1981); Reynolds v. United States, 748 F. 2d 291, 292 (CA5

Opinion of the Court
cause it was commenced when he lodged his complaint with
the District Court on March 6, 1989, or because it should
be viewed as having been "instituted" on the date when his
administrative claim was denied.

The text of the statute requires rejection of the first possibility. The command that an "action shall not be instituted
. . . unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim
to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have
been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by
certified or registered mail" is unambiguous. We are not
free to rewrite the statutory text. As of March 6, 1989, petitioner had neither presented his claim to the Public Health
Service, nor had his claim been "finally denied" by that
agency. As the Court of Appeals held, petitioner's complaint was filed too early.

The statutory text does not speak with equal clarity to
the argument that petitioner's subsequent receipt of a formal
denial from the agency might be treated as the event that
"instituted" his action. Petitioner argues the word "instituted" that is used in $ 2675(a), see n. 1, supra, is not synonymous with the word "begun" in $ 2401(b), see n. 4, supra, or
with the word "commence" as used in certain other statutes
and rules. See, e. g., Hallstrom v. Tillamook County, 493
U. S. 20 (1989). He suggests that an action is not "instituted" until the occurrence of the events that are necessary
predicates to the invocation of the court's jurisdiction--
namely, the filing of his complaint and the formal denial of
the administrative claim. This construction, he argues, is
consistent with the underlying purpose of $ 2675(a): As long
as no substantial progress has been made in the litigation
by the time the claimant has exhausted his administrative
remedies, the federal agency will have had a fair opportunity to investigate and possibly settle the claim before the par508us1$70z 02-13-97 14:03:49 PAGES OPINPGT

ties must assume the burden of costly and time-consuminglitigation.

We find this argument unpersuasive. In its statutory con-text, we think the normal interpretation of the word "institute" is synonymous with the words "begin" and "com-mence." The most natural reading of the statute indicates
that Congress intended to require complete exhaustion ofExecutive remedies before invocation of the judicial process.
Every premature filing of an action under the FTCA imposessome burden on the judicial system

8 and on the Department

of Justice which must assume the defense of such actions.Although the burden may be slight in an individual case, the

statute governs the processing of a vast multitude of claims.The interest in orderly administration of this body of litigation is best served by adherence to the straightforward stat-utory command.

7 Prior to 1966, FTCA claimants had the option of filing suit in federal
court without first presenting their claims to the appropriate federal
agency. Moreover, federal agencies had only limited authority to settle
claims. See Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, ch. 753, $$ 403(a), 420, 60
Stat. 843, 845. Because the vast majority of claims ultimately were settled before trial, the Department of Justice proposed that Congress amend
the FTCA to "requir[e] all claims to be presented to the appropriate
agency for consideration and possible settlement before a court action
could be instituted. This procedure would make it possible for the claim
first to be considered by the agency whose employee's activity allegedly
caused the damage. That agency would have the best information concerning the activity which gave rise to the claim. Since it is the one
directly concerned, it can be expected that claims which are found to be
meritorious can be settled more quickly without the need for filing suit and
possible expensive and time-consuming litigation." S. Rep. No. 1327, 89th
Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1966).

The Senate Judiciary Committee further noted that "the improvements
contemplated by [the 1966 amendments] would not only benefit private
litigants, but would also be beneficial to the courts, the agencies, and the
Department of Justice itself." Id., at 2.

8 Even petitioner concedes that at least one objective of the 1966 amendments to the FTCA was to "reduce unnecessary congestion in the courts."

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, given the clarity of the statutory text, it is cer-tainly not a "trap for the unwary." It is no doubt true that

there are cases in which a litigant proceeding without coun-sel may make a fatal procedural error, but the risk that a
lawyer will be unable to understand the exhaustion require-ment is virtually nonexistent. Our rules of procedure are
based on the assumption that litigation is normally con-ducted by lawyers. While we have insisted that the pleadings prepared by prisoners who do not have access to counselbe liberally construed, see

Haines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519(1972); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 106 (1976),

9 and have

held that some procedural rules must give way because ofthe unique circumstance of incarceration, see Houston v.

Lack, 487 U. S. 266 (1988) (pro se prisoner's notice of appealdeemed filed at time of delivery to prison authorities), we
have never suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civillitigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by
those who proceed without counsel.10 As we have noted be-fore, "in the long run, experience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legisla-ture is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of
the law." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807, 826 (1980).The FTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federal
court until they have exhausted their administrative reme-dies. Because petitioner failed to heed that clear statutory
command, the District Court properly dismissed his suit.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

9 Again, the question whether the Court of Appeals should have liberally
construed petitioner's letter of August 7, 1989, as instituting a new action
is not before us. See n. 5, supra.

10 Indeed, we have previously recognized a systemic interest in having

a party represented by independent counsel even when the party is a
lawyer. See Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U. S. 432 (1991).

OKLAHOMA TAX COMMISSION v. SAC AND FOXNATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 92-259. Argued March 23, 1993--Decided May 17, 1993
Respondent Sac and Fox Nation (Tribe) is a federally recognized Indian

tribe located in Oklahoma. It brought this action seeking a permanent
injunction barring petitioner Oklahoma Tax Commission (Commission)
from, among other things, taxing the income of tribal members who
work or reside within tribal jurisdiction, and imposing the State's motor
vehicle excise tax and registration fees on tribal members who live and
garage their cars principally on tribal land and register those cars with
the Tribe. In large part, the Tribe based its claims of immunity from
those state taxes on McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411
U. S. 164, in which the Court held that a State could not subject a tribal
member living on the reservation, and whose income derived from reservation sources, to a state income tax absent an express authorization
from Congress. The Commission responded that the State had complete taxing jurisdiction over the Tribe because McClanahan and the
Court's other immunity cases applied only to tribes on established reservations, whereas the Tribe's 1891 Treaty with the Government disestablished the Sac and Fox Reservation in favor of allotments of trust land
for individual tribal members. In affirming the District Court's rulings
on cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court of Appeals held,
among other things, that the income of tribal members who work for
the Tribe was immune from state taxation under McClanahan and
Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,
498 U. S. 505. In so ruling, the court rejected the Commission's contention that the tribal member's residence was relevant in addition to the
status of the land on which the income was earned. The court also
concluded that the State's vehicle taxes were flatly prohibited under
Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville
Reservation, 447 U. S. 134.

Held: Absent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, it must be

presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members
who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory
consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent
Indian communities. Pp. 123-128.

Syllabus
(a) The Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it did not determine
the residence of the tribal members working for the Tribe. The residence of a tribal member is a significant component of the McClanahan
presumption against state taxing authority. Contrary to the Commission's contention, that presumption applies not only to formal reservations, but also to all "Indian country." Citizen Band of Potawatomi
Tribe of Okla., supra, at 511. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1151 broadly defines
the quoted phrase to include formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or
held in trust by the United States. If it is determined on remand that
the relevant tribal members do live in Indian country, the Court of Appeals must analyze the relevant treaties and federal statutes against the
backdrop of Indian sovereignty. Unless Congress expressly authorized
state tax jurisdiction in Indian country, the McClanahan presumption
counsels against finding such jurisdiction. Because all of the tribal
members earning income from the Tribe may live within Indian country,
this Court need not determine whether the Tribe's right to selfgovernance could operate independently of its territorial jurisdiction to
pre-empt the State's ability to tax income earned from work performed
for the Tribe itself when the employee does not reside in Indian country.
See, e. g., White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142.
Pp. 123-126.

(b) Oklahoma's vehicle excise tax and registration fees are no different than the state taxes the Court held pre-empted in Colville and Moe.
The Commission's argument that neither of those cases applies because
the Sac and Fox live on scattered allotments, rather than a reservation, fails for the same reasons it fails with regard to income taxes.
Pp. 126-128.

(c) Because the Court of Appeals did not determine whether the
tribal members on whom Oklahoma attempts to impose its income and
motor vehicle taxes live in Indian country, its judgment must be vacated. P. 128.

In this case, we consider whether the State of Oklahoma

I
The Sac and Fox Nation (Tribe) is a federally recognized
Indian tribe located in the State of Oklahoma. Until the
mid-18th century, the Tribe lived in the Great Lakes region
of the United States. M. Wright, A Guide to the Indian
Tribes of Oklahoma 225 (1951). In 1789, it entered into its
first treaty with the United States and ceded much of its
land. See Treaty at Fort Harmar, 7 Stat. 28. That was
only the first of many agreements between the Government
and the Tribe in which the Tribe surrendered its land and
moved elsewhere. As part of its gradual, treaty-imposed
migration, the Tribe stopped briefly along the Mississippi
and Missouri Rivers in what are now the States of Illinois,
Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska. Wright, Guide to Indian

Opinion of the Court
Tribes of Oklahoma, at 225-226. In the mid-19th century,the Sac and Fox Nation ceded land in several States for two

reservations in Kansas, but the Government eventuallyasked it to cede these as well. Id., at 226. In 1867, the Sac
and Fox Nation moved for the final time to the Sac and FoxReservation in Indian Territory.

Ibid.By the 1880's, however, white settlers increasingly clamored for the land the Sac and Fox and other tribes held inIndian Territory. In response, Congress passed two statutes that greatly affected the Tribe: the General AllotmentAct (Dawes Act), 24 Stat. 388, which provided for allotting
reservation land to individual tribal members and purchas-ing the surplus land for the use of white settlers; and the
Oklahoma Territory Organic Act, 26 Stat. 81, which estab-lished the Oklahoma Territory in what is now the western
half of the State of Oklahoma. This new Oklahoma Terri-tory included the Sac and Fox Nation's Reservation. In
June 1890, the Government and the Tribe concluded theirfinal treaty--a treaty designed to effectuate the provisions
of the Dawes Act. Congress ratified the treaty in 1891(hereinafter 1891 Treaty). Concerning the Tribe's cession
of land, the 1891 Treaty states:

"Article I. The said the Sac and Fox Nation herebycedes, conveys, transfers, surrenders and forever relinquishes to the United States of America, all their title,claim or interest, of every kind or character, in and to
the following described tract of land or country, in theIndian Territory, to-wit: [the Reservation land granted
the Tribe in the Treaty of 1867].. . . . .

"Provided however the quarter section of land onwhich is now located the Sac and Fox Agency shall not
pass to the United States by this cession, conveyance,transfer, surrender and relinquishment, but shall remain
the property of said Sac and Fox Nation, to the full ex-tent that it is now the property of said Nation--subject

Opinion of the Court
only to the rights of the United States therein, by reasonof said Agency being located thereon, and subject to the

rights, legal and equitable, of those persons that are nowlegally located thereon. . . . And the section of land now

designated and set apart near the Sac and Fox Agency,for a school and farm, shall not be subject either to allotment to an Indian or to homestead entry under the lawsof the United States--but shall remain as it now is and
kept for school and farming purposes, so long as saidSac and Fox Nation shall so use the same . . . ." 26
Stat. 750-751.
Under the 1891 Treaty, the Tribe retained the 800 acresdiscussed in the proviso. Each of the Tribe's members,

adults and minors, had the right to choose an allotment ofone quarter section (160 acres) within the boundaries of the
ceded land.Today, the Sac and Fox Nation has approximately 2,500
members. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. It has a fully functioningtribal government with its headquarters on the 800 acres
reserved to it under the 1891 Treaty. The United Statesrecognizes and encourages the Tribe's sovereign right to
self-governance within "the family of governments inthe federal constitutional system." Compact of SelfGovernance Between the Sac and Fox Nation and the UnitedStates of America 2 (June 26, 1991), see 25 U. S. C. $ 450f,
note. To this end, the Tribe has a Constitution and a Codeof Laws, as well as a court system in which to enforce them.
It employs approximately 140 to 150 people, most of whomare tribal members. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.

Among the Tribe's employees are the members of the Sacand Fox Tax Commission, which administers the Sac & Fox
tax code. The Tribe imposes a tribal earnings tax, seeSac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okla. Code of Laws, Tit. 14,
ch. 4, and a motor vehicle tax, see ch. 8. The earnings ofany employee employed within tribal jurisdiction, whether
or not that employee is a member of the Tribe, are subject

Opinion of the Court
to the earnings tax. Ch. 4, $ 402. The motor vehicle taxand registration provisions apply to "all motor vehicles

owned by a resident of, and principally garaged within thejurisdiction of the Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma." Ch. 8, $ 802.

The Oklahoma Tax Commission (Commission) also admin-isters income taxes and motor vehicle taxes and fees. Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 2351 et seq. (1981and Supp. 1990). All residents, and nonresidents of Oklahoma who receive income in the State, are subject to theOklahoma income tax. $$ 2362, 2368. Oklahoma contends
that the tax applies equally to members of Indian tribes and
to nonmembers. Thus, it claims that those residents of
Oklahoma who also reside within Sac and Fox jurisdiction
are subject to both state and tribal income taxes.

Pursuant to the Vehicle Excise Tax Act, Okla. Stat., Tit.
68, $ 2101 et seq. (1981 and Supp. 1990), the State levies an
excise tax, calculated as a percentage of a vehicle's value,
"upon the transfer of legal ownership of any vehicle registered in th[e] state and upon the use of any vehicle registered
in th[e] state." $ 2103(A). The Commission collects the tax
"at the time of the issuance of a certificate of title for any
such vehicle." Ibid. Finally, the Commission assesses a
vehicle registration fee for all vehicles registered with the
State of Oklahoma, see Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Okla. Stat., Tit. 47, $ 1101 et seq. (Supp. 1990), at
the annual rate of $15 plus a percentage of the value of the
car, $ 1132(A)(1). Like the vehicle excise tax, see Tit. 68,

$ 2102, the vehicle registration fees are to provide funds for
"general governmental functions," Tit. 47, $ 1103.

The Commission contends that tribal members must register their vehicles with the State, just as everyone else who
lives within Oklahoma must do. The Tribe, however, requires Sac and Fox tribal members who live and garage cars
within Sac and Fox territory to register those cars with the
Tribe and to use tribal license plates. Oklahoma considers

120 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATION

Opinion of the Court
all tribal members who register their vehicles with the Sac
and Fox Nation (and hence do not pay state excise and registration taxes) to be delinquent with regard to the state
taxes. Nevertheless, so long as a tribal member retains
ownership of a vehicle, the State makes no effort to collect
the allegedly delinquent taxes. If the tribal member sells
the car to a nonmember, however, and the nonmember then
"applies to the State for a title and license plate, the subsequent owner must bring up the title on the vehicle by paying
the current and delinquent excise taxes on the transfers of
the vehicle." App. 29. The subsequent owner also must
pay registration fees for the current year and registration
fees and penalties for one previous year. Ibid. In contrast,
the Commission issues transfer titles to vehicles previously
licensed in other States upon payment of current registration
fees without more. Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 2105(b) (Supp.
1990).

The Sac and Fox Nation brought this action on behalf of
itself and all residents of its territorial jurisdiction, App. 1,
seeking a permanent injunction barring the Commission
from taxing the income of people who earn their income
within Sac and Fox territory and of people who reside within
the Tribe's jurisdiction, id., at 8. The Tribe also sought relief from imposition of the State's vehicle excise tax and registration fees on vehicles "owned by residents of, and principally garaged within, the Sac and Fox jurisdiction" that
lawfully were registered with the Sac and Fox Nation.
Ibid. In large part, the Tribe based its arguments of immunity on our opinion in McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax
Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164 (1973), in which we held that a State
could not subject a tribal member living on the reservation
whose income derived from reservation sources to a state
income tax absent express authorization from Congress.
The Commission contended in response that neither
McClanahan nor any other of our cases discussing Indian

Opinion of the Court
sovereign immunity were relevant. The analysis in those
cases, the Commission argued, applied only to tribes on
established reservations. It reasoned that Oklahoma had
complete tax jurisdiction over the Sac and Fox, because the
1891 Treaty had disestablished the Sac and Fox Reservation.

The District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma
ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment. The court
declined to determine whether the reservation had been disestablished or its boundaries diminished. Instead, it held
that the Commission could levy and collect state income tax
on the income that nonmembers of the Tribe earned from
tribal employment on trust lands, but not on the income that
tribal members earned from tribal employment on trust
lands. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-10. The District Court did
not look to where the tribal members resided; it rested its
holding instead only on where they worked. The court also
held that the Commission could not require, as a prerequisite
to issuing an Oklahoma motor vehicle title, payment of excise
taxes and registration fees for the years a vehicle properly
had been licensed by the Tribe. Id., at A-11 to A-13.

Both parties appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 967 F. 2d 1425 (1992).
Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined to
determine the boundaries of the Sac and Fox Reservation.
The court read our opinion in McClanahan, supra, to stand
for the proposition that, absent express congressional authorization, state jurisdiction to tax "the income of a tribal
member earned solely on a reservation is presumed to be
preempted," 967 F. 2d, at 1428, and it rejected the State's
contention that the residence of the tribal member also was
relevant, id., at 1428, n. 3. Thus, the Court of Appeals
looked only to the status of the land on which the income
was earned--in this case, trust land. In light of Oklahoma
Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,
498 U. S. 505 (1991), the court concluded that for tribal immu508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
nity purposes there was no difference between trust landvalidly set apart for Indian use and reservation land. 967

F. 2d, at 1428. Hence, the income of tribal members whoworked for the Tribe on trust land was immune from state
taxation. Id., at 1428-1429. The income of nonmembers,
however, was not immune. Id., at 1429-1430.Turning to the vehicle taxes, the Court of Appeals found

that the excise tax was not enforced as a sales tax. Id.,at 1430. It rejected the Commission's contention that the
registration fee was imposed for the privilege of using stateroads because the State had offered no evidence to show the
registration fee was tailored to the amount of use outside
Indian country. Ibid. Relying on Moe v. Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425
U. S. 463 (1976), and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of
Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980), the court held
that the taxes were "flatly prohibited." 967 F. 2d, at 1430.
Although the taxes were imposed only indirectly on tribal
members, the court would "not permit the State to tax indirectly what it cannot tax directly." Ibid. As with the income taxes, the Court of Appeals rejected the Tribe's argument that vehicles registered with the Tribe by nonmembers
also should be immune from state taxation. Id., at 1430-
1431. Both parties petitioned for certiorari.

Soon after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, the
Wisconsin Supreme Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that McClanahan's presumption in favor of tax immunity was limited to those instances in which a tribal member both lived on and earned a living on the reservation.
Anderson v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 169 Wis. 2d 255,
484 N. W. 2d 914 (1992). Thus, it declined to find state tax
immunity for the wages of a tribal member who worked for
the tribe on the reservation but who did not live on the
reservation. Id., at 274-276, 484 N. W. 2d, at 921-922.
We granted the Oklahoma Tax Commission's petition for
certiorari. 506 U. S. 971 (1992).

Opinion of the Court

II

A

In McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S.
164 (1973), we held that a State was without jurisdiction to
subject a tribal member living on the reservation, and whose
income derived from reservation sources, to a state income
tax absent an express authorization from Congress. The
Commission contends that the McClanahan presumption
against jurisdiction comes into effect only when the income
is earned from reservation sources by a tribal member residing on the reservation. Under the Commission's reading of
McClanahan, the District Court erred in not determining
whether the Sac and Fox Reservation has been disestablished or reduced because unless the members of the Sac and
Fox Nation live on a reservation the State has jurisdiction
to tax their earnings and their vehicles. The Commission
is partially correct: The residence of a tribal member is
a significant component of the McClanahan presumption
against state tax jurisdiction. But our cases make clear that
a tribal member need not live on a formal reservation to be
outside the State's taxing jurisdiction; it is enough that the
member live in "Indian country." Congress has defined Indian country broadly to include formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments,
whether restricted or held in trust by the United States.
See 18 U. S. C. $ 1151.

Our decision in McClanahan relied heavily on the doctrine
of tribal sovereignty. We found a "deeply rooted" policy in
our Nation's history of "leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control." 411 U. S., at 168 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Indian nations, we noted, long have been
" `distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive.' " Ibid.
(quoting Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 557 (1832) (Marshall, C. J.)). The Indian sovereignty doctrine, which histor508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT
124 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATION

Opinion of the Court
ically gave state law "no role to play" within a tribe's territo-rial boundaries, 411 U. S., at 168, did not provide "a definitive

resolution of the issues," but it did "provid[e] a backdropagainst which the applicable treaties and federal statutes
must be read," id., at 172. Accord, Colville, supra, at 178-
179 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, concurring in resultin part, and dissenting in part). Although "exemptions from

tax laws should, as a general rule, be clearly expressed,"
McClanahan, 411 U. S., at 176, the tradition of Indian sovereignty requires that the rule be reversed when a State at-tempts to assert tax jurisdiction over an Indian tribe or

tribal members living and working on land set aside for
those members.

To determine whether a tribal member is exempt from
state income taxes under McClanahan, a court first must
determine the residence of that tribal member. To the extent that the Court of Appeals ruled without such a reference, it erred. The Commission, however, contends that the
relevant boundary for taxing jurisdiction is the perimeter of
a formal reservation, not merely land set aside for a tribe or
its members. In the Commission's view, Indian sovereignty
serves as a "backdrop" only for those tribal members who
live on the reservation, and all others fall outside McClanahan's presumption against taxation. It is true that we
began our discussion in McClanahan by emphasizing that
we were not "dealing with Indians who have left or never
inhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use or
who do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal selfgovernment." Id., at 167-168. Here, in contrast, some of
the Tribe's members may not live within a reservation; indeed, if the Commission's interpretation of the 1891 Treaty
is correct and the reservation was disestablished, none do.

Nonetheless, in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of
Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., we rejected precisely the same
argument--and from precisely the same litigant. There the
Commission contended that even if the State did not have

125Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction to tax cigarette sales to tribal members on thereservation, it had jurisdiction to tax sales by a tribal convenience store located outside the reservation on land heldin trust for the Potawatomi. 498 U. S., at 511. We noted
that we have never drawn the distinction Oklahoma urged.
Instead, we ask only whether the land is Indian country.
Ibid. Accord, F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law
34 (1982 ed.) ("[T]he intent of Congress, as elucidated by [Su-preme Court] decisions, was to designate as Indian country

all lands set aside by whatever means for the residence oftribal Indians under federal protection, together with trust
and restricted Indian allotments"); Ahboah v. Housing Authority of Kiowa Tribe of Indians, 660 P. 2d 625, 629 (Okla.
1983) (same).

Additional congressional enactments support our conclusion that the McClanahan presumption against state taxing
authority applies to all Indian country, and not just formal
reservations. Under Pub. L. 280, 67 Stat. 588, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1360 (Pub. L. 280), Congress required some States to assume, and gave other States, including Oklahoma, see Ahboah, supra, at 630, the option of assuming, criminal and civil
jurisdiction "in the areas of Indian country situated within
such State." 25 U. S. C. $$ 1321(a), 1322(a) (emphasis added).
Congress amended Pub. L. 280 with the Indian Civil Rights
Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 78-80, and among other
changes, added a requirement that the tribes involved consent before a State can assume jurisdiction over Indian country. Oklahoma did not assume jurisdiction pursuant to
Pub. L. 280 prior to the law's amendment in 1968, see Ahboah, supra, at 630-632, and the Commission does not contend that the members of the Sac and Fox Nation have consented to an assumption of jurisdiction since the amendment.
We noted in McClanahan that the "absence of either civil or
criminal jurisdiction would seem to dispose of " any contention that the State has jurisdiction to tax. 411 U. S., at
178-179.

126 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATION

Opinion of the Court
On remand, it must be determined whether the relevanttribal members live in Indian country--whether the land is

within reservation boundaries, on allotted lands, or in de-pendent communities. If the tribal members do live in Indian country, our cases require the court to analyze therelevant treaties and federal statutes against the backdrop
of Indian sovereignty. Unless Congress expressly author-ized tax jurisdiction in Indian country, the

McClanahanpresumption counsels against finding such jurisdiction. Because all of the tribal members earning income from theTribe may live within Indian country, we need not determine
whether the Tribe's right to self-governance could operateindependently of its territorial jurisdiction to pre-empt the
State's ability to tax income earned from work performedfor the Tribe itself when the employee does not reside in
Indian country. See, e. g., White Mountain Apache Tribe v.
Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142 (1980) (citing Williams v. Lee, 358U. S. 217, 220 (1959)).

B
The Commission also argues that the Court of Appealserred in holding that the State could not impose state motor

vehicle taxes on tribal members who live on tribal land, ga-rage their cars principally on tribal land, and register their
vehicles with the Tribe. It contends that because the vehi-cle excise tax is paid only when a vehicle is sold, it "resembles a sales tax" on transactions that occur outside Indiancountry. Brief for Petitioner 21. It also contends that the
registration fee is not pre-empted because it is imposed onall vehicles that use state roads. Id., at 23. The Court of
Appeals found that the vehicle excise tax "is not enforced asa sales tax against Sac and Fox purchasers," 967 F. 2d, at
1430, and by its terms, the tax is imposed on both the trans-fer and the use of any vehicle in the State. Okla. Stat., Tit.
68, $ 2103 (Supp. 1990). Furthermore, the taxes are not im-posed on

all vehicles using the roads in Oklahoma. Resi-dents of nearby States pay neither the excise tax nor the

Opinion of the Court
registration fee. See Okla. Stat., Tit. 47, $ 1125(C) (Supp.
1990) (exempting "visiting nonresident[s]" from registration
and hence from payment of both taxes).

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the excise tax
and registration fees strongly resemble the taxes that we
held pre-empted in Washington v. Confederated Tribes of
Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980). Prior to Colville, we held in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai
Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463 (1976), that
Montana could not apply its personal property tax to motor
vehicles owned by tribal members who lived on the reservation. Id., at 480-481. To avoid the Moe holding, in Colville
Washington described its motor vehicle taxes as "excise
tax[es] for the `privilege' of using the covered vehicle in
the State." Colville, supra, at 162. Although Washington
called its taxes "excise taxes," those taxes, like the taxes we
held pre-empted in Moe, were "assessed annually at a certain
percentage of fair market value" of the vehicle, and the State
sought to impose them "upon vehicles owned by the Tribe or
its members and used both on and off the reservation." 447
U. S., at 162. In Colville, we rejected Washington's distinction of Moe because the only difference between the Washington taxes and the Montana taxes was their names. 447
U. S., at 163. We did "not think Moe and McClanahan
c[ould] be this easily circumvented. While Washington may
well be free to levy a tax on the use outside the reservation
of Indian-owned vehicles, it may not under that rubric accomplish what Moe held was prohibited." Ibid.

Oklahoma's taxes are no different than those in Moe and
Colville. Like the taxes in both those cases, the excise tax
and registration fee are imposed in addition to a sales tax;
the two taxes are imposed for use both on and off Indian
country; and the registration fees are assessed annually
based on a percentage of the value of the vehicle. Oklahoma
may not avoid our precedent by avoiding the name "personal

property tax" here any more than Washington could inColville.

The Commission, however, argues that Oklahoma's taxesare different for yet another reason. It claims that because
the Sac and Fox live on scattered allotments, and not on areservation, neither

Moe nor Colville applies. That argu-ment fails for the same reasons it fails with regard to income

taxes. See supra, at 123-126. Tribal members who live inIndian country consisting solely of scattered allotments
likely use their cars more frequently on state land and lessfrequently within Indian country than tribal members who
live on an established reservation. Nevertheless, membersof the Sac and Fox Nation undeniably use their vehicles
within Indian country. As we said in Colville, had the State"tailored its tax to the amount of actual off-[Indian country]
use, or otherwise varied something more than mere nomen-clature, this might be a different case. But it has not done
so, and we decline to treat the case as if it had." 447 U. S.,at 163-164.

III
Absent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, wepresume against a State's having the jurisdiction to tax

within Indian country, whether the particular territory con-sists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or
dependent Indian communities. Because the Court of Ap-peals did not determine whether the tribal members on
whom Oklahoma attempts to impose its income and motorvehicle taxes live in Indian country, its judgment is vacated.
We remand this case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

129OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

DEAL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-8199. Argued March 1, 1993--Decided May 17, 1993
On the basis of his use of a gun in committing six bank robberies on different dates, petitioner Deal was convicted, in a single proceeding, of six
counts of carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a crime
of violence in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). Section 924(c)(1) prescribes a 5-year prison term for the first such conviction (in addition to
the punishment provided for the crime of violence) and requires a 20-
year sentence "[i]n the case of [a] second or subsequent conviction under
this subsection." The District Court sentenced Deal to 5 years' imprisonment on the first $ 924(c)(1) count and to 20 years on each of the five
other counts, the terms to run consecutively. The Court of Appeals
affirmed.

Held: Deal's second through sixth convictions in a single proceeding arose

"[i]n the case of his second or subsequent conviction" within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1). There is no merit to his contention that the language
of $ 924(c)(1) is facially ambiguous and should therefore be construed in
his favor under the rule of lenity. In context, "conviction" unambiguously refers to the finding of guilt that necessarily precedes the entry
of a final judgment of conviction. If it referred, as Deal contends, to
"judgment of conviction," which by definition includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence, the provision would be incoherent, prescribing that a sentence which has already been imposed shall be 5 or
20 years longer than it was. Deal's reading would have the strange
consequence of giving a prosecutor unreviewable discretion either to
impose or to waive the enhanced sentence by opting to charge and try
a defendant either in separate prosecutions or under a single multicount
indictment. The provision also cannot be read to impose an enhanced
sentence only for an offense committed after a previous sentence has
become final. While lower courts have held that statutes providing enhancement for "subsequent offenses" apply only when a second offense
has been committed after conviction for the first, those decisions depend
on the fact that it cannot legally be known that an "offense" has been
committed until there has been a conviction. The present statute does
not use the term "offense," and so does not require a criminal act after
the first conviction; it merely requires a conviction after the first conviction. Nor is the rule of lenity called for on grounds that the total length

Opinion of the Court
of Deal's sentence (105 years) is "glaringly unjust." Under any conceivable reading of $ 924(c)(1), some criminals convicted of six armed bank
robberies would receive a sentence of that length. It is not "glaringly
unjust" to refuse to give Deal a lesser sentence merely because he escaped apprehension and conviction until the sixth crime had been committed. Pp. 131-137.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Between January and April 1990, petitioner committed six
bank robberies on six different dates in the Houston, Texas,area. In each robbery, he used a gun. Petitioner was convicted of six counts of bank robbery, 18 U. S. C. $$ 2113(a)
and (d), six counts of carrying and using a firearm during
and in relation to a crime of violence, $ 924(c), and one count
of being a felon in possession of firearms, $ 922(g). Title 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. III) provides:

"Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence . . . uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to
the punishment provided for such crime of violence . . . ,
be sentenced to imprisonment for five years . . . . In
the case of his second or subsequent conviction under
this subsection, such person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years . . . ."

Opinion of the Court
The United States District Court for the Southern Districtof Texas sentenced petitioner to 5 years' imprisonment on

the first $ 924(c)(1) count and to 20 years on each of the otherfive $ 924(c)(1) counts, the terms to run consecutively. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed
the convictions and sentence. 954 F. 2d 262 (1992). Wegranted certiorari on the question whether petitioner's second through sixth convictions under $ 924(c)(1) in this singleproceeding arose "[i]n the case of his second or subsequent
conviction" within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1). 506 U. S. 814(1992).

Petitioner contends that the language of $ 924(c)(1) is facially ambiguous, and should therefore be construed in his
favor pursuant to the rule of lenity. His principal argument
in this regard is that the word "conviction" can, according to
the dictionary, have two meanings, "either the return of a
jury verdict of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on that
verdict," Brief for Petitioner 4; and that the phrase "second
or subsequent conviction" could therefore "mean `an additional finding of guilt rendered at any time' " (which would
include petitioner's convictions on the second through sixth
counts in the single proceeding here) or " `a judgment of conviction entered at a later time,' " (which would not include
those convictions, since the District Court entered only a
single judgment on all of the counts), id., at 7.

It is certainly correct that the word "conviction" can mean
either the finding of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on
that finding. The word has many other meanings as well,
including "[a]ct of convincing of error, or of compelling the
admission of a truth"; "[s]tate of being convinced; esp., state
of being convicted of sin, or by one's conscience"; "[a] strong
persuasion or belief; as, to live up to one's convictions; an
intensity of thorough conviction." Webster's New International Dictionary 584 (2d ed. 1950). But of course susceptibility of all of these meanings does not render the word "conviction," whenever it is used, ambiguous; all but one of the

508us1$72K 02-14-97 20:00:03 PAGES OPINPGT
132 DEAL v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context. There is notthe slightest doubt, for example, that $ 924(c)(1), which deals

with punishment in this world rather than the next, does notuse "conviction" to mean the state of being convicted of sin.
Petitioner's contention overlooks, we think, this fundamental
principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of languageitself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in

isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it isused. See

King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221
(1991); Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803,809 (1989);

United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984).
In the context of $ 924(c)(1), we think it unambiguous that
"conviction" refers to the finding of guilt by a judge or jury
that necessarily precedes the entry of a final judgment of
conviction. A judgment of conviction includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence. See Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 32(b)(1) ("A judgment of conviction shall set forth the
plea, the verdict or findings, and the adjudication and sentence" (emphasis added)); see also Black's Law Dictionary
843 (6th ed. 1990) (quoting Rule 32(b)(1) in defining "judgment of conviction"). Thus, if "conviction" in $ 924(c)(1)
meant "judgment of conviction," the provision would be incoherent, prescribing that a sentence which has already been
imposed (the defendant's second or subsequent "conviction")
shall be 5 or 20 years longer than it was.

Petitioner contends that this absurd result is avoided by
the "[i]n the case of " language at the beginning of the provision. He maintains that a case is the "case of [a defendant's]
second or subsequent" entry of judgment of conviction even
before the court has entered that judgment of conviction and
even before the court has imposed the sentence that is the
prerequisite to the entry of judgment of conviction. We
think not. If "conviction" meant "entry of judgment of conviction," a "case" would surely not be the "case of his second
or subsequent conviction" until that judgment of conviction
was entered, by which time a lower sentence than that which

Opinion of the Court

$ 924(c)(1) requires would already have been imposed. Andmore fundamentally still, petitioner's contention displays

once again the regrettable penchant for construing words inisolation. The word "case" can assuredly refer to a legal
proceeding, and if the phrase "in the case of " is followed by
a name, such as "Marbury v. Madison," that is the apparentmeaning. When followed by an act or event, however, "in

the case of " normally means "in the event of "--and we thinkthat is its meaning here.

The sentence of $ 924(c)(1) that immediately follows theone at issue here confirms our reading of the term "conviction." That sentence provides: "Notwithstanding anyother provision of law, the court shall not place on probation
or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection." That provision, like the one beforeus in this case, is obviously meant to control the terms of

a sentence yet to be imposed. But if we give the term
"convicted" a meaning similar to what petitioner contends
is meant by "conviction"--as connoting, that is, the entry of
judgment, which includes sentence--we once again confront
a situation in which the prescription of the terms of a sentence cannot be effective until it is too late, i. e., until after
the sentence has already been pronounced.1

We are also confirmed in our conclusion by the recognition
that petitioner's reading would give a prosecutor unreviewable discretion either to impose or to waive the enhanced
sentencing provisions of $ 924(c)(1) by opting to charge and
try the defendant either in separate prosecutions or under
a multicount indictment. Although the present prosecution

1 Petitioner also argues that the terms "second" and "subsequent" admit
of at least two meanings--next in time and next in order or succession.
That ambiguity is worth pursuing if "conviction" means "judgment," since
a judgment entered once-in-time can (as here) include multiple counts.
The point becomes irrelevant, however, when "conviction" means (as we
hold) a finding of guilt. Unlike a judgment on several counts, findings of
guilt on several counts are necessarily arrived at successively in time.

Opinion of the Court
would not have permitted enhanced sentencing, if the same
charges had been divided into six separate prosecutions for
the six separate bank robberies, enhanced sentencing would
clearly have been required. We are not disposed to give the
statute a meaning that produces such strange consequences.2

The dissent contends that $ 924(c)(1) must be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an offense committed
after a previous sentence has become final. Though this interpretation was not mentioned in petitioner's briefs, and
was put forward only as a fallback position in petitioner's
oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, the dissent thinks it
so "obvious," post, at 142, that our rejection of it constitutes
a triumph of "textualism" over "common sense," post, at 146,
and the result of "an elaborate exercise in sentence parsing,"
ibid. We note, to begin with, that most of the textual distinctions made in this opinion--all of them up to this point--
respond to the elaborate principal argument of petitioner
that "conviction" means "entry of judgment." It takes not
much "sentence parsing" to reject the quite different argument of the dissent that the terms "subsequent offense" and
"second or subsequent conviction" mean exactly the same
thing, so that "second conviction" means "first offense after
an earlier conviction."

No one can disagree with the dissent's assertion that "Congress sometimes uses slightly different language to convey
the same message," post, at 137--but when it does so it uses
"slightly different language" that means the same thing.
"Member of the House" instead of "Representative," for

2 The dissent contends that even under our reading of the statute,
"prosecutors will continue to enjoy considerable discretion in deciding how
many $ 924(c) offenses to charge in relation to a criminal transaction or
series of transactions." Post, at 145. That discretion, however, pertains
to the prosecutor's universally available and unvoidable power to charge
or not to charge an offense. Petitioner's reading would confer the extraordinary new power to determine the punishment for a charged offense
by simply modifying the manner of charging.

Opinion of the Court
example. Or "criminal offense" instead of "crime." But tosay that "subsequent offense" means the same thing as "second or subsequent conviction" requires a degree of verbalknow-nothingism that would render government by legislation quite impossible. Under the terminology "second or
subsequent conviction," in the context at issue here, it is en-tirely clear (without any "sentence parsing") that a defendant convicted of a crime committed in 1992, who has pre-viously been convicted of a crime committed in 1993, would
receive the enhanced sentence.The dissent quotes extensively from

Gonzalez v. United
States, 224 F. 2d 431 (CA1 1955). See post, at 138-139. Butfar from supporting the "text-insensitive" approach favored

by the dissent, that case acknowledges that "[i]n construing
subsequent offender statutes . . . the decisions of the courtshave varied depending upon the particular statute involved."

224 F. 2d, at 434. It says, as the dissent points out, thatfederal courts have "uniformly" held it to be the rule that a
second offense can occur only after conviction for the first.
Ibid. But those holdings were not arrived at in disregard
of the statutory text. To the contrary, as Gonzalez goes onto explain:

" `It cannot legally be known that an offense has beencommitted until there has been a conviction. A second
offense, as used in the criminal statutes, is one that hasbeen committed after conviction for a first offense.' "
Ibid. (quoting Holst v. Owens, 24 F. 2d 100, 101 (CA5

1928)).

The present statute, however, does not use the term "offense," so it cannot possibly be said that it requires a criminal act after the first conviction. What it requires is a conviction after the first conviction. There is utterly no
ambiguity in that, and hence no occasion to invoke the rule
of lenity. (The erroneous lower-court decisions cited by the
dissent, see post, at 142-144, do not alter this assessment;

judges cannot cause a clear text to become ambiguous byignoring it.)

In the end, nothing but personal intuition supports the dis-sent's contention that the statute is directed at those who
" `failed to learn their lessons from the initial punishment,' "
post, at 146 (quoting United States v. Neal, 976 F. 2d 601, 603(CA9 1992) (Fletcher, J., dissenting)). Like most intuitions,

it finds Congress to have intended what the intuitor thinksCongress ought to intend.

3 And like most intuitions, it is

not very precise. "[F]ailed to learn their lessons from theinitial punishment" would seem to suggest that the serving

of the punishment, rather than the mere pronouncement ofit, is necessary before the repeat criminal will be deemed
an inadequate student--a position that certainly appeals to"common sense," if not to text. Elsewhere, however, the
dissent says that the lesson is taught once "an earlier convic-tion has become final,"

post, at 142--so that the felon whoescapes during a trial that results in a conviction becomes

eligible for enhanced punishment for his later crimes, thoughhe has seemingly been taught no lesson except that the law
is easy to beat. But no matter. Once text is abandoned,one intuition will serve as well as the other. We choose to
follow the language of the statute, which gives no indicationthat punishment of those who fail to learn the "lesson" of
prior conviction or of prior punishment is the sole purposeof $ 924(c)(1), to the exclusion of other penal goals such as
taking repeat offenders off the streets for especially long pe-riods, or simply visiting society's retribution upon repeat offenders more severely. We do not agree with the dissent'ssuggestion that these goals defy "common sense." It seems
to us eminently sensible to punish the second murder, for

" `punishing first offenders [i. e., repeat offenders who have not yet been
convicted of an earlier offense] with twenty-five-year sentences does not
deter crime as much as it ruins lives.' " Post, at 146, n. 10 (quoting United

example, with life in prison rather than a term of years--whether or not conviction of the first murder (or completion

of the sentence for the first murder) has yet occurred.Finally, we need not tarry over petitioner's contention that
the rule of lenity is called for because his 105-year sentence"is so glaringly unjust that the Court cannot but question
whether Congress intended such an application of thephrase, `in the case of his second or subsequent conviction.' "
Brief for Petitioner 24. Even under the dissent's reading of$ 924(c)(1), some criminals whose only offenses consist of six
armed bank robberies would receive a total sentence of 105years in prison. We see no reason why it is "glaringly unjust" that petitioner be treated similarly here, simply be-cause he managed to evade detection, prosecution, and conviction for the first five offenses and was ultimately tried forall six in a single proceeding.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

Congress sometimes uses slightly different language toconvey the same message. Thus, Congress uses the terms

"subsequent offense," "second or subsequent offense," and"second or subsequent conviction" in various sections of the
Criminal Code, all to authorize enhanced sentences for re-peat offenders.

1 On some occasions, Congress meticulously

defines the chosen term to identify those offenses committedafter a prior conviction "has become final";

2 more frequently,

1 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 1302 ("subsequent offense" related to mailing of
lottery tickets); $ 1735 ("second or subsequent offense" related to sexually
oriented advertising); $ 844(h) ("second or subsequent conviction" for felonious use of explosives).

2 See, e. g., 21 U. S. C. $ 859(b) (1988 ed., Supp. III) (distribution of drugs

to minors); 21 U. S. C. $ 860(b) (1988 ed., Supp. III) (distribution of drugs
near schools); 21 U. S. C. $ 962(b) (importation of controlled substances).

138 DEAL v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
it relies on settled usage and the reader's common sense toimpart the same meaning.

In certain sections of the Code, even absent a definition,the context makes perfectly clear that the word "subsequent" describes only those offenses committed after a priorconviction has become final. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1302, for instance, which prohibits mailing of lottery tickets, authorizesa 5-year prison sentence for "any subsequent offense." A
literal reading of that phrase, like the one adopted by themajority today, presumably would justify imposition of five
5-year sentences if a defendant who sold six lottery ticketsthrough the mail were charged in a single indictment. But
it is absurd to think that Congress intended to treat such adefendant as a repeat offender, subject to penalty enhancement, "simply because he managed to evade detection, prose-cution, and conviction for the first five offenses and was ultimately tried for all six in a single proceeding." Ante, at 137.In other Code sections, where context is less illuminating,
the long-established usage of the word "subsequent" to dis-tinguish between first offenders and recidivists is sufficient
to avoid misunderstanding by anyone familiar with federalcriminal practice.

3 Thus, in a 1955 opinion construing the

undefined term "subsequent offense," the First Circuit notedthat most "subsequent offender" statutes had been construed

to provide that any offense "committed subsequent to a con-viction calls for the increased penalty." Gonzalez v. United
States, 224 F. 2d 431, 434 (1955). The court continued:

"In the United States courts uniformly this has beenheld to be the rule. In Singer v. United States, [278 F.

415 (1922)], the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuitconsidered a substantially similar statute to that presently before us and held that a second offense within the
3 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 2114 ("subsequent offense" of mail robbery), as
interpreted in United States v. Cooper, 580 F. 2d 259, 261 (CA7 1978) ("obvious" that "subsequent offense" language must be read as applying only
to offenses committed after conviction on a prior offense).

Stevens, J., dissenting
meaning of the statute could occur only after a convic-tion for the first offense. See, e. g., United States v.

Lindquist, [285 F. 447 (WD Wash. 1921)], and Biddle v.Thiele, [11 F. 2d 235 (CA8 1926)]. The Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit said in Holst v. Owens, [24 F. 2d100, 101 (1928)]: `It cannot legally be known that an offense has been committed until there has been a convic-tion. A second offense, as used in the criminal statutes,
is one that has been committed after conviction for afirst offense. Likewise, a third or any subsequent offense implies a repetition of crime after each previousconviction.' Similarly, in Smith v. United States, [41
F. 2d 215, 217 (CA9 1930)], the court stated: `In orderthat a conviction shall affect the penalty for subsequent
offenses, it must be prior to the commission of the of-fense.' " Ibid.

Congress did not define the term "subsequent conviction"when it enacted $ 924(c) in 1968. It is fair to presume, however, that Congress was familiar with the usage uniformlyfollowed in the federal courts. See NLRB v. Amax Coal
Co., 453 U. S. 322, 329 (1981); Perrin v. United States, 444U. S. 37, 42-45 (1979). Indeed, given the settled construction of repeat offender provisions, it is hardly surprisingthat Congressman Poff, who proposed the floor amendment
that became $ 924(c), felt it unnecessary to elaborate further.Cf.

unsurprising that there appears to have been no misunder-standing of the term "second or subsequent conviction" for

bank robberies, two months apart. Convicted in two sepa508us1$72K 02-14-97 20:00:03 PAGES OPINPGT

rate trials, the defendant was sentenced in each for bankrobbery, and in each to 10 years under $ 924(c), then the maximum authorized term for a first-time offender. Id., at 9.Apparently, nobody considered the possibility that the defendant might have been treated as a repeat offender at hissecond trial, and sentenced under $ 924(c)'s "second or subsequent conviction" provision. In any event, despite the factthat the literal language of the statute would have authorized the $ 924(c) sentences, id., at 16-17 (Rehnquist, J., dis-senting), the Court set them aside, applying the rule of lenity
and concluding that Congress did not intend enhancementunder $ 924(c) when, as in Simpson's case, a defendant is also
sentenced under a substantive statute providing for an en-hancement for use of a firearm. Id., at 14-15.

In Busic v. United States, 446 U. S. 398 (1980), the Courtconstrued the first offender portion of $ 924(c) even more narrowly than in Simpson, again rejecting a literal reading ofthe statutory text that would have supported a contrary result. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stewart succinctlydescribed $ 924(c) as a "general enhancement provision--
with its stiff sanctions for first offenders and even stiffersanctions for recidivists."

4 This understanding that the

term "second or subsequent conviction" was used to describerecidivism seemingly was shared by other judges, as several

years were to elapse before the construction adopted by theEleventh Circuit in United States v. Rawlings, 821 F. 2d

4 446 U. S., at 416. His full comment:
"I agree with the holding in Simpson that Congress did not intend to
`pyramid' punishments for the use of a firearm in a single criminal transaction. Yet I find quite implausible the proposition that Congress, in enacting $ 924(c)(1), did not intend this general enhancement provision--with
its stiff sanctions for first offenders and even stiffer sanctions for recidivists--to serve as an alternative source of enhanced punishment for those
who commit felonies, such as bank robbery and assaulting a federal officer,
that had been previously singled out by Congress as warranting special
enhancement, but for which a lesser enhancement sanction than that imposed by $ 924(c) had been authorized."

At oral argument, the Government was unable to tell ushow the "second or subsequent conviction" language of

$ 924(c) was construed by Government prosecutors prior to
1987, when Rawlings was decided. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28.It seems to me, however, quite likely that until 1987, the

Government read the "second or subsequent" section of$ 924(c) as a straightforward recidivist provision, just as
Justice Stewart did in 1980. That reading certainly wouldcomport with the Government's submissions to this Court
in Simpson, supra, and Busic, supra, both of which describethe "second or subsequent conviction" provision in terms of
recidivism.5 It would be consistent, too, with the reportedcases involving $ 924(c) sentencing, which make clear that the
district courts were routinely imposing consecutive 5-yearsentences when defendants were convicted of two separate
offenses under $ 924(c), apparently without objection from
the Government that the second conviction warranted a
longer sentence. See, e. g., United States v. Henry, 878 F. 2d
937, 938 (CA6 1989); United States v. Jim, 865 F. 2d 211,
212 (CA9), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 827 (1989); United States v.

U. S. 983 (1988).

In light of this history, I would find no ambiguity in the
phrase "subsequent conviction" as used in $ 924(c). Like its
many counterparts in the Criminal Code, the phrase clearly
is intended to refer to a conviction for an offense committed

after an earlier conviction has become final; it is, in short,a recidivist provision. When that sensible construction is

adopted, of course, the grammatical difficulties and the po-tential for prosecutorial manipulation that trouble the majority, see ante, at 131-134, are avoided entirely. See United
States v. Neal, 976 F. 2d 601, 603 (CA9 1992) (Fletcher, J.,dissenting) ("common-sense reading of $ 924(c)" as recidivist

statute).Even assuming, however, that the meaning of $ 924(c)'s repeat offender provision is not as obvious as I think, its his-tory belies the notion that its text admits of only one reading,
that adopted in Rawlings. Surely it cannot be argued thata construction surfacing for the first time 19 years after enactment is the only available construction. Indeed, evenafter

Rawlings, there is no consensus on this point; somecourts--and some Government prosecutors--continue to

apply $ 924(c) as a recidivist statute.6 In United States v.Nabors, 901 F. 2d 1351 (CA6), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 871
(1990), for instance, a case decided in 1990, the Court of Ap-peals purported to follow Rawlings, but actually affirmed
imposition of two 5-year sentences for convictions on twodistinct $ 924(c) violations.

7 Similarly, in United States v.

6 Dismissing these cases, as well as those decided pre-Rawlings, as a
long line of "erroneous lower-court decisions," ante, at 135, cannot explain
why 19 years passed before the correct interpretation of a statute of

"utterly no ambiguity," ibid., made its first reported appearance.

7 There is some tension between the notion that the text of the statute

is clear and unambiguous and the Court of Appeals' explanation for its
holding:

"While $ 924(c)(1) is, at best, hard to follow in simple English, we concur
with the reasoning in Rawlings that two distinct violations of the statute
trigger the subsequent sentence enhancement provisions of $ 924(c)(1).
Thus, the commission of two violations of $ 924(c)(1) would result in a fiveyear consecutive sentence for the first conviction and a ten-year consecutive sentence for the second $ 924(c)(1) conviction. However, because of
the complexity of this issue, we find the district court's failure to sentence
Nabors to a ten-year consecutive sentence for his second $ 924(c)(1) conviction not clearly erroneous." United States v. Nabors, 901 F. 2d, at

Luskin, 926 F. 2d 372 (CA4), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 815
(1991), decided a year later, the Court of Appeals upheld
three 5-year sentences for three violations of $ 924(c) committed on separate dates, even though the minimum mandatory penalty for a "second or subsequent conviction" was 10
years at the time of trial. Significantly, the Government did
not challenge the 5-year sentences on the second and third
convictions.8

At the very least, this equivocation on the part of those
charged with enforcing $ 924(c), combined with the understanding of repeat offender provisions current when $ 924(c)
was enacted, render the construction of $ 924(c) sufficiently
uncertain that the rule of lenity should apply. Cf. Simpson, 435 U. S., at 14-15; see United States v. Abreu, 962
F. 2d 1447, 1450-1451 (CA10 1992) (en banc). As one District Court judge said of $ 924(c), in the course of a 1991
sentencing:

"The statute is not a model of clarity. Its use of the
word `conviction' rather than wording describing the offense suggests an intent to reach recidivists who repeat
conduct after conviction in the judicial system for prior
offenses. The legislative history suggests that Congress was trying to impose draconian punishment `if

he does it a second time.' 114 Cong. Rec. 22231, 22237
(1968). It is unclear whether this means a second time
as a recidivist or a second time offender who has not
faced deterrence by a prior sentence. Criminal statutes must be strictly construed. Nabors [901 F. 2d, at

8 "The 1988 amendment raised the penalty for repeat violators of the
statute to twenty years. In the version that was in effect at the time of
the present crimes, the penalty for repeat violators was ten years. Arguably, the district judge should have sentenced appellant to one five-year
and two ten-year consecutive terms of imprisonment for his convictions
under Counts V through VII. However, since the United States has not
counter-appealed on this point, we will not address it." United States

decline to hold him to a higher test than one found diffi-cult by appellate court judges." United States v. Godwin, 758 F. Supp. 281, 283 (ED Pa. 1991).
In an effort to cure $ 924(c) of any ambiguity, the Courtundertakes an intricate grammatical analysis, with an emphasis on the word "conviction." 9 According to the Court,the "conviction" referred to in $ 924(c) must be a finding of
guilt, preceding the entry of final judgment, because sen-tence is imposed with the final judgment; if "conviction"
referred to the final judgment itself, there would be no op-portunity for sentence enhancement. Ante, at 132. The
"absurd[ity]" of this situation, ibid., which, I note, has thusfar eluded all of the courts to apply $ 924(c) as a recidivist

9 The Court also suggests that use of the word "conviction," rather than
"offense," distinguishes this statute from the repeat offender provisions
discussed in Gonzalez v. United States, 224 F. 2d 431 (CA1 1955), supra,
at 138-139. Of course, the majority's textualist approach would lead to
the same result if $ 924(c)'s enhancement were reserved for "second or
subsequent offenses": At the time of sentencing for two violations committed on separate dates, one violation is "second or subsequent" to the
other, and the conviction itself always will establish that two "offenses"
have indeed been committed. See ante, at 135.

It is true, as the Court points out in passionate defense of its reading,
that the words "offense" and "conviction" are not identical. What is at
issue here, however, is not whether the terms mean the same thing in all
usages, but whether they mean the same thing when they are used by
Congress to identify the class of repeat offenders subject to enhanced sentences. Cf. ante, at 131-132 (context gives meaning to word "conviction").
If there is any difference between the terms as so used, it only lends
further support to the conclusion that $ 924(c) is a recidivist provision. As
discussed above, repeat offender statutes couched in terms of "offense"
were understood at the time of $ 924(c)'s enactment to identify offenses
committed after a prior conviction. See supra, at 138-139. A fortiori,
"use of the word `conviction' rather than wording describing the offense
suggests an intent to reach recidivists who repeat conduct after conviction
in the judicial system for prior offenses." United States v. Godwin, 758
F. Supp. 281, 283 (ED Pa. 1991).

statute, see supra, evaporates if we assume that sentencing
judges are gifted with enough common sense to understand
that they may, upon entry of a second final judgment, enhance the sentence incorporated therein. In any event, the
majority's conclusion that a "second or subsequent conviction" is a finding of guilt leaves unanswered the question
dispositive here: whether that second conviction (finding of
guilt or entry of judgment) is subject to enhancement if it
is not for an offense committed after a prior conviction has
become final.

The Court finds additional support for its conclusion in the
fact that at least some contrary readings of $ 924(c) would
"give a prosecutor unreviewable discretion either to impose
or to waive the enhanced sentencing provisions" through the
manner in which she charged a crime or crimes. Ante, at
133. I have already pointed out that the majority's particular concern is not implicated if $ 924(c) is treated as
a straightforward recidivist provision, supra, at 142-143;
under that construction, a defendant who commits a second

$ 924(c) offense before trial on the first would not be eligible
for sentence enhancement whether the two counts were tried
separately or together. I would add only that the Court's
alternative reading does not solve the broader problem it
identifies. As the Government concedes, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 31-32, prosecutors will continue to enjoy considerable
discretion in deciding how many $ 924(c) offenses to charge
in relation to a criminal transaction or series of transactions.
An armed defendant who robs a bank and, at the same time,
assaults a guard, may be subject to one or two $ 924(c)
charges; the choice is the prosecutor's, and the consequence,
under today's holding, the difference between a 5- and a 15-
year enhancement. Cf. United States v. Jim, 865 F. 2d, at
212 (defendant charged with three counts under $ 924(c), each
arising from the same criminal episode); United States v.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Section 924(c) of the Criminal Code mandates an enhanced,20-year sentence for repeat offenders. Between 1968, when

the statute was enacted, and 1987, when textualism replacedcommon sense in its interpretation, the bench and bar seem
to have understood that this provision applied to defendantswho, having once been convicted under $ 924(c), "failed to
learn their lessons from the initial punishment" and com-mitted a repeat offense. See

United States v. Neal, 976F. 2d, at 603 (Fletcher, J., dissenting).

10 The contrary reading adopted by the Court today, driven by an elaborate exer-cise in sentence parsing, is responsive to neither historical

context nor common sense. Because I cannot agree withthis unwarranted and unnecessarily harsh construction of

$ 924(c), the meaning of which should, at a minimum, be in-formed by the rule of lenity, I respectfully dissent.

10 "However, punishing first offenders with twenty-five-year sentences
does not deter crime as much as it ruins lives. If, after arrest and conviction, a first offender is warned that he will face a mandatory twenty-year
sentence if he commits the same crime again, then the offender will know
of the penalty. Having already served at least five years in prison, he
will have a strong incentive to stay out of trouble. Discouraging recidivism by people who have already been in prison and been released serves
a far more valuable purpose than deterring offenders who have yet to be
arrested and have no knowledge of the law's penalties." United States v.
Jones, 965 F. 2d 1507, 1521 (CA8 1992) (internal citation omitted).

EL VOCERO de PUERTO RICO et al. v. PUERTORICO

et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the supremecourt of puerto rico

No. 92-949. Decided May 17, 1993
Puerto Rico Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(c) provides that preliminary

hearings in criminal cases "shall be held privately" unless the defendant
requests otherwise. Petitioners, a newspaper and reporter, challenged
this provision, claiming that it violates the First Amendment for the
same reasons that a similar California law was struck down in PressEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside, 478 U. S.
1. There, this Court applied the experience and logic test of Globe
Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court of County of Norfolk, 457 U. S. 596,
to hold that preliminary criminal hearings have traditionally been public
and that California's hearings were sufficiently like a trial that public
access was essential to their proper functioning. The Puerto Rico Superior Court dismissed petitioners' suit, and the Commonwealth's Supreme Court affirmed, holding that several differences between California hearings and Rule 23(c) hearings made Press-Enterprise inapposite.
Applying the Globe Newspaper tests anew, it concluded that closed hearings were compatible with the Commonwealth's unique history and traditions and that open hearings would prejudice defendants' rights to fair
trials because of Puerto Rico's small size and dense population.

Held: Rule 23(c)'s privacy provision is unconstitutional. The decision

below is irreconcilable with Press-Enterprise. Each of the features
cited by Press-Enterprise in support of the finding that the California
hearings were like a trial--e. g., hearings before a neutral magistrate
and a defendant's right to cross-examine witnesses--is present here.
The commonalities are not coincidental, as one source for Rule 23 was
the California law. Rule 23(c)'s privacy provision is also more clearly
suspect than California's law, which allowed hearings to be closed only
upon a determination that there was a substantial likelihood of prejudice
to the defendant. Contrary to the lower court's finding, the experience
test of Globe Newspaper looks not to the particular practice of any one
jurisdiction, but to the experience in that type or kind of hearing
throughout the United States. The lower court's concern that publicity
will prejudice defendants' fair trial rights is legitimate but can be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

the accused is afforded the rights to counsel, to cross-examination, to present testimony, and, at least in some instances, to suppress illegally seized evidence; 4 the accused isbound over for trial only upon the magistrate's finding probable cause; in a substantial portion of criminal cases, the hear-ing provides the only occasion for public observation of the
criminal justice system; 5 and no jury is present. Cf. 478U. S., at 12-13.

Puerto Rico's preliminary hearing render it a subspecies ofthe provision this Court found to be infirm seven years ago.
Beyond this, however, the privacy provision of Rule 23(c) ismore clearly suspect. California law allowed magistrates to
close hearings only upon a determination that there was asubstantial likelihood of prejudice to the defendant, yet the
Press-Enterprise Court found this standard insufficientlyexacting to protect public access. 478 U. S., at 14-15. By
contrast, Rule 23 provides no standard, allowing hearings tobe closed upon the request of the defendant, without more.

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court's reliance on PuertoRican tradition is also misplaced. As the Court of Appeals

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. KEYSTONE CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES, INC.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-1677. Argued February 22, 1993--Decided May 24, 1993
Respondent company, which maintained several tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its employees during the time at issue, contributed
a number of unencumbered properties to the trust fund supporting the
plans and then credited the properties' fair market value against its
minimum funding obligation under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Petitioner, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ruled that respondent owed substantial excise taxes because the transfers to the trust were "prohibited transactions" under 26
U. S. C. $ 4975(c)(1)(A), which bars "any direct or indirect . . . sale or
exchange . . . of . . . property between a plan and a disqualified person"
such as the employer of employees covered by the plan. The Tax Court
disagreed and entered summary judgment for respondent on its petition
for redetermination, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: When applied to an employer's funding obligation, the contribution

of unencumbered property to a defined benefit plan is a prohibited "sale
or exchange" under $ 4975(c)(1)(A). Pp. 158-162.

(a) The well-established income tax rule that the transfer of property
in satisfaction of a monetary obligation is a "sale or exchange," see, e. g.,
Helvering v. Hammel, 311 U. S. 504, is applicable under $ 4975(c)(1)(A).
That the latter section forbids the transfer of property in satisfaction
of a debt is demonstrated by its prohibition not merely of a "sale or
exchange," but of "any direct or indirect . . . sale or exchange." The
contribution of property in satisfaction of a funding obligation is at
least both an indirect type of sale and a form of exchange, since the
property is exchanged for diminution of the employer's funding obligation. Pp. 158-159.

(b) The foregoing construction is necessary to accomplish $ 4975's
goal to bar categorically a transaction likely to injure the pension plan.
A property transfer poses various potential problems for the plan--
including a shortage of funds to pay promised benefits, assumption of
the primary obligation to pay any encumbrance, overvaluation of the
property by the employer, the property's nonliquidity, the burden and
cost of disposing of the property, and the employer's substitution of

Pp. 160-161.

(c) The Court of Appeals erred in reading $ 4975(f)(3)--which states
that a transfer of property "by a disqualified person to a plan shall be
treated as a sale or exchange if the property is subject to a mortgage
or similar lien"--as implying that a transfer cannot be a "sale or exchange" under $ 4975(c)(1)(A) unless the property is encumbered. The
legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended $ 4975(f)(3) to
expand, not limit, $ 4975(c)(1)(A)'s scope by extending the reach of "sale
or exchange" to include contributions of encumbered property that do
not satisfy funding obligations. The Commissioner's construction of

$ 4975 is a sensible one. A transfer of encumbered property, like the
transfer of unencumbered property to satisfy an obligation, has the potential to burden a plan, while a transfer of property that is neither
encumbered nor satisfies a debt presents far less potential for causing
loss to the plan. Pp. 161-162.

question whether such a contribution, when applied to theemployer's funding obligation, is a prohibited "sale or exchange" under 26 U. S. C. $ 4975 so that the employerthereby incurs the substantial excise taxes imposed by the
statute. I

A "defined benefit pension plan," as its name implies, isone where the employee, upon retirement, is entitled to a
fixed periodic payment. The size of that payment usuallydepends upon prior salary and years of service. The more
common "defined contribution pension plan," in contrast, istypically one where the employer contributes a percentage
of payroll or profits to individual employee accounts. Uponretirement, the employee is entitled to the funds in his account. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1002(34) and (35).If either type of plan qualifies for favorable tax treatment,
the employer, for income tax purposes, may deduct its cur-rent contributions to the plan; the retiree, however, is not
taxed until he receives payment from the plan. See 26U. S. C. $$ 402(a)(1) and 404(a)(1).

II
The facts that are pertinent for resolving the present liti-gation are not in dispute. During its taxable years ended

June 30, 1983, through June 30, 1988, inclusive, respondentKeystone Consolidated Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business in Dallas, Tex., main-tained several tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans.
These were subject to the minimum funding requirementsprescribed by $ 302 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), Pub. L. 93-406, $ 302, 88 Stat.869, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1082. See also 26 U. S. C.

$ 412. Respondent funded the plans by contributions to theKeystone Consolidated Master Pension Trust.

On March 8, 1983, respondent contributed to the PensionTrust five truck terminals having a stated fair market value

Opinion of the Court
of $9,655,454 at that time. Respondent credited that value
against its minimum funding obligation to its defined benefit
pension plans for its fiscal years 1982 and 1983. On March
13, 1984, respondent contributed to the Pension Trust certain
Key West, Fla., real property having a stated fair market
value of $5,336,751 at that time. Respondent credited that
value against its minimum funding obligation for its fiscal
year 1984. The truck terminals were not encumbered at the
times of their transfers. Neither was the Key West property. Their respective stated fair market values are not
challenged here.

Respondent claimed deductions on its federal income tax
returns for the fair market values of the five truck terminals
and the Key West property. It also reported as taxable capital gain the difference between its income tax basis in each
property and that property's stated fair market value.
Thus, for income tax purposes, respondent treated the disposal of each property as a "sale or exchange" of a capital
asset. See 26 U. S. C. $ 1222.

Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C.

$ 4975, was added by $ 2003(a) of ERISA. See 88 Stat. 971.
It imposes a two-tier excise tax 1 on specified "prohibited
transactions" between a pension plan and a "disqualified person." Among the "disqualified persons" listed in the statute
is the employer of employees covered by the pension plan.
See $ 4975(e)(2)(C). Among the transactions prohibited is
"any direct or indirect . . . sale or exchange . . . of any

1 The first-tier tax is "5 percent of the amount involved." 26 U. S. C.

$ 4975(a). The second-tier tax is "100 percent of the amount involved."

$ 4975(b). The "amount involved" is the greater of the amount of money
and the fair market value of the other property given or the amount of
money and the fair market value of the other property received.

$ 4975(f)(4). The second-tier tax usually may be avoided by timely correction of the prohibited transaction upon completion of the litigation concerning the taxpayer's liability for the tax. See $$ 4961(a), 4963(b) and

property between a plan and a disqualified person." See$ 4975(c)(1)(A).

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who is the peti-tioner here, ruled that respondent's transfers to the Pension
Trust of the five truck terminals and the Key West property
were sales or exchanges prohibited under $ 4975(c)(1)(A).This ruling resulted in determined deficiencies in respondent's first-tier excise tax liability of $749,610 for its fiscal year1984 and of $482,773 for each of its fiscal years 1983 and
1985-1988, inclusive. The Commissioner also determinedthat respondent incurred second-tier excise tax liability in
the amount of $9,655,454 for its fiscal year 1988.

Respondent timely filed a petition for redetermination
with the United States Tax Court. That court, with an unreviewed opinion on cross-motions for summary judgment,
ruled in respondent's favor. 60 TCM 1423 (1990), || 90,628
P-H Memo TC.

The Tax Court acknowledged that "there is a potential for
abuse by allowing unencumbered property transfers to plans
in satisfaction of minimum funding requirements." Id., at
1424, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071. Nonetheless, it
did not agree that the transfers in this case constituted sales
or exchanges under $ 4975. It rejected the Commissioner's
attempt to analogize the property transfers to the recognition of income for income tax purposes, for it considered the
issue whether a transfer is a prohibited transaction under

$ 4975 to be "separate and distinct from income tax recognition." Id., at 1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071.

In drawing this distinction, the Tax Court cited 26 U. S. C.

$ 4975(f)(3). That section specifically states that a transfer
of property "by a disqualified person to a plan shall be
treated as a sale or exchange if the property is subject to a
mortgage or similar lien." The court observed: "Since section 4975(f )(3) specifically describes certain transfers of real
or personal property to a plan by a disqualified person as a
sale or exchange for purposes of section 4975, the definitional

concerns of `sale or exchange' are removed from the general
definitions found in other areas of the tax law." 60 TCM, at
1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071. The Tax Court
thus seemed to say that $ 4975(f )(3) limits the reach of

$ 4975(c)(1)(A), so that only transfers of encumbered property
are prohibited.

The Tax Court also rejected the Commissioner's argument
that by contributing noncash property to its plan, the employer was in a position to exert unwarranted influence over
the Pension Trust's investment policy. The court's answer
was that the trustee "can dispose of " the property. Id., at
1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3072. The court noted
that it earlier had rejected the Commissioner's distinction
between transfers of property that satisfy a funding obligation and transfers of encumbered property, whether or not
the latter transfers fulfill a funding obligation, in Wood v.
Commissioner, 95 T. C. 364 (1990) (unreviewed), rev'd, 955
F. 2d 908 (CA4), cert. granted, 504 U. S. 972, dism'd, 505 U. S.
1231 (1992). See 60 TCM, at 1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC,
p. 90-3072.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed. 951 F. 2d 76 (1992). It read $ 4975(f )(3) as "implying that unless it is encumbered by a mortgage or lien, a
transfer of property is not to be treated as if it were a sale
or exchange." Id., at 78. It rejected the Commissioner's
argument that $ 4975(f )(3) was intended to expand the definition of "sale or exchange" to include transfers of encumbered property that do not fulfill funding obligations; in the
court's view, "there is no basis for this distinction between
involuntary and voluntary transfers anywhere in the Code."
Ibid. The court reasoned: "If all transfers of property to
a plan were to be treated as a sale or exchange" under

$ 4975(c)(1)(A), then $ 4975(f)(3) "would be superfluous."
Ibid. That a transfer of property in satisfaction of an obligation is treated as a "sale or exchange" of property for

Opinion of the Court

income tax purposes is "irrelevant," because "[s]ection 4975was not enacted to measure economic income." Id., at 79.

The Court of Appeals ruled that the Commissioner's viewswere not entitled to deference, despite the fact that both the
Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor ad-minister ERISA's prohibited-transaction provisions. This
was because the Commissioner's views had not been set outin a formal regulation, and because the Department of Labor's views were set out in an advisory opinion that wasbinding only "on the parties thereto, and has no precedential
effect." Ibid.In view of the acknowledged conflict between the Fourth
Circuit's decision in Wood, see 955 F. 2d, at 913, and the FifthCircuit's decision in the present litigation, cases decided
within two weeks of each other, we granted certiorari. 506U. S. 813 (1992).

III
The statute with which we are concerned is a complicatedone. But when much of its language, not applicable to the

present case, is set to one side, the issue before us comesinto better focus. Respondent acknowledges that it is a
"disqualified person" with respect to the Pension Trust. Italso acknowledges that the trust qualifies as a plan under

$ 4975. Our task, then, is only to determine whether thetransfers of the terminals and of the Key West property
were sales or exchanges within the reach of $ 4975(c)(1)(A)and therefore were prohibited transactions.

A
It is well established for income tax purposes that thetransfer of property in satisfaction of a monetary obligation

is usually a "sale or exchange" of the property. See, e. g.,
Helvering v. Hammel, 311 U. S. 504 (1941). See also 2B. Bittker & L. Lokken, Federal Taxation of Income, Estates

and Gifts || 40.4, p. 40-11 (2d ed. 1990). It seems clear,therefore, that respondent's contribution of the truck termi508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT

159Cite as: 508 U. S. 152 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
nals and the Key West property constituted, under the income tax laws, sales of those properties to the Pension Trust.
The Fourth Circuit, in Wood, supra, observed: "[W]e are
aware of no instance when the term `sale or exchange' has
been used or interpreted not to include transfers of property
in satisfaction of indebtedness." 955 F. 2d, at 913.

This logic applied in income tax cases is equally applicable
under $ 4975(c)(1)(A). The phrase "sale or exchange" had
acquired a settled judicial and administrative interpretation
over the course of a half century before Congress enacted in

$ 4975 the even broader statutory language of "any direct or
indirect . . . sale or exchange." Congress presumptively was
aware when it enacted $ 4975 that the phrase "sale or exchange" consistently had been construed to include the transfer of property in satisfaction of a monetary obligation. See
Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 340-343 (1981). It
is a "normal rule of statutory construction," Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986), that "identical
words used in different parts of the same act are intended
to have the same meaning," Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.
v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932). Further, "the
Code must be given `as great an internal symmetry and consistency as its words permit.' " Commissioner v. Lester, 366

U. S. 299, 304 (1961). Accordingly, when we construe

$ 4975(c)(1)(A), it is proper to accept the already settled
meaning of the phrase "sale or exchange."

Even if this phrase had not possessed a settled meaning,
it still would be clear that $ 4975(c)(1)(A) prohibits the transfer of property in satisfaction of a debt. Congress barred
not merely a "sale or exchange." It prohibited something
more, namely, "any direct or indirect . . . sale or exchange."
The contribution of property in satisfaction of a funding obligation is at least both an indirect type of sale and a form of
exchange, since the property is exchanged for diminution of
the employer's funding obligation.

We note, too, that this construction of the statute's broadlanguage is necessary to accomplish Congress' goal. Before

ERISA's enactment in 1974, the measure that governed atransaction between a pension plan and its sponsor was the
customary arm's-length standard of conduct. This providedan open door for abuses such as the sponsor's sale of property to the plan at an inflated price or the sponsor's satisfac-tion of a funding obligation by contribution of property that
was overvalued or nonliquid. Congress' response to theseabuses included the enactment of ERISA's $ 406(a)(1)(A), 29
U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(A), and the addition of $ 4975 to the In-ternal Revenue Code.

Congress' goal was to bar categorically a transaction thatwas likely to injure the pension plan. S. Rep. No. 93-383,
pp. 95-96 (1973). The transfer of encumbered property mayjeopardize the ability of the plan to pay promised benefits.
See Wood v. Commissioner, supra. Such a transfer imposesupon the trust the primary obligation to pay the encumbrance, and thus frees cash for the employer by restrictingthe use of cash by the trust. Overvaluation, the burden of
disposing of the property, and the employer's substitution ofits own judgment as to investment policy, are other obvious
considerations. Although the burden of an encumbrance isunique to the contribution of encumbered property, concerns
about overvaluation, disposal of property, and the need tomaintain an independent investment policy animate any contribution of property that satisfies a funding obligation, re-gardless of whether or not the property is encumbered.
This is because as long as a pension fund is giving up anaccount receivable in exchange for property, the fund runs
the risk of giving up more than it is getting in return if theproperty is either less valuable or more burdensome than a
cash contribution would have been.These potential harmful effects are illustrated by the facts
of the present case, even though the properties at issue

Opinion of the Court
were unencumbered and not overvalued at the times of theirrespective transfers. There were exclusive sales-listing

agreements respondent had made with respect to two of thetruck terminals; these agreements called for sales commissions. The presence of this requirement demonstrates thatit is neither easy nor costless to dispose of such properties.
The Chicago truck terminal, for example, was not sold for3

1/2 years after it was listed for sale by the Pension Trust.

These problems are not solved, as the Court of Appealssuggested, by the mere imposition of excise taxes by $ 4971.

It is $ 4975 that prevents the abuses.

C
We do not agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that$ 4975(f )(3) limits the meaning of "sale or exchange," as that

phrase appears in $ 4975(c)(1)(A). Section 4975(f )(3) statesthat a transfer of property "by a disqualified person to a plan
shall be treated as a sale or exchange if the property is sub-ject to a mortgage or similar lien." The Court of Appeals
read this language as implying that unless property "is en-cumbered by a mortgage or lien, a transfer of property is
not to be treated as if it were a sale or exchange." 951 F. 2d,at 78. We feel that by this language Congress intended

$ 4975(f )(3) to expand, not limit, the scope of the prohibited-transaction provision. It extends the reach of "sale or exchange" in $ 4975(c)(1)(A) to include contributions of encum-bered property that do not satisfy funding obligations. See
H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 307 (1974). Congress in-tended by $ 4975(f )(3) to provide additional protection, not to
limit the protection already provided by $ 4975(c)(1)(A).2

2 Such expanded coverage is illustrated by the following example. An
employer with no outstanding funding obligations wishes to contribute
property to a pension fund to reward its employees for an especially productive year of service. Under our analysis, the property contribution is
permissible if the property is unencumbered, because it will not be "exchanged" for a diminution in funding obligations and therefore does not

We feel that the Commissioner's construction of $ 4975 isa sensible one. A transfer of encumbered property, like the

transfer of unencumbered property to satisfy an obligation,has the potential to burden a plan, while a transfer of property that is neither encumbered nor satisfies a debt presentsfar less potential for causing loss to the plan.

For the reasons stated in the opinions of the Tax Court,60 TCM 1423 (1990), || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, and the Court

of Appeals, 951 F. 2d 76 (CA5 1992), I am persuaded that thetransfer of unencumbered property to a pension trust is not

two observations.
fall within the prohibition of $ 4975(c)(1)(A). On the other hand, the property contribution is impermissible if the property is encumbered, because

$ 4975(f)(3) specifically prohibits all contributions of encumbered property.

3 We note, in passing, that the parties and the amicus have argued strenuously the issue whether we should afford deference to the interpretation
of the statute by the two agencies charged with administering it. See
Brief for Petitioner 29-32; Brief for Respondent 39-42; Reply Brief for
Petitioner 18-20; Brief for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as Amicus Curiae 10-13.

It does appear that the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue
Service consistently have taken the position that a sponsoring employer's
transfer of unencumbered property to a pension plan to satisfy its funding
obligation is a prohibited sale or exchange. See Department of Labor
Advisory Opinion 81-69A, issued July 28, 1981; Department of Labor Advisory Opinion 90-05A, issued March 29, 1990; Rev. Rule 81-40, 1981-1 Cum.
Bull. 508; Rev. Rule 77-379, 1977-2 Cum. Bull. 387.

We reach our result in this case without reliance on any rule of deference. Because of the nature and limitations of these rulings, we express
no view as to whether they are or are not entitled to deference. The
resolution of that issue is deferred to another day.

Stevens, J., dissenting
In holding that an employer's transfer of unencumberedproperty to a pension fund in satisfaction of a funding obligation is a "sale or exchange" barred by $ 4975(c)(1)(A), theCourt draws upon the well-established rule that for income
tax purposes the transfer of property to satisfy an indebted-ness is a "sale or exchange."

Ante, at 158. It is equallywell established, however, or at least was so at the time Congress enacted $ 4975(c)(1)(A), that any contribution of prop-erty by an employer to an employee pension fund, whether
done so voluntarily or pursuant to a funding obligation, is,for income tax purposes, a "sale or exchange" of that property. See Tasty Baking Co. v. United States, 393 F. 2d 992(Ct. Cl. 1968);

A. P. Smith Manufacturing Co. v. UnitedStates, 364 F. 2d 831 (Ct. Cl. 1966); United States v. General

Shoe Corp., 282 F. 2d 9 (CA6 1960); see also Rev. Rul. 75-498,1975-2 Cum. Bull. 29. If indeed our focus in answering the
question presented in this case is to be congressional under-standing of the term "sale or exchange" as it relates to the
determination of gain or loss, it would seem to follow thatCongress, in enacting $ 4975(c)(1)(A), rejected the very distinction between voluntary and mandatory contributionsthat the Commissioner advocates and that the Court today
embraces. The alternative, of course, is to recognize, as didthe Tax Court and the Court of Appeals, that Congress did
not intend to import into $ 4975(c)(1)(A) the meaning of "saleor exchange" that has developed and been applied in the very
different context of measuring a taxpayer's gain or loss uponthe disposition of property. See 951 F. 2d, at 79; 60 TCM, at
1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071. I would so hold.*

*In defense of his position, the Commissioner argues that there is no
inconsistency in relying on the well-established meaning of "sale or exchange," and holding that a voluntary contribution to a pension plan is not
barred by $ 4975(c)(1)(A). The latter, the Commissioner argues, bars the
"sale or exchange" of property "between a plan" and an employer, whereas
the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code refer more generally
to the "sale or exchange" of property. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. $$ 1001(c),
1222. By this reasoning, a voluntary transfer of property to a pension
plan is a "sale or exchange" for purposes of determining gain or loss, but

Stevens, J., dissenting

The Court is properly concerned about the potential forabuse associated with an employer's transfer of property to

a pension plan. See ante, at 160. It is worth noting, how-ever, that the risk of abuse is mitigated by the fact that the
trustees of a pension plan have the right--indeed, the duty--to refuse to accept property transfers that are disadvantageous to the trust. See generally 29 U. S. C. $ 1104. In-deed, there may well be situations in which a rule that disables the trustees from accepting any consideration otherthan cash may be contrary to the best interests of the trust.
For example, one can easily imagine a situation in which thetrustees, acting prudently and in the best interests of the
plan beneficiaries, would prefer that an employer transfer anundervalued piece of property to the plan, as opposed to selling the property to a third party at a discount and satisfyingits funding obligation in cash. Though the majority's reading of the statute is plausible, I am not persuaded that Con-gress intended to so restrict employers and pension plan
trustees.I respectfully dissent.

is not a "sale or exchange" between the employer and the plan within the
meaning of $ 4975(c)(1)(A) because it was not made in satisfaction of a
mandatory funding obligation.

The Commissioner's argument, in my view, places more weight on the
words "between a plan" in $ 4975(c)(1)(A) than they can reasonably bear.
The Commissioner asks that we accept the hypothesis that Congress drew
upon a settled body of law regarding the terms "sale or exchange" in the
income tax context, but then, by the use of these three words, departed
from that settled usage and drew a distinction between voluntary and
involuntary contributions that had been roundly rejected in the case law
and by the Internal Revenue Service itself. Again, as did the Court of
Appeals and the Tax Court, I find it more likely that Congress intended
that we construe $ 4975(c)(1)(A) in its context, and independent of the
meaning attributed to the term "sale or exchange" in other parts of the
Internal Revenue Code.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

et al. v. LANDANO

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-2054. Argued February 24, 1993--Decided May 24, 1993
Respondent Landano was convicted in New Jersey state court for murdering a police officer during what may have been a gang-related robbery.
In an effort to support his claim in subsequent state-court proceedings
that the prosecution violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by withholding material exculpatory evidence, he filed Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) requests with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for
information it had compiled in connection with the murder investigation.
When the FBI redacted some documents and withheld others, Landano
filed this action in the Federal District Court, seeking disclosure of the
requested files' contents. The FBI claimed that it withheld the information under Exemption 7(D), which exempts agency records compiled
for law enforcement purposes by law enforcement authorities in the
course of a criminal investigation if the records' release "could reasonably be expected to disclose" the identity of, or information provided by,
a "confidential source." The court held that the FBI had to articulate
case-specific reasons for nondisclosure of information given by anyone
other than a regular informant, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in
relevant part. It held that a source is confidential if there has been an
explicit assurance of confidentiality or circumstances from which such
an assurance could reasonably be inferred. However, it rejected the
Government's argument that a presumption of confidentiality arises
whenever any individual or institutional source supplies information to
the FBI during a criminal investigation and declined to rule that a presumption may be based on the particular investigation's subject matter.
Rather, it held that, to justify withholding under Exemption 7(D), the
Government had to provide detailed explanations relating to each alleged confidential source.

Held:

1. The Government is not entitled to a presumption that all sources
supplying information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation are confidential sources within the meaning of Exemption 7(D).
Pp. 171-178.

(a) A source should be deemed "confidential" if the source furnished
information with the understanding that the FBI would not divulge the

166 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE v. LANDANO

Syllabus
communication except to the extent it thought necessary for law enforcement purposes. Contrary to respondent's position, Congress could
not have intended to limit the exemption to only those sources who are
promised complete anonymity or secrecy, because at the time an interview is conducted, neither a source nor the FBI ordinarily knows
whether a communication will need to be disclosed. Pp. 173-174.

(b) Nonetheless, the presumption for which the Government argues
in this case is unwarranted, because it does not comport with common
sense and probability. During the course of a criminal investigation,
the FBI collects diverse information, ranging from the extremely sensitive to the routine, from a variety of individual and institutional sources.
While most individual sources may expect confidentiality, the Government offers no explanation, other than administrative ease, why that
expectation always should be presumed. The justifications for presuming the confidentiality of all institutional sources are even less persuasive, given the wide variety of information that such sources are asked
to give. Considerations of fairness also counsel against the Government's rule. Its presumption is, in practice, all but irrebuttable, because a requester without knowledge about the particular source or the
withheld information will very rarely be in a position to offer persuasive
evidence that the source had no interest in confidentiality. While Exemption 7(D)'s "could reasonably be expected to" language and this
Court's decision in Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S. 749, may support some inferences of confidentiality, they do not support the presumption that all FBI criminal investigative sources are exempt. Nor does the FOIA's legislative history
indicate that Congress intended to create such a rule. Pp. 174-178.

2. Some narrowly defined circumstances can provide a basis for inferring confidentiality. For example, it is reasonable to infer that paid
informants normally expect their cooperation with the FBI to be kept
confidential. Similarly, the character of the crime at issue and the
source's relation to the crime may be relevant to determining whether
a source cooperated with the FBI with an implied assurance of confidentiality. Most people would think that witnesses to a gang-related
murder likely would be unwilling to speak to the FBI except under such
conditions. The Court of Appeals erred in declining to rely on such
circumstances. This more particularized approach is consistent with
Congress' intent to provide workable FOIA disclosure rules. And
when a document containing confidential source information is requested, it is generally possible to establish the nature of the crime and
the source's relation to it. Thus, the requester will have a more realistic opportunity to develop an argument that the circumstances do not
support an inference of confidentiality. To the extent that the Govern508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:13 PAGES OPINPGT

ment's proof may compromise legitimate interests, the Government still
can attempt to meet its burden with in camera affidavits. Pp. 179-180.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5U. S. C. $ 552 (FOIA), exempts from disclosure agency records "compiled for law enforcement purposes . . . by crimi-nal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal
investigation" if release of those records "could reasonablybe expected to disclose" the identity of, or information provided by, a "confidential source." $ 552(b)(7)(D). This caseconcerns the evidentiary showing that the Government must
make to establish that a source is "confidential" within themeaning of Exemption 7(D). We are asked to decide
whether the Government is entitled to a presumption thatall sources supplying information to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI or Bureau) in the course of a criminalinvestigation are confidential sources.

Respondent Vincent Landano was convicted in New Jer-sey state court for murdering Newark, New Jersey, police

officer John Snow in the course of a robbery. The crimereceived considerable media attention. Evidence at trial
showed that the robbery had been orchestrated by VictorForni and a motorcycle gang known as "the Breed." There

Opinion of the Court
was testimony that Landano, though not a Breed member,had been recruited for the job. Landano always has maintained that he did not participate in the robbery and thatForni, not he, killed Officer Snow. He contends that the
prosecution withheld material exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).Although his efforts to obtain state postconviction and

federal habeas relief thus far have proved unsuccessful, see
Landano v. Rafferty, 897 F. 2d 661 (CA3), cert. denied, 498
U. S. 811 (1990); Landano v. Rafferty, 856 F. 2d 569 (CA31988), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1014 (1989);

State v. Landano,
97 N. J. 620, 483 A. 2d 153 (1984), Landano apparently is currently pursuing a Brady claim in the state courts, see Landano v. Rafferty, 970 F. 2d 1230, 1233-1237 (CA3), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 955 (1992); Brief for Petitioners 3, n. 1.
Seeking evidence to support that claim, Landano filed FOIA
requests with the FBI for information that the Bureau had
compiled in the course of its involvement in the investigation
of Officer Snow's murder. Landano sought release of the
Bureau's files on both Officer Snow and Forni. The FBI released several hundred pages of documents. The Bureau redacted some of these, however, and withheld several hundred
other pages altogether.

Landano filed an action in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey seeking disclosure of the
entire contents of the requested files. In response, the
Government submitted a declaration of FBI Special Agent
Regina Superneau explaining the Bureau's reasons for withholding portions of the files. The information withheld
under Exemption 7(D) included information provided by five
types of sources: regular FBI informants; individual witnesses who were not regular informants; state and local law
enforcement agencies; other local agencies; and private financial or commercial institutions. Superneau Declaration,
App. 28. Agent Superneau explained why, in the Government's view, all such sources should be presumed confiden508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tial. The deleted portions of the files were coded to indicate
which type of source each involved. The Bureau provided
no other information about the withheld materials. Id., at
33-41.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District
Court largely rejected the Government's categorical explanations. See 751 F. Supp. 502 (NJ 1990), clarified on reconsideration, 758 F. Supp. 1021 (NJ 1991). There was no dispute that the undisclosed portions of the Snow and Forni
files constituted records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes by criminal law enforcement authority
in the course of a criminal investigation. The District Court
concluded, however, that the Government had not met its
burden of establishing that each withheld document reasonably could be expected to disclose the identity of, or information provided by, a "confidential source." Although the
court evidently was willing to assume that regular FBI informants were confidential sources, it held that the FBI had
to articulate "case-specific reasons for non-disclosure" of
all other information withheld under Exemption 7(D). 751
F. Supp., at 508.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in
relevant part. 956 F. 2d 422 (1992). Relying on legislative
history, the court stated that a source is confidential within
the meaning of Exemption 7(D) if the source received an explicit assurance of confidentiality or if there are circumstances " `from which such an assurance could reasonably be
inferred.' " Id., at 433 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-1200, p. 13
(1974)). An "assurance of confidentiality," the court said, is
not a promise of absolute anonymity or secrecy, but "an
assurance that the FBI would not directly or indirectly disclose the cooperation of the interviewee with the investigation unless such a disclosure is determined by the FBI to be
important to the success of its law enforcement objective."
956 F. 2d, at 434.

Opinion of the Court
The court then addressed the Government's argument thata presumption of confidentiality arises whenever any individual or institutional source supplies information to the Bu-reau during a criminal investigation. As the Court of Appeals phrased it, the issue was "whether the fact that the
source supplied information to the FBI in the course of acriminal investigation is alone sufficient to support an inference that the source probably had a reasonable expecta-tion that no unnecessary disclosure of his or her cooperation would occur." Ibid. The court thought the question"close."

Ibid. On one hand, the Bureau tends to investigate significant criminal matters, and the targets of those
investigations are likely to resent cooperating witnesses.
This is especially so where, as here, the investigation concerns a highly publicized, possibly gang-related police shooting. Id., at 434, and n. 5. On the other hand, the court
recognized that "there are undoubtedly many routine FBI
interviews in the course of criminal investigations that are
unlikely to give rise to similar apprehensions on the part of
the interviewee." Id., at 434.

The Court of Appeals recognized that a number of other
courts had adopted the Government's position. See, e. g.,
Nadler v. United States Dept. of Justice, 955 F. 2d 1479,
1484-1487 (CA11 1992); Schmerler v. FBI, 283 U. S. App.
D. C. 349, 353, 900 F. 2d 333, 337 (1990); Donovan v. FBI,
806 F. 2d 55, 61 (CA2 1986); Johnson v. United States Dept.
of Justice, 739 F. 2d 1514, 1517-1518 (CA10 1984); Ingle v.
Department of Justice, 698 F. 2d 259, 269 (CA6 1983); Miller
v. Bell, 661 F. 2d 623, 627 (CA7 1981) (per curiam), cert.
denied, 456 U. S. 960 (1982). Considering itself bound by
its previous decision in Lame v. United States Department
of Justice, 654 F. 2d 917 (CA3 1981), however, the Court of
Appeals took a different view. It declined to rely either on
the Government's proposed presumption or on the particular
subject matter of the investigation. Instead, it determined
that, to justify withholding information under Exemption

7(D), the Government had to provide " `detailed explanationsrelating to each alleged confidential source.' " 956 F. 2d, at

435 (quoting Lame, supra, at 928).We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
Courts of Appeals over the nature of the FBI's evidentiaryburden under Exemption 7(D). 506 U. S. 813 (1992).

II

A
Exemption 7(D) permits the Government to withhold

"records or information compiled for law enforcementpurposes, but only to the extent that the production of

such law enforcement records or information . . . couldreasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreignagency or authority or any private institution which
furnished information on a confidential basis, and, inthe case of a record or information compiled by criminal
law enforcement authority in the course of a criminalinvestigation . . . , information furnished by a confidential source." $ 552(b)(7)(D).
The Government bears the burden of establishing that theexemption applies. $ 552(a)(4)(B).

We have described the evolution of Exemption 7(D) else-where. See

John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U. S.146, 155-157 (1989);

FBI v. Abramson, 456 U. S. 615, 621-622 (1982). When FOIA was enacted in 1966, Exemption 7

broadly protected " `investigatory files compiled for law en-forcement purposes except to the extent available by law to
a private party.' " Id., at 621. Congress revised the statutein 1974 to provide that law enforcement records could be
withheld only if the agency demonstrated one of six enumer-ated harms. The 1974 version of Exemption 7(D) protected

" `investigatory records compiled for law enforcementpurposes [the production of which] would . . . disclose

508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:13 PAGES OPINPGT
172 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE v. LANDANO

Opinion of the Court
the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of arecord compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority

in the course of a criminal investigation, . . . confidentialinformation furnished only by the confidential source.' "
Id., at 622.
Congress adopted the current version of Exemption 7(D) in1986. The 1986 amendment expanded "records" to "records

or information," replaced the word "would" with the phrase"could reasonably be expected to," deleted the word "only"
from before "confidential source," and clarified that a con-fidential source could be a state, local, or foreign agency or
a private institution. See 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(7)(D).Under Exemption 7(D), the question is not whether the
requested document is of the type that the agency usuallytreats as confidential, but whether the particular source
spoke with an understanding that the communication wouldremain confidential. According to the Conference Report
on the 1974 amendment, a source is confidential within themeaning of Exemption 7(D) if the source "provided information under an express assurance of confidentiality or in cir-cumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred." S. Rep. No. 93-1200, at 13. In this case,the Government has not attempted to demonstrate that the
FBI made explicit promises of confidentiality to particularsources. That sort of proof apparently often is not possible:
The FBI does not have a policy of discussing confidentialitywith every source, and when such discussions do occur,
agents do not always document them. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8,47-48. The precise question before us, then, is how the Government can meet its burden of showing that a source pro-vided information on an implied assurance of confidentiality.
The parties dispute two issues: the meaning of the word"confidential," and whether, absent specific evidence to the
contrary, an implied assurance of confidentiality always canbe inferred from the fact that a source cooperated with the
FBI during a criminal investigation.

Opinion of the Court

B
Landano argues that the FBI's sources in the Snow inves-tigation could not have had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality because the Bureau might have been obliged todisclose the sources' names or the information they provided
under Brady, the Jencks Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 3500, or federaldiscovery rules, see Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 16, 26.2. He
also points out that some FBI witnesses invariably will becalled to testify publicly at trial. Landano apparently takes
the position that a source is "confidential" for purposes ofExemption 7(D) only if the source can be assured, explicitly
or implicitly, that the source's cooperation with the Bureauwill be disclosed to no one. We agree with the Court of
Appeals that this cannot have been Congress' intent.FOIA does not define the word "confidential." In common usage, confidentiality is not limited to complete anonym-ity or secrecy. A statement can be made "in confidence"
even if the speaker knows the communication will be sharedwith limited others, as long as the speaker expects that the
information will not be published indiscriminately. SeeWebster's Third New International Dictionary 476 (1986)
(defining confidential to mean "communicated, conveyed,[or] acted on . . . in confidence: known only to a limited
few: not publicly disseminated"). A promise of complete se-crecy would mean that the FBI agent receiving the source's
information could not share it even with other FBI person-nel. See Dow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice, 286
U. S. App. D. C. 349, 357, 917 F. 2d 571, 579 (1990) (Silber-man, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). Such
information, of course, would be of little use to the Bureau.We assume that Congress was aware of the Government's
disclosure obligations under Brady and applicable proceduralrules when it adopted Exemption 7(D). Congress also must
have realized that some FBI witnesses would testify at trial.We need not reach the question whether a confidential
source's public testimony "waives" the FBI's right to with508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:13 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
hold information provided by that source. See, e. g., Irons
v. FBI, 880 F. 2d 1446 (CA1 1989) (en banc). For present
purposes, it suffices to note that, at the time an interview is
conducted, neither the source nor the FBI agent ordinarily
knows whether the communication will be disclosed in any
of the aforementioned ways. Thus, an exemption so limited
that it covered only sources who reasonably could expect
total anonymity would be, as a practical matter, no exemption at all. Cf. John Doe, 493 U. S., at 152 (FOIA exemptions "are intended to have meaningful reach and application"). We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that
the word "confidential," as used in Exemption 7(D), refers to
a degree of confidentiality less than total secrecy. A source
should be deemed confidential if the source furnished information with the understanding that the FBI would not divulge the communication except to the extent the Bureau
thought necessary for law enforcement purposes.

C
The Government objects to the Court of Appeals' requirement that it make an individualized showing of confidentiality with respect to each source. It argues that an assurance
of confidentiality is " `inherently implicit' " whenever a source
cooperates with the FBI in a criminal investigation. Brief
for Petitioners 18-20 (quoting Miller v. Bell, 661 F. 2d, at
627). The Government essentially contends that all FBI
sources should be presumed confidential; the presumption
could be overcome only with specific evidence that a particular source had no interest in confidentiality.

This Court previously has upheld the use of evidentiary
presumptions supported by considerations of "fairness, public policy, and probability, as well as judicial economy."
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245 (1988). We also
have recognized the propriety of judicially created presumptions under federal statutes that make no express provision

175Cite as: 508 U. S. 165 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
for their use. See, e. g., ibid. But we are not persuadedthat the presumption for which the Government argues in

this case is warranted.Although the Government sometimes describes its approach as "categorical," see, e. g., Superneau Declaration,
App. 33-41, the proposed rule is not so much categorical asuniversal, at least with respect to FBI sources. The Government would have us presume that virtually every sourceis confidential: the paid informant who infiltrates an underworld organization; the eyewitness to a violent crime; thetelephone company that releases phone records; the state
agency that furnishes an address. The only "sources" that
the Government is willing to state are not presumptively
confidential (though they may be exempt from disclosure
under other FOIA provisions) are newspaper clippings, wiretaps, and witnesses who speak to an undercover agent and
therefore do not realize they are communicating with the
FBI. Although we recognize that confidentiality often will
be important to the FBI's investigative efforts, we cannot
say that the Government's sweeping presumption comports
with "common sense and probability." Basic Inc., supra,
at 246.

The FBI collects information from a variety of individual
and institutional sources during the course of a criminal investigation. See, e. g., Superneau Declaration, App. 35-41.
The Bureau's investigations also cover a wide range of criminal matters. See 28 U. S. C. $ 533 (FBI authorized to investigate "crimes against the United States" and to conduct
other investigations "regarding official matters under the
control of the Department of Justice and the Department of
State"); $ 540 (FBI authorized to investigate certain felonious killings of state and local law enforcement officers). In
this case, the Bureau participated in the investigation of a
state crime in part because of the need for interstate "unlawful flight" warrants to apprehend certain suspects. Brief
for Petitioners 2, n. 1. The types of information the Bureau

508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT
176 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE v. LANDANO

Opinion of the Court
collects during an investigation also appear to be quite diverse. Although the Government emphasizes the difficulty
of anticipating all the ways in which release of information
ultimately may prove harmful, it does not dispute that the
communications the FBI receives can range from the extremely sensitive to the routine.

The Government maintains that an assurance of confidentiality can be inferred whenever an individual source communicates with the FBI because of the risk of reprisal or
other negative attention inherent in criminal investigations.
See Superneau Declaration, App. 37-38. It acknowledges,
however, that reprisal may not be threatened or even likely
in any given case. Id., at 38. It may be true that many,
or even most, individual sources will expect confidentiality.
But the Government offers no explanation, other than ease
of administration, why that expectation always should be
presumed. The justifications offered for presuming the confidentiality of all institutional sources are less persuasive.
The Government "is convinced" that the willingness of other
law enforcement agencies to furnish information depends on
a "traditional understanding of confidentiality." Id., at 40.
There is no argument, however, that disclosure ordinarily
would affect cooperating agencies adversely or that the
agencies otherwise would be deterred from providing even
the most nonsensitive information. The Government does
suggest that private institutions might be subject to "possible legal action or loss of business" if their cooperation with
the Bureau became publicly known. Id., at 41. But the
suggestion is conclusory. Given the wide variety of information that such institutions may be asked to provide, we
do not think it reasonable to infer that the information is
given with an implied understanding of confidentiality in all
cases.

Considerations of "fairness" also counsel against the Government's rule. Basic Inc., supra, at 245. The Govern508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT

177Cite as: 508 U. S. 165 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
ment acknowledges that its proposed presumption, though
rebuttable in theory, is in practice all but irrebuttable. Tr.
of Oral Arg. 22-23. Once the FBI asserts that information
was provided by a confidential source during a criminal investigation, the requester--who has no knowledge about the
particular source or the information being withheld--very
rarely will be in a position to offer persuasive evidence that
the source in fact had no interest in confidentiality. See
Dow Jones & Co. v. Department of Justice, 286 U. S. App.
D. C., at 355, 917 F. 2d, at 577.

The Government contends that its presumption is supported by the phrase "could reasonably be expected to" and
by our decision in Department of Justice v. Reporters
Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S. 749 (1989). In Reporters Committee we construed Exemption 7(C), which
allows the Government to withhold law enforcement records
or information the production of which "could reasonably be
expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy." 5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(7)(C). We held that certain
criminal "rap sheet" information was categorically exempt
from disclosure because the release of such information invariably constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy.
489 U. S., at 780. Our approval of a categorical approach
was based in part on the phrase "could reasonably be expected to," which Congress adopted in 1986 to ease the Government's burden of invoking Exemption 7, see id., at 756,
n. 9, and to "replace a focus on the effect of a particular
disclosure `with a standard of reasonableness . . . based
on an objective test,' " id., at 778, n. 22 (quoting S. Rep.
No. 98-221, p. 24 (1983)). As explained more fully in Part
III, below, we agree with the Government that when certain
circumstances characteristically support an inference of confidentiality, the Government similarly should be able to claim
exemption under Exemption 7(D) without detailing the circumstances surrounding a particular interview. Neither the

508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT
178 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE v. LANDANO

Opinion of the Court
language of Exemption 7(D) nor Reporters Committee, however, supports the proposition that the category of all FBI
criminal investigative sources is exempt.

The Government relies extensively on legislative history.
It is true that, when Congress debated the adoption of Exemption 7(D), several Senators recognized the importance of
confidentiality to the FBI and argued that the exemption
should not jeopardize the effectiveness of the Bureau's investigations. See, e. g., 120 Cong. Rec. 17036, 17037 (May 30,
1974) (Sen. Thurmond) ("It is just such assurance [of confidentiality] that encourages individuals from all walks of life
to furnish this agency information . . ."). But Congress did
not expressly create a blanket exemption for the FBI; the
language that it adopted requires every agency to establish
that a confidential source furnished the information sought to
be withheld under Exemption 7(D). The Government cites
testimony presented to Congress prior to passage of the 1986
amendment emphasizing that the threat of public exposure
under FOIA deters potential sources from cooperating with
the Bureau in criminal investigations. See, e. g., FBI Oversight: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary,
96th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 97, 99-100, 106 (1980) (FBI Dir.
William Webster); see also Freedom of Information Act:
Hearings before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess.,
pp. 990-1040 (1981). But none of the changes made to Exemption 7(D) in 1986 squarely addressed the question presented here. In short, the Government offers no persuasive
evidence that Congress intended for the Bureau to be able
to satisfy its burden in every instance simply by asserting
that a source communicated with the Bureau during the
course of a criminal investigation. Had Congress meant
to create such a rule, it could have done so much more
clearly.

Opinion of the Court

III
Although we have determined that it is unreasonable toinfer that all FBI criminal investigative sources are confidential, we expect that the Government often can point tomore narrowly defined circumstances that will support the
inference. For example, as the courts below recognized, andrespondent concedes, see Brief for Respondent 46, it is reasonable to infer that paid informants normally expect theircooperation with the FBI to be kept confidential. The nature of the informant's ongoing relationship with the Bureau,and the fact that the Bureau typically communicates with
informants "only at locations and under conditions which as-sure the contact will not be noticed," Superneau Declaration,
App. 36, justify the inference.There may well be other generic circumstances in which
an implied assurance of confidentiality fairly can be inferred.The Court of Appeals suggested that the fact that the investigation in this case concerned the potentially gang-relatedshooting of a police officer was probative. We agree that
the character of the crime at issue may be relevant to de-termining whether a source cooperated with the FBI with
an implied assurance of confidentiality. So too may thesource's relation to the crime. Most people would think
that witnesses to a gang-related murder likely would be un-willing to speak to the Bureau except on the condition of
confidentiality.The Court of Appeals below declined to rely on such circumstances. But several other Court of Appeals decisions(including some of those the Government cites favorably)
have justified nondisclosure under Exemption 7(D) by exam-ining factors such as the nature of the crime and the source's
relation to it. See, e. g., Keys v. United States Dept. of Justice, 265 U. S. App. D. C. 189, 197-198, 830 F. 2d 337, 345-346 (1987) (individuals who provided information about subject's possible Communist sympathies, criminal activity, andmurder by foreign operatives would have worried about re508us1$75J 01-23-96 19:19:14 PAGES OPINPGT

taliation); Donovan v. FBI, 806 F. 2d, at 60-61 (on facts ofthis case, in which FBI investigated murder of American

churchwomen in El Salvador, "it cannot be doubted that theFBI's investigation would have been severely curtailed,
and, perhaps, rendered ineffective if its confidential sourcesfeared disclosure");

Parton v. United States Dept. of Justice,727 F. 2d 774, 776-777 (CA8 1984) (prison officials who provided information about alleged attack on inmate faced "highprobability of reprisal"); Miller v. Bell, 661 F. 2d, at 628 (individuals who provided information about self-proclaimedlitigious subject who sought to enlist them in his "antigovernment crusade" faced "strong potential for harass-ment");

who informed on guards who allegedly beat another inmatesupported finding of implied assurance of confidentiality).

We think this more particularized approach is consistentwith Congress' intent to provide " ` "workable" rules' " of
FOIA disclosure. Reporters Committee, 489 U. S., at 779(quoting

FTC v. Grolier Inc., 462 U. S. 19, 27 (1983)); seealso EPA v. Mink, 410 U. S. 73, 80 (1973). The Government

does not deny that, when a document containing confidentialsource information is requested, it generally will be possible
to establish factors such as the nature of the crime that wasinvestigated and the source's relation to it. Armed with this
information, the requester will have a more realistic oppor-tunity to develop an argument that the circumstances do not
support an inference of confidentiality. To the extent thatthe Government's proof may compromise legitimate interests, of course, the Government still can attempt to meet itsburden with

in camera affidavits.

The Government has argued forcefully that its ability tomaintain the confidentiality of all of its sources is vital to

effective law enforcement. A prophylactic rule protecting

Opinion of the Court
the identities of all FBI criminal investigative sources un-doubtedly would serve the Government's objectives and

would be simple for the Bureau and the courts to administer.But we are not free to engraft that policy choice onto the
statute that Congress passed. For the reasons we have dis-cussed, and consistent with our obligation to construe FOIA
exemptions narrowly in favor of disclosure, see, e. g., John
Doe, 493 U. S., at 152; Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425U. S. 352, 361-362 (1976), we hold that the Government is

not entitled to a presumption that a source is confidentialwithin the meaning of Exemption 7(D) whenever the source
provides information to the FBI in the course of a criminalinvestigation.

More narrowly defined circumstances, however, can pro-vide a basis for inferring confidentiality. For example, when
circumstances such as the nature of the crime investigatedand the witness' relation to it support an inference of confidentiality, the Government is entitled to a presumption.In this case, the Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that
it lacked discretion to rely on such circumstances. Accord-ingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.

LINCOLN, ACTING DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH

SERVICE, et al. v. VIGIL et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 91-1833. Argued March 3, 1993--Decided May 24, 1993
The Indian Health Service receives yearly lump-sum appropriations from

Congress, and expends the funds under authority of the Snyder Act
and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to provide health care
for American Indian and Alaska Native people. Out of these appropriations the Service funded, from 1978 to 1985, the Indian Children's
Program (Program), which provided clinical services to handicapped
Indian children in the Southwest. Congress never expressly authorized or appropriated funds for the Program but was apprised of its
continuing operation. In 1985, the Service announced that it was discontinuing direct clinical services under the Program in order to establish a nationwide treatment program. Respondents, Indian children
eligible to receive services under the Program, filed this action against
petitioners (collectively, the Service), alleging, inter alia, that the decision to discontinue services violated the federal trust responsibility
to Indians, the Snyder Act, the Improvement Act, the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
In granting summary judgment for respondents, the District Court held
that the Service's decision was subject to judicial review, rejecting the
argument that the decision was "committed to agency discretion by law"
under the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2). The court declined to address
the merits of the Service's action, however, holding that the decision
to discontinue the Program amounted to a "legislative rule" subject to
the APA's notice-and-comment requirements, $ 553, which the Service
had not fulfilled. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, even
though no statute or regulation mentioned the Program, the repeated
references to it in the legislative history of the annual appropriations
Acts, in combination with the special relationship between Indian people
and the Federal Government, provided a basis for judicial review. The
court also reasoned that this Court's decision in Morton v. Ruiz, 415
U. S. 199, required the Service to abide by the APA's notice-andcomment procedures before cutting back on a congressionally created
and funded program for Indians.

Held:

1. The Service's decision to discontinue the Program was "committed
to agency discretion by law" and therefore not subject to judicial review
under $ 701(a)(2). Pp. 190-195.

(a) Section 701(a)(2) precludes review of certain categories of administrative decisions that courts traditionally have regarded as "committed to agency discretion." The allocation of funds from a lump-sum
appropriation is such a decision. It is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that where Congress merely appropriates lump-sum
amounts without statutory restriction, a clear inference may be drawn
that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the
funds should, or are expected to, be spent do not establish any legal
requirements on the agency. As long as the agency allocates the
funds to meet permissible statutory objectives, courts may not intrude
under $ 701(a)(2). Pp. 190-193.

(b) The decision to terminate the Program was committed to the
Service's discretion. The appropriations Acts do not mention the Program, and both the Snyder and Improvement Acts speak only in general
terms about Indian health. The Service's representations to Congress
about the Program's operation do not translate through the medium of
legislative history into legally binding obligations, and reallocating resources to assist handicapped Indian children nationwide clearly falls
within the Service's statutory mandate. In addition, whatever its contours, the special trust relationship existing between Indian people and
the Federal Government cannot limit the Service's discretion to reorder
its priorities from serving a subgroup of beneficiaries to serving the
class of all Indians nationwide. Pp. 193-195.

(c) Respondents' argument that the Program's termination violated
their due process rights is left for the Court of Appeals to address on
remand. While the APA contemplates that judicial review will be
available for colorable constitutional claims absent a clear expression of
contrary congressional intent, the record at this stage does not allow
mature consideration of constitutional issues. P. 195.

2. The Service was not required to abide by $ 553's notice-andcomment rulemaking procedures before terminating the Program, even
assuming that the statement terminating the Program would qualify as
a "rule" within the meaning of the APA. Termination of the Program
might be seen as affecting the Service's organization, but $ 553(b)(A)
exempts "rules of agency organization" from notice-and-comment
requirements. Moreover, $ 553(b)(A) exempts "general statements of
policy," and, whatever else that term may cover, it surely includes an508us1$76M 02-13-97 17:42:13 PAGES OPINPGT

nouncements of the sort at issue here. This analysis is confirmed by
Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, which
stands for the proposition that decisions to expend otherwise unrestricted funds are not, without more, subject to $ 553's notice-andcomment requirements. Finally, the Court of Appeals erred in holding
that Morton v. Ruiz, supra, required the Service to abide by $ 553's
notice-and-comment requirements. Those requirements were not at
issue in Ruiz. Pp. 195-199.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
For several years in the late 1970's and early 1980's, theIndian Health Service provided diagnostic and treatment

services, referred to collectively as the Indian Children'sProgram (Program), to handicapped Indian children in the
Southwest. In 1985, the Service decided to reallocate theProgram's resources to a nationwide effort to assist such
children. We hold that the Service's decision to discontinuethe Program was "committed to agency discretion by law"
and therefore not subject to judicial review under the Ad-ministrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2), and that
the Service's exercise of that discretion was not subject to
the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements imposedby $ 553.

Opinion of the Court

I
The Indian Health Service, an agency within the PublicHealth Service of the Department of Health and Human

Services, provides health care for some 1.5 million AmericanIndian and Alaska Native people. Brief for Petitioners 2.
The Service receives yearly lump-sum appropriations fromCongress and expends the funds under authority of the
Snyder Act, 42 Stat. 208, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 13, andthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act, 90 Stat. 1400,
as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 1601 et seq. So far as it concernsus here, the Snyder Act authorizes the Service to "expend
such moneys as Congress may from time to time appropri-ate, for the benefit, care, and assistance of the Indians," for
the "relief of distress and conservation of health." 25U. S. C. $ 13.

1 The Improvement Act authorizes expenditures for, inter alia, Indian mental-health care, and specifi-cally for "therapeutic and residential treatment centers."

$ 1621(a)(4)(D).The Service employs roughly 12,000 people and operates
more than 500 health-care facilities in the continental UnitedStates and Alaska. See Hearings on Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1993 beforea Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations,
102d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 4, p. 32 (1992); Brief for Petitioners2. This case concerns a collection of related services, commonly known as the Indian Children's Program, that theService provided from 1978 to 1985. In the words of the
Court of Appeals, a "clou[d] [of] bureaucratic haze" obscuresthe history of the Program, Vigil v. Rhoades, 953 F. 2d 1225,
1226 (CA10 1992), which seems to have grown out of a plan"to establish therapeutic and residential treatment centers

1 By its terms, the Snyder Act applies to the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
an agency within the Department of the Interior. Under 42 U. S. C.

$ 2001(a), however, the Bureau's authorities and responsibilities with respect to "the conservation of the health of Indians" have been transferred
to the Department of Health and Human Services.

for disturbed Indian children." H. R. Rep. No. 94-1026,pt. 1, p. 80 (1976) (prepared in conjunction with enactment

of the Improvement Act). These centers were to be estab-lished under a "major cooperative care agreement" between
the Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, id., at 81, and
would have provided such children "with intensive care in aresidential setting."

Id., at 80.
Congress never expressly appropriated funds for thesecenters. In 1978, however, the Service allocated approximately $292,000 from its fiscal year 1978 appropriation to itsoffice in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the planning and development of a pilot project for handicapped Indian children,
which became known as the Indian Children's Program.
See 953 F. 2d, at 1227. The pilot project apparently convinced the Service that a building was needed, and, in 1979,
the Service requested $3.5 million from Congress to construct a diagnostic and treatment center for handicapped
Indian children. See ibid.; Hearings on Department of the
Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1980 before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 8, p. 250 (1979) (hereinafter
House Hearings (Fiscal Year 1980)). The appropriation for
fiscal year 1980 did not expressly provide the requested
funds, however, and legislative reports indicated only that
Congress had increased the Service's funding by $300,000 for
nationwide expansion and development of the Program in
coordination with the Bureau. See H. R. Rep. No. 96-374,
pp. 82-83 (1979); S. Rep. No. 96-363, p. 91 (1979).

Plans for a national program to be managed jointly by the
Service and the Bureau were never fulfilled, however, and
the Program continued simply as an offering of the Service's
Albuquerque office, from which the Program's staff of 11 to
16 employees would make monthly visits to Indian communities in New Mexico and southern Colorado and on the Navajo
and Hopi Reservations. Brief for Petitioners 6. The Program's staff provided "diagnostic, evaluation, treatment

never authorized or appropriated moneys expressly for the
Program, and the Service continued to pay for its regional
activities out of annual lump-sum appropriations from 1980
to 1985, during which period the Service repeatedly apprised
Congress of the Program's continuing operation. See, e. g.,

188 LINCOLN v. VIGIL

Opinion of the Court
Nevertheless, the Service had not abandoned the proposalfor a nationwide treatment program, and in June 1985 it notified those who referred patients to the Program that it was"re-evaluating [the Program's] purpose . . . as a national mental health program for Indian children and adolescents."App. 77. In August 1985, the Service determined that Program staff hitherto assigned to provide direct clinical serv-ices should be reassigned as consultants to other nationwide
Service programs, 953 F. 2d, at 1226, and discontinued thedirect clinical services to Indian children in the Southwest.
The Service announced its decision in a memorandum, datedAugust 21, 1985, addressed to Service offices and Program
referral sources:

"As you are probably aware, the Indian Children's Pro-gram has been involved in planning activities focusing

on a national program effort. This process has in-cluded the termination of all direct clinical services to
children in the Albuquerque, Navajo and Hopi reserva-tion service areas. During the months of August and
September, . . . staff will [see] children followed by theprogram in an effort to update programs, identify alternative resources and facilitate obtaining alternativeservices. In communities where there are no identified
resources, meetings with community service providerswill be scheduled to facilitate the networking between
agencies to secure or advocate for appropriate services."App. 80.

The Service invited public "input" during this "difficult tran-sition," and explained that the reallocation of resources had
been "motivated by our goal of increased mental health serv-ices for all Indian [c]hildren."

2 As of August 1985, the Program was providing services for 426 handicapped Indian children, and the Bureau continues to provide services for
such children in discharging its responsibilities under the Education for

Opinion of the Court
Respondents, handicapped Indian children eligible to re-ceive services through the Program, subsequently brought

this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against peti-tioners, the Director of the Service and others (collectively,
the Service), in the United States District Court for the
District of New Mexico. Respondents alleged, inter alia,that the Service's decision to discontinue direct clinical services violated the federal trust responsibility to Indians,the Snyder Act, the Improvement Act, the Administrative
Procedure Act, various agency regulations, and the FifthAmendment's Due Process Clause.

The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents. Vigil v. Rhoades, 746 F. Supp. 1471 (1990). The
District Court held that the Service's decision to discontinue the Program was subject to judicial review, rejecting
the argument that the Service's decision was "committed
to agency discretion by law" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 701(a)(2). 746 F. Supp., at
1479. The court declined on ripeness grounds, however, to
address the merits of the Service's action. It held that the
Service's decision to discontinue the Program amounted to
the making of a "legislative rule" subject to the APA's
notice-and-comment requirements, 5 U. S. C. $ 553, and that
the termination was also subject to the APA's publication
requirements for the adoption of "statements of general policy," $ 552(a)(1)(D). See 746 F. Supp., at 1480, 1483. Because the Service had not met these procedural requirements, the court concluded that the termination was
procedurally invalid and that judicial review would be "premature." Id., at 1483. The court ordered the Service to
reinstate the Program, id., at 1486-1487, and the Solicitor
General has represented that a reinstated Program is now
in place. Brief for Petitioners 9.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. Like the District Court,
it rejected the Service's argument that the decision to discontinue the Program was committed to agency discretion

190 LINCOLN v. VIGIL

Opinion of the Court
under the APA. Although the court concededly could iden-tify no statute or regulation even mentioning the Program,

see 953 F. 2d, at 1229, it believed that the repeated refer-ences to it in the legislative history of the annual appropriations Acts, supra, at 187, "in combination with the spe-cial relationship between the Indian people and the federal
government," 953 F. 2d, at 1230, provided a basis for judicialreview. The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District
Court's ruling that the Service was subject to the APA'snotice-and-comment procedures in terminating the Program,
reasoning that our decision in Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199(1974), requires as much whenever the Federal Government
" `cuts back congressionally created and funded programs forIndians.' " 953 F. 2d, at 1231 (citation omitted). The Court
of Appeals did not consider whether the APA's publicationrequirements applied to the Service's decision to terminate
the Program or whether the District Court's order to rein-state the Program was a proper form of relief, an issue the
Service had failed to raise. Id., at 1231-1232. We grantedcertiorari to address the narrow questions presented by the
Court of Appeals's decision. 506 U. S. 813 (1992).

II
First is the question whether it was error for the Court ofAppeals to hold the substance of the Service's decision to

terminate the Program reviewable under the APA. TheAPA provides that "[a] person suffering legal wrong because
of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved byagency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is
entitled to judicial review thereof," 5 U. S. C. $ 702, and wehave read the APA as embodying a "basic presumption of
judicial review," Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S.136, 140 (1967). This is "just" a presumption, however,
Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 349(1984), and under $ 701(a)(2) agency action is not subject to
judicial review "to the extent that" such action "is committed

191Cite as: 508 U. S. 182 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
to agency discretion by law." 3 As we explained in Hecklerv. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 830 (1985), $ 701(a)(2) makes it clear

that "review is not to be had" in those rare circumstanceswhere the relevant statute "is drawn so that a court would
have no meaningful standard against which to judge theagency's exercise of discretion." See also

Webster v. Doe,486 U. S. 592, 599-600 (1988); Citizens to Preserve Overton

Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 410 (1971). "In such acase, the statute (`law') can be taken to have `committed' the
decisionmaking to the agency's judgment absolutely." Heck-ler, supra, at 830.

Over the years, we have read $ 701(a)(2) to preclude judi-cial review of certain categories of administrative decisions
that courts traditionally have regarded as "committed toagency discretion." See

Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505U. S. 788, 817 (1992) (
Stevens, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment);

Webster, supra, at 609 (Scalia, J.,dissenting). In Heckler itself, we held an agency's decision

not to institute enforcement proceedings to be presump-tively unreviewable under $ 701(a)(2). 470 U. S., at 831. An
agency's "decision not to enforce often involves a complicatedbalancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within
its expertise," ibid., and for this and other good reasons, weconcluded, "such a decision has traditionally been `committed
to agency discretion,' " id., at 832. Similarly, in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270, 282 (1987), we held that$ 701(a)(2) precludes judicial review of another type of administrative decision traditionally left to agency discretion, anagency's refusal to grant reconsideration of an action because
of material error. In so holding, we emphasized "the impos-sibility of devising an adequate standard of review for such

3 In full, $ 701(a) provides: "This chapter [relating to judicial review]
applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that--
(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to
agency discretion by law." The parties have not addressed, and we have
no occasion to consider, the application of $ 701(a)(1) in this case.

Opinion of the Court
agency action." Ibid. Finally, in Webster, supra, at 599-
601, we held that $ 701(a)(2) precludes judicial review of a
decision by the Director of Central Intelligence to terminate
an employee in the interests of national security, an area of
executive action "in which courts have long been hesitant to
intrude." Franklin, supra, at 819 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment).

The allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is
another administrative decision traditionally regarded as
committed to agency discretion. After all, the very point of
a lump-sum appropriation is to give an agency the capacity
to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory
responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way. See International Union, United Automobile,
Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America
v. Donovan, 241 U. S. App. D. C. 122, 128, 746 F. 2d 855,
861 (1984) (Scalia, J.) ("A lump-sum appropriation leaves it
to the recipient agency (as a matter of law, at least) to distribute the funds among some or all of the permissible objects as it sees fit") (footnote omitted), cert. denied sub nom.
Automobile Workers v. Brock, 474 U. S. 825 (1985); 2 United
States General Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, p. 6-159 (2d ed. 1992). For this reason, a
fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where
"Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without
statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a
clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee reports
and other legislative history as to how the funds should or
are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on" the agency. LTV Aerospace Corp., 55 Comp. Gen.
307, 319 (1975); cf. American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB, 499
U. S. 606, 616 (1991) (statements in committee reports do not
have the force of law); TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 191 (1978)
("Expressions of committees dealing with requests for ap508us1$76M 02-13-97 17:42:13 PAGES OPINPGT

193Cite as: 508 U. S. 182 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
propriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by
Congress"). Put another way, a lump-sum appropriation
reflects a congressional recognition that an agency must be
allowed "flexibility to shift . . . funds within a particular . . .
appropriation account so that" the agency "can make necessary adjustments for `unforeseen developments' " and
" `changing requirements.' " LTV Aerospace Corp., supra,
at 318 (citation omitted).

Like the decision against instituting enforcement proceedings, then, an agency's allocation of funds from a lump-sum
appropriation requires "a complicated balancing of a number
of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise": whether
its "resources are best spent" on one program or another;
whether it "is likely to succeed" in fulfilling its statutory
mandate; whether a particular program "best fits the
agency's overall policies"; and, "indeed, whether the agency
has enough resources" to fund a program "at all." Heckler,
470 U. S., at 831. As in Heckler, so here, the "agency is far
better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities." Id.,
at 831-832. Of course, an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities: Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting
restrictions in the operative statutes (though not, as we have
seen, just in the legislative history). See id., at 833. And,
of course, we hardly need to note that an agency's decision
to ignore congressional expectations may expose it to grave
political consequences. But as long as the agency allocates
funds from a lump-sum appropriation to meet permissible
statutory objectives, $ 701(a)(2) gives the courts no leave to
intrude. "[T]o [that] extent," the decision to allocate funds
"is committed to agency discretion by law." $ 701(a)(2).

The Service's decision to discontinue the Program is accordingly unreviewable under $ 701(a)(2). As the Court of
Appeals recognized, the appropriations Acts for the relevant

Opinion of the Court
period do not so much as mention the Program,4 and both
the Snyder Act and the Improvement Act likewise speak
about Indian health only in general terms. It is true that
the Service repeatedly apprised Congress of the Program's
continued operation, but, as we have explained, these representations do not translate through the medium of legislative
history into legally binding obligations. The reallocation of
agency resources to assist handicapped Indian children nationwide clearly falls within the Service's statutory mandate
to provide health care to Indian people, see supra, at 185,
and respondents, indeed, do not seriously contend otherwise.
The decision to terminate the Program was committed to the
Service's discretion.

The Court of Appeals saw a separate limitation on the
Service's discretion in the special trust relationship existing
between Indian people and the Federal Government. 953
F. 2d, at 1230-1231. We have often spoken of this relationship, see, e. g., Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831)
(Marshall, C. J.) (Indians' "relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian"), and the law is "well
established that the Government in its dealings with Indian
tribal property acts in a fiduciary capacity," United States v.
Cherokee Nation of Okla., 480 U. S. 700, 707 (1987); see also

4 Significantly, Congress did see fit on occasion to impose other statutory
restrictions on the Service's allocation of funds from its lump-sum appropriations. For example, the appropriations Act for fiscal year 1985 provided that "none of the funds appropriated under this Act to [the Service]
shall be available for the initial lease of permanent structures without
advance provision therefor in appropriations Acts." Pub. L. 98-473, 98
Stat. 1864. Similarly, the appropriations Act for fiscal year 1983 provided
that "notwithstanding current regulations, eligibility for Indian Health
Services shall be extended to non-Indians in only two situations: (1) a
non-Indian woman pregnant with an eligible Indian's child for the duration
of her pregnancy through postpartum, and (2) non-Indian members of an
eligible Indian's household if the medical officer in charge determines that
this is necessary to control acute infectious disease or a public health
hazard." Pub. L. 97-394, 96 Stat. 1990.

Opinion of the Court
Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 80 (1908) (distinguishingbetween money appropriated to fulfill treaty obligations, to

which trust relationship attaches, and "gratuitous appro-priations"). Whatever the contours of that relationship,
though, it could not limit the Service's discretion to reorderits priorities from serving a subgroup of beneficiaries to
serving the broader class of all Indians nationwide. See
Hoopa Valley Tribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA91986) (Federal Government "does have a fiduciary obligation

to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary obligation that is owed toall Indian tribes") (emphasis added).

One final note: although respondents claimed in the Dis-trict Court that the Service's termination of the Program
violated their rights under the Fifth Amendment's Due Proc-ess Clause, see

supra, at 189, that court expressly declinedto address respondents' constitutional arguments, 746

F. Supp., at 1483, as did the Court of Appeals, 953 F. 2d,at 1228-1229, n. 3. Thus, while the APA contemplates, in
the absence of a clear expression of contrary congressionalintent, that judicial review will be available for colorable constitutional claims, see Webster, 486 U. S., at 603-604, the rec-ord at this stage does not allow mature consideration of constitutional issues, which we leave for the Court of Appealson remand.

III
We next consider the Court of Appeals's holding, quiteapart from the matter of substantive reviewability, that before terminating the Program the Service was required toabide by the familiar notice-and-comment rulemaking provisions of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 553. Section 553 provides gen-erally that an agency must publish notice of a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and afford "interestedpersons an opportunity to participate . . . through submission
of written data, views, or arguments." $$ 553(b), (c). Thesame section also generally requires the agency to publish
a rule not less than 30 days before its effective date and

incorporate within it "a concise general statement" of therule's "basis and purpose." $$ 553(c), (d). There are exceptions, of course. Section 553 has no application, for example,to "a matter relating to agency management or personnel
or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts."$ 553(a)(2).

5 The notice-and-comment requirements apply,

moreover, only to so-called "legislative" or "substantive"rules; they do not apply to "interpretative rules, general

statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, proce-dure, or practice." $ 553(b). See

McLouth Steel Products
Corp. v. Thomas, 267 U. S. App. D. C. 367, 370, 838 F. 2d
1317, 1320 (1988); Community Nutrition Institute v. Young,260 U. S. App. D. C. 294, 296-297, 818 F. 2d 943, 945-946

regulations found in the APA").It is undisputed that the Service did not abide by these
notice-and-comment requirements before discontinuing the
Program and reallocating its resources. The Service ar-gues that it was free from any such obligation because its

decision to terminate the Program did not qualify as a "rule"within the meaning of the APA. Brief for Petitioners 29-34.
Respondents, to the contrary, contend that the Service's ac-tion falls well within the APA's broad definition of that
term. $ 551(4).6 Brief for Respondents 17-19. Determin5 In " `matter[s] relating to . . . benefits,' " the Secretary of Health and

Opinion of the Court
ing whether an agency's statement is what the APA calls a
"rule" can be a difficult exercise. We need not conduct that
exercise in this case, however. For even assuming that a
statement terminating the Program would qualify as a "rule"
within the meaning of the APA, it would be exempt from the
notice-and-comment requirements of $ 553.7 Termination of
the Program might be seen as affecting the Service's organization, but "rules of agency organization" are exempt from
notice-and-comment requirements under $ 553(b)(A). Moreover, $ 553(b)(A) also exempts "general statements of policy,"
which we have previously described as " `statements issued
by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary
power.' " Chrysler Corp., supra, at 302, n. 31 (quoting Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure
Act 30, n. 3 (1947)). Whatever else may be considered a
"general statemen[t] of policy," the term surely includes an
announcement like the one before us, that an agency will
discontinue a discretionary allocation of unrestricted funds
from a lump-sum appropriation.

Our decision in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.
Volpe, 401 U. S. 402 (1971), confirms our conclusion that the
Service was not required to follow the notice-and-comment
procedures of $ 553 before terminating the Program. Overton Park dealt with the Secretary of Transportation's decision to authorize the use of federal funds to construct
an interstate highway through a public park in Memphis,
Tennessee. Private citizens and conservation organizations

includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities,
appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing."

7 We express no view on the application of the publication requirements

of $ 552, or on the propriety of the relief granted by the District Court.
The Court of Appeals did not address these issues. See supra, at 190.

Opinion of the Court
claimed that the Secretary's decision violated federal stat-utes prohibiting the use of federal funds for such a purpose

where there existed a " `feasible and prudent' " alternativeroute,

id., at 405 (citations omitted), and argued, inter alia,
that the Secretary's determination was subject to judicial
review under the APA's "substantial evidence" standard, 5U. S. C. $ 706(2)(E). 401 U. S., at 414. In rejecting that

contention, we explained that the substantial-evidence testapplies, in addition to circumstances not relevant here, only
where "agency action is taken pursuant to [the] rulemakingprovision[s]" of $ 553. We held unequivocally that "[t]he
Secretary's decision to allow the expenditure of federal funds
to build [the highway] through [the park] was plainly not an
exercise of a rulemaking function." Ibid.

Overton Park is authority here for the proposition that
decisions to expend otherwise unrestricted funds are not,
without more, subject to the notice-and-comment requirements of $ 553. Although the Secretary's determination in
Overton Park was subject to statutory criteria of " `feasib[ility] and pruden[ce],' " id., at 405, the generality of those
standards underscores the administrative discretion inherent
in the determination (reviewable though it was), to which
the Service's discretionary authority to meet its obligations
under the Snyder and Improvement Acts is comparable. Indeed, respondents seek to distinguish Overton Park principally on the ground that the Service's determination altered
the eligibility criteria for Service assistance. See Brief for
Respondents 24-25. But the record fails to support the distinction, there being no indication that the Service's decision
to discontinue the Program (or, for that matter, to initiate it)
did anything to modify eligibility standards for Service care,
as distinct from affecting the availability of services in a particular geographic area. The Service's decision to reallocate
funds presumably did mean that respondents would no
longer receive certain services, but it did not alter the Service's criteria for providing assistance any more than the

Opinion of the Court
Service's initiation of the pilot project in 1978 altered thecriteria for assistance to Indians in South Dakota.

Nor, finally, do we think that the Court of Appeals was onsolid ground in holding that Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199
(1974), required the Service to abide by the APA's notice-and-comment provisions before terminating the Program.
Those provisions were not at issue in Ruiz, where respond-ents challenged a provision, contained in a Bureau of Indian
Affairs manual, that restricted eligibility for Indian assist-ance. Although the Bureau's own regulations required it to
publish the provision in the Federal Register, the Bureauhad failed to do so.

Id., at 233-234. We held that the Bu-reau's failure to abide by its own procedures rendered the

provision invalid, stating that, under those circumstances,the denial of benefits would be "inconsistent with `the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Governmentin its dealings with these dependent and sometimes exploited people.' " Id., at 236 (quoting Seminole Nation v.
United States, 316 U. S. 286, 296 (1942)). No such circum-stances exist here.

IV
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion. It is so ordered.

KEENE CORP. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 92-166. Argued March 23, 1993--Decided May 24, 1993
Petitioner Keene Corporation has been sued by thousands of plaintiffs

alleging injury from exposure to asbestos fibers and dust released from
Keene products. Claiming that it was following Government specifications in including asbestos within products supplied to Government
projects, and that it actually bought asbestos fiber from the Government, Keene filed two complaints against the United States in the
Court of Federal Claims to recoup some of the money it was paying to
litigate and settle the asbestos suits. At the time it filed each of the
complaints, Keene had a similar claim pending in another court; the
other actions were dismissed before the Court of Federal Claims ordered the dismissals at issue here. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed both cases on the authority of 28 U. S. C. $ 1500, which prohibits
it from exercising jurisdiction over a claim "for or in respect to which"
the plaintiff "has [a suit or process] pending" in any other court, finding
that Keene had the same claims pending in other courts when it filed
the cases. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Section 1500 precludes Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over

Keene's actions. Pp. 205-218.

(a) In applying the jurisdictional bar here by looking to the facts
existing when Keene filed each of its complaints, the Court of Federal
Claims followed the longstanding principle that a court's jurisdiction
depends upon the state of things at the time the action is brought.
Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539. Keene gives no convincing reason for dispensing with this rule in favor of one that would look to the
facts at the time of the Court of Federal Claims' ruling on a motion to
dismiss. Although some of the provisions surrounding $ 1500 use the
phrase "jurisdiction to render judgment," $ 1500 speaks of "jurisdiction," without more; this fact only underscores the Court's duty to refrain from reading into the statute a phrase that Congress has left out.
Keene's appeal to statutory history is no more availing, since Congress
expressed no clear intent that a shift in the provision's language from
"file or prosecute" to "jurisdiction" indicated a change in the substantive law. Pp. 205-209.

(b) For the purposes of a possible dismissal under $ 1500, claims must
be compared to determine whether the plaintiff has a suit pending in

508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT

201Cite as: 508 U. S. 200 (1993)
Syllabus
another court "for or in respect to" the claim raised in the Court of
Federal Claims. That comparison turns on whether the plaintiff's other
suit is based on substantially the same operative facts as the Court of
Federal Claims action, at least if there is some overlap in the relief
requested, see Ex parte Skinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86; Corona
Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537, not on whether the actions are
based on different legal theories, see British American Tobacco Co. v.
United States, 89 Ct. Cl. 438 (per curiam). Since this interpretation of

$ 1500's immediate predecessor represented settled law when Congress
reenacted the "for or in respect to" language in 1948, the presumption
that Congress was aware of the earlier judicial interpretations and, in
effect, adopted them is applied here. Thus, the Court rejects Keene's
theory that $ 1500 does not apply here because the other pending suits
rested on legal theories that could not have been pleaded in the Court
of Federal Claims. Pp. 210-214.

(c) There is no need to address the question whether the Court of
Appeals's construction of $ 1500 is "a new rule of law" that ought to be
applied only prospectively under the test set out in Chevron Oil Co. v.
Huson, 404 U. S. 97, because Keene's claims were dismissed under wellsettled law. Finally, Keene's policy arguments should be addressed to
Congress. Pp. 215-218.

962 F. 2d 1013, affirmed.

Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Keene Corporation has been sued by thousands of plaintiffs alleging injury from exposure to asbestos fibers and
dust released from products made by Keene and by a company it acquired. In trying to recoup some of the money it
was paying to litigate and settle the cases, Keene filed two
complaints against the United States in the Court of Federal
Claims.1 When it filed each complaint, however, Keene had
a similar claim pending against the Government in another
court. We hold that 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 consequently precludes Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over Keene's
actions and affirm the dismissal of its complaints.

Opinion of the Court
1970's, plaintiffs began suing Keene in tort, alleging injuryor death from exposure to asbestos fibers. In a typical case

filed against Keene and other defendants in the DistrictCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania,

Miller v.
Johns-Manville Products Corp., No. 78-1283E, the plaintiff
alleged, on behalf of the estate of one Dzon, that the dece-dent had died of lung cancer caused by asbestos fibers and

dust inhaled during employment in 1943 and 1944. In June1979, Keene filed a third-party complaint against the United
States, alleging that any asbestos products to which Dzonwas exposed had been supplied to the Government in accordance with specifications set out in Government contracts,
and seeking indemnification or contribution from the Government for any damages Keene might have to pay the
plaintiff. This third-party action ended, however, in May
1980, when the District Court granted Keene's motion for
voluntary dismissal of its complaint.

In the meantime, in December 1979, with the Miller thirdparty action still pending, Keene filed the first of its two
complaints in issue here, seeking damages from the United
States in the Court of Federal Claims "for any amounts
which have been, or which may be recovered from Keene by
the claimants, by settlement or judgment." Keene Corp. v.
United States, No. 579-79C (Keene I), App. to Pet. for Cert.
H15. The "claimants" are defined as the plaintiffs in the
more than 2,500 lawsuits filed against Keene "by persons
alleging personal injury or death from inhalation of asbestos
fibers contained in thermal insulation products" manufactured or sold by Keene or its subsidiaries. Id., at H3.
Keene alleges conformance with Government specifications
in the inclusion of asbestos within the thermal insulation
products Keene supplied to Government shipyards and other
projects funded or controlled by the Government, and Keene
further claims that the Government even sold it some of
the asbestos fiber used in its products. Keene's theory of
recovery is breach by the United States of implied warran508us1$77M 03-17-97 14:45:01 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ties in contracts between the Government and Keene, a the-ory only the Court of Federal Claims may entertain, given

the amount of damages requested, under the Tucker Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1).

Keene's next move against the Government came the following month when it filed a 23-count complaint in the Dis-trict Court for the Southern District of New York.

Keene
Corp. v. United States, No. 80-CIV-0401(GLG). The plead-ings tracked, almost verbatim, the lengthy factual allegations of Keene I, but the action was recast in terms of varioustort theories, again seeking damages for any amounts paid
by Keene to asbestos claimants. Keene also added a takings
claim for the Government's allegedly improper recoupment,
under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA),
5 U. S. C. $ 8132, of money paid by Keene to claimants covered by the Act. For this, Keene sought restitution of "the
amounts of money which have been, or which may be, recouped by [the United States] from claimants from judgments and settlements paid by Keene," App. 37, as well as
an injunction against the Government's collection of FECA
refunds thereafter. This suit suffered dismissal in September 1981, on the basis of sovereign immunity, which the court
held unaffected by any waiver found in the Federal Tort
Claims Act, the Suits in Admiralty Act, and the Public Vessels Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Keene Corp. v.
United States, 700 F. 2d 836 (CA2 1983), and we denied certiorari, 464 U. S. 864 (1983).

Only five days before the Southern District's dismissal of
that omnibus action, Keene returned to the Court of Federal
Claims with the second of the complaints in issue here.
Keene Corp. v. United States, No. 585-81C (Keene II). Although this one, too, repeats many of the factual allegations
of Keene I, it adopts one of the theories raised in the Southern District case, seeking payment for "the amounts of
money that [the United States] has recouped" under FECA
from asbestos claimants paid by Keene. App. to Pet. for

Opinion of the Court
Cert. F10-F11. Again, the recoupments are said to betakings of Keene's property without due process and just

compensation, contrary to the Fifth Amendment. See 28
U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1) (covering, inter alia, certain claims
"founded . . . upon the Constitution").

After the Court of Federal Claims raised the present jurisdictional issue sua sponte in similar actions brought by
Johns-Manville, the Government invoked 28 U. S. C. $ 1500
in moving to dismiss both Keene I and Keene II, as well as
like actions by five other asbestos product manufacturers.
With trial imminent in the Johns-Manville cases, the Court
of Federal Claims initially granted the motion to dismiss
only as to them. Keene Corp. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct.
197 (1987). That decision was affirmed on appeal, JohnsManville Corp. v. United States, 855 F. 2d 1556 (CA Fed.
1988) (per curiam), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1066 (1989), and
the Court of Federal Claims then entered dismissals in
Keene I and Keene II, among other cases, finding that when
Keene had filed both Keene I and Keene II, it had the same
claims pending in other courts. 17 Cl. Ct. 146 (1989).
While a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
reversed on the ground that $ 1500 was inapplicable because
no other claim had been pending elsewhere when the Court
of Federal Claims entertained and acted upon the Government's motion to dismiss, UNR Industries, Inc. v. United
States, 911 F. 2d 654 (1990), the Court of Appeals, en banc,
subsequently vacated the panel opinion, 926 F. 2d 1109
(1990), and affirmed the trial court's dismissals, 962 F. 2d
1013 (1992). We granted certiorari. 506 U. S. 939 (1992).

II
The authority cited for dismissing Keene's complaints for
want of jurisdiction was 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 (1988 ed., Supp. IV):

"The United States Court of Federal Claims shall not
have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which

Opinion of the Court
the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any othercourt any suit or process against the United States or

any person who, at the time when the cause of actionalleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect
thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indi-rectly under the authority of the United States."

The lineage of this text runs back more than a century tothe aftermath of the Civil War, when residents of the Confederacy who had involuntarily parted with property (usu-ally cotton) during the war sued the United States for compensation in the Court of Claims, under the AbandonedProperty Collection Act, ch. 120, 12 Stat. 820 (1863). When
these cotton claimants had difficulty meeting the statutorycondition that they must have given no aid or comfort to
participants in the rebellion, see $ 3 of the Act, they re-sorted to separate suits in other courts seeking compensation not from the Government as such but from federal offi-cials, and not under the statutory cause of action but on tort
theories such as conversion. See Schwartz, Section 1500 ofthe Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 574-580 (1967).It was these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress to
prohibit anyone from filing or prosecuting in the Court ofClaims "any claim . . . for or in respect to which he . . . shall
have commenced and has pending" an action in any othercourt against an officer or agent of the United States. Act
of June 25, 1868, ch. 71, $ 8, 15 Stat. 77. The statute haslong outlived the cotton claimants, having been incorporated

its present form by the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat.942, 28 U. S. C. $ 1500.

Keene argues it was error for the courts below to applythe statute by focusing on facts as of the time Keene filed
its complaints (instead of the time of the trial court's rulingon the motion to dismiss) and to ignore differences said to
exist between the Court of Federal Claims actions and thosefiled in the District Courts. Neither assignment of error
will stand. A

Congress has the constitutional authority to define the ju-risdiction of the lower federal courts, see

Finley v. United
States, 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989), and, once the lines aredrawn, "limits upon federal jurisdiction . . . must be neither

disregarded nor evaded," Owen Equipment & Erection Co.v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 374 (1978). In $ 1500, Congress
has employed its power to provide that the Court of FederalClaims "shall not have jurisdiction" over a claim, "for or in
respect to which" the plaintiff "has [a suit or process] pend-ing" in any other court. In applying the jurisdictional bar
here by looking to the facts existing when Keene filed eachof its complaints, the Court of Federal Claims followed the
longstanding principle that "the jurisdiction of the Courtdepends upon the state of things at the time of the action
brought." Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824)(Marshall, C. J.); see

Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 69 (1987) (opinionof

gives us nothing to convince us that we should. Keene ar-gues that if $ 1500 spoke of "jurisdiction to render judgment" instead of "jurisdiction" pure and simple, the phrasewould "all but preclude" application of the time-of-filing rule.
Id., at 34. But, without deciding whether such a change ofterms would carry such significance, we have only to say
that $ 1500 speaks of "jurisdiction," without more, whereassome nearby sections of Title 28 use the longer phrase. This
fact only underscores our duty to refrain from reading aphrase into the statute when Congress has left it out.
" `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one sec-tion of a statute but omits it in another . . . , it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely inthe disparate inclusion or exclusion.' " Russello v. United
States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (citation omitted).Keene's next appeal, to statutory history, is no more availing. The immediate predecessor of $ 1500, $ 154 of the Judi-cial Code of 1911, provided that "[n]o person shall file or
prosecute in the Court of Claims . . . any claim for or inrespect to which he . . . has pending in any other court any
suit or process . . . ." Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, $ 154,36 Stat. 1138. With this express prohibition against filing
claims for which another suit was pending, there could, ofcourse, have been no doubt that at least a time-of-filing rule
applied. See Shapiro v. United States, 168 F. 2d 625, 626(CA3 1948) ($ 154 "forbids the filing" of a Little Tucker Act

3 On this score, Keene cites Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain,

accurate, for Keene has not shown that we should, even if we could. We
do note, however, that Newman-Green reiterated the principle that "[t]he
existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they
exist when the complaint is filed." 490 U. S., at 830.

current reference to "jurisdiction" in the comprehensiverevision of the Judicial Code completed in 1948, we do not
presume that the revision worked a change in the underlying
substantive law "unless an intent to make such [a] chang[e]is clearly expressed."

Since Keene, indeed, comes up with nothing to the contrary,we read the statute as continuing to bar jurisdiction over the

claim of a plaintiff who, upon filing, has an action pending in

any other court "for or in respect to" the same claim.4

The statutory notion of comparable claims is more elusive.By precluding jurisdiction over the claim of a plaintiff with

a suit pending in another court "for or in respect to" thesame claim, $ 1500 requires a comparison between the claims
raised in the Court of Federal Claims and in the other law-suit. The exact nature of the things to be compared is not
illuminated, however, by the awkward formulation of $ 1500.Nor does it advance the ball very far to recognize from the
statute's later reference to "the cause of action alleged insuch suit or process," that the term "claim" is used here
synonymously with "cause of action," see Black's Law Dic-tionary 247 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "claim" as "cause of action"), since, as both parties admit, "cause of action," like"claim," can carry a variety of meanings. See Brief for Petitioner 18; Brief for United States 15; see also JohnsManville Corp., 855 F. 2d, at 1560.Fortunately, though, we can turn to earlier readings of

the word "claim" as it appears in this statute. The phrase"any claim . . . for or in respect to which" has remained
unchanged since the statute was first adopted in 1868, seeAct of June 25, 1868, ch. 71, $ 8, 15 Stat. 77, and prior encounters with $ 154 of the Judicial Code of 1911, the immediate predecessor to $ 1500, shed some light on the issue.
Corona Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537 (1924), was
an action brought against the United States in the Court ofClaims, seeking compensation for coal requisitioned by the

Government. Before bringing its appeal to this Court, theplaintiff sued the President's agent in Federal District
Court, "the causes of action therein set forth being the sameas that set forth in the [Court of Claims] case."

appeal. Id., at 539-540. Later that year, we had the caseof a plaintiff seeking a writ of mandamus to stop the Court

of Claims from reinstating a suit it had dismissed earlier,without prejudice, on the plaintiff 's own motion. Ex parte
Skinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86 (1924). Skinner & Eddyhad sued the United States in the Court of Claims for nearly
$17.5 million; "[t]he largest item of the claim was for antici-pated profits on 25 vessels" covered by an order, later canceled, by the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation.
Id., at 91. After the Court of Claims had granted its motionto dismiss, Skinner & Eddy sued the Emergency Fleet Corporation in state court "on substantially the same causesof action as those sued for in the Court of Claims."

Id.,at 92. There was no question that the factual predicate of

each action was the same, except for the omission from thestate court action of any demand for anticipated profits, thus
limiting the damages sought to $9.1 million. We issued thewrit of mandamus, holding that $ 154 prevented the Court
of Claims from exercising jurisdiction over the claims it haddismissed earlier, given the intervening state court suit.

5

A few years later, the Court of Claims settled a key ques-tion only foreshadowed by Skinner & Eddy: whether $ 154

applied when the Court of Claims action and the "other"suit proceeded under different legal theories. In British
American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 89 Ct. Cl. 438 (1939)(per curiam), after the plaintiff had surrendered his gold
bullion to the Government (in compliance with executive or-ders and regulations that took this country off the gold

5 We have had one other encounter with this statute, in Matson Navigation Co. v. United States, 284 U. S. 352 (1932), where we relied on the
plain words of $ 154 to hold that the statute did not apply where the Court
of Claims plaintiff had brought suit in another court against the United
States, rather than against an agent of the United States, for the same
claim. When Congress reenacted the statute in 1948, it added the phrase
"against the United States" to close this loophole. See Act of June 25,
1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 942; Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, 855
F. 2d 1556, 1566-1567, and n. 15 (CA Fed. 1988).

standard), he sued in the Court of Claims on allegationsthat he had been underpaid by more than $4.3 million. Earlier the same day, the plaintiff had filed a suit in FederalDistrict Court "for the recovery of the same amount for the
same gold bullion surrendered." Id., at 439. The Court ofClaims observed that "[t]he only distinction between the two
suits instituted in the District Court and in this court is thatthe action in the District Court was made to sound in tort
and the action in this court was alleged on contract." Id.,at 440. Because the two actions were based on the same
operative facts, the court dismissed the Court of Claimsaction for lack of jurisdiction, finding it to be "clear that the
word `claim,' as used in section 154, . . . has no reference tothe legal theory upon which a claimant seeks to enforce his
demand." Ibid.These precedents demonstrate that under the immediate
predecessor of $ 1500, the comparison of the two cases forpurposes of possible dismissal would turn on whether the
plaintiff 's other suit was based on substantially the sameoperative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least if
there was some overlap in the relief requested.6 See Skin-ner & Eddy, supra; Corona Coal, supra. That the two actions were based on different legal theories did not matter.See British American Tobacco, supra. Since Keene has
given us no reason to doubt that these cases representedsettled law when Congress reenacted the "claim for or in
respect to which" language in 1948, see 62 Stat. 942, weapply the presumption that Congress was aware of these
earlier judicial interpretations and, in effect, adopted them.

6 Because the issue is not presented on the facts of this case, we need
not decide whether two actions based on the same operative facts, but
seeking completely different relief, would implicate $ 1500. Cf. Casman

Opinion of the Court
not apply when there is no "settled judicial construction" atthe time of reenactment). The decision in

British American Tobacco strikes us, moreover, as a sensible reading ofthe statute, for it honors Congress's decision to limit Court

of Federal Claims jurisdiction not only as to claims "for . . .
which" the plaintiff has sued in another court, but as tothose "in respect to which" he has sued elsewhere as well.

While the latter language does not set the limits of claimidentity with any precision, it does make it clear that Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered useless by anarrow concept of identity providing a correspondingly liberal opportunity to maintain two suits arising from the samefactual foundation.

Keene nonetheless argues, for the first time in its merits
brief,7 that "[a] claim brought outside the [Court of FederalClaims] is `for or in respect to' a claim in the [Court of

Federal Claims only] when claim-splitting law would treat
them as the same--i. e., require them to be joined in a single
suit--if the two claims were both brought against the United
States." Brief for Petitioner 20. Under this theory, $ 1500
would not apply to a Court of Federal Claims plaintiff unless
his suit pending in the other court rested on a legal theory
that could have been pleaded (as Keene's could not have
been) in the Court of Federal Claims. But this reinterpretation of $ 1500 is bound to fail, not because novelty is
always fatal in the construction of an old statute, but because the novel proposition in Keene's suggested reading
would have rendered the statute useless, in all or nearly
all instances, to effect the very object it was originally en7 Keene argued in its petition for certiorari that the claim it raised in
its third-party action in Miller was not based on the same facts as its
complaint in Keene I. Keene did not press this argument after we
granted the writ, and, in any event, we see no reason to disturb the
rulings to the contrary by both courts below. See 962 F. 2d, at 1024
("[W]e have no quarrel with the [Court of Federal Claims] determination
that the underlying facts in Miller and Keene I are the same").

acted to accomplish. Keene fails to explain how the originalstatute would have applied to the cotton claimants, whose

tort actions brought in other courts were beyond the juris-diction of the Court of Claims, just as tort cases are outside
the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims today.8Keene's theory was squarely rejected in British American
Tobacco,9 and it must be rejected again this time.

8 It is not that Keene has not tried to meet the objection. Keene assumes, contrary to the plain text, that the statute here is not jurisdictional, arguing instead that it was meant to supplement the formalistic
19th-century concept of res judicata. According to Keene, res judicata
would not have barred a cotton claimant from instigating an action against
a federal officer who had acted for the Government, even though the
claimant had lost an otherwise identical action against the Government
itself (and vice versa), the difference between the named defendants being
significant at that time. On the assumption that the statute eliminated
nonidentity of parties defendant as a barrier to the application of res judicata, Keene then argues that causes of action were treated as identical
in those days if the same evidence was used to prove multiple claims. On
this view of the law, Keene concludes, multiple cotton claims would have
been treated as the same, and the statute would have barred the Court
of Claims suit, just as Congress intended. Reply Brief for Petitioner 7.
Even on its own terms, however, this argument fails, for the Court of
Claims in 1868 had no jurisdiction to try a tort action for conversion,
however similar it might have been for res judicata purposes to the statutory action within that court's jurisdiction. Accordingly, under Keene's
claim-splitting theory, the conversion action would not have been treated
as identical with the statutory action; each would have survived, leaving
the statute useless to solve the problem Congress was addressing.

9 Keene claims that its view represents "well-established law," citing

Allied Materials & Equipment Co. v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl. 714 (1976)
(per curiam), and Casman v. United States, supra. Brief for Petitioner
15. In Casman, however, the plaintiff was seeking completely different
relief in the Court of Claims and the District Court, and later cases have
read Casman as limited to that situation. See Johns-Manville Corp., 855
F. 2d, at 1566-1567; Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, FSB v. United
States, 864 F. 2d, at 139. Although it is not clear whether the plaintiff in
Allied Materials was seeking completely different relief in the District
Court, the Court of Claims simply applied Casman without much explanation. Neither Casman nor Allied Materials discussed, much less purported to overrule, British American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 89
Ct. Cl. 438 (1939), a case that undoubtedly is well established. See, e. g.,

III
Finally, Keene takes the tack that if we adopt the Court
of Appeals's construction of $ 1500, we will be announcing "a
new rule of law" that ought to be applied only prospectively
under the test set out in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404
U. S. 97 (1971). Brief for Petitioner 42-43. Even assuming that this call for "pure prospectivity," see James B.
Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 544 (1991)
(opinion of Souter, J.), might fairly fall within the questions
presented,10 there is no need to address it because, as the
Government points out, Keene's claims were dismissed under
well-settled law.

The Court of Appeals, to be sure, announced that it was
overruling five cases: Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,
170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U. S.
976 (1966); Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956);
Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, FSB v. United States, 864
F. 2d 137 (CA Fed. 1988); Brown v. United States, 175 Ct. Cl.
343, 358 F. 2d 1002 (1966) (per curiam); and Hossein v.
United States, 218 Ct. Cl. 727 (1978) (per curiam). And
while Keene contends that nothing less than these repudiations of precedent would have sufficed to dismiss its suits,
we read the five cases as supporting neither Keene's position
that the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over its
cases nor its plea for pure prospectivity of the overruling
decision.

Johns-Manville Corp., supra, at 1562-1563; Los Angeles Shipbuilding &
Drydock Corp. v. United States, 138 Ct. Cl. 648, 652, 152 F. Supp. 236, 238
(1957); Hill v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 382, 386-388 (1985). Accordingly,
Keene's appeal to "well-established law" is misplaced.

10 The questions on which we granted certiorari contain no direct mention of prospectivity, see Pet. for Cert. i, although Keene did argue in its
petition that Tecon Engineers should be overruled only prospectively, see
Pet. for Cert. 13, and the Court of Appeals did consider, and reject, the
argument that its ruling should only be prospectively applied, see 962
F. 2d, at 1025.

Opinion of the Court
In applying $ 1500 to the facts of this case, we find it
unnecessary to consider, much less repudiate, the "judicially
created exceptions" to $ 1500 found in Tecon Engineers, Casman, and Boston Five. See 962 F. 2d, at 1021. Tecon Engineers held that a later filed action in another court does
not oust the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over an
earlier filed complaint; our decision turns on Keene's earlier
filed District Court actions, and even Keene now concedes
it to be "unnecessary for the Court to address the Tecon
question" in ruling on the dismissal of Keene's claims.
Reply Brief for Petitioner 14, n. 14; see n. 4, supra. The
Casman court recognized an exception (followed in Boston
Five) for plaintiffs who seek distinctly different types of relief in the two courts; here, Keene had sought monetary
relief in each of the cases pending when it filed the complaints seeking monetary relief in Keene I and Keene II.
See n. 6, supra. In Brown, the Court of Claims reinstated
a claim after the plaintiff 's District Court action for the
same claim had been dismissed, on the grounds that the
other suit was "no longer `pending' " and had itself been
dismissed because jurisdiction lay exclusively in the Court
of Claims. 175 Ct. Cl., at 348, 358 F. 2d, at 1004. Brown's
narrow reasoning, that $ 1500 does not apply after dismissal
of an earlier filed District Court suit brought in derogation
of the Court of Federal Claims's exclusive jurisdiction, was
echoed in Hossein, a per curiam order citing neither Brown,
nor any other case, on this point.11 See also Boston Five,
supra, at 139-140 (following Hossein). Since Keene's District Court actions were not, and could not have been, dis11 We note that both the Brown and Hossein courts failed to consider
the possibility that the District Court, in such a situation, could transfer
the case to the Court of Federal Claims under a statute first adopted in
1960. See Act of Sept. 13, 1960, $ 1, 74 Stat. 912 (codified at 28 U. S. C.

$ 1406(c) (1964 ed.)); Act of Apr. 2, 1982, $ 301(a), 96 Stat. 55 (codified at

missed on the ground of falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, Keene gets no support
from Brown and Hossein.12 Thus, there is no "new principle of law" at work in ruling against Keene, see Chevron
Oil, supra, at 106, and no need to plunge into retroactivity
analysis.13

IV

We have said nothing until now about Keene's several
policy arguments, and now can only answer that Keene addresses the wrong forum. It may well be, as Keene argues,
that $ 1500 operates in some circumstances to deprive plaintiffs of an opportunity to assert rights that Congress has
generally made available to them "under the complex legal
and jurisdictional schemes that govern claims against the
Government." Brief for Petitioner 15. The trial judge in
this case was not the first to call this statute anachronistic,
see 12 Cl. Ct., at 205; A. C. Seeman, Inc. v. United States,
5 Cl. Ct. 386, 389 (1984), and there is a good argument that,
even when first enacted, the statute did not actually perform
the preclusion function emphasized by its sponsor, see
Schwartz, 55 Geo. L. J., at 579. But the "proper theater"
for such arguments, as we told another disappointed claimant many years ago, "is the halls of Congress, for that
branch of the government has limited the jurisdiction of the
Court of Claims." 14 Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 45 (1873).
We enjoy no "liberty to add an exception . . . to remove

12 Brown and Hossein do not survive our ruling today, for they ignored
the time-of-filing rule discussed in Part II-A, supra.

13 Keene also asks the Court to "make clear that, if Keene refiles the

same claims, equitable tolling would be available to eliminate any limitations bar." Brief for Petitioner 45. But any response to this request
would be an advisory opinion.

14 A recent attempt to repeal $ 1500 failed in Congress. See S. 2521,

102d Cong., 2d Sess., $ 10(c) (1992); 138 Cong. Rec. S4830-S4832 (Apr. 2,

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
In my opinion, 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 does not require theCourt of Federal Claims to dismiss an action against the

United States simply because another suit on the same claimwas once, but is no longer, pending in district court.
Rather, the plaintiff may continue to pursue his claim solong as there is no other suit pending when the Court of
Federal Claims decides the motion to dismiss. Neither thetext nor the history of the statute demands more of the
plaintiff than that he make an "election either to leave theCourt of Claims or to leave the other courts" at that time.

Section 1500 is not itself a grant of jurisdiction to theCourt of Federal Claims. That function is performed by

other sections of the Judicial Code immediately preceding$ 1500, which give the court "jurisdiction to render judgment

$ 1500, as follows:
" `The object of this amendment is to put to their election that large class
of persons having cotton claims particularly, who have sued the Secretary
of the Treasury and the other agents of the Government in more than a
hundred suits that are now pending, scattered over the country here and
there, and who are here at the same time endeavoring to prosecute their
claims, and have filed them in the Court of Claims, so that after they put
the Government to the expense of beating them once in a court of law
they can turn around and try the whole question in the Court of Claims.
The object is to put that class of persons to their election either to leave
the Court of Claims or to leave the other courts. I am sure everybody

is the same as the "jurisdiction" surrounding Code provisions
bestow: the jurisdiction to enter judgment.

The text of $ 1500 simply provides that the Court of Federal Claims " `shall not have jurisdiction' over a claim `. . .
which' the plaintiff . . . `has pending' in any other court . . . ."
Ante, at 207 (emphasis added). Accordingly, so long as a
plaintiff has pending another suit in another court, the Court
of Federal Claims may not adjudicate the plaintiff 's claim,
even though its subject matter would otherwise bring it
within the court's jurisdiction. The Government may invoke this exception by putting such a plaintiff to his choice:
either "leave the other courts," n. 1, supra, or forgo further
proceedings in the Court of Federal Claims. If the plaintiff
declines to leave the other courts, then the Court of Federal Claims is without jurisdiction to proceed with the case
before it, though it may retain the case on its docket pending
disposition of the other action. Hossein v. United States,

other action, then the Court of Federal Claims is free to decide his case. Section 1500 was so construed over a quarter

358 F. 2d 1002 (1966),3 and I see no reason to interpret it now
as a broader prohibition on pretrial proceedings.

It is true that an earlier version of $ 1500 provided that a
claimant may not "file or prosecute" an action in the Court
of Federal Claims while another action is pending. Ante,
at 208. That original text, however, did not prescribe the
consequences of a prohibited filing. In view of the fact that
the text did not then mention the word "jurisdiction," there
is nothing to suggest that pendency of another action would
have to be treated as a defect warranting automatic dismissal.4 Instead, given the plain statement of the legislation's sponsor that he intended to force an election of remedies before trial, see n. 1, supra, this earlier language is
fairly construed as giving the Government the right to avoid
duplicative litigation by having the Court of Claims action

pending in a court is that stated in the plaintiffs' petition in this court.

"In these circumstances we grant the motions for rehearing, vacate our
prior order dismissing the petition, and now deny the defendant's motion
to dismiss. Our earlier order of dismissal was predicated on the fact that
the other `claim remains pending in the said District Court.' That is no
longer true, and the claim is no longer `pending in any other court.' In
this situation, we do not believe that 28 U. S. C. $ 1500 requires us to
deprive plaintiffs of the only forum they have in which to test their demand for just compensation." Brown, 175 Ct. Cl., at 348, 358 F. 2d, at

dismissed if the plaintiff chose not to abandon the claim
pending elsewhere.

In any event, when the text of $ 1500 was revised in 1948,
Congress removed the prohibition on filing. The Court
nevertheless assumes that the section should be construed
as originally drafted, because Congress did not intend the
1948 revisions of the Judicial Code to make substantive
changes in the law. See ante, at 209. In fact, the 1948 revision did work a significant substantive change by enlarging
the class of suits subject to dismissal to include suits against
the United States, as well as suits against its agents. See
ante, at 212, n. 6; Matson Navigation Co. v. United States,
284 U. S. 352, 355-356 (1932); see also Schwartz, Section
1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the
Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 579-580
(1967). But even if it were the case that Congress intended
no substantive change in 1948, that would mean only that
the present text is the best evidence of what the law has
always meant, and that the language of the prior version
cannot be relied upon to support a different reading.

In my judgment, the Court of Claims properly construed

$ 1500 in 1966 when it held that the provision merely requires claimants to choose between alternative pending
claims before proceeding to trial. See Brown, 175 Ct. Cl.,
at 348, 358 F. 2d, at 1004. The statute limits the power of
the Court of Federal Claims to render judgments, and thus
the ability of a plaintiff to prosecute simultaneous actions
against the Government, but it does not prevent the Court
of Federal Claims from allowing a case to remain on its
docket until the claimant has made the required election.
Even if I did not agree with this interpretation of $ 1500,
however, I would nevertheless endorse it here, as litigants
have a right to rely on a longstanding and reasoned judicial
construction of an important statute that Congress has not
seen fit to alter. See McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.

350, 376-377 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing cases).Whether or not "novelty is always fatal in the construction

of an old statute," ante, at 213, the overruling of a consistentline of precedent raises equitable concerns that should not
be disregarded.5Admittedly, this is a badly drafted statute. Viewed
against a legal landscape that has changed dramatically sincethe days of the cotton claimants, see

ante, at 206-207, it doesnot lend itself easily to sensible construction. Moreover,

the Court's interpretation of $ 1500 today may have the salu-tary effect of hastening its repeal or amendment. Nevertheless, a reading that is faithful not only to the statutory textbut also to the statute's stated purpose is surely preferable
to the harsh result the Court endorses here. Accordingly,I respectfully dissent.

5 The Court seeks to minimize these concerns by suggesting that the
Brown line of cases on which petitioner relies would not in any event
apply here, because petitioner's District Court action was not dismissed
on the grounds that it fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Federal Claims. Ante, at 216-217. In my view, Brown, and cases like it,
do not warrant such a narrow reading, but stand instead for the broader
proposition that a former district court action, once dismissed, no longer
bars adjudication in the Court of Federal Claims. See n. 2, supra; National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 274, 275-276
(1985) (in case of concurrent jurisdiction, providing for automatic reinstatement of Court of Federal Claims action upon dismissal of district
court suit). That the Court of Appeals felt it necessary to overrule
Brown on the facts of this case, see UNR Industries, 962 F. 2d, at 1022,
suggests a similar understanding of Brown's scope.

223OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

SMITH v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-8674. Argued March 23, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
After petitioner Smith offered to trade an automatic weapon to an undercover officer for cocaine, he was charged with numerous firearm and
drug trafficking offenses. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) requires the imposition of specified penalties if the defendant, "during and in relation to
. . . [a] drug trafficking crime[,] uses . . . a firearm." In affirming Smith's
conviction and sentence, the Court of Appeals held that $ 924(c)(1)'s plain
language imposes no requirement that a firearm be "use[d]" as a
weapon, but applies to any use of a gun that facilitates in any manner
the commission of a drug offense.

Held: A criminal who trades his firearm for drugs "uses" it "during and

in relation to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime" within the meaning of

$ 924(c)(1). Pp. 227-241.

(a) Section 924's language and structure establish that exchanging
a firearm for drugs may constitute "use" within $ 924(c)(1)'s meaning.
Smith's handling of his gun falls squarely within the everyday meaning
and dictionary definitions of "use." Had Congress intended $ 924(c)(1)
to require proof that the defendant not only used his firearm but used
it in a specific manner--as a weapon--it could have so indicated in
the statute. However, Congress did not. The fact that the most familiar example of "us[ing] . . . a firearm" is "use" as a weapon does not
mean that the phrase excludes all other ways in which a firearm might
be used. The United States Sentencing Guidelines, even if the Court
were to assume their relevance in the present context, do not support
the dissent's narrow interpretation that "to use" a firearm can mean
only to use it for its intended purposes, such as firing and brandishing,
since Guidelines Manual $ 2B3.1(b)(2) explicitly contemplates "othe[r]
use[s]" that are not limited to the intended purposes identified by the
dissent. The dissent's approach, moreover, would exclude the use of
a gun to pistol-whip a victim as the intended purpose of a gun is that
it be fired or brandished, not that it be used as a bludgeon. In addition,
Congress affirmatively demonstrated that it meant to include transactions like Smith's as "us[ing] a firearm" within the meaning of

$ 924(c)(1) by employing similar language in $ 924(d)(1), which subjects
to forfeiture any "firearm . . . intended to be used" in various listed
offenses. Many of the listed offenses involve "using" the firearm not as

508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT
224 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
a weapon but as an item of barter or commerce. Thus, even if

$ 924(c)(1), as originally enacted, applied only to use of a firearm during
crimes of violence, it is clear from the face of the statute that "use" is
not presently limited to use as a weapon, but is broad enough to cover
use for trade. Pp. 227-237.

(b) Smith's use of his firearm was "during and in relation to" a
drug trafficking crime. Smith does not, and cannot, deny that the
alleged use occurred "during" such a crime. And there can be little
doubt that his use was "in relation to" the offense. That phrase has a
dictionary meaning of "with reference to" or "as regards" and, at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with
respect to the drug crime. Thus, its presence or involvement cannot
be the result of accident or coincidence, and it at least must facilitate or
have the purpose of facilitating the drug offense. Here, the firearm
was an integral part of the drug transaction, which would not have been
possible without it. There is no reason why Congress would not have
wanted its language to cover this situation, since the introduction of
guns into drug transactions dramatically heightens the danger to society, whether the guns are used as a medium of exchange or as protection
for the transactions or dealers. Pp. 237-239.

(c) Smith's invocation of the rule of lenity is rejected. Imposing a
postnarrower construction of $ 924(c)(1) than the one herein adopted
would do violence not only to the statute's plain language and structure,
but also to its purpose of addressing the heightened risk of violence and
death that accompanies the introduction of firearms to drug trafficking
offenses. Pp. 239-241.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
We decide today whether the exchange of a gun for nar-cotics constitutes "use" of a firearm "during and in relation

to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime" within the meaning of 18U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). We hold that it does.

I
Petitioner John Angus Smith and his companion went fromTennessee to Florida to buy cocaine; they hoped to resell

it at a profit. While in Florida, they met petitioner's ac-quaintance, Deborah Hoag. Hoag agreed to, and in fact did,
purchase cocaine for petitioner. She then accompanied peti-tioner and his friend to her motel room, where they were
joined by a drug dealer. While Hoag listened, petitionerand the dealer discussed petitioner's MAC-10 firearm, which
had been modified to operate as an automatic. The MAC-10apparently is a favorite among criminals. It is small and
compact, lightweight, and can be equipped with a silencer.Most important of all, it can be devastating: A fully automatic MAC-10 can fire more than 1,000 rounds per minute.The dealer expressed his interest in becoming the owner of
a MAC-10, and petitioner promised that he would discussselling the gun if his arrangement with another potential
buyer fell through.Unfortunately for petitioner, Hoag had contacts not only
with narcotics traffickers but also with law enforcement offi-cials. In fact, she was a confidential informant. Consistent
with her post, she informed the Broward County Sheriff 'sOffice of petitioner's activities. The Sheriff 's Office responded quickly, sending an undercover officer to Hoag 'smotel room. Several others were assigned to keep the
motel under surveillance. Upon arriving at Hoag's motelroom, the undercover officer presented himself to petitioner
as a pawnshop dealer. Petitioner, in turn, presented the of-ficer with a proposition: He had an automatic MAC-10 and
silencer with which he might be willing to part. Petitioner

Opinion of the Court
then pulled the MAC-10 out of a black canvas bag andshowed it to the officer. The officer examined the gun and

asked petitioner what he wanted for it. Rather than askingfor money, however, petitioner asked for drugs. He was
willing to trade his MAC-10, he said, for two ounces of cocaine. The officer told petitioner that he was just a pawn-shop dealer and did not distribute narcotics. Nonetheless,

he indicated that he wanted the MAC-10 and would try toget the cocaine. The officer then left, promising to return
within an hour.Rather than seeking out cocaine as he had promised, the
officer returned to the Sheriff 's Office to arrange for petitioner's arrest. But petitioner was not content to wait. The
officers who were conducting surveillance saw him leave the
motel room carrying a gun bag; he then climbed into his van
and drove away. The officers reported petitioner's departure and began following him. When law enforcement authorities tried to stop petitioner, he led them on a high-speed
chase. Petitioner eventually was apprehended.

Petitioner, it turns out, was well armed. A search of
his van revealed the MAC-10 weapon, a silencer, ammunition, and a "fast-feed" mechanism. In addition, the police
found a MAC-11 machine gun, a loaded .45 caliber pistol,
and a .22 caliber pistol with a scope and homemade silencer.
Petitioner also had a loaded 9 millimeter handgun in his
waistband.

A grand jury sitting in the District Court for the Southern
District of Florida returned an indictment charging petitioner with, among other offenses, two drug trafficking
crimes--conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and attempt to possess cocaine with intent to distribute
in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)(1), 846, and 18 U. S. C. $ 2.
App. 3-9. Most important here, the indictment alleged that
petitioner knowingly used the MAC-10 and its silencer during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Id., at 4-5.

arm must be sentenced to five years' incarceration. Andwhere, as here, the firearm is a "machinegun" or is fitted

with a silencer, the sentence is 30 years. See $ 924(c)(1)("[I]f the firearm is a machinegun, or is equipped with a firearm silencer," the sentence is "thirty years"); $ 921(a)(23),26 U. S. C. $ 5845(b) (term "machinegun" includes automatic
weapons). The jury convicted petitioner on all counts.On appeal, petitioner argued that $ 924(c)(1)'s penalty for
using a firearm during and in relation to a drug traffickingoffense covers only situations in which the firearm is used as
a weapon. According to petitioner, the provision does notextend to defendants who use a firearm solely as a medium
of exchange or for barter. The Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit disagreed. 957 F. 2d 835 (1992). The
plain language of the statute, the court explained, imposesno requirement that the firearm be used as a weapon. Instead, any use of "the weapon to facilitate in any mannerthe commission of the offense" suffices. Id., at 837 (internal
quotation marks omitted).Shortly before the Eleventh Circuit decided this case, the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit arrivedat the same conclusion.

United States v. Harris, 294 U. S.App. D. C. 300, 315-316, 959 F. 2d 246, 261-262 (per curiam),

cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992). In United States v.Phelps, 877 F. 2d 28 (1989), however, the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit held that trading a gun in a drug-related transaction could not constitute use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense within themeaning of $ 924(c)(1). We granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict among the Circuits. 506 U. S. 814 (1992). We nowaffirm.

Opinion of the Court
make two showings. First, the prosecution must demon-strate that the defendant "use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm." Second, it must prove that the use or carrying was "during andin relation to" a "crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."

A
Petitioner argues that exchanging a firearm for drugs doesnot constitute "use" of the firearm within the meaning of the

statute. He points out that nothing in the record indicatesthat he fired the MAC-10, threatened anyone with it, or employed it for self-protection. In essence, petitioner arguesthat he cannot be said to have "use[d]" a firearm unless he
used it as a weapon, since that is how firearms most oftenare used. See 957 F. 2d, at 837 (firearm often facilitates
drug offenses by protecting drugs or protecting or embold-ening the defendant). Of course, $ 924(c)(1) is not limited to
those cases in which a gun is used; it applies with equal forcewhenever a gun is "carrie[d]." In this case, however, the
indictment alleged only that petitioner "use[d]" the MAC-10.App. 4. Accordingly, we do not consider whether the evidence might support the conclusion that petitioner carriedthe MAC-10 within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1). Instead we
confine our discussion to what the parties view as the dispos-itive issue in this case: whether trading a firearm for drugs
can constitute "use" of the firearm within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1).

When a word is not defined by statute, we normally con-strue it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning. See
Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (words notdefined in statute should be given ordinary or common meaning). Accord, post, at 242 ("In the search for statutory mean-ing, we give nontechnical words and phrases their ordinary
meaning"). Surely petitioner's treatment of his MAC-10can be described as "use" within the everyday meaning of
that term. Petitioner "used" his MAC-10 in an attempt toobtain drugs by offering to trade it for cocaine. Webster's

Opinion of the Court
defines "to use" as "[t]o convert to one's service" or "to em-ploy." Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed.

1950). Black's Law Dictionary contains a similar definition:"[t]o make use of; to convert to one's service; to employ; to
avail oneself of; to utilize; to carry out a purpose or action
by means of." Black's Law Dictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990).Indeed, over 100 years ago we gave the word "use" the same

gloss, indicating that it means " `to employ' " or " `to deriveservice from.' "

Astor v. Merritt, 111 U. S. 202, 213 (1884).
Petitioner's handling of the MAC-10 in this case fallssquarely within those definitions. By attempting to trade

his MAC-10 for the drugs, he "used" or "employed" it as an
item of barter to obtain cocaine; he "derived service" from it
because it was going to bring him the very drugs he sought.

In petitioner's view, $ 924(c)(1) should require proof not
only that the defendant used the firearm, but also that he
used it as a weapon. But the words "as a weapon" appear
nowhere in the statute. Rather, $ 924(c)(1)'s language
sweeps broadly, punishing any "us[e]" of a firearm, so long
as the use is "during and in relation to" a drug trafficking
offense. See United States v. Long, 284 U. S. App. D. C. 405,
409-410, 905 F. 2d 1572, 1576-1577 (Thomas, J.) (although not
without limits, the word "use" is "expansive" and extends
even to situations where the gun is not actively employed),
cert. denied, 498 U. S. 948 (1990). Had Congress intended
the narrow construction petitioner urges, it could have so
indicated. It did not, and we decline to introduce that additional requirement on our own.

Language, of course, cannot be interpreted apart from context. The meaning of a word that appears ambiguous if
viewed in isolation may become clear when the word is analyzed in light of the terms that surround it. Recognizing
this, petitioner and the dissent argue that the word "uses"
has a somewhat reduced scope in $ 924(c)(1) because it appears alongside the word "firearm." Specifically, they contend that the average person on the street would not think

508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT
230 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
immediately of a guns-for-drugs trade as an example of"us[ing] a firearm." Rather, that phrase normally evokes an

image of the most familiar use to which a firearm is put--use as a weapon. Petitioner and the dissent therefore argue
that the statute excludes uses where the weapon is not fired
or otherwise employed for its destructive capacity. See
post, at 242-244. Indeed, relying on that argument--and
without citation to authority--the dissent announces its own,restrictive definition of "use." "To use an instrumentality,"

the dissent argues, "ordinarily means to use it for its in-tended purpose."

Post, at 242.
There is a significant flaw to this argument. It is one
thing to say that the ordinary meaning of "uses a firearm"
includes using a firearm as a weapon, since that is the intended purpose of a firearm and the example of "use" that
most immediately comes to mind. But it is quite another to
conclude that, as a result, the phrase also excludes any other
use. Certainly that conclusion does not follow from the
phrase "uses . . . a firearm" itself. As the dictionary definitions and experience make clear, one can use a firearm in a
number of ways. That one example of "use" is the first to
come to mind when the phrase "uses . . . a firearm" is uttered
does not preclude us from recognizing that there are other
"uses" that qualify as well. In this case, it is both reasonable and normal to say that petitioner "used" his MAC-10 in
his drug trafficking offense by trading it for cocaine; the dissent does not contend otherwise. Ibid.

The dissent's example of how one might "use" a cane,
ibid., suffers from a similar flaw. To be sure, "use" as an
adornment in a hallway is not the first "use" of a cane that
comes to mind. But certainly it does not follow that the
only "use" to which a cane might be put is assisting one's
grandfather in walking. Quite the opposite: The most infamous use of a cane in American history had nothing to do
with walking at all, see J. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom
150 (1988) (describing the caning of Senator Sumner in the

United States Senate in 1856); and the use of a cane as aninstrument of punishment was once so common that "to

any event, the only question in this case is whether the
phrase "uses . . . a firearm" in $ 924(c)(1) is most reasonablyread as

excluding the use of a firearm in a gun-for-drugs
trade. The fact that the phrase clearly includes using afirearm to shoot someone, as the dissent contends, does not

answer it.The dissent relies on one authority, the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1992), as "reflect[ing]" its interpretation of the phrase "uses . . . a firearm." See post, at 243. But the Guidelines do not define
"using a firearm" as using it for its intended purposes, which
the dissent apparently assumes are limited to firing, brandishing, displaying, and possessing. In fact, if we entertain
for the moment the dubious assumption that the Sentencing
Guidelines are relevant in the present context, they support
the opposite view. Section 2B3.1(b)(2), upon which the dissent relies, ibid., provides for increases in a defendant's
offense level, and therefore his sentence, if the offense involved a firearm. The extent of the adjustment varies according to the nature of the gun's involvement. There is a
seven-point upward adjustment if the firearm "was discharged," $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(A); a six-point enhancement if a gun
was "otherwise used," $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added); and
a five-point adjustment if the firearm was brandished, displayed, or possessed, $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). Unless the six-point
enhancement for "othe[r] use[s]" is mere surplusage, there
must be "uses" for a firearm other than its "intended purposes" of firing, brandishing, displaying, or possessing. The
dissent points out that there may be some uses that are
not firing or brandishing but constitute use as a weapon
nonetheless. See post, at 243-244, n. 2. But nothing in

$ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) suggests that the phrase "othe[r] use[s]"

Opinion of the Court
must be so limited. On the contrary, it is perfectly reason-able to construe $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) as including uses, such as

trading and bludgeoning, that do not constitute use for thefirearm's "intended purpose."

It is true that the Guidelines commentary defines " `[o]therwise used' " as conduct that falls short of " `discharg[ing]a firearm but [is] more than brandishing, displaying, or

possessing [it].' " Post, at 243 (quoting USSG $ 1B1.1, com-ment., n. 1(g)). That definition, however, simply reflects
the peculiar hierarchy of culpability established in USSG$ 2B3.1(b)(2). It clarifies that between the most culpable
conduct of discharging the firearm and less culpable actions
such as "brandishing, displaying, or possessing" lies a category of "othe[r] use[s]" for which the Guidelines impose intermediate punishment. It does not by its terms exclude from
its scope trading, bludgeoning, or any other use beyond the
firearm's "intended purpose."

We are not persuaded that our construction of the phrase
"uses . . . a firearm" will produce anomalous applications.
See post, at 242 (example of using a gun to scratch one's
head). As we already have noted, see supra, at 227-228,
and will explain in greater detail later, infra, at 237-239,

$ 924(c)(1) requires not only that the defendant "use" the
firearm, but also that he use it "during and in relation to"
the drug trafficking crime. As a result, the defendant who
"uses" a firearm to scratch his head, see post, at 242, or for
some other innocuous purpose, would avoid punishment for
that conduct altogether: Although scratching one's head with
a gun might constitute "use," that action cannot support punishment under $ 924(c)(1) unless it facilitates or furthers the
drug crime; that the firearm served to relieve an itch is not
enough. See infra, at 238 (phrase "in relation to" requires,
at a minimum, that the use facilitate the crime). Such a
defendant would escape the six-point enhancement provided
in USSG $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) as well. As the Guidelines definition of "[o]therwise use[d]" makes clear, see USSG $ 1B1.1,

Opinion of the Court
comment., n. 1(g), the six-point enhancement does not applyunless the use is "more than" brandishing. While pistolwhipping a victim with a firearm might be "more than" bran-dishing, scratching one's head is not.

In any event, the "intended purpose" of a firearm is notthat it be used in any offensive manner whatever, but rather
that it be used in a particular fashion--by firing it. Thedissent's contention therefore cannot be that the defendant
must use the firearm "as a weapon," but rather that he mustfire it or threaten to fire it, "as a gun." Under the dissent's
approach, then, even the criminal who pistol-whips his victimhas not used a firearm within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1), for
firearms are intended to be fired or brandished, not used asbludgeons. It appears that the dissent similarly would limit
the scope of the "othe[r] use[s]" covered by USSG $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B). The universal view of the courts of appeals, however, is directly to the contrary. No court of appeals everhas held that using a gun to pistol-whip a victim is anything
but the "use" of a firearm; nor has any court ever held thattrading a firearm for drugs falls short of being the "use"
thereof. But cf. Phelps, 877 F. 2d, at 30 (holding that trad-ing a gun for drugs is not use "

in relation to" a drug traf-ficking offense).

To the extent there is uncertainty about the scope of thephrase "uses . . . a firearm" in $ 924(c)(1), we believe the remainder of $ 924 appropriately sets it to rest. Just as a sin-gle word cannot be read in isolation, nor can a single provision of a statute. As we have recognized:

"Statutory construction . . . is a holistic endeavor. Aprovision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often

clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme--because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a
context that makes its meaning clear, or because onlyone of the permissible meanings produces a substantive
effect that is compatible with the rest of the law."United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood

234 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (cita-tions omitted).

Here, Congress employed the words "use" and "firearm" to-gether not only in $ 924(c)(1), but also in $ 924(d)(1), which
deals with forfeiture of firearms. See United States v. OneAssortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984) (discussing
earlier version of the statute). Under $ 924(d)(1), any "fire-arm or ammunition intended to be used" in the various offenses listed in $ 924(d)(3) is subject to seizure and forfeiture.Consistent with petitioner's interpretation, $ 924(d)(3) lists
offenses in which guns might be used as offensive weapons.See $$ 924(d)(3)(A), (B) (weapons used in a crime of violence
or drug trafficking offense). But it also lists offenses inwhich the firearm is

not used as a weapon but instead as anitem of barter or commerce. For example, any gun intended

to be "used" in an interstate "transfer, s[ale], trade, gi[ft],transport, or deliver[y]" of a firearm prohibited under

$ 922(a)(5) where there is a pattern of such activity, see$ 924(d)(3)(C), or in a federal offense involving "the exportation of firearms," $ 924(d)(3)(F), is subject to forfeiture. Infact, none of the offenses listed in four of the six subsections
of $ 924(d)(3) involves the bellicose use of a firearm; each of-fense involves use as an item in commerce.* Thus, it is clear

*Section 924(d)(3)(C) lists four offenses: unlicensed manufacture of or
commerce in firearms, in violation of $ 922(a)(1); unlicensed receipt of a
weapon from outside the State, in violation of $ 922(a)(3); unlicensed transfer of a firearm to a resident of a different State, in violation of $ 922(a)(5);
and delivery of a gun by a licensed entity to a resident of a State that is
not the licensee's, in violation of $ 922(b)(3). Section 924(d)(3)(D) mentions
only one offense, the transfer or sale of a weapon to disqualified persons,
such as fugitives from justice and felons, in violation of $ 922(d). Under

$ 924(d)(3)(E), firearms are subject to forfeiture if they are intended to be
used in any of five listed offenses: shipping stolen firearms, in violation of

$ 922(i); receipt of stolen firearms, in violation of $ 922(j); importation of
firearms, in violation of $ 922(l); shipment of a firearm by a felon, in violation of $ 922(n); and shipment or receipt of a firearm with intent to commit
a felony, in violation of $ 924(b). Finally, $ 924(d)(3)(F) subjects to forfeit508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
from $ 924(d)(3) that one who transports, exports, sells, ortrades a firearm "uses" it within the meaning of $ 924(d)(1)--

even though those actions do not involve using the firearmas a weapon. Unless we are to hold that using a firearm has
a different meaning in $ 924(c)(1) than it does in $ 924(d)--and clearly we should not,

United Savings Assn., supra, at371--we must reject petitioner's narrow interpretation.

The evident care with which Congress chose the languageof $ 924(d)(1) reinforces our conclusion in this regard. Although $ 924(d)(1) lists numerous firearm-related offensesthat render guns subject to forfeiture, Congress did not lump
all of those offenses together and require forfeiture solely ofguns "used" in a prohibited activity. Instead, it carefully
varied the statutory language in accordance with the guns'relation to the offense. For example, with respect to some
crimes, the firearm is subject to forfeiture not only if it is"used," but also if it is "involved in" the offense. $ 924(d)(1).
Examination of the offenses to which the "involved in" lan-guage applies reveals why Congress believed it necessary to
include such an expansive term. One of the listed offenses,violation of $ 922(a)(6), is the making of a false statement
material to the lawfulness of a gun's transfer. Because mak-ing a material misstatement in order to acquire or sell a gun
is not "use" of the gun even under the broadest definition ofthe word "use," Congress carefully expanded the statutory
language. As a result, a gun with respect to which a mate-rial misstatement is made is subject to forfeiture because,
even though the gun is not "used" in the offense, it is "in-volved in" it. Congress, however, did not so expand the language for offenses in which firearms were "intended to beused," even though the firearms in many of those offenses
function as items of commerce rather than as weapons. In-stead, Congress apparently was of the view that one could
use a gun by trading it. In light of the common meaning of
ure any firearm intended to be used in any offense that may be prosecuted
in federal court if it involves the exportation of firearms.

236 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the word "use" and the structure and language of the statute,we are not in any position to disagree.

The dissent suggests that our interpretation produces a"strange dichotomy" between "using" a firearm and "carrying" one. Post, at 246. We do not see why that is so. Just
as a defendant may "use" a firearm within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1) by trading it for drugs

or using it to shoot someone, so too would a defendant "carry" the firearm by keepingit on his person whether he intends to exchange it for cocaine

or fire it in self-defense. The dichotomy arises, if at all, onlywhen one tries to extend the phrase " `uses . . . a firearm' "
to any use " `for any purpose whatever.' " Ibid. For our
purposes, it is sufficient to recognize that, because $ 924(d)(1)
includes both using a firearm for trade and using a firearm
as a weapon as "us[ing] a firearm," it is most reasonable to
construe $ 924(c)(1) as encompassing both of those "uses" as
well.

Finally, it is argued that $ 924(c)(1) originally dealt with
use of a firearm during crimes of violence; the provision concerning use of a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking offenses was added later. Ibid. From this, the dissent infers that "use" originally was limited to use of a gun
"as a weapon." That the statute in its current form employs
the term "use" more broadly is unimportant, the dissent
contends, because the addition of the words " `drug trafficking crime' would have been a peculiar way to expand its
meaning." Ibid. Even if we assume that Congress had
intended the term "use" to have a more limited scope when
it passed the original version of $ 924(c) in 1968, but see
supra, at 229-231, we believe it clear from the face of the
statute that the Congress that amended $ 924(c) in 1986 did
not. Rather, the 1986 Congress employed the term "use"
expansively, covering both use as a weapon, as the dissent
admits, and use as an item of trade or barter, as an examination of $ 924(d) demonstrates. Because the phrase "uses . . . a
firearm" is broad enough in ordinary usage to cover use of a

Opinion of the Court
firearm as an item of barter or commerce, Congress was freein 1986 so to employ it. The language and structure of $ 924

indicate that Congress did just that. Accordingly, we con-clude that using a firearm in a guns-for-drugs trade may constitute "us[ing] a firearm" within the meaning of $ 924(c)(1).

B
Using a firearm, however, is not enough to subject the de-fendant to the punishment required by $ 924(c)(1). Instead,

the firearm must be used "during and in relation to" a "crimeof violence or drug trafficking crime." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1).
Petitioner does not deny that the alleged use occurred "dur-ing" a drug trafficking crime. Nor could he. The indictment charged that petitioner and his companion conspired topossess cocaine with intent to distribute. App. 3-4. There
can be no doubt that the gun-for-drugs trade was proposedduring and in furtherance of that interstate drug conspiracy.
Nor can it be contended that the alleged use did not occurduring the "attempt" to possess cocaine with which petitioner also was charged, id., at 4; the MAC-10 served as aninducement to convince the undercover officer to provide
petitioner with the drugs that petitioner sought.Petitioner, however, does dispute whether his use of the
firearm was "in relation to" the drug trafficking offense.The phrase "in relation to" is expansive, cf. District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Board of Trade, 506 U. S. 125,129 (1992) (the phrase "relate to" is "deliberately expansive"
(internal quotation marks omitted)), as the Courts of Ap-peals construing $ 924(c)(1) have recognized, United States v.
Phelps, 877 F. 2d, at 30 ("[t]he phrase `in relation to' isbroad");

United States v. Harris, 294 U. S. App. D. C., at 315,959 F. 2d, at 261 (per curiam) (firearm is used "in relation

to" the crime if it "facilitate[s] the predicate offense in someway"). Nonetheless, the phrase does illuminate $ 924(c)(1)'s
boundaries. According to Webster's, "in relation to" means"with reference to" or "as regards." Webster's New Inter508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT
238 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
national Dictionary, at 2102. The phrase "in relation to"thus, at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some

purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime;its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident
or coincidence. As one court has observed, the "in relation
to" language "allay[s] explicitly the concern that a personcould be" punished under $ 924(c)(1) for committing a drug

trafficking offense "while in possession of a firearm" eventhough the firearm's presence is coincidental or entirely "unrelated" to the crime. United States v. Stewart, 779 F. 2d538, 539 (CA9 1985) (Kennedy, J.). Instead, the gun at least
must "facilitat[e], or ha[ve] the potential of facilitating," the
drug trafficking offense. Id., at 540. Accord, United States
v. Ocampo, 890 F. 2d 1363, 1371-1372 (CA7 1989); 957 F. 2d,
at 837.

We need not determine the precise contours of the "in relation to" requirement here, however, as petitioner's use of
his MAC-10 meets any reasonable construction of it. The
MAC-10's presence in this case was not the product of
happenstance. On the contrary, "[f]ar more than [in] the
ordinary case" under $ 924(c)(1), in which the gun merely
facilitates the offense by providing a means of protection or
intimidation, here "the gun . . . was an integral part of the
transaction." United States v. Phelps, 895 F. 2d 1281, 1283
(CA9 1990) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing
en banc). Without it, the deal would not have been possible.
The undercover officer posing as a pawnshop dealer expressly told petitioner that he was not in the narcotics business and that he did not get involved with drugs. For a
MAC-10, however, he was willing to see if he could track
down some cocaine.

Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit in Phelps and on the legislative record, petitioner insists that the relationship between the gun and the
drug offense in this case is not the type of connection Congress contemplated when it drafted $ 924(c)(1). With re508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT

239Cite as: 508 U. S. 223 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
spect to that argument, we agree with the District of Colum-bia Circuit's observation:

"It may well be that Congress, when it drafted thelanguage of [$ ]924(c), had in mind a more obvious use of
guns in connection with a drug crime, but the language[of the statute] is not so limited[;] nor can we imagine
any reason why Congress would not have wished its lan-guage to cover this situation. Whether guns are used
as the medium of exchange for drugs sold illegally oras a means to protect the transaction or dealers, their
introduction into the scene of drug transactions dramati-cally heightens the danger to society."

Harris, supra,at 316, 959 F. 2d, at 262.

One need look no further than the pages of the Federal Re-porter to verify the truth of that observation. In Phelps,
supra, the defendant arranged to trade his MAC-10 forchemicals necessary to make methamphetamine. The Ninth
Circuit held that the gun was not used or carried "in relationto" the drug trafficking offense because it was used as an
item of barter and not as a weapon. The defendant, how-ever, did not believe his MAC-10's capabilities were so limited. When he was stopped for a traffic violation, "[t]heMAC 10, suddenly transmogrified [from an item of commerce] into an offensive weapon, was still in [the defendant's]possession[.] [He] opened fire and shot a deputy sheriff."
Id., at 1288, n. 4 (Kozinski, J., dissenting from denial of re-hearing en banc).

C
Finally, the dissent and petitioner invoke the rule of lenity.
Post, at 246-247. The mere possibility of articulating a nar-rower construction, however, does not by itself make the rule

of lenity applicable. Instead, that venerable rule is reservedfor cases where, "[a]fter `seiz[ing] every thing from which aid
can be derived,' " the Court is "left with an ambiguous stat-ute." United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347 (1971) (quot508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:07 PAGES OPINPGT

ing United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805)). Ac-cord,

Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990).
This is not such a case. Not only does petitioner's use of hisMAC-10 fall squarely within the common usage and dictionary definitions of the terms "uses . . . a firearm," but Congress affirmatively demonstrated that it meant to includetransactions like petitioner's as "us[ing] a firearm" by so employing those terms in $ 924(d).Imposing a more restrictive reading of the phrase "uses
. . . a firearm" does violence not only to the structure andlanguage of the statute, but to its purpose as well. When
Congress enacted the current version of $ 924(c)(1), it was no
doubt aware that drugs and guns are a dangerous combination. In 1989, 56 percent of all murders in New York City
were drug related; during the same period, the figure for the
Nation's Capital was as high as 80 percent. The American
Enterprise 100 (Jan.-Feb. 1991). The fact that a gun is
treated momentarily as an item of commerce does not render
it inert or deprive it of destructive capacity. Rather, as experience demonstrates, it can be converted instantaneously
from currency to cannon. See supra, at 239. We therefore
see no reason why Congress would have intended courts and
juries applying $ 924(c)(1) to draw a fine metaphysical distinction between a gun's role in a drug offense as a weapon
and its role as an item of barter; it creates a grave possibility
of violence and death in either capacity.

We have observed that the rule of lenity "cannot dictate
an implausible interpretation of a statute, nor one at odds
with the generally accepted contemporary meaning of a
term." Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 596 (1990).
That observation controls this case. Both a firearm's use as
a weapon and its use as an item of barter fall within the plain
language of $ 924(c)(1), so long as the use occurs during and
in relation to a drug trafficking offense; both must constitute
"uses" of a firearm for $ 924(d)(1) to make any sense at all;
and both create the very dangers and risks that Congress

meant $ 924(c)(1) to address. We therefore hold that a crimi-nal who trades his firearm for drugs "uses" it during and in

relation to a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of$ 924(c)(1). Because the evidence in this case showed that
petitioner "used" his MAC-10 machine gun and silencer in
precisely such a manner, proposing to trade them for cocaine,petitioner properly was subjected to $ 924(c)(1)'s 30-year

mandatory minimum sentence. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion in full because I understand the
discussion in Part II-B not to foreclose the possibility thatthe "in relation to" language of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) requires

more than mere furtherance or facilitation of a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime. I agree with the Court thatbecause petitioner's use of his MAC-10 meets any reasonable

construction of the phrase, it is unnecessary to determine in
this case the precise contours of "in relation to" as it appears
in $ 924(c)(1). See ante, at 238.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Section 924(c)(1) mandates a sentence enhancement for any
defendant who "during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses . . . a firearm." 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). The Court begins its analysis by focusing upon the word "use" in this passage, and explaining that
the dictionary definitions of that word are very broad. See
ante, at 228-229. It is, however, a "fundamental principle of
statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that
the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but
must be drawn from the context in which it is used." Deal
v. United States, ante, at 132. That is particularly true of a
word as elastic as "use," whose meanings range all the way

242 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
from "to partake of " (as in "he uses tobacco") to "to be wontor accustomed" (as in "he used to smoke tobacco"). See

Webster's New International Dictionary 2806 (2d ed. 1950).In the search for statutory meaning, we give nontechnical
words and phrases their ordinary meaning. See Chapmanv.

United States, 500 U. S. 453, 462 (1991); Perrin v. UnitedStates, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979); Minor v. Mechanics Bank of

Alexandria, 1 Pet. 46, 64 (1828). To use an instrumentalityordinarily means to use it for its intended purpose. When
someone asks, "Do you use a cane?," he is not inquiringwhether you have your grandfather's silver-handled walking
stick on display in the hall; he wants to know whether you
walk with a cane. Similarly, to speak of "using a firearm"is to speak of using it for its distinctive purpose, i. e., as a

weapon. To be sure, "one can use a firearm in a number ofways," ante, at 230, including as an article of exchange, just
as one can "use" a cane as a hall decoration--but that is notthe ordinary meaning of "using" the one or the other.

1 The

Court does not appear to grasp the distinction between howa word can be used and how it ordinarily is used. It would,

indeed, be "both reasonable and normal to say that petitioner`used' his MAC-10 in his drug trafficking offense by trading
it for cocaine." Ibid. It would also be reasonable and nor-mal to say that he "used" it to scratch his head. When one
wishes to describe the action of employing the instrument ofa firearm for such unusual purposes, "use" is assuredly a

1 The Court asserts that the "significant flaw" in this argument is that
"to say that the ordinary meaning of `uses a firearm' includes using a
firearm as a weapon" is quite different from saying that the ordinary
meaning "also excludes any other use." Ante, at 230 (emphases in original). The two are indeed different--but it is precisely the latter that I
assert to be true: The ordinary meaning of "uses a firearm" does not include using it as an article of commerce. I think it perfectly obvious, for
example, that the objective falsity requirement for a perjury conviction
would not be satisfied if a witness answered "no" to a prosecutor's inquiry
whether he had ever "used a firearm," even though he had once sold his
grandfather's Enfield rifle to a collector.

verb one could select. But that says nothing about whetherthe

ordinary meaning of the phrase "uses a firearm" embraces such extraordinary employments. It is unquestion-ably

not reasonable and normal, I think, to say simply "do
not use firearms" when one means to prohibit selling or
scratching with them.The normal usage is reflected, for example, in the United

States Sentencing Guidelines, which provide for enhancedsentences when firearms are "discharged," "brandished,
displayed, or possessed," or "otherwise used." See, e. g.,United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 2B3.1(b)(2) (Nov. 1992). As to the latter term, the Guide-lines say: " `Otherwise used' with reference to a dangerous
weapon (including a firearm) means that the conduct did not
amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than bran-dishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon." USSG $ 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(g) (definitions).
"Otherwise used" in this provision obviously means "otherwise used as a weapon." 2

2 The Court says that it is "not persuaded that [its] construction of the
phrase `uses . . . a firearm' will produce anomalous applications." Ante,
at 232. But as proof it points only to the fact that $ 924(c)(1) fortuitously
contains other language--the requirement that the use be "during and in
relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime"--that happens
to prevent untoward results. Ibid. That language does not, in fact, prevent all untoward results: Though it excludes an enhanced penalty for the
burglar who scratches his head with the barrel of a gun, it requires one
for the burglar who happens to use a gun handle, rather than a rock, to
break the window affording him entrance--hardly a distinction that ought
to make a sentencing difference if the gun has no other connection to the
crime. But in any event, an excuse that turns upon the language of

$ 924(c)(1) is good only for that particular statute. The Court cannot
avoid "anomalous applications" when it applies its anomalous meaning of
"use a firearm" in other contexts--for example, the Guidelines provision
just described in text.

In a vain attempt to show the contrary, it asserts that the phrase "otherwise used" in the Guidelines means used for any other purpose at all (the
Court's preferred meaning of "use a firearm"), so long as it is more "culpa508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:08 PAGES OPINPGT
244 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
Given our rule that ordinary meaning governs, and given
the ordinary meaning of "uses a firearm," it seems to me
inconsequential that "the words `as a weapon' appear nowhere in the statute," ante, at 229; they are reasonably implicit. Petitioner is not, I think, seeking to introduce an
"additional requirement" into the text, ibid., but is simply
construing the text according to its normal import.

The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion by referring to
the next subsection of the statute, $ 924(d), which does not
employ the phrase "uses a firearm," but provides for the confiscation of firearms that are "used in" referenced offenses
which include the crimes of transferring, selling, or transporting firearms in interstate commerce. The Court concludes from this that whenever the term appears in this statute, "use" of a firearm must include nonweapon use. See
ante, at 233-236. I do not agree. We are dealing here not
with a technical word or an "artfully defined" legal term,

ble" than brandishing. See ante, at 232. But whence does it derive that
convenient limitation? It appears nowhere in the text--as well it should
not, since the whole purpose of the Guidelines is to take out of the hands
of individual judges determinations as to what is "more culpable" and "less
culpable." The definition of "otherwise used" in the Guidelines merely
says that it means "more than" brandishing and less than firing. The
Court is confident that "scratching one's head" with a firearm is not "more
than" brandishing it. See ante, at 233. I certainly agree--but only because the "more" use referred to is more use as a weapon. Reading the
Guidelines as they are written (rather than importing the Court's deus ex
machina of a culpability scale), and interpreting "use a firearm" in the
strange fashion the Court does, produces, see ante, at 232, a full sevenpoint upward sentence adjustment for firing a gun at a storekeeper during
a robbery; a mere five-point adjustment for pointing the gun at the storekeeper (which falls within the Guidelines' definition of "brandished," see
USSG $ 1B1.1, comment., n. 1(c)); but an intermediate six-point adjustment
for using the gun to pry open the cash register or prop open the door.
Quite obviously ridiculous. When the Guidelines speak of "otherwise
us[ing]" a firearm, they mean, in accordance with normal usage, otherwise
"using" it as a weapon--for example, placing the gun barrel in the mouth
of the storekeeper to intimidate him.

cf. Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U. S. 410, 423 (1992) (Scalia, J.,dissenting), but with common words that are, as I have suggested, inordinately sensitive to context. Just as adding thedirect object "a firearm" to the verb "use"

narrows the
meaning of that verb (it can no longer mean "partake of "),
so also adding the modifier "in the offense of transferring,selling, or transporting firearms" to the phrase "use a firearm" expands the meaning of that phrase (it then includes,as it previously would not, nonweapon use). But neither the
narrowing nor the expansion should logically be thought toapply to

all appearances of the affected word or phrase.
Just as every appearance of the word "use" in the statute
need not be given the narrow meaning that word acquires in
the phrase "use a firearm," so also every appearance of the
phrase "use a firearm" need not be given the expansive connotation that phrase acquires in the broader context "use a
firearm in crimes such as unlawful sale of firearms." When,
for example, the statute provides that its prohibition on certain transactions in firearms "shall not apply to the loan or
rental of a firearm to any person for temporary use for lawful
sporting purposes," 18 U. S. C. $$ 922(a)(5)(B), (b)(3)(B), I
have no doubt that the "use" referred to is only use as a
sporting weapon, and not the use of pawning the firearm to
pay for a ski trip. Likewise when, in $ 924(c)(1), the phrase
"uses . . . a firearm" is not employed in a context that necessarily envisions the unusual "use" of a firearm as a commodity, the normally understood meaning of the phrase should
prevail.

Another consideration leads to the same conclusion:

$ 924(c)(1) provides increased penalties not only for one who
"uses" a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, but also for one who "carries"
a firearm in those circumstances. The interpretation I
would give the language produces an eminently reasonable
dichotomy between "using a firearm" (as a weapon) and "carrying a firearm" (which in the context "uses or carries a fire508us1$78J 02-21-97 22:40:08 PAGES OPINPGT
246 SMITH v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting
arm" means carrying it in such manner as to be ready foruse as a weapon). The Court's interpretation, by contrast,

produces a strange dichotomy between "using a firearm forany purpose whatever, including barter," and "carrying a
firearm." 3Finally, although the present prosecution was brought
under the portion of $ 924(c)(1) pertaining to use of a firearm"during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime," I
think it significant that that portion is affiliated with the pre-existing provision pertaining to use of a firearm "during and
in relation to any crime of violence," rather than with thefirearm trafficking offenses defined in $ 922 and referenced
in $ 924(d). The word "use" in the "crime of violence" con-text has the unmistakable import of use as a weapon, and
that import carries over, in my view, to the subsequentlyadded phrase "or drug trafficking crime." Surely the word
"use" means the same thing as to both, and surely the 1986addition of "drug trafficking crime" would have been a peculiar way to expand its meaning (beyond "use as a weapon")for crimes of violence.

Even if the reader does not consider the issue to be asclear as I do, he must at least acknowledge, I think, that it
is eminently debatable--and that is enough, under the ruleof lenity, to require finding for the petitioner here. "At the
very least, it may be said that the issue is subject to somedoubt. Under these circumstances, we adhere to the familiar rule that, `where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute,doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.' "

3 The Court responds to this argument by abandoning all pretense of
giving the phrase "uses a firearm" even a permissible meaning, much less
its ordinary one. There is no problem, the Court says, because it is not
contending that "uses a firearm" means "uses for any purpose," only that
it means "uses as a weapon or for trade." See ante, at 236. Unfortunately, that is not one of the options that our mother tongue makes available. "Uses a firearm" can be given a broad meaning ("uses for any purpose") or its more ordinary narrow meaning ("uses as a weapon"); but it
can not possibly mean "uses as a weapon or for trade."

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

4 The Court contends that giving the language its ordinary meaning
would frustrate the purpose of the statute, since a gun "can be converted
instantaneously from currency to cannon," ante, at 240. Stretching language in order to write a more effective statute than Congress devised is
not an exercise we should indulge in. But in any case, the ready ability
to use a gun that is at hand as a weapon is perhaps one of the reasons
the statute sanctions not only using a firearm, but carrying one. Here,
however, the Government chose not to indict under that provision. See

MERTENS et al. v. HEWITT ASSOCIATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-1671. Argued February 22, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
Petitioners allege that they represent a class of former employees who

participated in the Kaiser Steel Retirement Plan, a qualified pension
plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA); that respondent was the plan's actuary when Kaiser began to
phase out its steelmaking operations, prompting early retirement by
many plan participants; that respondent failed to change the plan's actuarial assumptions to reflect the additional retirement costs, causing the
plan to be funded inadequately and eventually to be terminated; that
petitioners now receive only the benefits guaranteed by ERISA, rather
than the substantially greater pensions due them under the plan; and
that respondent is liable for the plan's losses as a nonfiduciary that
knowingly participated in the plan fiduciaries' breach of their fiduciary
duties. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of
Appeals affirmed.

Held: ERISA does not authorize suits for money damages against nonfiduciaries who knowingly participate in a fiduciary's breach of fiduciary
duty. ERISA $ 502(a)(3) permits plan participants to bring civil actions
to obtain "appropriate equitable relief" to redress violations of the statute or a plan. Assuming, arguendo, that this creates a cause of action
against nonfiduciaries who knowingly assist in a fiduciary's breach of
duty, requiring respondent to make the plan whole for the losses it
sustained would not constitute "appropriate equitable relief." What
petitioners in fact seek is the classic form of legal relief, compensatory
damages. We have held that similar language used in another statute
precludes awarding damages. See United States v. Burke, 504 U. S.
229, 238. And the text of ERISA leaves no doubt that Congress intended "equitable relief" to include only those types of relief that were
typically available in equity, such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution. Given ERISA's roots in the law of trusts, "equitable relief " could
in theory mean all relief available for breach of trust in the common-law
courts of equity, which would include the relief sought here. Since all
relief available for breach of trust could be obtained from an equity
court, however, that interpretation would render the modifier "equitable" superfluous; that reading would also deprive of all meaning the
distinction Congress drew between "equitable relief " and "remedial"

Opinion of the Court
et seq., is liable for losses that an employee benefit plan suf-fers as a result of the breach.

I
According to the complaint, the allegations of which wetake as true, petitioners represent a class of former employees of the Kaiser Steel Corporation (Kaiser) who participatedin the Kaiser Steel Retirement Plan, a qualified pension plan
under ERISA. Respondent was the plan's actuary in 1980,when Kaiser began to phase out its steelmaking operations,
prompting early retirement by a large number of plan partic-ipants. Respondent did not, however, change the plan's actuarial assumptions to reflect the additional costs imposedby the retirements. As a result, Kaiser did not adequately
fund the plan, and eventually the plan's assets became insuf-ficient to satisfy its benefit obligations, causing the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to terminate the planpursuant to 29 U. S. C. $ 1341. Petitioners now receive only
the benefits guaranteed by ERISA, see $ 1322, which are ingeneral substantially lower than the fully vested pensions
due them under the plan.Petitioners sued the fiduciaries of the failed plan, alleging
breach of fiduciary duties. See Mertens v. Black, 948 F. 2d1105 (CA9 1991)

(per curiam) (affirming denial of summaryjudgment). They also commenced this action against respondent,1 alleging that it had caused the losses by allowingKaiser to select the plan's actuarial assumptions, by failing
to disclose that Kaiser was one of its clients, and by failingto disclose the plan's funding shortfall. Petitioners claimed
that these acts and omissions violated ERISA by effecting abreach of respondent's "professional duties" to the plan, for
which they sought, inter alia, monetary relief. In opposing

capacity as the plan's statutory trustee. The District Court's dismissal of
these defendants was not appealed, nor was its dismissal of the PBGC's
cross-claim demanding that any recovery by petitioners be paid to it.

respondent's motion to dismiss, petitioners fleshed out thisclaim, asserting that respondent was liable (1) as an ERISA

fiduciary that committed a breach of its own fiduciary duties,(2) as a nonfiduciary that knowingly participated in the plan
fiduciaries' breach of their fiduciary duties, and (3) as a non-fiduciary that committed a breach of nonfiduciary duties imposed on actuaries by ERISA. The District Court for theNorthern District of California dismissed the complaint,

ERISA is, we have observed, a "comprehensive and reticu-lated statute," the product of a decade of congressional study
of the Nation's private employee benefit system. Nachman
Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S.359, 361 (1980). The statute provides that not only the persons named as fiduciaries by a benefit plan, see 29 U. S. C.$ 1102(a), but also anyone else who exercises discretionary
control or authority over the plan's management, administra-tion, or assets, see $ 1002(21)(A), is an ERISA "fiduciary."
Fiduciaries are assigned a number of detailed duties andresponsibilities, which include "the proper management,
administration, and investment of [plan] assets, the mainte2 Petitioners also claimed that respondent's activities constituted a
party-in-interest transaction prohibited by ERISA and professional malpractice under state law. The District Court's dismissal of the former
claim was not appealed, but the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal
of the pendent claim on state-law grounds. Petitioners also sought declaratory and injunctive relief, which the District Court deemed irrelevant,
given that the plan had been terminated and with it respondent's position
as the plan's actuary. The Court of Appeals did not address this point.

Opinion of the Court
allows the Secretary of Labor or any plan beneficiary, partic-ipant, or fiduciary to bring a civil action "for appropriate relief under section [409]."The above described provisions are, however, limited by
their terms to fiduciaries. The Court of Appeals decided
that respondent was not a fiduciary, see 948 F. 2d, at 610, andpetitioners do not contest that holding. Lacking equivalent

provisions specifying nonfiduciaries as potential defendants,or damages as a remedy available against them, petitioners
have turned to $ 502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3), which au-thorizes a plan beneficiary, participant, or fiduciary to bring
a civil action:

"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any
provision of [ERISA] or the terms of the plan, or (B) toobtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress

such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of[ERISA] or the terms of the plan . . . ."

See also $ 502(a)(5), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(5) (providing, insimilar language, for civil suits by the Secretary based upon
violation of ERISA provisions). Petitioners contend thatrequiring respondent to make the Kaiser plan whole for the
losses resulting from its alleged knowing participation in thebreach of fiduciary duty by the Kaiser plan's fiduciaries
would constitute "other appropriate equitable relief " within
the meaning of $ 502(a)(3).We note at the outset that it is far from clear that, even if

this provision does make money damages available, it makesthem available for the actions at issue here. It does not,
after all, authorize "appropriate equitable relief " at large,
but only "appropriate equitable relief " for the purpose of "redress[ing any] violations or . . . enforc[ing] any provisions"
of ERISA or an ERISA plan. No one suggests that any
term of the Kaiser plan has been violated, nor would any
be enforced by the requested judgment. And while ERISA
contains various provisions that can be read as imposing obli508us1$79K 02-21-97 22:41:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
gations upon nonfiduciaries, including actuaries,4 no provision explicitly requires them to avoid participation (knowing
or unknowing) in a fiduciary's breach of fiduciary duty. It is
unlikely, moreover, that this was an oversight, since ERISA
does explicitly impose "knowing participation" liability on
cofiduciaries. See $ 405(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1105(a). That limitation appears all the more deliberate in light of the fact that
"knowing participation" liability on the part of both cotrustees and third persons was well established under the
common law of trusts. See 3 A. Scott & W. Fratcher, Law
of Trusts $ 224.1, p. 404 (4th ed. 1988) (hereinafter Scott &
Fratcher) (cotrustees); 4 Scott & Fratcher $ 326, p. 291 (third
persons). In Russell we emphasized our unwillingness to
infer causes of action in the ERISA context, since that statute's carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme provides "strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate
expressly." 473 U. S., at 146-147. All of this notwithstanding, petitioners and their amicus the United States seem to
assume that respondent's alleged action (or inaction) violated
ERISA, and address their arguments almost exclusively to
what forms of relief are available. And respondent, despite
considerable prompting by its amici, expressly disclaims reliance on this preliminary point. See Brief for Respondent
18, n. 15; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. Thus, although we acknowledge the oddity of resolving a dispute over remedies where
it is unclear that a remediable wrong has been alleged, we

reasonable compensation, $ 1108(b)(2). See also $ 1023(d)(8) (annual reports must include certification by enrolled actuary); $ 1082(c)(3) (minimum funding standards for plan to be based on "reasonable" actuarial

Petitioners maintain that the object of their suit is "appro-priate equitable relief " under $ 502(a)(3) (emphasis added).

They do not, however, seek a remedy traditionally viewed as"equitable," such as injunction or restitution. (The Court of
Appeals held that restitution was unavailable, see 948 F. 2d,at 612, and petitioners have not challenged that.) Although
they often dance around the word, what petitioners in factseek is nothing other than compensatory

damages--mone-tary relief for all losses their plan sustained as a result of

the alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Money damages are,of course, the classic form of

legal relief. Curtis v. Loether,415 U. S. 189, 196 (1974); Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558,

570-571 (1990); D. Dobbs, Remedies $ 1.1, p. 3 (1973). Andthough we have never interpreted the precise phrase "other
appropriate equitable relief," we have construed the similarlanguage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (before
its 1991 amendments)--"any other equitable relief as thecourt deems appropriate," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g)--to preclude "awards for compensatory or punitive damages."
United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 238 (1992).Petitioners assert, however, that this reading of "equitable

relief " fails to acknowledge ERISA's roots in the commonlaw of trusts, see Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489
U. S. 101, 110-111 (1989). "[A]lthough a beneficiary's actionto recover losses resulting from a breach of duty superficially

5 The dissent expresses its certitude that "the statute clearly does not
bar such a suit." Post, at 265, n. 1. That, of course, is not the issue.
The issue is whether the statute affirmatively authorizes such a suit. To
meet that requirement, it is not enough to observe that "trust beneficiaries
clearly had such a remedy [against nonfiduciaries who actively assist in
the fiduciary's breach] at common law." Ibid. They had such a remedy
because nonfiduciaries had a duty to the beneficiaries not to assist in the
fiduciary's breach. A similar duty is set forth in ERISA; but as we have
noted, only some common-law "nonfiduciaries" are made subject to it,
namely, those who fall within ERISA's artificial definition of "fiduciary."

resembles an action at law for damages," the Solicitor Gen-eral suggests, "such relief traditionally has been obtained in

courts of equity" and therefore "is, by definition, `equitablerelief.' " Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-14.
It is true that, at common law, the courts of equity had exclu-sive jurisdiction over virtually all actions by beneficiaries for
breach of trust. See Lessee of Smith v. McCann, 24 How.398, 407 (1861); 3 Scott & Fratcher $ 197, p. 188.

6 It is also

true that money damages were available in those courtsagainst the trustee, see

United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S.206, 226 (1983); G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and

Trustees $ 701, p. 198 (rev. 2d ed. 1982) (hereinafter Bogert &Bogert), and against third persons who knowingly participated in the trustee's breach, see Seminole Nation v. United
States, 316 U. S. 286, 296-297 (1942); Scott, Participation ina Breach of Trust, 34 Harv. L. Rev. 454 (1921).

At common law, however, there were many situations--not limited to those involving enforcement of a trust--in
which an equity court could "establish purely legal rightsand grant legal remedies which would otherwise be beyond
the scope of its authority." 1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurispru-dence $ 181, p. 257 (5th ed. 1941). The term "equitable relief " can assuredly mean, as petitioners and the SolicitorGeneral would have it, whatever relief a court of equity is
empowered to provide in the particular case at issue. Butas indicated by the foregoing quotation--which speaks of
"legal remedies" granted by an equity court--"equitable re-lief " can also refer to those categories of relief that were
typically available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus,and restitution, but not compensatory damages). As memories of the divided bench, and familiarity with its technicalrefinements, recede further into the past, the former mean6 The only exceptions were actions at law to obtain payment of money
or transfer of chattels immediately and unconditionally due the beneficiary,

whether equivalent actions could also be brought in equity, see id., $ 198.3.

intended.In the context of the present statute, we think there can
be no doubt. Since all relief available for breach of trustcould be obtained from a court of equity, limiting the sort of
relief obtainable under $ 502(a)(3) to "equitable relief " in thesense of "whatever relief a common-law court of equity could
provide in such a case" would limit the relief not at all.7

7 The dissent argues that it would limit the relief by rendering punitive
damages unavailable. Post, at 270-272. The notion that concern about
punitive damages motivated Congress is a classic example of projecting
current attitudes upon the helpless past. Unlike the availability of money
damages, which always has been a central concern of courts and legislatures in fashioning causes of action, the availability of punitive damages
is a major issue today, but was not in 1974, when ERISA was enacted.
See Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 61-62 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); P. Huber, Liability 127 (1988); Ellis, Fairness and Efficiency in the Law of Punitive Damages, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 2-3 (1982).
That is particularly so for breach-of-trust cases. The 1988 edition of
Scott & Fratcher cites no pre-ERISA case on the issue of punitive damages, see 3 Scott & Fratcher $ 205, p. 239, n. 2; the 1982 edition of Bogert &
Bogert cites two, see Bogert & Bogert $ 862, p. 41, n. 12. The 1992 supplements to these treatises, however, each cite more than a dozen cases on
the issue from the 1980's.

But even if Congress had been concerned about "extracompensatory
forms of relief," post, at 270, it would have been foolhardy to believe that
excluding "legal" relief was the way to prohibit them (while still permitting other forms of monetary relief) in breach-of-trust cases. The dissent's confident assertion that punitive damages "were not available" in
equity, ibid., simply does not correspond to the state of the law when
ERISA was enacted. A year earlier, a major treatise on remedies was
prepared to say only that "a majority of courts that have examined the
point probably still refuse to grant punitive damages in equity cases." D.
Dobbs, Remedies $ 3.9, p. 211 (1973). That, of course, was speaking of
equity cases in general. It would have been even riskier to presume that
punitive damages were unavailable in that subclass of equity cases in
which law-type damages were routinely awarded, namely, breach-of-trust
cases. The few trust cases that did allow punitive damages were not
exclusively actions at law. See Rivero v. Thomas, 86 Cal. App. 2d 225,

Opinion of the Court
We will not read the statute to render the modifier superfluous. See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,
36 (1992); Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-110
(1990). Regarding "equitable" relief in $ 502(a)(3) to mean
"all relief available for breach of trust at common law" would
also require us either to give the term a different meaning
there than it bears elsewhere in ERISA, or to deprive of all
meaning the distinction Congress drew between "equitable"
and "remedial" relief in $ 409(a),8 and between "equitable"
and "legal" relief in the very same section of ERISA, see 29
U. S. C. $ 1132(g)(2)(E); in the same subchapter of ERISA,
see $ 1024(a)(5)(C); and in the ERISA subchapter dealing

194 P. 2d 533 (1948). The two decisions upon which the dissent relies,
Fleishman v. Krause, Lindsay & Nahstoll, 261 Ore. 505, 495 P. 2d 268
(1972), and Dixon v. Northwestern Nat. Bank of Minneapolis, 297 F. Supp.
485 (Minn. 1969), see post, at 271, held only that the breach-of-trust actions
at issue could be brought at law, thus entitling the plaintiffs to a jury trial.
While both decisions noted in passing that the plaintiffs sought punitive
as well as compensatory damages, neither said that those damages could
be obtained, much less that they could be obtained only at law.

The dissent's claim that the Courts of Appeals have adopted its theory
that "equitable relief" was used in ERISA to exclude punitive damages,
see post, at 272, n. 6, is also unfounded. The only opinion the dissent cites
that permits punitive damages when an "equitable relief" limitation does
not exist (viz., under $ 502(a)(2), which permits not only "equitable," but
also "remedial," relief) is Kuntz v. Reese, 760 F. 2d 926 (CA9 1985). That
opinion (a) was based on the Ninth Circuit precedent we subsequently
reversed in Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134
(1985), see Kuntz, supra, at 938; (b) was formally withdrawn after being
vacated on other grounds, see 785 F. 2d 1410 (per curiam), cert. denied,
479 U. S. 916 (1986); and (c) has never been relied upon again, even by the
Ninth Circuit.

8 We agree with the dissent, see post, at 269, n. 4, that the distinction

between "equitable" and "remedial" relief is artless, but do not agree that
we are therefore free to consider it meaningless. "Equitable" relief must
mean something less than all relief. Congress has, it may be noted, used
the same language ("other equitable or remedial relief") elsewhere. See
5 U. S. C. $ 8477(e)(1)(A).

with the PBGC, see $$ 1303(e)(1), 1451(a)(1).9 Neither option is acceptable. See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling
Co., 505 U. S. 469, 479 (1992); cf. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.
575, 583 (1978). The authority of courts to develop a "federal common law" under ERISA, see Firestone, 489 U. S., at
110, is not the authority to revise the text of the statute.

Petitioners point to ERISA $ 502(l), which was added to
the statute in 1989, see Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1989 (OBRA), Pub. L. 101-239, $ 2101, 103 Stat. 2123, and
provides as follows:

"(1) In the case of--

"(A) any breach of fiduciary responsibility under (or
other violation of) part 4 by a fiduciary, or

"(B) any knowing participation in such a breach or
violation by any other person,

"the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty against such
fiduciary or other person in an amount equal to 20 percent of the applicable recovery amount." 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(l)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. III).

9 The dissent postulates that Congress used the "legal or equitable relief " language only where the cause of action it was authorizing lacked
"any discernible analogue in the common law of trusts," as a means of
indicating that the courts are "free to craft whatever relief is most appropriate." Post, at 268-269. That is demonstrably not so. Administrative accounting requirements like the ones enforced through 29 U. S. C.

$ 1024(a)(5)(C) (which uses the "legal or equitable" formulation) were not
unheard-of before ERISA, see 2A Scott & Fratcher $ 172, p. 456, and they
have an "analogue" in the basic duty of trustees to keep and render accounts upon demand by the beneficiary, see id., $ 172; Bogert & Bogert

$ 861, pp. 7-9. Moreover, in a 1986 amendment to the subchapter dealing
with the PBGC, Congress created a cause of action to enforce the provisions governing termination of single-employer plans, using the same
"other appropriate equitable relief" language as appears in $ 502(a)(3).
See 29 U. S. C. $ 1370(a)(2). That cause of action no more reflects some
common-law "analogue" than do those created by the other PBGC
provisions referred to in text (which employ the "legal or equitable"
formulation).

260 MERTENS v. HEWITT ASSOCIATES

Opinion of the Court
The Secretary may waive or reduce this penalty if he be-lieves that "the fiduciary or other person will [otherwise] not

be able to restore all losses to the plan without severe fi-nancial hardship." $ 1132(

l)(3)(B). "[A]pplicable recovery
amount" is defined (in $ 502(l)(2)(B)) as "any amount . . .
ordered by a court to be paid by such fiduciary or other per-son to a plan or its participants or beneficiaries in a judicial

proceeding instituted by the Secretary under [$$ 502](a)(2)or (a)(5)." It will be recalled that the latter subsection,

$ 502(a)(5), authorizes relief in actions by the Secretary onthe same terms ("appropriate equitable relief ") as in the
private-party actions authorized by $ 502(a)(3). Petitioners
argue that $ 502(l) confirms that $ 502(a)(5)--and hence, since
it uses the same language, $ 502(a)(3)--allows actions for
damages, since otherwise there could be no "applicable recovery amount" against some "other person" than the fiduciary, and the Secretary would have no occasion to worry
about whether any such "other person" would be able to "restore all losses to the plan" without financial hardship.

We certainly agree with petitioners that language used in
one portion of a statute ($ 502(a)(3)) should be deemed to
have the same meaning as the same language used elsewhere
in the statute ($ 502(a)(5)). Indeed, we are even more zealous advocates of that principle than petitioners, who stop
short of applying it directly to the term "equitable relief."
We cannot agree, however, that $ 502(l) establishes the existence of a damages remedy under $ 502(a)(5)--i. e., that it is
otherwise so inexplicable that we must give the term "equitable relief " the expansive meaning "all relief available for
breach of trust." For even in its more limited sense, the
"equitable relief " awardable under $ 502(a)(5) includes restitution of ill-gotten plan assets or profits, providing an "applicable recovery amount" to use to calculate the penalty, which
the Secretary may waive or reduce if paying it would prevent the restoration of those gains to the plan; and even assuming nonfiduciaries are not liable at all for knowing partic508us1$79K 02-21-97 22:41:28 PAGES OPINPGT

ipation in a fiduciary's breach of duty, see supra, at 253-254,cofiduciaries expressly are, see $ 405(a), so there are some

"other person[s]" than fiduciaries-in-breach liable under$ 502(l)(1)(B). These applications of $ 502(l) give it meaning
and scope without resort to the strange interpretation of
"equitable relief " in $ 502(a)(3) that petitioners propose.The Secretary's initial interpretation of $ 502(l) accords with

our view. The prologue of the proposed regulation imple-menting $ 502(l), to be codified at 29 CFR $ 2560.502l-1,
states that when a court awards "equitable relief "--as op-posed to "monetary damages"--a $ 502(l) penalty will be
assessed only if the award involves the transfer to the plan
of money or property. 55 Fed. Reg. 25288, 25289, and n. 9
(1990).

In the last analysis, petitioners and the United States ask
us to give a strained interpretation to $ 502(a)(3) in order to
achieve the "purpose of ERISA to protect plan participants
and beneficiaries." Brief for Petitioners 31. They note, as
we have, that before ERISA nonfiduciaries were generally
liable under state trust law for damages resulting from
knowing participation in a trustees's breach of duty, and they
assert that such actions are now pre-empted by ERISA's
broad pre-emption clause, $ 514(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), see
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 139-140
(1990). Thus, they contend, our construction of $ 502(a)(3)
leaves beneficiaries like petitioners with less protection than
existed before ERISA, contradicting ERISA's basic goal of
"promot[ing] the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans," Shaw v. Delta Air Lines,
Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 90 (1983). See Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co. v. Bruch, supra, at 114.

Even assuming (without deciding) that petitioners are correct about the pre-emption of previously available statecourt actions, vague notions of a statute's "basic purpose"
are nonetheless inadequate to overcome the words of its text
regarding the specific issue under consideration. See Pen508us1$79K 02-21-97 22:41:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S.633, 646-647 (1990). This is especially true with legislation

such as ERISA, an enormously complex and detailed statutethat resolved innumerable disputes between powerful competing interests--not all in favor of potential plaintiffs. See,
e. g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54-56 (1987).The text that we have described is certainly not nonsensical;

it allocates liability for plan-related misdeeds in reasonableproportion to respective actors' power to control and prevent
the misdeeds. Under traditional trust law, although a bene-ficiary could obtain damages from third persons for knowing
participation in a trustee's breach of fiduciary duties, only
the trustee had fiduciary duties. See 1 Scott & Fratcher

$ 2.5, p. 43. ERISA, however, defines "fiduciary" not in
terms of formal trusteeship, but in functional terms of control and authority over the plan, see 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(21)(A),
thus expanding the universe of persons subject to fiduciary
duties--and to damages--under $ 409(a). Professional service providers such as actuaries become liable for damages
when they cross the line from adviser to fiduciary; must disgorge assets and profits obtained through participation as
parties-in-interest in transactions prohibited by $ 406, and
pay related civil penalties, see $ 502(i), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(i),
or excise taxes, see 26 U. S. C. $ 4975; and (assuming nonfiduciaries can be sued under $ 502(a)(3)) may be enjoined from
participating in a fiduciary's breaches, compelled to make
restitution, and subjected to other equitable decrees. All
that ERISA has eliminated, on these assumptions, is the
common law's joint and several liability, for all direct and
consequential damages suffered by the plan, on the part of
persons who had no real power to control what the plan did.
Exposure to that sort of liability would impose high insurance costs upon persons who regularly deal with and offer
advice to ERISA plans, and hence upon ERISA plans themselves. There is, in other words, a "tension between the
primary [ERISA] goal of benefiting employees and the

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

Justice White, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

The majority candidly acknowledges that it is plausible tointerpret the phrase "appropriate equitable relief " as used

in $ 502(a)(3), 88 Stat. 891, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3), at leaststanding alone, as meaning that relief which was available in
the courts of equity for a breach of trust. Ante, at 256.The majority also acknowledges that the relief petitioners
seek here--a compensatory monetary award--was availablein the equity courts under the common law of trusts, not only
against trustees for breach of duty, but also against nonfidu-ciaries knowingly participating in a breach of trust, ante, at
256, 261, 262. Finally, there can be no dispute that ERISAwas grounded in this common-law experience and that "we
are [to be] guided by principles of trust law" in construingthe terms of the statute.

Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 111 (1989). Nevertheless, the majority

today holds that in enacting ERISA Congress strippedERISA trust beneficiaries of a remedy against trustees and
third parties that they enjoyed in the equity courts undercommon law. Although it is assumed that a cause of action
against a third party such as respondent is provided byERISA, the remedies available are limited to the "traditional" equitable remedies, such as injunction and restitu-tion, and do not include compensatory damages--"the classic
form of legal relief." Ante, at 255 (emphasis in original).

White, J., dissenting
Because I do not believe that the statutory language re-quires this result and because we have elsewhere recognized

the anomaly of construing ERISA in a way that "would af-ford less protection to employees and their beneficiaries than
they enjoyed before ERISA was enacted," Firestone, supra,at 114 (emphasis added), I must dissent.

I
Concerned that many pension plans were being corruptlyor ineptly mismanaged and that American workers were losing their financial security in retirement as a result, Con-gress in 1974 enacted ERISA, "declar[ing] [it] to be the policy of [the statute] to protect . . . the interests of participantsin employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and benefi-ciaries of financial and other information with respect [to the
plans], by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and
by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and readyaccess to the Federal courts." 29 U. S. C. $ 1001(b).

As we have noted previously, "ERISA's legislative historyconfirms that the Act's fiduciary responsibility provisions,
29 U. S. C. $$ 1101-1114, `codif[y] and mak[e] applicable to[ERISA] fiduciaries certain principles developed in the evolution of the law of trusts.' " Firestone, supra, at 110 (quot-ing H. R. Rep. No. 93-533, p. 11 (1973)). ERISA, we have
explained, "abounds with the language and terminology oftrust law" and must be construed against the background of
the common law of trusts. Firestone, supra, at 110-111; seealso

Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension
Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570-571(1985). Indeed, absent some express statutory departure--

such as ERISA's broader definition of a responsible "fidu-ciary," see ante, at 262--Congress intended that the courts
would look to the settled experience of the common law ingiving shape to a " `federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans.' " Firestone, supra, at

(statement of Sen. Williams).Accordingly, it is to the common law of trusts that we must
look in construing the scope of the "appropriate equitablerelief " for breaches of trust contemplated by $ 502(a)(3), 29
U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(3).1 As the majority notes, at common law

1 As an initial matter, the majority expresses some uncertainty about
whether $ 502(a)(3) affords a cause of action and any sort of remedy
against nonfiduciaries who participate in a fiduciary's breach of duty under
the statute. See ante, at 253-254. In my view, however, the statute
clearly does not bar such a suit. Section 502(a)(3) gives a cause of action
to any participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary of an ERISA-governed plan
"to redress . . . violations" of the statute. There can be no dispute that
when an ERISA fiduciary breaches his or her duty of care in managing
the plan, there has been a violation of the statute. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1104.
The only question then is whether the remedies provided by $ 502(a)(3)
"to redress such [a] violatio[n]" must stop with the breaching fiduciary or
may extend to nonfiduciaries who actively assist in the fiduciary's breach.
Section 502(a)(3) does not expressly provide for such a limitation and it
does not seem appropriate to import one given that trust beneficiaries
clearly had such a remedy at common law, see ante, at 256, 261, 262, and
that ERISA is grounded in that common law and was intended, above all,
to protect the interests of beneficiaries.

Moreover, the amendment of the statute in 1989, adding $ 502(l), seems
clearly to reflect Congress' understanding that ERISA provides such a
remedy. As the majority notes, see ante, at 259, $ 502(l) empowers the
Secretary of Labor to assess a civil penalty against nonfiduciaries who
"knowing[ly] participat[e]" in a fiduciary's breach of trust. 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(l)(1)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. III). The subsection further provides that
this penalty shall be "equal to 20 percent of the applicable recovery
amount" obtained from the nonfiduciary in a proceeding under $ 502(a)(5),
which provides a cause of action to the Secretary that parallels that
provided to beneficiaries under $ 502(a)(3). $$ 1132(l)(1) and (2); see also
ante, at 260. This provision clearly contemplates that some remedy
may be had under $ 502(a)(5)--and, by necessary implication, under

$ 502(a)(3)--against nonfiduciaries for "knowing participation" in a fiduciary's "breach of fiduciary responsibilit[ies]." $ 1132(l)(1). Given that
this understanding accords with well-established common-law trust principles undergirding ERISA and that it is also compatible with the language
of $ 502(a)(3), I see no basis for doubting the validity of petitioners' cause
of action.

the courts of equity were the predominant forum for benefi-ciaries' claims arising from a breach of trust. These courts

were not, however, the exclusive forum. In some instances,there was jurisdiction both in law and in equity and it was
generally (although not universally) acknowledged that the
beneficiary could elect between his or her legal and equitableremedies. See

Clews v. Jamieson, 182 U. S. 461, 480-481

Trust as Exclusive of Remedy in Equity, 171 A. L. R. 429
(1947). Indeed, the Restatement of Trusts sets out in separate, successive sections the "legal" and "equitable" remedies
available to beneficiaries under the common law of trusts.
See Restatement (Second) of Trusts $$ 198, 199 (1959).

The traditional "equitable remedies" available to a trust
beneficiary included compensatory damages. Equity "endeavor[ed] as far as possible to replace the parties in the
same situation as they would have been in, if no breach of
trust had been committed." Hill, supra, at *522; see also
J. Tiffany & E. Bullard, Law of Trusts and Trustees 585-

586 (1862) (defendant is chargeable with any losses caused to
trust or with any profits trust might have earned absent the
breach). This included, where necessary, the payment of a
monetary award to make the victims of the breach whole.
Clews v. Jamieson, supra, at 479-480; Hill, supra, at *522;
Bogert & Bogert, supra, $ 862; see also United States v.

J., concurring in judgment).

Given this history, it is entirely reasonable in my view to
construe $ 502(a)(3)'s reference to "appropriate equitable relief " to encompass what was equity's routine remedy for such
breaches--a compensatory monetary award calculated to
make the victims whole, a remedy that was available against

both fiduciaries and participating nonfiduciaries. Constru-ing the statute in this manner also avoids the anomaly of

interpreting ERISA so as to leave those Congress set out toprotect--the participants in ERISA-governed plans and
their beneficiaries--with "less protection . . . than they en-joyed before ERISA was enacted."

Firestone, 489 U. S., at114.
2 Indeed, this is precisely how four Justices of this

Court read $ 502(a)(3)'s reference to "appropriate equitablerelief " in

Russell. See 473 U. S., at 154, and n. 10 (Brennan,
J., joined by White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concur-ring in judgment).

II
The majority, however, struggles to find on the face of the
statute evidence that $ 502(a)(3) is to be more narrowly con-strued. First, it observes that ERISA elsewhere uses the

terms "remedial relief " and "legal relief " and reasons thatCongress must therefore have intended to differentiate between these concepts and "equitable relief." Second, it isnoted that the crucial language of $ 502(a)(3) describes the
available relief as equitable relief. It is then asserted that
"[s]ince all relief available for breach of trust could be ob-tained from a court of equity, limiting the sort of relief obtainable under $ 502(a)(3) to `equitable relief ' in the sense of`whatever relief a common-law court of equity could provide
in such a case' would limit the relief not at all," renderingCongress' imposition of the modifier "equitable" a nullity.
Ante, at 257 (emphasis in original). Searching for some way

2 Section 514(a) of ERISA pre-empts "any and all State laws insofar as
they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan" governed
by ERISA. 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a). Although the majority stops short of
deciding the pre-emption implications of its holding, see ante, at 261, it is
difficult to imagine how any common-law remedy for the harm alleged
here--participation in a breach of fiduciary duty concerning an ERISAgoverned plan--could have survived enactment of ERISA's " `deliberately
expansive' " pre-emption provision, Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498

in which to give "appropriate equitable relief " a limitingeffect, the majority feels compelled to read the phrase as

encompassing only "those categories of relief that were
typically available" in the broad run of equity cases, without regard to the particular equitable remedies available
in trust cases. See ante, at 256 (emphasis in original). Thiswould include injunction and restitution, for example, but not

money damages. See ibid. As I see it, however, the words"appropriate equitable relief " are no more than descriptive
and simply refer to all remedies available in equity under thecommon law of trusts, whether or not they were or are the
exclusive remedies for breach of trust.

I disagree with the majority's inference that by using
the term "legal . . . relief " elsewhere in ERISA, Congress
demonstrated a considered judgment to constrict the relief
available under $ 502(a)(3). To be sure, $ 502(g)(2)(E) of the
statute empowers courts to award appropriate "legal or
equitable relief " where a fiduciary successfully sues an employer for failing to make required contributions to a "multiemployer plan." $ 1132(g)(2)(E). Likewise, $ 104(a)(5)(C)
authorizes the Secretary of Labor to bring "a civil action
for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate" to
force the administrator of an employee benefit plan to file
certain plan documents with the Secretary. 29 U. S. C.

$ 1024(a)(5)(C). And, finally, $$ 4003(e)(1) and 4301(a)(1) of
the statute, also cited by the majority, empower courts to
dispense "appropriate relief, legal or equitable or both," in
actions brought by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) or by plan fiduciaries, participants, or beneficiaries with respect to the peculiar statutory duties relating
to the PBGC. 29 U. S. C. $ 1303(e)(1); see also $ 1451(a)(1)
(authorizing "an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief, or both"). Significantly, however, none of the causes of
action described in these sections--relating to the financing
of "multiemployer plans," administrative filing requirements,
and the PBGC--had any discernible analogue in the common

law of trusts. Accordingly, there being no common-law tradition either in law or in equity to which Congress might
direct the courts, it is not at all surprising that Congress
would refer to both legal and equitable relief in making clear
that the courts are free to craft whatever relief is most appropriate.3 It seems to me a treacherous leap to draw from
these sections a congressional intention to foreclose compensatory monetary awards under $ 502(a)(3) notwithstanding
that such awards had always been considered "appropriate
equitable relief " for breach of trust at common law. See
supra, at 266-267.4

3 The majority claims to find a common-law analogue for an action
under $ 104(a)(5)(C), likening an action by the Secretary of Labor to enforce ERISA's administrative filing requirements to a common-law action
against a trustee for failure to keep and render accounts. Ante, at 259,
n. 9. The analogy seems to me a long reach. The common-law duty of
trustees to account to beneficiaries for all transactions made on behalf of
the trust bears, at best, only slight resemblance to the ERISA-created
duty of plan administrators to file with the Secretary of Labor specified
annual reports, plan descriptions, and summary plan descriptions. See
29 U. S. C. $ 1024(a)(1). So, too, the fact that some States--by statute--
have required trustees to render an accounting to state courts, see 2A
A. Scott & W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts $ 172, p. 456 (4th ed. 1988), cited
ante, at 259, n. 9, fails to establish a common-law analogue for actions by
the Secretary under $ 104(a)(5)(C).

4 Moreover, if the text of the statute reflects Congress' careful differentiation between "legal" and "equitable" relief, as the majority posits, it presumably must also reflect a careful differentiation between "equitable" and
"remedial" relief and, for that matter, between "legal" and "remedial" relief. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1109(a) (breaching fiduciary "shall be subject to such
other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate").
What limiting principle Congress could have intended to convey by this
latter term I cannot readily imagine. "Remedial," after all, simply means
"intended as a remedy," Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 996
(1983), and "relief" is commonly understood to be a synonym for "remedy,"
id., at 995. At the very least, Congress' apparent imprecision in this regard undermines my confidence in the strong inferences drawn by the
majority from Congress' varying phraseology concerning relief under
ERISA.

White, J., dissenting
Even accepting, however, that "equitable" relief is to bedistinguished from "legal" relief under the statute, the majority is wrong in supposing that the former concept swal-lows the latter if $ 502(a)(3)'s reference to "appropriate equitable relief " is understood to encompass those remedies thatwere traditionally available in the equity courts for breach
of trust. The fact of the matter is that not all forms of reliefwere available in the common-law courts of equity for a
breach of trust. Although the equity courts could awardmonetary relief to make the victim of a breach of trust whole,
extracompensatory forms of relief, such as punitive damages,were not available. As this Court has long recognized,
courts of equity would not--absent some express statutoryauthorization--enforce penalties or award punitive damages.
See Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412, 422, and n. 7 (1987);

W. Hale, Law of Damages 319 (2d ed. 1912); 1 T. Sedgwick,
Measure of Damages $ 371, p. 531 (8th ed. 1891). As Justice Kennedy has observed, this limitation on equitable relief applied in the trust context as well, where plaintiffs couldrecover compensatory monetary relief for a breach of trust,

but not punitive or exemplary damages. See Teamsters v.
Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 587 (1990) (dissenting opinion).5

5 Justice Kennedy's observation is well grounded in legal history. In
crafting a remedy for a breach of trust the exclusive aim of the commonlaw equity courts was to make the victim whole, "endeavor[ing] as far as
possible to replace the parties in the same situation as they would have
been in, if no breach of trust had been committed." J. Hill, Trustees *522;
see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 205 (1959). Historically, punitive damages were unavailable in any equitable action on the theory that
"the Court of Chancery as the Equity Court is a court of conscience and
will permit only what is just and right with no element of vengeance."

By contrast, punitive damages were among the "legal rem-edies" available in common-law trust cases. In those trust

cases that historically could have been brought as actionsat law--such as where a trustee is under an immediate and
unconditional duty to pay over funds to a beneficiary, see
ante, at 256, n. 6--it has been acknowledged that the benefi-ciary may recover punitive as well as compensatory damages. See Fleishman v. Krause, Lindsay & Nahstoll, 261Ore. 505, 495 P. 2d 268 (1972) (reversing and remanding for
jury trial beneficiary's claim for punitive and compensatorydamages); Dixon v. Northwestern Nat. Bank of Minneapolis, 297 F. Supp. 485 (Minn. 1969) (same). Moreover, whilethe majority of courts adhere to the view that equity courts,
even in trust cases, cannot award punitive damages, seeNote, Participant and Beneficiary Remedies Under ERISA:
Extracontractual and Punitive Damages After Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, 71 Cornell L.

(1975); Superior Constr. Co. v. Elmo, 204 Md. 1, 16, 104 A. 2d 581, 583

117 So. 2d 419, 422-423 (Fla. App. 1960); D. Dobbs, Remedies $ 3.9,
pp. 211-212 (1973). Thus, even "where, in equitable actions, it becomes
necessary to award damages, only compensatory damages should be allowed." Karns v. Allen, 135 Wis. 48, 58, 115 N. W. 357, 361 (1908); see

1913); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages $ 371, p. 531 (8th ed. 1891).

The majority denigrates this traditional rule by citing to Professor
Dobbs' 1973 treatise on remedies. That treatise noted a "modern" trend
among some courts (on the eve of ERISA's enactment) to allow punitive
damages in equity cases, but it also noted that the majority rule remained
otherwise. Moreover, the trend Professor Dobbs identified was driven in
large part by the "modern" merger of law and equity and by the consequent belief that there is no longer any reason to disallow "legal" remedies
in what traditionally were "equitable" actions. See ante, at 258, n. 8. Accordingly, the majority's observation in no way undermines the validity of
the traditional rule--well ensconsed at the time of ERISA's enactment--
that punitive damages were not an appropriate equitable remedy, even in
trust cases.

Rev. 1014, 1029-1030 (1986); see also D. Dobbs, Remedies$ 3.9, pp. 211-212 (1973), a number of courts in more recent

decades have drawn upon their "legal" powers to award pu-nitive damages even in cases that historically could have
been brought only in equity. While acknowledging the tra-ditional bar against such relief in equity, these courts have
concluded that the merger of law and equity authorizes mod-ern courts to draw upon both legal and equitable powers in
crafting an appropriate remedy for a breach of trust. See

Because some forms of "legal" relief in trust cases werethus not available at equity, limiting the scope of relief under

limitation and, if one is needed, a basis for distinguishing"equitable" from "legal" relief.

III
Although the trust beneficiary historically had an equita-ble suit for damages against a fiduciary for breach of trust,

as well as against a participating nonfiduciary, the majoritytoday construes $ 502(a)(3) as not affording such a remedy
against any fiduciary or participating third party on theground that damages are not "appropriate equitable relief."
The majority's conclusion, as I see it, rests on transparently
1465 (CA5 1986), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 1034 (1987); Powell v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Virginia, 780 F. 2d 419, 424 (CA4 1985),
cert. denied, 476 U. S. 1170 (1986). With respect to $ 502(a)(2), however,
under which a beneficiary may claim both "equitable" and "remedial" relief, see 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(2) (allowing "for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title"), the courts are split over whether punitive damages
may be recovered. Compare Kuntz v. Reese, 760 F. 2d 926, 938 (CA9
1985) (allowing such a recovery), vacated on other grounds, 785 F. 2d 1410,
cert. denied, 479 U. S. 916 (1986), with Sommers Drug Stores, supra, at
1463 (disallowing such a recovery); see also Cox v. Eichler, 765 F. Supp.
601, 610-611 (ND Cal. 1990) (punitive damages available under $ 502(a)(2)
but not under $ 502(a)(3)). This Court in Russell expressly reserved judgment on whether punitive damages might be recovered on behalf of an
ERISA-governed plan under $ 502(a)(2). Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins.
Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 144, n. 12 (1985).

7 The majority faults "[t]he notion that concern about punitive damages

motivated Congress" in drafting ERISA on the grounds that the availability of punitive damages was not "a major issue" in 1974. Ante, at 257,
n. 7. Neither, of course, is there anything to suggest that the availability
of compensatory damages was a "major issue" in 1974, although the majority does not hesitate to attribute this concern to the 93d Congress. In
any event, it seems to me considerably less fanciful to suppose that Congress was motivated by a desire to limit the availability of punitive damages than that it was moved by a desire to take from the statute's intended
beneficiaries their traditional and possibly their only means of makewhole relief.

insufficient grounds. The text of the statute supports areading of $ 502(a)(3) that would permit a court to award

compensatory monetary relief where necessary to make anERISA beneficiary whole for a breach of trust. Such a
reading would accord with the established equitable reme-dies available under the common law of trusts, to which Congress has directed us in construing ERISA, and with Con-gress' primary goal in enacting the statute, the protection of
beneficiaries' financial security against corrupt or inept planmismanagement. Finally, such a reading would avoid the
perverse and, in this case, entirely needless result of constru-ing ERISA so as to

deprive beneficiaries of remedies theyenjoyed prior to the statute's enactment. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

275OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

SULLIVAN v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana

No. 92-5129. Argued March 29, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
The jury instructions in petitioner Sullivan's state-court trial for firstdegree murder included a definition of reasonable doubt that was essentially identical to the one held unconstitutional in Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (per curiam). The jury entered a verdict of guilty,
and Sullivan was sentenced to death. In upholding the conviction on
direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the erroneous
instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Held: A constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction cannot be

harmless error. Pp. 277-282.

(a) Sullivan's Sixth Amendment right to jury trial was denied by the
giving of a constitutionally deficient beyond-a-reasonable-doubt instruction. The Fifth Amendment requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, see, e. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364, and the Sixth Amendment requirement that the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisite finding of guilty, are interrelated: The required jury verdict is a
verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court's opinion in
Cage, which held that an instruction of the sort given here does not
produce such a verdict, is controlling. Pp. 277-278.

(b) The giving of a constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction is among those constitutional errors that require reversal of a conviction, rather than those that are amenable to harmless-error analysis.
See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24. Consistent with the jurytrial guarantee, Chapman instructs a reviewing court to consider the
actual effect of the error on the guilty verdict in the case at hand.
Since in petitioner's case there has been no jury verdict within the
meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the premise for harmless-error analysis is absent. Unlike an erroneous presumption regarding an element of the offense, see Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, a deficient reasonable-doubt instruction vitiates all the jury's factual findings.
A reviewing court in such a case can only engage in pure speculation--
its view of what a reasonable jury would have done. When it does that,
the wrong entity judges the defendant guilty. Moreover, denial of the
right to a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the consequences of which are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, is
certainly a "structural defec[t] in the constitution of the trial mechanism,
which def[ies] analysis by `harmless-error' standards" under Arizona v.

The question presented is whether a constitutionally defi-cient reasonable-doubt instruction may be harmless error.

I
Petitioner was charged with first-degree murder in thecourse of committing an armed robbery at a New Orleans

bar. His alleged accomplice in the crime, a convicted felonnamed Michael Hillhouse, testifying at the trial pursuant to
a grant of immunity, identified petitioner as the murderer.Although several other people were in the bar at the time of
the robbery, only one testified at trial. This witness, whohad been unable to identify either Hillhouse or petitioner at
a physical lineup, testified that they committed the robbery,and that she saw petitioner hold a gun to the victim's head.
There was other circumstantial evidence supporting the con-clusion that petitioner was the triggerman. 596 So. 2d 177,
180-181 (La. 1992). In closing argument, defense counselargued that there was reasonable doubt as to both the identity of the murderer and his intent.

Opinion of the Court
In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge gave a defi-nition of "reasonable doubt" that was, as the State conceded

below, essentially identical to the one held unconstitutionalin Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). See
596 So. 2d, at 185, and n. 3. The jury found petitioner guiltyof first-degree murder and subsequently recommended that
he be sentenced to death. The trial court agreed. On di-rect appeal, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held, consistent
with its opinion on remand from our decision in Cage, Statev.

Cage, 583 So. 2d 1125, cert. denied, 502 U. S. 874 (1991),that the erroneous instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 596 So. 2d, at 186. It therefore upheld theconviction, though remanding for a new sentencing hearing
because of ineffectiveness of counsel in the sentencing phase.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 939 (1992).

II
The Sixth Amendment provides that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . ." In Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), we found this right totrial by jury in serious criminal cases to be "fundamental to

the American scheme of justice," and therefore applicable instate proceedings. The right includes, of course, as its most
important element, the right to have the jury, rather thanthe judge, reach the requisite finding of "guilty." See

Sparfv. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 105-106 (1895). Thus, although a judge may direct a verdict for the defendant if theevidence is legally insufficient to establish guilt, he may not
direct a verdict for the State, no matter how overwhelm-ing the evidence.

fense charged, see, e. g., Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197,210 (1977); Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 795 (1952), and

must persuade the factfinder "beyond a reasonable doubt"of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements,
see, e. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970); Cool v.
United States, 409 U. S. 100, 104 (1972) (per curiam). Thisbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement, which was adhered

to by virtually all common-law jurisdictions, applies in stateas well as federal proceedings. Winship, supra.

It is self-evident, we think, that the Fifth Amendment re-quirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the Sixth
Amendment requirement of a jury verdict are interrelated.It would not satisfy the Sixth Amendment to have a jury
determine that the defendant is probably guilty, and thenleave it up to the judge to determine (as

Winship requires)whether he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In other

words, the jury verdict required by the Sixth Amendment isa jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Our per
curiam opinion in Cage, which we accept as controlling, heldthat an instruction of the sort given here does not produce
such a verdict.* Petitioner's Sixth Amendment right tojury trial was therefore denied.

III
In Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), we re-jected the view that all federal constitutional errors in the

course of a criminal trial require reversal. We held that the

*The State has argued in this Court that the Cage standard for review
of jury instructions, which looked to whether a jury "could have" applied
the instructions in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution, was contradicted in Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990), and disapproved in Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72-73, n. 4 (1991). In view of
the question presented and the State's failure to raise this issue below,
we do not consider whether the instruction given here would survive review under the Boyde standard. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg,
492 U. S. 33, 38-39 (1989); Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes
of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n. 20 (1979).

Opinion of the Court
Fifth Amendment violation of prosecutorial comment uponthe defendant's failure to testify would not require reversal

of the conviction if the State could show "beyond a reason-able doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to
the verdict obtained." Id., at 24. The Chapman standard
recognizes that "certain constitutional errors, no less thanother errors, may have been `harmless' in terms of their

effect on the factfinding process at trial." Delaware v. Van
Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986). Although most constitutional errors have been held amenable to harmless-erroranalysis, see

Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 306-307
(1991) (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., for the Court) (collecting examples), some will always invalidate the conviction.
Id., at 309-310 (citing, inter alia, Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total deprivation of the right to counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (trial by a biased
judge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984) (right to
self-representation)). The question in the present case is
to which category the present error belongs.

Chapman itself suggests the answer. Consistent with the
jury-trial guarantee, the question it instructs the reviewing
court to consider is not what effect the constitutional error
might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury,
but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the
case at hand. See Chapman, supra, at 24 (analyzing effect of error on "verdict obtained"). Harmless-error review looks, we have said, to the basis on which "the jury actually rested its verdict." Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 404
(1991) (emphasis added). The inquiry, in other words, is not
whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty
verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the
guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered--no
matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict
might be--would violate the jury-trial guarantee. See Rose

Opinion of the Court
v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 578 (1986); id., at 593 (Blackmun, J.,dissenting);

Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 509-510 (1987)
(Stevens, J., dissenting).Once the proper role of an appellate court engaged in the

Chapman inquiry is understood, the illogic of harmless-error
review in the present case becomes evident. Since, for thereasons described above, there has been no jury verdict

within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the entirepremise of

Chapman review is simply absent. There being
no jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, thequestion whether the

same verdict of guilty-beyond-areasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless. There is no object,
so to speak, upon which harmless-error scrutiny can operate.
The most an appellate court can conclude is that a jury would
surely have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt--not that the jury's actual finding of guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt would surely not have been different
absent the constitutional error. That is not enough. See
Yates, supra, at 413-414 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). The Sixth Amendment requires
more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury's
action, or else directed verdicts for the State would be sustainable on appeal; it requires an actual jury finding of guilty.
See Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607, 614 (1946).

Insofar as the possibility of harmless-error review is concerned, the jury-instruction error in this case is quite different from the jury-instruction error of erecting a presumption
regarding an element of the offense. A mandatory presumption--for example, the presumption that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts--violates the Fourteenth Amendment, because it may relieve the
State of its burden of proving all elements of the offense.
Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979); Francis v.
Franklin, 471 U. S. 307 (1985). But "[w]hen a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must

find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt."
Rose v. Clark, supra, at 580. And when the latter facts "are
so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed thatno rational jury could find those facts without also finding

that ultimate fact, making those findings is functionally
equivalent to finding the element required to be presumed."
Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 271 (1989) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment). See also Pope, supra, at 504(

Scalia, J., concurring). A reviewing court may thus be
able to conclude that the presumption played no significantrole in the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Yates, supra, at 402-406. But the essential connection to a
"beyond a reasonable doubt" factual finding cannot be made
where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of
the burden of proof, which vitiates all the jury's findings. A
reviewing court can only engage in pure speculation--its
view of what a reasonable jury would have done. And when
it does that, "the wrong entity judge[s] the defendant guilty."
Rose, supra, at 578.

Another mode of analysis leads to the same conclusion that
harmless-error analysis does not apply: In Fulminante, we
distinguished between, on the one hand, "structural defects
in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by `harmless-error' standards," 499 U. S., at 309, and, on
the other hand, trial errors which occur "during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be
quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented," id., at 307-308. Denial of the right to a jury verdict
of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is certainly an error of
the former sort, the jury guarantee being a "basic protectio[n]" whose precise effects are unmeasurable, but without
which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function,
Rose, supra, at 577. The right to trial by jury reflects, we
have said, "a profound judgment about the way in which law
should be enforced and justice administered." Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S., at 155. The deprivation of that right,

with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and in-determinate, unquestionably qualifies as "structural error."

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is re-versed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring.
In Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991), we divided
the class of constitutional violations that may occur duringthe course of a criminal proceeding, be it at trial or sentencing, into two categories: one consisting of "trial error[s],"which "may . . . be quantitatively assessed in the context of
other evidence presented," id., at 307-308 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., for the Court), and are amenable to harmlesserror analysis; the other consisting of "structural defects,"
which "affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds," id., at 310, and require automatic reversal. There is
a "strong presumption" that any error will fall into the first
of these categories. Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 579 (1986).
Thus, it is the rare case in which a constitutional violation
will not be subject to harmless-error analysis. See Fulminante, supra, at 309-310 (listing examples of structural
errors).

The Court holds today that the reasonable-doubt instruction given at Sullivan's trial, which (it is conceded) violates
due process under our decision in Cage v. Louisiana, 498
U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam), amounts to structural error,
and thus cannot be harmless regardless of how overwhelming the evidence of Sullivan's guilt. See ante, at 281-282.
It grounds this conclusion in its determination that harmlesserror analysis cannot be conducted with respect to error of
this sort consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to a
jury trial. We of course have long since rejected the argument that, as a general matter, the Sixth Amendment prohibits the application of harmless-error analysis in determin508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
ing whether constitutional error had a prejudicial impact onthe outcome of a case. See,

e. g., Rose, supra, at 582, n. 11.
The Court concludes that the situation at hand is fundamen-tally different, though, because, in the case of a constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction, "the entire premise of Chapman [harmless-error] review is simply absent."
Ante, at 280.

Where the jury views the evidence from the lens of adefective reasonable-doubt instruction, the Court reasons,

there can be no factual findings made by the jury beyond areasonable doubt in which an appellate court can ground its
harmless-error analysis. See ante, at 280-281. The Court
thus distinguishes our cases in which we have found jury
instructions that create an unconstitutional presumption regarding an element of the offense subject to harmless-error
review. In Rose v. Clark, supra, for example, we held that
harmless-error analysis may be applied in reviewing instructions that violate the principles of Sandstrom v. Montana,
442 U. S. 510 (1979), and Francis v. Franklin, 471 U. S. 307
(1985). The "malice instruction" in Rose shifted the burden
of proof on the issue of intent, in violation of due process
under our decision in Sandstrom. Because the jury was instructed to presume malice from certain predicate facts, and
it was required to find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt,
we held that the Sandstrom error was amenable to harmlesserror analysis. 478 U. S., at 580. See also Connecticut v.
Johnson, 460 U. S. 73, 96-97 (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).

There are many similarities between the instructional
error in Rose and the one in this case. In the first place,
neither error restricted the defendants' "opportunity to put
on evidence and make argument to support [their] claim[s] of
innocence." 478 U. S., at 579. Moreover, "[u]nlike [structural] errors such as judicial bias or denial of counsel, the
error[s] . . . did not affect the composition of the record."
Id., at 579, n. 7. Finally, neither error removed an element
of the offense from the jury's consideration, id., at 580, n. 8,

508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring
or prevented the jury from considering certain evidence.(In this regard, a trial in which a deficient reasonable-doubt

instruction is given seems to me to be quite different fromone in which no reasonable-doubt instruction is given at all.)
Thus, in many respects, the Cage violation committed at Sullivan's trial bears the hallmark of an error that is amenableto harmless-error analysis.

One may question whether, even in the case of Sandstromerror, the ability to conduct harmless-error review is dependent on the existence of "beyond a reasonable doubt" juryfindings. In the typical case, of course, a jury does not make
explicit factual findings; rather, it simply renders a general
verdict on the question of guilt or innocence. Thus, although it may be possible to conclude from the jury's verdict
that it has found a predicate fact (or facts), the reviewing
court is usually left only with the record developed at trial
to determine whether it is possible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the jury's
verdict. Moreover, any time an appellate court conducts
harmless-error review it necessarily engages in some speculation as to the jury's decisionmaking process; for in the end
no judge can know for certain what factors led to the jury's
verdict. Cf. Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 503, n. 6 (1987).
Yet harmless-error review has become an integral component of our criminal justice system. See Delaware v. Van
Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986); Chapman v. California,
386 U. S. 18, 22 (1967).

Despite these lingering doubts, I accept the Court's conclusion that a constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction is a breed apart from the many other instructional
errors that we have held are amenable to harmless-error
analysis. See, e. g., Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263
(1989) (per curiam) (instruction containing erroneous conclusive presumption); Pope v. Illinois, supra (instruction
misstating an element of the offense); Rose v. Clark, supra
(instruction containing erroneous burden-shifting presump508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT

tion). A constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruc-tion will always result in the absence of "beyond a reasonable doubt" jury findings. That being the case, I agreethat harmless-error analysis cannot be applied in the case
of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction consistent withthe Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. I join the
Court's opinion.

MUSICK, PEELER & GARRETT et al. v. EMPLOY-ERS INSURANCE OF WAUSAU

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-34. Argued March 1, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
Respondents insured most of the named defendants in a suit that, inter

alia, was based on an implied private right of action under $ 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (a 10b-5 action), and that eventually was settled
by the parties. After funding $13 million of the settlement, respondents brought this lawsuit seeking contribution from petitioners, who
were the attorneys and accountants involved in the stock offering that
prompted the 10b-5 action. Both the District Court and the Court of
Appeals, consistent with binding Circuit precedent, recognized that
respondents had a right to seek contribution for the 10b-5 liability.
Shortly after the latter court ruled in respondents' favor, however, the
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that there can be no implied cause of action for contribution in a 10b-5 action.

Held: Defendants in a 10b-5 action have a right to seek contribution as a

matter of federal law. Pp. 290-298.

(a) Federal courts have authority to imply a right to contribution in
a 10b-5 action. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451
U. S. 77, Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630,
and the precedents on which they are based, distinguished. The 10b-5
action was not created by Congress, but was implied by the judiciary.
The courts having implied the underlying liability in the first place, it
would be most unfair to those against whom damages have been assessed for the courts to now disavow authority to allocate that liability
on the theory that Congress has not addressed the issue directly. Congress has recognized a judicial authority to shape, within limits, the
10b-5 cause of action when, in enacting the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 and a statute respecting 10b-5 limitations periods, it included provisions acknowledging the 10b-5 action
without expressing any intent to define it. Congress has left that task
to the courts. Pp. 290-294.

(b) A right to contribution is within the contours of the 10b-5 action.
In order to ensure that the rules established to govern such actions are
symmetrical and consistent with the 1934 Act's overall structure and
objectives, the Court must attempt to infer how the 1934 Congress
would have addressed the issue of contribution had it included the 10b-5

private right of action as an express provision in the Act. See, e. g.,
Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350,
359. Two sections of the 1934 Act containing express private rights of
action, $$ 9 and 18, are close in structure, purpose, and intent to the
10b-5 action, and each explicitly provides for a right of contribution.
See 15 U. S. C. $$ 78i(e) and 78r(b). Consistency and coherence therefore require that a like contribution rule be adopted for 10b-5 actions.
Moreover, there is no evidence this rule will impede the purposes of the
10b-5 action; in the more than 20 years since the federal courts first
recognized a right to contribution for 10b-5 defendants, there has been
no showing that the right detracts from the effectiveness of the 10b-5
implied action or interferes with the effective operation of the securities
laws. Pp. 294-298.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Where there is joint responsibility for tortious conduct,the question often arises whether those who compensate the

injured party may seek contribution from other joint tortfea-sors who have paid no damages or paid less than their fair
share. In this case we must determine whether defendantsin a suit based on an implied private right of action under

$ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (a 10b-5
action) may seek contribution from joint tortfeasors. With-out addressing the merits of the claim for contribution in this
case, we hold that defendants in a 10b-5 action have a rightto seek contribution as a matter of federal law.

Opinion of the Court
fessionals had joint responsibility for the securities violations
and were liable for contribution under various theories, including a right to contribution based on the 10b-5 action
central to the complaint in the original class suit.

In proceedings before the United States District Court for
the Southern District of California and the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties disputed
the principles for determining whether the insureds had paid
more than their fair share of liability in the class settlement,
with scant attention being paid to the underlying issue
whether liability in a 10b-5 action is accompanied by any
right to contribution at all. This lack of attention is understandable, for the existence of the 10b-5 right to contribution
is well established in the Ninth Circuit, Smith v. Mulvaney,
827 F. 2d 558, 560 (1987), as well as in a number of other
Circuits, In re Jiffy Lube Securities Litigation, 927 F. 2d
155, 160 (CA4 1991); Sirota v. Solitron Devices, Inc., 673
F. 2d 566, 578 (CA2), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 838 (1982); Huddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F. 2d 534, 557-559 (CA5
1981), aff 'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 459 U. S.
375 (1983); Heizer Corp. v. Ross, 601 F. 2d 330, 331-334
(CA7 1979).

Some three months after the Court of Appeals ruled in
favor of respondents, 954 F. 2d 575 (CA9 1992), the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit created a conflict on the basic issue whether defendants in a 10b-5 action
have a right to contribution. In light of our decisions on
contribution in other areas of federal law, the Eighth Circuit
ruled that there can be no implied cause of action for contribution in a 10b-5 action. Chutich v. Touche Ross & Co., 960
F. 2d 721, 724 (1992). Petitioners requested that we resolve
the conflict among the Circuits. We granted their petition
for a writ of certiorari on the sole question presented:

Requests to recognize a right to contribution for defend-ants liable under federal law are not unfamiliar to this Court.

Twice we have declined to recognize an action for contribu-tion under federal laws outside the arena of securities regulation. In Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,451 U. S. 77 (1981), we held that an employer had no right to
contribution against unions alleged to be joint participantswith the employer in violations of the Equal Pay Act of 1963
and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Later thatsame Term, in

Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials,Inc., 451 U. S. 630 (1981), we determined that there is no

right to contribution for recovery based on violation of $ 1 ofthe Sherman Act.

On the other hand, we endorsed a nonstatutory right tocontribution among joint tortfeasors responsible for injuring
a longshoreman in Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke,
Inc., 417 U. S. 106 (1974). We have been careful to note thatCooper does not stand for the proposition that there is a

general right to contribution under federal law. Northwest
Airlines, supra, at 96-97. Indeed, the rule announced inCooper represented an exercise of our authority to provide

just and equitable remedies for cases within our admiraltyjurisdiction, a jurisdiction in which the federal courts have
had historic, well-recognized responsibility for the elabora-tion of legal doctrine. See United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397, 409 (1975). For our purposes, there-fore,

Cooper is less instructive than our decisions in TexasIndustries and Northwest Airlines. But the instruction we

receive from the latter two cases is that they are distinguish-able from, rather than parallel to, the matter now before us.

The federal interests in both Texas Industries and North-west Airlines were defined by statutory provisions that were

291Cite as: 508 U. S. 286 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
express in creating the substantive damages liability forwhich contribution was sought. Recognizing that the applicable statutes did not "implicate `uniquely federal interests'of the kind that oblige courts to formulate federal common
law," Texas Industries, 451 U. S., at 642, we asked whether
Congress "expressly or by clear implication" envisioned acontribution right to accompany the substantive damages

right created, id., at 638, or, failing that, whether Congress"intended courts to have the power to alter or supplement
the remedies enacted," id., at 645. See also Northwest Airlines, supra, at 91 and 97. But these inquiries are not helpful in the present context. The private right of action under
Rule 10b-5 was implied by the Judiciary on the theory courts
should recognize private remedies to supplement federal
statutory duties, not on the theory Congress had given an
unequivocal direction to the courts to do so. Blue Chip
Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 730, 737 (1975).
Thus, it would be futile to ask whether the 1934 Congress
also displayed a clear intent to create a contribution right
collateral to the remedy. See Franklin v. Gwinnett County
Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 76 (1992); id., at 71 (Scalia,
J., concurring).

If Texas Industries and Northwest Airlines are not controlling, petitioners tell us, then the precedents on which
those cases were based do control. Those authorities caution against the creation of new causes of action. Universities Research Assn., Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U. S. 754, 770 (1981);

Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S.
11, 15-16 (1979); Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S.
560, 575-577 (1979). They teach that the creation of new
rights ought to be left to legislatures, not courts. And, petitioners remind us, whether the right of a tortfeasor to seek
contribution from those who share, or ought to share, joint
liability is recognized by statute, see, e. g., Cal. Civ. Proc.
Code Ann. $$ 875-880 (West 1980 and Supp. 1993); Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $$ 32.001 and 32.002 (1986), or

as a matter of common law, see, e. g., Goldman v. MitchellFletcher Co., 292 Pa. 354, 364-365, 141 A. 231, 234-235
(1928); Davis v. Broad Street Garage, 191 Tenn. 320, 325, 232S. W. 2d 355, 357 (1950), in both instances the right is thought

to be a separate or independent cause of action. Cf. Northwest Airlines, supra, at 87, n. 17; Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 886A (1979).

This argument, like the argument based on Texas Industries and Northwest Airlines, would have much force were
the duty to be created one governing conduct subject to lia-bility under an express remedial provision fashioned by Congress, or one governing conduct not already subject to liability through private suit. That, however, is not the present
state of the jurisprudence we consider here. The parties
against whom contribution is sought are, by definition, persons or entities alleged to have violated existing securities
laws and who share joint liability for that wrong under a
remedial scheme established by the federal courts. Even
though we are being asked to recognize a cause of action
that supports a suit against these parties, the duty is but the
duty to contribute for having committed a wrong that courts
have already deemed actionable under federal law. The violation of the securities laws gives rise to the 10b-5 private
cause of action, and the question before us is the ancillary
one of how damages are to be shared among persons or entities already subject to that liability. Having implied the underlying liability in the first place, to now disavow any authority to allocate it on the theory that Congress has not
addressed the issue would be most unfair to those against
whom damages are assessed.

We must confront the law in its current form. The federal
courts have accepted and exercised the principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration of the scope of the 10b-5
right and the definition of the duties it imposes. As we recognized in a case arising under $ 14(a) of the 1934 Act, 15
U. S. C. $ 78n(a), "where a legal structure of private statutory

own cases and has become an established part of the securi-ties laws . . . we should enforce it as a meaningful remedy
unless we are to eliminate it altogether"). See also Blue
Chip Stamps, supra, at 737 (recognizing the authority of
federal courts to define "the contours of a private cause
of action under Rule 10b-5" and "to flesh out the portions
of the law with respect to which neither the congressional
enactment nor the administrative regulations offer conclusive guidance").

We are not alone in recognizing a judicial authority to
shape, within limits, the 10b-5 cause of action. The existence of that action, and our cumulative work in its design,
have been obvious legislative considerations in the enactment of two recent federal statutes. The first is the Insider
Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub.
L. 100-704, 102 Stat. 4680, which added the insider trading
prohibition of $ 20A to the 1934 Act. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78t-1.
Section 20A(d) states that "[n]othing in this section shall be
construed to limit or condition . . . the availability of any
cause of action implied from a provision of this title." The
second statute is the recent congressional enactment respecting limitations periods for 10b-5 actions. Following
our resolution two Terms ago of a difficult statute of limitations issue for 10b-5 suits, see Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), Congress intervened by limiting the retroactive effect of our decision, and the caution in its intervention is instructive. In

Opinion of the Court

an approach parallel to the one it adopted for the insidertrading statute, Congress did no more than direct the applicable "limitation period for any private civil action impliedunder section 78j(b) of this title [$ 10(b) of the 1934 Act] that
was commenced on or before June 19, 1991 [the day prior toissuance of

Lampf, Pleva]." 15 U. S. C. $ 78aa-1 (1988 ed.,Supp. III).

We infer from these references an acknowledgment of the10b-5 action without any further expression of legislative
intent to define it. See Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston,459 U. S. 375, 384-386 (1983); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378-382 (1982).Indeed, the latter statute, $ 78aa-1, not only treats the 10b-5
action as an accepted feature of our securities laws, butavoids entangling Congress in its formulation. That task, it
would appear, Congress has left to us.

III
We now turn to the question whether a right to contribu-tion is within the contours of the 10b-5 action. The parties

have devoted considerable portions of their briefs to debat-ing whether a rule of contribution or of no contribution is
more efficient or more equitable. Just as we declined to ruleon these matters in

Texas Industries and Northwest Air-lines, we decline to do so here. Our task is not to assess the

relative merits of the competing rules, but rather to attemptto infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the
issue had the 10b-5 action been included as an express pro-vision in the 1934 Act. See Lampf, Pleva, supra, at 359;
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 200-201 (1976).We do this not as an exercise in historical reconstruction for
its own sake, but to ensure that the rules established to gov-ern the 10b-5 action are symmetrical and consistent with
the overall structure of the 1934 Act and, in particular, withthose portions of the 1934 Act most analogous to the private
10b-5 right of action that is of judicial creation. Although

Opinion of the Court
we have narrowed our discretion in this regard over theyears, our goals in establishing limits for the 10b-5 action

have remained the same: to ensure the action does not con-flict with Congress' own express rights of action,

id., at 210,
to promote clarity, consistency, and coherence for those who
rely upon, or are subject to, 10b-5 liability, cf. Blue Chip
Stamps, 421 U. S., at 737-744, and to effect Congress' objectives in enacting the securities laws, Santa Fe Industries,
Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462, 477-478 (1977).

Inquiring about what a given Congress might have done,though not a promising venture as a general proposition,

does in this case yield an answer we find convincing. It is
true that the initial step, drawing some inference of congressional intent from the language of $ 10(b) itself, id., at 472;
Ernst & Ernst, supra, at 197, yields no answer. The text of

$ 10(b) provides little guidance where we are asked to specify
elements or aspects of the 10b-5 apparatus unique to a private liability arrangement, including a statute of limitations,
Lampf, Pleva, supra, at 359, a reliance requirement, Basic
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 243 (1988), a defense to liability, Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U. S.
299 (1985), or a right to contribution. Having made no attempt to define the precise contours of the private cause of
action under $ 10(b), Congress had no occasion to address
how to limit, compute, or allocate liability arising from it.

There are, however, two sections of the 1934 Act, $$ 9 and
18 (15 U. S. C. $$ 78i and 78r), that, as we have noted, are
close in structure, purpose, and intent to the 10b-5 action.
Lampf, Pleva, supra, at 360-361. See also Basic Inc.,
supra, at 243; Bateman Eichler, supra, at 316, n. 28; Ernst &
Ernst, supra, at 209, n. 28. Each confers an explicit right
of action in favor of private parties and, in so doing, discloses
a congressional intent regarding the definition and apportionment of liability among private parties. For two distinct reasons, these express causes of action are of particular
significance in determining how Congress would have re508us1$81L 02-13-97 20:34:43 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

solved the question of contribution had it provided for a pri-vate cause of action under $ 10(b). First, $$ 9 and 18 are

instructive because both "target the precise dangers that arethe focus of $ 10(b),"

Lampf, Pleva, supra, at 360, and the
intent motivating all three sections is the same--"to deter
fraud and manipulative practices in the securities markets,and to ensure full disclosure of information material to investment decisions," Randall v. Loftsgaarden, 478 U. S. 647,664 (1986).

Second, of the eight express liability provisions containedin the 1933 and 1934 Acts, $$ 9 and 18 impose liability upon
defendants who stand in a position most similar to 10b-5
defendants for the sake of assessing whether they should be
entitled to contribution. All three causes of action impose
direct liability on defendants for their own acts as opposed
to derivative liability for the acts of others; all three involve
defendants who have violated the securities law with scienter, Ernst & Ernst, supra, at 209, n. 28; all three operate
in many instances to impose liability on multiple defendants
acting in concert, 3 L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1739-1740,
n. 178 (2d ed. 1961); and all three are based on securities
provisions enacted into law by the 73d Congress. The Acts'
six other express liability provisions, on the other hand,
stand in marked contrast to the implied $ 10 remedy: $ 15
of the 1933 Act (15 U. S. C. $ 77o) and $ 20 of the 1934 Act (15
U. S. C. $ 78t) impose derivative liability only; $$ 11 and 12 of
the 1933 Act (15 U. S. C. $$ 77k and 77l) and $ 16 of the 1934
Act (15 U. S. C. $ 78p) do not require scienter in all instances,
see Ernst & Ernst, supra, at 208; Kern County Land Co. v.
Occidental Petroleum Corp., 411 U. S. 582, 595 (1973); $ 12 of
the 1933 Act and $ 16 of the 1934 Act do not often create
joint defendant liability, see Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S. 622,
650 (1988); Kern County, supra, at 591; and $ 20A of the 1934
Act (15 U. S. C. $ 78t-1) was not an original liability provision
in that Act, having been added to the securities laws in 1988,
see Lampf, Pleva, 501 U. S., at 361.

Opinion of the Court
Sections 9 and 18 contain nearly identical express provi-sions for a right to contribution, each permitting a defendant

to "recover contribution as in cases of contract from any per-son who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable
to make the same payment." 15 U. S. C. $$ 78i(e) and 78r(b).
These were forward-looking provisions at the time. Thecourse of tort law in this century has been to reverse the

old rule against contribution, but this movement has beenconfined in large part to actions in negligence. 3 F. Harper,
F. James, & O. Gray, Law of Torts $ 10.2, p. 42, and n. 10(2d ed. 1986). The express contribution provisions in $$ 9
and 18 were, and still are, cited as important precedents because they permit contribution for intentional torts. See
id., $ 10.2, p. 43, and n. 11; Ruder, Multiple Defendants in
Securities Law Fraud Cases, 120 U. Pa. L. Rev. 597, 650-651
(1972). We think that these explicit provisions for contribution are an important, not an inconsequential, feature of the
federal securities laws and that consistency requires us to
adopt a like contribution rule for the right of action existing
under Rule 10b-5. Given the identity of purpose behind

$$ 9, 10(b), and 18, and similarity in their operation, we find
no ground for ruling that allowing contribution in 10b-5 actions will frustrate the purposes of the statutory section
from which it is derived.

Our conclusion is consistent with the rule adopted by the
vast majority of Courts of Appeals and District Courts that
have considered the question. See, e. g., In re Jiffy Lube
Securities Litigation, 927 F. 2d, at 160; Smith v. Mulvaney,
827 F. 2d, at 560; Sirota v. Solitron Devices, Inc., 673 F. 2d,

404 U. S. 941 (1971). We consider this to be of particularimportance because in the more than 20 years since a right

to contribution was first recognized for 10b-5 defendants,DeHass v. Empire Petroleum Co., 286 F. Supp. 809, 815-816
(Colo. 1968), aff 'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds,435 F. 2d 1223 (CA10 1970), neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor the federal courts have suggestedthat the contribution right detracts from the effectiveness
of the 10b-5 implied action or interferes with the effectiveoperation of the securities laws. See Brief for the Securities
and Exchange Commission as Amicus Curiae 25-26. Ab-sent any showing that the implied $ 10(b) liability structure
or the 1934 Act as a whole will be frustrated by finding aright to contribution paralleling the right to contribution in
analogous express liability provisions, our task is completeand our resolution clear: Those charged with liability in a
10b-5 action have a right to contribution against other par-ties who have joint responsibility for the violation.

I
I agree with the Court's description of its mission as an
"attempt to infer how the 1934 Congress would have ad-dressed the issue had the 10b-5 action been included as an

express provision in the 1934 Act." Ante, at 294. How-ever, I do disagree with the Court's chosen method for pursuing this difficult quest. The words of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5scarcely "suggest that either Congress in 1934 or the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1942 foreordained" the existence of a private 10b-5 action. Blue Chip Stamps, 421U. S., at 737. Despite our conceded inability "to divine from

the language of $ 10(b) the express `intent of Congress,' "
ibid., we acquiesced in the lower courts' consensus that an
implied right of action existed under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty
Co., 404 U. S. 6, 13, n. 9 (1971); Affiliated Ute Citizens of
Utah v. United States, 406 U. S. 128, 150-154 (1972). See
Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., 69 F. Supp. 512 (ED Pa.
1946). Such acquiescence was "entirely consistent" with J. I.
Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426 (1964), which may have suggested a relatively permissive approach to the recognition ofimplied rights of action.

3 Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 730.

Although we later "decline[d] to read [Borak] so broadly
that virtually every provision of the securities Acts gives
rise to an implied private cause of action," Touche Ross &
Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 577 (1979), we never repudiated the 10b-5 action.We again have no cause to reconsider whether the 10b-5

action should have been recognized at all. In summarizingits rationale, the Court states: "Having made no attempt to
define the precise contours of the private cause of actionunder $ 10(b), Congress had no occasion to address how to

limit, compute, or allocate liability arising from it." Ante,at 295. Though this statement is an adequate description of

how we came to infer the private right of action, it is notan adequate defense of the Court's reasoning. Unlike the
majority, I do not assume that courts should accord different
treatment to implied rights of action whose recognition mayhave been influenced by

Borak. How a particular private
cause of action may have emerged should not weaken ourvigilance in the subsequent interpretation and application of

that action. Our inquiries into statutory text, congressionalintent, and legislative purpose remain intact. We have consistently declined to recognize an implied private cause of
action "under the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act . . . where it is `unnecessary to ensure the fulfillment of Congress' purposes' in adopting the Act." Santa Fe
Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462, 477 (1977) (quoting
Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U. S. 1, 41 (1977)).
Accordingly, the 10b-5 action must be "judicially delimited
one way or another unless and until Congress addresses the
question." Blue Chip Stamps, supra, at 749. In the absence of any compelling reason to allow contribution in private 10b-5 suits, we should seek to keep "the breadth" of
the 10b-5 action from "grow[ing] beyond the scope congressionally intended." Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg,
501 U. S. 1083, 1102 (1991).

The Court's abandonment of this restrained approach to
implied remedies stems from its mistaken assumption that a
right to contribution is a mere "elemen[t] or aspec[t]" of Rule
10b-5's private liability apparatus. Ante, at 295. Unlike a
statute of limitations, a reliance requirement, or a defense
to liability, however, contribution requires a wholly separate
cause of action. This case does not require us to define the
elements of a 10b-5 claim or to clarify some other essential
aspect of this liability scheme. Rather, we are asked to determine whether a 10b-5 defendant enjoys a distinct right
to recover from a joint tortfeasor.

The recent decision in which we established a limitationsperiod for 10b-5 actions,

Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &
Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), illustrates thedifference that I find decisive. A limitations period is almost indispensable to a scheme of civil liability; even when
federal law prescribes no express statute of limitations, wewill not ordinarily assume that Congress intended no time

limit. DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, 158 (1983).Rather, we " `borrow' the most suitable statute or other rule
of timeliness from some other source." Ibid. Contribution,by contrast, was generally unavailable at common law. See
Union Stock Yards Co. of Omaha v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.,
196 U. S. 217, 224 (1905). Those jurisdictions that have seen
fit to provide contribution have usually done so by resort to
legislation. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers,
451 U. S. 77, 87-88, and n. 17 (1981); Texas Industries, Inc.
v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 634 (1981). A
court that recognizes an implied right to contribution must
endorse a remedy contrary to the common law and perhaps
even the legislative policy of the relevant jurisdiction.

Lampf, Pleva and like cases thus offer scant guidance
when the question is not whether a right to contribution is
an appropriate incident of the 10b-5 action, but whether congressional intent or federal common law justifies an expansion of the class entitled to enforce $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
through private lawsuits. In conducting this inquiry, we
cannot safely rely on Congress' design of distinct statutory
provisions. Indeed, inappropriate extension of 10b-5 liability would "nullify the effectiveness of the carefully drawn
. . . express actions" that Congress has provided through
other sections of the 1934 Act. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 210 (1976). However proper it may be
to examine related portions of the Act when fleshing out details of the core 10b-5 action, see Lampf, Pleva, 501 U. S.,
at 359; id., at 365-366 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment), the Court errs in placing disposi508us1$81L 02-13-97 20:34:43 PAGES OPINPGT

tive weight on the existence of contribution rights under $$ 9
and 18 of the Act. See ante, at 296-298.

The proper analysis flows from our well-established approach to implied causes of action in general and to implied
rights of contribution in particular. When deciding whether
a statute confers a private right of action, we ask whether
Congress--either expressly or by implication--intended to
create such a remedy. Touche Ross, 442 U. S., at 575; Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15-
16, 24 (1979). Where Congress did not expressly create a
contribution remedy, we may infer that Congress nevertheless intended by clear implication to confer a right to contribution. Texas Industries, supra, at 638; Northwest Airlines, supra, at 90. Through the exercise of their power to
craft federal common law, federal courts may also fashion
a right to contribution. Texas Industries, supra, at 638;
Northwest Airlines, supra, at 90.

Application of this familiar analytical framework compels
me to conclude that there is no right to contribution under

$ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. With respect to fashioning a
common-law right to contribution, the Court readily and correctly concludes that the right to contribution recognized in
Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U. S. 106
(1974), has no bearing on the availability of contribution
under the elaborate federal statutory scheme governing purchases and sales of securities. Ante, at 290. See also Texas
Industries, supra, at 640-646; Northwest Airlines, supra, at
95-98. This case therefore depends exclusively on the interpretation of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

" `The starting point in every case involving construction
of a statute is the language itself.' " Ernst & Ernst, supra,

10b-5 suggests that joint tortfeasors should enjoy a right tocontribution. Section 10(b) makes it

"unlawful for any person . . .. . . . .

". . . To use or employ, in connection with the purchaseor sale of any security registered on a national securities
exchange or any security not so registered, any manipu-lative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commissionmay prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest for the protection of investors." 15 U. S. C.$ 78j(b).

Rule 10b-5 recasts this proscription in similar terms:

"It shall be unlawful for any person . . ."(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to

defraud,"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in orderto make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not mislead-ing, or

"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of busi-ness which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
"in connection with the purchase or sale of any secu-rity." 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1992).

The sweeping words of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 ban manipu-lation, deception, or fraud in the purchase or sale of securities. "[A]ny person" who engages in such activity meritscondemnation under the statute and the rule. Far from
being entitled to seek the protection of $ 10(b) and Rule10b-5, joint tortfeasors must confess that these provisions
were "expressly directed . . . to regulate their conduct forthe benefit" of others. Northwest Airlines, supra, at 92.

Neither enactment suggests that Congress or the SEC in-tended to "softe[n] the blow on joint wrongdoers" by permitting contribution. Texas Industries, supra, at 639. Quitethe contrary: As private actors "whose activities Congress
[and the SEC] intended to regulate for the protection and
benefit of an entirely distinct class," joint tortfeasors "canscarcely lay claim to the status of `beneficiary' " under $ 10(b)

and Rule 10b-5. Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, 430 U. S.,at 37.

The "underlying . . . structure of the [1934 Act's] statutoryscheme" also negates the existence of a 10b-5 contribution
action. Northwest Airlines, 451 U. S., at 91. The Court
notes the presence of express contribution rights under $$ 9
and 18 of the Act, but it misconstrues the significance of
these provisions. See ante, at 296-298. The ability to legislate express contribution remedies under the 1934 Act applies with no less force to $ 10(b) than to $$ 9 and 18. "When
Congress wished to provide a [contribution] remedy . . . it
had little trouble in doing so expressly." Blue Chip Stamps,
supra, at 734. Nor has Congress lacked opportunities to
modify the 10b-5 action. Within the last five years, Congress has both preserved and altered the 10b-5 action
through amendments to the 1934 Act. Compare Insider
Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub.
L. 100-704, $ 5, 102 Stat. 4681 (stating that nothing in a new
provision prohibiting insider trading "shall be construed to
limit or condition . . . the availability of any cause of action
implied from a provision of this title"), with 15 U. S. C.

350 (1991)). See generally ante, at 293-294. Had Congress
intended 10b-5 defendants to sue joint tortfeasors, a single
enactment could have given effect to this policy. Congress'
failure to act does not justify further judicial elaboration of
the 10b-5 action.

Moreover, contribution is inconsistent with our establishedviews of the 10b-5 action. In Blue Chip Stamps, supra, we

held that only actual purchasers and sellers of securities areentitled to press private 10b-5 suits. We based this conclusion largely on the language of $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, whichby their terms govern only "the purchase or sale of any security." See 421 U. S., at 731-732; id., at 756-757 (Powell, J.,concurring). The merits of a contribution action in this case
would turn on whether "the attorneys and accountants in-volved in [a] public offering" bore "joint responsibility for . . .
securities violations." Ante, at 288-289. Even if a courtwere to acknowledge respondents' status as the subrogees of
securities sellers, the contribution action would be at leastone level removed from the underlying exchange of securities. Blue Chip Stamps' requirement of actual purchase orsale would virtually evaporate in a contribution dispute embroiling only separate groups of professionals who had merelyadvised or facilitated a tainted securities transaction. The
rule adopted today thus undermines not only the discernibleintent of Congress and the SEC, but also our own elaboration
of this regulatory scheme. Such are the risks that inhere inthe "hazardous enterprise" of recognizing a private right of

Once again we have been invited to join a "vigorous debateover the advantages and disadvantages of contribution and

various contribution schemes." Texas Industries, 451 U. S.,at 638. Consistent with our prior practice, I would adhere
to the task of resolving the "dispositive threshold question:whether courts have the power to create . . . a cause of action
absent legislation." Ibid. Whether the answer to thatquestion is "most unfair" to those who litigate private 10b-5

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION et al.

v. BEACH COMMUNICATIONS, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 92-603. Argued March 29, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Act) provides that cable

television systems be franchised by local governmental authorities, but
exempts, inter alia, facilities serving "only subscribers in 1 or more
multiple unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, unless such . . . facilities us[e] any public right-of-way," $ 602(7)(B).
After petitioner Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that
a satellite master antenna television (SMATV) system--which typically
receives a satellite signal through a rooftop dish and then retransmits
the signal by wire to units within a building or a building complex--is
subject to the franchise requirement if its transmission lines interconnect separately owned and managed buildings or if its lines use or cross
any public right-of-way, respondents, SMATV operators, petitioned the
Court of Appeals for review. Among other things, the court found that

$ 602(7) violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because there is no rational basis for distinguishing between those facilities exempted by the statute and SMATV
systems linking separately owned and managed buildings.

Held: Section 602(7)(B)'s common-ownership distinction is constitutional.

Pp. 313-320.

(a) In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification
that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if
any reasonably conceivable state of facts could provide a rational basis
for the classification. See, e. g., Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 485.
On rational-basis review, a statutory classification such as the one at
issue comes before the Court bearing a strong presumption of validity,
and those attacking its rationality have the burden to negate every conceivable basis that might support it. Since a legislature need not articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the legislature was actually motivated by
the conceived reason for the challenged distinction. Legislative choice
is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational
speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data. Adherence to
these restraints on judicial review preserves to the legislative branch

its rightful independence and its ability to function. The restraints have
added force where a legislature must engage in a process of line drawing, as Congress did here in choosing which facilities to franchise. This
necessity renders the precise coordinates of the resulting legislative
judgment virtually unreviewable, since the legislature must be allowed
leeway to approach a perceived problem incrementally. Pp. 313-316.

(b) There are at least two possible bases for the common-ownership
distinction; either one suffices. First, Congress borrowed $ 602(7)(B)
from the FCC's pre-Act regulations, and, thus, it is plausible that Congress also adopted the FCC's rationale, which was that common ownership was indicative of systems for which the costs of regulation would
outweigh the benefits to consumers. A legislator might rationally assume that such systems would typically be limited in size or would share
some other attribute affecting their impact on cable viewers' welfare
such that regulators could safely ignore them. Subscribers who can
negotiate with one voice through a common owner or manager may have
greater bargaining power relative to the cable operator and therefore
less need for regulatory protection. A second conceivable basis for the
statutory distinction is concern over the potential for effective monopoly
power. The first SMATV operator to gain a foothold by installing a
dish on one building in a block of separately owned buildings would have
a significant cost advantage in competing for the remaining subscribers,
because it could connect additional buildings for the cost of a length of
cable while its competitors would have to recover the cost of their own
satellite facilities. Thus, the first operator could charge rates well
above its cost and still undercut the competition. These rationales provide plausible bases for the common-ownership distinction that do not
depend upon the use of public rights-of-way. Pp. 317-320.

Cable Television Association.*

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In providing for the regulation of cable television facilities,
Congress has drawn a distinction between facilities that
serve separately owned and managed buildings and those
that serve one or more buildings under common ownership
or management. Cable facilities in the latter category are
exempt from regulation as long as they provide services
without using public rights-of-way. The question before us
is whether there is any conceivable rational basis justifying
this distinction for purposes of the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.

The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Cable Act),
98 Stat. 2779, amended the Communications Act of 1934, 47
U. S. C. $ 151 et seq., to establish a national framework for
regulating cable television. One objective of the Cable Act
was to set out "franchise procedures and standards which
encourage the growth and development of cable systems and
which assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs
and interests of the local community." $ 601(2), 47 U. S. C.

$ 521(2). To that end, Congress provided for the franchising
of cable systems by local governmental authorities, $ 621(a),
47 U. S. C. $ 541(a), and prohibited any person from operating a cable system without a franchise, subject to certain
exceptions, $ 621(b), 47 U. S. C. $ 541(b). Section 602(7) of
the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U. S. C. A. $ 522(7)

ment by defining the operative term "cable system." 1 Acable system means any facility designed to provide video

programming to multiple subscribers through "closed trans-mission paths," but does not include, inter alia,

"a facility that serves only subscribers in 1 or moremultiple unit dwellings under common ownership, control, or management, unless such facility or facilitiesus[e] any public right-of-way." $ 602(7)(B), 47 U. S. C.

$ 522(7)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. V).
In part, this provision tracks a regulatory "private cable"exemption previously promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) pursuant to pre-existing authority under the Communications Act. See 47
CFR $ 76.5(a) (1984) (exempting from the definition of "cabletelevision system" "any such facility that serves or will serve
only subscribers in one or more multiple unit dwellingsunder common ownership, control, or management"). The
earlier regulatory exemption derived in turn from the Com-mission's first set of cable rules, published in 1965. See
Rules re Microwave-Served CATV, 38 F. C. C. 683, 741 (1965)(exempting from the definition of "community antenna television system" "any such facility which serves only the resi-dents of one or more apartment dwellings under common
ownership, control, or management, and commercial estab-lishments located on the premises of such an apartment
house"). The Cable Act narrowed the terms of the regula-tory exemption by further excluding from the exemption any
closed transmission facilities that use public rights-of-way.

1 The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of
1992, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460--enacted after the decision of the
Court of Appeals in this case--amended the Communications Act to provide, among other things, for the regulation of rates charged by cable
systems. See $ 3, 106 Stat. 1464. The 1992 Act renumbered the subsections of 47 U. S. C. $ 522 but did not amend the provision at issue, which
is now subsection (7). We refer to the current version of the Communications Act.

Opinion of the Court
This case arises out of an FCC proceeding clarifying theagency's interpretation of the term "cable system" as it is

used in the Cable Act. See In re Definition of a Cable Tele-vision System, 5 F. C. C. Rcd. 7638 (1990). In this proceeding, the Commission addressed the application of the exemp-tion codified in $ 602(7)(B) to satellite master antenna
television (SMATV) facilities. Unlike a traditional cabletelevision system, which delivers video programming to a
large community of subscribers through coaxial cables laidunder city streets or along utility lines, an SMATV system
typically receives a signal from a satellite through a smallsatellite dish located on a rooftop and then retransmits the
signal by wire to units within a building or complex of build-ings. See 5 F. C. C. Rcd., at 7639. The Commission ruled
that an SMATV system that serves multiple buildings via anetwork of interconnected physical transmission lines is a
cable system, unless it falls within the $ 602(7)(B) exemption.See id., at 7639-7640. Consistent with the plain terms of
the statutory exemption, the Commission concluded thatsuch an SMATV system is subject to the franchise requirement if its transmission lines interconnect separately ownedand managed buildings or if its lines use or cross any public
right-of-way. See id., at 7641-7642.2Respondents Beach Communications, Inc., Maxtel Limited
Partnership, Pacific Cablevision, and Western Cable Commu-nications, Inc.--SMATV operators that would be subject to
franchising under the Cable Act as construed by the Com-mission--petitioned the Court of Appeals for review. The

2 In its initial interpretation of the Cable Act, the Commission had ruled
that the dispositive distinction between a cable system and other video
distribution systems was "the crossing of the public rights-of-way, not the
ownership, control or management" of the buildings served. In re
Amendments of Parts 1, 63, & 76, 104 F. C. C. 2d 386, 396-397 (1986).
After a District Court held that this interpretation contravened the unambiguous terms of the statute, the Commission abandoned it in the proceedings at issue here. See In re Definition of a Cable Television System, 5
F. C. C. Rcd. 7638, 7641 (1990).

312 FCC v. BEACH COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals rejected respondents' statutory challenge
to the Commission's interpretation, but a majority of the
court found merit in the claim that $ 602(7) violates the implied equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause.
294 U. S. App. D. C. 377, 959 F. 2d 975 (1992). In the absence
of what it termed "the predominant rationale for local franchising" (use of public rights-of-way), the court saw no rational basis "[o]n the record," and was "unable to imagine"
any conceivable basis, for distinguishing between those facilities exempted by the statute and those SMATV cable systems that link separately owned and managed buildings.
Id., at 389, 959 F. 2d, at 987. The court remanded the record
and directed the FCC to provide "additional `legislative
facts' " to justify the distinction. Ibid.3

A report subsequently filed by the Commission failed to
satisfy the Court of Appeals. The Commission stated that
it was "unaware of any desirable policy or other considerations . . . that would support the challenged distinctions,"
other than those offered by a concurring member of the
court. App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a. The concurrence had believed it sufficient that Congress could have reasoned that
SMATV systems serving separately owned buildings are
more similar to traditional cable systems than are facilities
serving commonly owned buildings, in terms of the problems
presented for consumers and the potential for regulatory
benefits. See 294 U. S. App. D. C., at 392, 959 F. 2d, at 990
(Mikva, C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
In a second opinion, the majority found this rationale to be

violates the First Amendment and that the $ 602(7)(B) classification should

F. 2d, at 984-985, and refused to address the heightened scrutiny argument without first applying "rational basis" analysis, id., at 388, 959 F. 2d,

Whether embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment or inferred from the Fifth, equal protection is not a license for
courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative
choices. In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory
classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor
infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld
against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably
conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis
for the classification. See Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478,
485 (1990); Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U. S. 587, 600-603 (1987);
United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S.

5 The Court of Appeals had also questioned whether there existed a

rational basis for distinguishing facilities connecting separately owned
buildings by wire from those that do not connect separate buildings or
that do so only by wireless media, such as radio or microwave transmission. See 294 U. S. App. D. C., at 382, 389, 959 F. 2d, at 980, 987. In its
second opinion, however, the court found it unnecessary to consider that
question, see 296 U. S. App. D. C., at 143, 965 F. 2d, at 1105, and it is not
presented here.

Congress' action, "our inquiry is at an end." United States
Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, supra, at 179. This
standard of review is a paradigm of judicial restraint. "The
Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention
is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may
think a political branch has acted." Vance v. Bradley, 440
U. S. 93, 97 (1979) (footnote omitted).6

On rational-basis review, a classification in a statute such
as the Cable Act comes to us bearing a strong presumption
of validity, see Lyng v. Automobile Workers, 485 U. S. 360,

6 As they did in the Court of Appeals, respondents seek heightened scrutiny, claiming that the statute discriminates on the basis of First Amendment activities. Brief for Respondents Beach Communications, Inc., et
al. 12-17 (hereinafter Brief for Respondents). We will confine ourselves,
however, to the question presented, which is limited to whether the distinction in $ 602(7)(B) is "rationally related to a legitimate government
purpose under the Due Process Clause." Pet. for Cert. I. The Court of
Appeals did not reach respondents' heightened-scrutiny challenge because
it found merit in their rational-basis contentions. 294 U. S. App. D. C., at
388, 959 F. 2d, at 986. In renewing their arguments for heightened scrutiny here, see Brief for Respondents 14-15, respondents point to the burdens imposed on franchised cable systems under the newly enacted Cable
Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, an Act the
Court of Appeals had no opportunity to consider. In these circumstances,
respondents' arguments for heightened scrutiny are best left open for consideration by the Court of Appeals on remand.

Respondents also raise a threshold issue. They argue that no case or
controversy exists, or that the issue is "moot," on the theory that Congress
"adopted" the Court of Appeals' "construction" of $ 602(7) (presumably
thereby acquiescing in the judgment that local franchising must depend
on use of public rights-of-way) when it took no action to amend or defend
the provision in later passing the 1992 Act. Brief for Respondents 8-12.
Cf. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). This notion of congressional adoption of statutory interpretations, however, has no place in
constitutional review, and the controversy presented in this case is obviously a live one, since petitioners stand ready to defend the statute as
drafted.

370 (1988), and those attacking the rationality of the legisla-tive classification have the burden "to negative every conceivable basis which might support it," Lehnhausen v. Lake
Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 364 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S.
314, 331-332 (1981). Moreover, because we never require alegislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, it

is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether theconceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. United States Railroad Retirement
Bd. v. Fritz, supra, at 179. See Flemming v. Nestor, 363
U. S. 603, 612 (1960). Thus, the absence of " `legislative
facts' " explaining the distinction "[o]n the record," 294 U. S.
App. D. C., at 389, 959 F. 2d, at 987, has no significance in
rational-basis analysis. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S.
1, 15 (1992) (equal protection "does not demand for purposes
of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification"). In other words, a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and
may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data. See Vance v. Bradley, supra, at
111. See also Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449
U. S. 456, 464 (1981). " `Only by faithful adherence to this
guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible
to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.' " Lehnhausen, supra, at
365 (quoting Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301
U. S. 495, 510 (1937)).

These restraints on judicial review have added force
"where the legislature must necessarily engage in a process
of line-drawing." United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.

ment be placed on different sides of the line, and the fact[that] the line might have been drawn differently at some

points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consid-eration." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The distinction at issue here represents such a line:By excluding from the definition of "cable system" those
facilities that serve commonly owned or managed buildingswithout using public rights-of-way, $ 602(7)(B) delineates the
bounds of the regulatory field. Such scope-of-coverage pro-visions are unavoidable components of most economic or social legislation. In establishing the franchise requirement,Congress had to draw the line somewhere; it had to choose
which facilities to franchise. This necessity renders the pre-cise coordinates of the resulting legislative judgment virtually unreviewable, since the legislature must be allowed lee-way to approach a perceived problem incrementally. See,
e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483(1955):

"The problem of legislative classification is a perennialone, admitting of no doctrinaire definition. Evils in the
same field may be of different dimensions and propor-tions, requiring different remedies. Or so the legislature may think. Or the reform may take one step at atime, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which
seems most acute to the legislative mind. The legisla-ture may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. The prohibition of theEqual Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination." Id., at 489 (citations omitted).7

Opinion of the Court
Applying these principles, we conclude that the commonownership distinction is constitutional. There are at least
two possible bases for the distinction; either one suffices.
First, Congress borrowed $ 602(7)(B) from pre-Cable Act
regulations, and although the existence of a prior administrative scheme is certainly not necessary to the rationality of
the statute, it is plausible that Congress also adopted the
FCC's earlier rationale. Under that rationale, common
ownership was thought to be indicative of those systems for
which the costs of regulation would outweigh the benefits to
consumers. Because the number of subscribers was a similar indicator, the Commission also exempted cable facilities
that served fewer than 50 subscribers. See 47 CFR $ 76.5(a)
(1984). In explaining both exemptions, the Commission
stated:

"[N]ot all [systems] can be subject to effective regulation with the resources available nor is regulation necessarily needed in every instance. A sensible regulatory
program requires that a division between the regulated
and unregulated be made in a manner which best conserves regulatory energies and allows the most cost effective use of available resources. In attempting to
make this division, we have focused on subscriber numbers as well as the multiple unit dwelling indicia on the
theory that the very small are inefficient to regulate and
can safely be ignored in terms of their potential for impact on broadcast service to the public and on multiple
unit dwelling facilities on the theory that this effectively
establishes certain maximum size limitations." In re

318 FCC v. BEACH COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
This regulatory-efficiency model, originally suggested byChief Judge Mikva in his concurring opinion, provides a conceivable basis for the common-ownership exemption. A leg-islator might rationally assume that systems serving only
commonly owned or managed buildings without crossing
public rights-of-way would typically be limited in size orwould share some other attribute affecting their impact on

the welfare of cable viewers such that regulators could"safely ignor[e]" these systems.

Respondents argue that Congress did not intend commonownership to be a surrogate for small size, since Congress
simultaneously rejected the FCC's 50-subscriber exemption
by omitting it from the Cable Act. Brief for Respondents
22. Whether the posited reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated Congress is "constitutionally irrelevant," United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz,
supra, at 179 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, in any
event, the FCC's explanation indicates that both common
ownership and number of subscribers were considered indicia of "very small" cable systems. Respondents also contend that an SMATV operator could increase his subscription
base and still qualify for the exemption simply by installing
a separate satellite dish on each building served. Brief for
Respondents 42. The additional cost of multiple dishes and
associated transmission equipment, however, would impose
an independent constraint on system size.

Furthermore, small size is only one plausible ownershiprelated factor contributing to consumer welfare. Subscriber
influence is another. Where an SMATV system serves a
complex of buildings under common ownership or management, individual subscribers could conceivably have greater
bargaining power vis-a` -vis the cable operator (even if the
number of dwelling units were large), since all the subscribers could negotiate with one voice through the common
owner or manager. Such an owner might have substantial
leverage, because he could withhold permission to operate

the SMATV system on his property. He would also have anincentive to guard the interests of his tenants. Thus, there

could be less need to establish regulatory safeguards for sub-scribers in commonly owned complexes. Respondents acknowledge such possibilities, see id., at 44, and we certainly
cannot say that these assumptions would be irrational.8There is a second conceivable basis for the statutory distinction. Suppose competing SMATV operators wish to sellvideo programming to subscribers in a group of contiguous
buildings, such as a single city block, which can be intercon-nected by wire without crossing a public right-of-way. If all
the buildings belong to one owner or are commonly managed,that owner or manager could freely negotiate a deal for all
subscribers on a competitive basis. But if the buildings areseparately owned and managed, the first SMATV operator
who gains a foothold by signing a contract and installing a
satellite dish and associated transmission equipment on one
of the buildings would enjoy a powerful cost advantage in
competing for the remaining subscribers: He could connect

8 According to respondents, the FCC's pre-Cable Act common-ownership
exemption provides no support for the rationality of $ 602(7)(B) for another
reason. They assert that the regulatory exemption's sole purpose was
to exempt master antenna television (MATV) facilities--ordinary rooftop
antenna facilities that receive conventional broadcast signals for transmission by wire to units within a single multiunit building or complex, see
294 U. S. App. D. C., at 379-380, 959 F. 2d, at 977-978. Respondents argue
that this prior exemption merely reflected the FCC's judgment that common antennas, unlike SMATV systems, were nothing more than residential amenities posing no threat to broadcast services. See Brief for Respondents 23-25. This argument is unavailing, because Congress is not
bound by the administrative derivation of the "private cable" exemption.
Moreover, regardless of the origin of the exemption, the Commission had
already applied it to SMATV facilities before passage of the Cable Act.
See In re Earth Satellite Communications, Inc., 95 F. C. C. 2d 1223, 1224,
n. 3 (1983), aff'd sub nom. New York State Comm'n on Cable Television v.
FCC, 242 U. S. App. D. C. 126, 749 F. 2d 804 (1984). Indeed, in these
proceedings, the Commission construed $ 602(7) to apply equally to
SMATV and MATV facilities. See 5 F. C. C. Rcd., at 7639-7641.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
additional buildings for the cost of a few feet of cable,whereas any competitor would have to recover the cost of

his own satellite headend facility. Thus, the first operatorcould charge rates well above his cost and still undercut the
competition. This potential for effective monopoly powermight theoretically justify regulating the latter class of
SMATV systems and not the former.

III
The Court of Appeals quite evidently believed that thecrossing or use of a public right-of-way is the only conceivable basis upon which Congress could rationally require localfranchising of SMATV systems. See 296 U. S. App. D. C., at
143, 965 F. 2d, at 1105; 294 U. S. App. D. C., at 389, 959 F. 2d,at 987. As we have indicated, however, there are plausible
rationales unrelated to the use of public rights-of-way forregulating cable facilities serving separately owned and managed buildings. The assumptions underlying these ration-ales may be erroneous, but the very fact that they are "arguable" is sufficient, on rational-basis review, to "immuniz[e]"the congressional choice from constitutional challenge.
Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S., at 112.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

So ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Freedom is a blessing. Regulation is sometimes neces-sary, but it is always burdensome. A decision

not to regulate the way in which an owner chooses to enjoy the benefitsof an improvement to his own property is adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.If the owner of a large building decides to improve it by
installing his own electric generator, or by placing a windmillon the roof, government might well decide to regulate his

321Cite as: 508 U. S. 307 (1993)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
use of that improvement. But if government permits theinstallation, it can surely allow the owner to use the electricity that it generates for whichever appliances on the prop-erty that he selects. However, if the owner elects to sell
electricity to his neighbors, a justification for regulation that
did not previously exist might arise. For he would be seek-ing access to an already regulated market.

A television antenna, like a windmill, is a somewhat un-sightly species of improvement. Nonetheless, the same
analysis applies. Government may reasonably decide toregulate the distribution of electricity or television programs
to paying customers in the open market without also regulating the way in which the owner of the antenna, or the windmill, distributes its benefits within the confines of his own
property. In my opinion the interest in the free use of one's
own property provides adequate support for an exception
from burdensome regulation and franchising requirements
even when the property is occupied not only by family
members and guests, but by lessees and co-owners as well,
and even when the property complex encompasses multiple
buildings.

The master antenna serving multiple units in an apartment building is less unsightly than a forest of individual
antennas, each serving a separate apartment. It was surely
sensible to allow owners to make use of such an improvement
without incurring the costs of franchising and economic regulation. Even though regulation might have been justified--
indeed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at
one time considered imposing such regulation, see Cable
Television Systems, 63 F. C. C. 2d 956, 996-998 (1977)--a
justification for nonregulation would nevertheless remain:
Whenever possible, property owners should be free to use
improvements to their property as they see fit.

That brings us to the "private cable" exemption as applied
to satellite master antenna television (SMATV) systems. A
justification for the "private cable" exemption that rests on

508us1$82N 02-21-97 22:42:28 PAGES OPINPGT
322 FCC v. BEACH COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
the presumption that an owner of property should be allowed
to use an improvement on his own property as he sees fit
unless there is a sufficient public interest in denying him that
right simply does not apply to the situation in which the
improvement--here, the satellite antenna--is being used to
distribute signals to subscribers on other people's property.
In that situation, the property owner, or the SMATV operator, has reached out beyond the property line and is seeking
to employ the satellite antenna in the broader market for
television programming. While the crossing of that line
need not trigger regulatory intervention, and the absence of
such a crossing may not prevent such intervention, it certainly cannot be said that government is disabled, by the
Constitution, from regulating in the case of the former and
abstaining in the case of the latter. Such a policy is adequately justified by the presumption in favor of freedom.

Thus, while I am not fully persuaded that the "private
cable" exemption is justified by the size of the market which
it encompasses, see ante, at 317-318,1 or by the Court's
"monopoly" rationale, see ante, at 319-320,2 I agree with its

1 Approximately 25% of all multiple dwellings units are in complexes
large enough to support an SMATV system. See C. Ferris, Cable Television Law: A Video Communications Practice Guide || 21.02, p. 21-3, n. 2
(1983). Furthermore, whereas the FCC had, prior to enactment to the
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Cable Act), 98 Stat. 2779, exempted from regulation cable systems of less than 50 subscribers as well
as those serving commonly owned multiple unit dwellings, Congress exempted only the latter when it passed the Cable Act, leaving out the exemption based on system size. Respondents thus make a strong argument that Congress may have rejected the very rationale upon which the
FCC, and the Court, rely.

2 The Court's theory assumes a great deal about the nature of what is

essentially a hypothetical market. Moreover, the Court's analysis overlooks the competitive presence of traditional cable as a potential constraint
on an SMATV operator's capacity to extract monopoly rents from
landlords.

ultimate conclusion. In my judgment, it is reasonable topresume

3 that Congress was motivated by an interest in

allowing property owners to exercise freedom in the use oftheir own property. Legislation so motivated surely does

not violate the sovereign's duty to govern impartially. See
Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976). Accord-ingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

3 The Court states that a legislative classification must be upheld "if
there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a
rational basis for the classification," and that "[w]here there are `plausible
reasons' for Congress' action, `our inquiry is at an end,' " ante, at 313-314.
In my view, this formulation sweeps too broadly, for it is difficult to imagine a legislative classification that could not be supported by a "reasonably
conceivable state of facts." Judicial review under the "conceivable set of
facts" test is tantamount to no review at all.

I continue to believe that when Congress imposes a burden on one
group, but leaves unaffected another that is similarly, though not identically, situated, "the Constitution requires something more than merely a
`conceivable' or `plausible' explanation for the unequal treatment."
United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 180 (1980)
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). In my view, when the actual rationale for the legislative classification is unclear, we should inquire
whether the classification is rationally related to "a legitimate purpose
that we may reasonably presume to have motivated an impartial legislature." Id., at 181 (emphasis added).

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 92-641. Argued April 19, 1993--Decided June 1, 1993
In their debt repayment plan under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code,

petitioners relied on 11 U. S. C. $ 506(a)--which provides, inter alia, that
an allowed claim secured by a lien on the debtor's property "is a secured
claim to the extent of the value of [the] property," and "is an unsecured
claim" to the extent it exceeds that value--to propose that the mortgage
on their principal residence in Texas be reduced from $71,335 to the
residence's $23,500 fair market value. Respondents, the mortgage
lender and the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to the plan, arguing that
the proposed bifurcation of the lender's claim into a secured claim for
$23,500 and an effectively worthless unsecured claim modified its rights
as a homestead mortgagee in violation of $ 1322(b)(2), which, among
other things, allows a plan to "modify the rights of holders of secured
claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real
property that is the debtor's principal residence." The Bankruptcy
Court agreed with respondents and denied confirmation of the plan.
The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Section 1322(b)(2) prohibits a Chapter 13 debtor from relying on

$ 506(a) to reduce an undersecured homestead mortgage to the fair market value of the mortgaged residence. Although petitioners were correct in looking to $ 506(a) for a judicial valuation of their residence to
determine the status of the lender's secured claim, that valuation does
not necessarily limit the lender's "rights [as a claim] holde[r]," which are
the focus of $ 1322(b)(2)'s protection. In the absence of a controlling
Bankruptcy Code definition, it must be presumed that Congress left the
determination of property "rights" in estate assets to state law.
Butner v. United States, 440 U. S. 48, 54-55. The mortgagee's "rights,"
therefore, are reflected in the relevant mortgage instruments, which are
enforceable under Texas law. Those rights include, among others, the
right to repayment of the principal in monthly installments over a fixed
term at specified adjustable interest rates, and they are protected from
modification by $ 1322(b)(2). That section's "other than" exception cannot be read to protect only that subset of allowed "secured claims,"
determined by application of $ 506(a), that are secured by a lien on the
debtor's home. Rather, the more reasonable interpretation is to read

"a claim secured only by a [homestead lien]" as referring to the lienholder's entire claim, including both its secured and unsecured components,

the fair market value of the mortgaged residence. We con-clude that it does and therefore affirm the judgment of the

Court of Appeals. I

In 1984, respondent American Savings Bank loaned peti-tioners Leonard and Harriet Nobelman $68,250 for the purchase of their principal residence, a condominium in Dallas,Texas. In exchange, petitioners executed an adjustable rate
note payable to the bank and secured by a deed of trust onthe residence. In 1990, after falling behind in their mortgage payments, petitioners sought relief under Chapter 13
of the Bankruptcy Code. The bank filed a proof of claim
with the Bankruptcy Court for $71,335 in principal, interest,
and fees owed on the note. Petitioners' modified Chapter 13
plan valued the residence at a mere $23,500--an uncontroverted valuation--and proposed to make payments pursuant
to the mortgage contract only up to that amount (plus prepetition arrearages). Relying on $ 506(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code,1 petitioners proposed to treat the remainder of the
bank's claim as unsecured. Under the plan, unsecured creditors would receive nothing.

The bank and the Chapter 13 trustee, also a respondent
here, objected to petitioners' plan. They argued that the
proposed bifurcation of the bank's claim into a secured claim
for $23,500 and an effectively worthless unsecured claim
modified the bank's rights as a homestead mortgagee, in vio1 Section 506(a) provides, in part, as follows:
"An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which
the estate has an interest . . . is a secured claim to the extent of the value
of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property, . . . and
is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest . . . is less than the amount of such allowed claim. Such value shall
be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed
disposition or use of such property, and in conjunction with any hearing
on such disposition or use or on a plan affecting such creditor's interest."

II
Under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, individualdebtors may obtain adjustment of their indebtedness

through a flexible repayment plan approved by a bankruptcycourt. Section 1322 sets forth the elements of a confirmable
Chapter 13 plan. The plan must provide, inter alia, for thesubmission of a portion of the debtor's future earnings and
income to the control of a trustee and for supervised pay-ments to creditors over a period not exceeding five years.
See 11 U. S. C. $$ 1322(a)(1) and 1322(c). Section 1322(b)(2),the provision at issue here, allows modification of the rights
of both secured and unsecured creditors, subject to specialprotection for creditors whose claims are secured only by a
lien on the debtor's home. It provides that the plan may

"modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other
than a claim secured only by a security interest in realproperty that is the debtor's principal residence, or of

holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected therights of holders of any class of claims." 11 U. S. C.

328 NOBELMAN v. AMERICAN SAVINGS BANK

Opinion of the Court
Chapter 13 plan proposes no such modification. They arguethat the protection of $ 1322(b)(2) applies only to the extent

the mortgagee holds a "secured claim" in the debtor's resi-dence and that we must look first to $ 506(a) to determine
the value of the mortgagee's "secured claim." Section506(a) provides that an allowed claim secured by a lien on
the debtor's property "is a secured claim to the extent of thevalue of [the] property"; to the extent the claim exceeds the
value of the property, it "is an unsecured claim." 3 Petition-ers contend that the valuation provided for in $ 506(a) operates automatically to adjust downward the amount of a lend-er's undersecured home mortgage before any disposition
proposed in the debtor's Chapter 13 plan. Under this view,the bank is the holder of a "secured claim" only in the amount
of $23,500--the value of the collateral property. Becausethe plan proposes to make $23,500 worth of payments pursuant to the monthly payment terms of the mortgage contract,petitioners argue, the plan effects no alteration of the bank's
rights as the holder of that claim. Section 1322(b)(2), theyassert, allows unconditional modification of the bank's leftover "unsecured claim."This interpretation fails to take adequate account of

$ 1322(b)(2)'s focus on "rights." That provision does notstate that a plan may modify "claims" or that the plan may
not modify "a claim secured only by" a home mortgage.Rather, it focuses on the modification of the "

rights of hold-ers" of such claims. By virtue of its mortgage contract with

petitioners, the bank is indisputably the holder of a claimsecured by a lien on petitioners' home. Petitioners were
correct in looking to $ 506(a) for a judicial valuation of thecollateral to determine the status of the bank's secured claim.
It was permissible for petitioners to seek a valuation in pro-posing their Chapter 13 plan, since $ 506(a) states that "[s]uch

3 As a general provision under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code,

$ 506(a) applies in an individual bankruptcy case under Chapter 13. See

Opinion of the Court
value shall be determined . . . in conjunction with any hear-ing . . . on a plan affecting such creditor's interest." But

even if we accept petitioners' valuation, the bank is still the"holder" of a "secured claim," because petitioners' home retains $23,500 of value as collateral. The portion of the
bank's claim that exceeds $23,500 is an "unsecured claimcomponen[t]" under $ 506(a),

United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 239, n. 3 (1989) (internal quota-tion marks omitted); however, that determination does not

necessarily mean that the "rights" the bank enjoys as amortgagee, which are protected by $ 1322(b)(2), are limited
by the valuation of its secured claim.

The term "rights" is nowhere defined in the Bankruptcy
Code. In the absence of a controlling federal rule, we generally assume that Congress has "left the determination of
property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to state
law," since such "[p]roperty interests are created and defined
by state law." Butner v. United States, 440 U. S. 48, 54-55
(1979). See also Barnhill v. Johnson, 503 U. S. 393, 398
(1992). Moreover, we have specifically recognized that
"[t]he justifications for application of state law are not limited to ownership interests," but "apply with equal force to
security interests, including the interest of a mortgagee."
Butner, supra, at 55. The bank's "rights," therefore, are reflected in the relevant mortgage instruments, which are enforceable under Texas law. They include the right to repayment of the principal in monthly installments over a fixed
term at specified adjustable rates of interest, the right to
retain the lien until the debt is paid off, the right to accelerate the loan upon default and to proceed against petitioners'
residence by foreclosure and public sale, and the right to
bring an action to recover any deficiency remaining after
foreclosure. See Record 135-140 (deed of trust); id., at 147-
151 (promissory note); Tex. Prop. Code Ann. $$ 51.002-51.005
(Supp. 1993). These are the rights that were "bargained for
by the mortgagor and the mortgagee," Dewsnup v. Timm,

Opinion of the Court
502 U. S. 410, 417 (1992), and are rights protected from modi-fication by $ 1322(b)(2).

This is not to say, of course, that the contractual rights ofa home mortgage lender are unaffected by the mortgagor's
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The lender's power to enforce itsrights--and, in particular, its right to foreclose on the property in the event of default--is checked by the BankruptcyCode's automatic stay provision. 11 U. S. C. $ 362. See
United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest
Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 369-370 (1988). In addition,$ 1322(b)(5) permits the debtor to cure prepetition defaults

on a home mortgage by paying off arrearages over the lifeof the plan "notwithstanding" the exception in $ 1322(b)(2).

4

These statutory limitations on the lender's rights, however,are independent of the debtor's plan or otherwise outside

$ 1322(b)(2)'s prohibition.Petitioners urge us to apply the so-called "rule of the last
antecedent," which has been relied upon by some Courts ofAppeals to interpret $ 1322(b)(2) the way petitioners favor.
E. g., In re Bellamy, 962 F. 2d 176, 180 (CA2 1992); In re
Hougland, 886 F. 2d 1182, 1184 (CA9 1989). According tothis argument, the operative clause "other than a claim secured only by a security interest in . . . the debtor's principalresidence" must be read to refer to and modify its immediate
antecedent, "secured claims." Thus, $ 1322(b)(2)'s protec-tion would then apply only to that subset of allowed "secured
claims," determined by application of $ 506(a), that are se-cured by a lien on the debtor's home--including, with respect
to the mortgage involved here, the bank's secured claim for$23,500. We acknowledge that this reading of the clause is
quite sensible as a matter of grammar. But it is not com4 Under $ 1322(b)(5), the plan may, "notwithstanding paragraph (2) of
this subsection, provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable
time and maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any . . .
secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which
the final payment under the plan is due."

Opinion of the Court
pelled. Congress chose to use the phrase "claim secured . . .by" in $ 1322(b)(2)'s exception, rather than repeating the

term of art "secured claim." The unqualified word "claim"is broadly defined under the Code to encompass any "right
to payment, whether . . . secure[d] or unsecured" or any
"right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance ifsuch breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether . . .

secure[d] or unsecured." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(5) (1988 ed., Supp.III). It is also plausible, therefore, to read "a claim secured
only by a [homestead lien]" as referring to the lienholder'sentire claim, including both the secured and the unsecured
components of the claim. Indeed, $ 506(a) itself uses the
phrase "claim . . . secured by a lien" to encompass both portions of an undersecured claim.

This latter interpretation is the more reasonable one, since
we cannot discern how $ 1322(b)(2) could be administered
under petitioners' interpretation. Petitioners propose to reduce the outstanding mortgage principal to the fair market
value of the collateral, and, at the same time, they insist that
they can do so without modifying the bank's rights "as to
interest rates, payment amounts, and [other] contract
terms." Brief for Petitioners 7. That appears to be impossible. The bank's contractual rights are contained in a unitary note that applies at once to the bank's overall claim,
including both the secured and unsecured components. Petitioners cannot modify the payment and interest terms for
the unsecured component, as they propose to do, without also
modifying the terms of the secured component. Thus, to
preserve the interest rate and the amount of each monthly
payment specified in the note after having reduced the principal to $23,500, the plan would also have to reduce the term
of the note dramatically. That would be a significant modification of a contractual right. Furthermore, the bank holds
an adjustable rate mortgage, and the principal and interest
payments on the loan must be recalculated with each adjustment in the interest rate. There is nothing in the mortgage

contract or the Code that suggests any basis for recalculatingthe amortization schedule--whether by reference to the face

value of the remaining principal or by reference to the unam-ortized value of the collateral. This conundrum alone indicates that $ 1322(b)(2) cannot operate in combination with$ 506(a) in the manner theorized by petitioners.

In other words, to give effect to $ 506(a)'s valuation andbifurcation of secured claims through a Chapter 13 plan in
the manner petitioners propose would require a modificationof the rights of the holder of the security interest. Section

Affirmed.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
At first blush it seems somewhat strange that the Bank-ruptcy Code should provide less protection to an individual's

interest in retaining possession of his or her home than ofother assets. The anomaly is, however, explained by the
legislative history indicating that favorable treatment of res-idential mortgagees was intended to encourage the flow of
capital into the home lending market. See Grubbs v. Hous-ton First American Savings Assn., 730 F. 2d 236, 245-246
(CA5 1984) (canvassing legislative history of Chapter 13home mortgage provisions). It therefore seems quite clear
that the Court's literal reading of the text of the statute isfaithful to the intent of Congress. Accordingly, I join its
opinion and judgment.

GILMORE v. TAYLOR
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 91-1738. Argued March 2, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
At his trial in Illinois state court, respondent Taylor admitted the killing

with which he was charged, but presented evidence to support his claim
that he was only guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The jury received
instructions modeled after the state pattern instructions on murder and
voluntary manslaughter and convicted Taylor of murder. After the
conviction and sentence became final, he sought federal habeas relief on
the ground that the jury instructions violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. While his case was pending, the Court of
Appeals, relying on Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, held as much,
finding that because the pattern murder instructions preceded the
voluntary-manslaughter instructions, but did not expressly direct a jury
that it could not return a murder conviction if it found that a defendant
possessed a mitigating mental state, it was possible for a jury to find
that a defendant was guilty of murder without even considering whether
he was entitled to a voluntary-manslaughter conviction. Falconer v.
Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129. The State conceded that Taylor's jury instructions were unconstitutional, but argued that the Falconer rule was
"new" within the meaning of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and could
not form the basis for federal habeas relief. The District Court agreed,
but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Boyde v. California,
494 U. S. 370, and Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (plurality opinion), rather than Cupp, were specific enough to have compelled the result in Falconer.

Held: The Falconer rule is "new" within the meaning of Teague and may

not provide the basis for federal habeas relief. Pp. 339-346.

(a) Subject to two narrow exceptions, a case that is decided after a
defendant's conviction and sentence become final may not provide the
basis for federal habeas relief if it announces a new rule, i. e., a result
that was not dictated by precedent at the time the defendant's conviction became final. This principle validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts and therefore
effectuates the States' interest in the finality of criminal convictions and
fosters comity between federal and state courts. Pp. 339-340.

(b) The flaw found in Falconer was not that the instructions somehow
lessened the State's burden of proof below that constitutionally required

Syllabus
by cases such as In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, but rather that the instructions prevented the jury from considering evidence of an affirmative defense. Cases following Cupp in the Winship line establish that
States must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to
every element of the offense charged, but may place on defendants the
burden of proving affirmative defenses, see Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S.
228; Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, and, thus, make clear that
Cupp is an unlikely progenitor of the Falconer rule. Nor do the other
cases cited by the Court of Appeals dictate the Falconer result. Boyde,
supra--in which the Court clarified the standard for reviewing on habeas a claim that ambiguous instructions impermissibly restricted a
jury's consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence--was a capital
case, with respect to which the Eighth Amendment requires a greater
degree of accuracy and factfinding than in noncapital cases. In contrast, in noncapital cases, instructions containing state-law errors may
not form the basis for federal habeas relief, Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.
62, and there is no counterpart to the Eighth Amendment's doctrine
of constitutionally relevant evidence in capital cases. Connecticut v.
Johnson, supra, and Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, which it
discusses, flow from Winship's due process guarantee, which does not
apply to affirmative defenses. The jury's failure to consider Taylor's
affirmative defense is not a violation of his due process right to present
a complete defense, since the cases involving that right have dealt only
with the exclusion of evidence and the testimony of defense witnesses,
and since Taylor's expansive reading of these cases would nullify the
rule reaffirmed in Estelle v. McGuire, supra. Pp. 340-344.

(c) The Falconer rule does not fall into either of Teague's exceptions.
The rule does not "decriminalize" any class of conduct or fall into that
small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Pp. 344-346.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.#

Respondent Kevin Taylor was convicted of murder byan Illinois jury and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.
After his conviction and sentence became final, he soughtfederal habeas relief on the ground that the jury instructions
given at his trial violated the Fourteenth Amendment's DueProcess Clause. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted relief on the basis of its recent decision in Falconer v. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129 (1990), which held that theIllinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntary

manslaughter were unconstitutional because they allowed ajury to return a murder verdict without considering whether
the defendant possessed a mental state that would support
a voluntary-manslaughter verdict instead. We conclude
that the rule announced in Falconer was not dictated by
prior precedent and is therefore "new" within the meaning
of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Accordingly, the
Falconer rule may not provide the basis for federal habeas
relief in respondent's case.

boyfriend, Scott Siniscalchi, over custodial arrangements for
his daughter. A fracas ensued between the three adults,
during which respondent stabbed Siniscalchi seven times
with a hunting knife. Siniscalchi died from these wounds,
and respondent was arrested at his home later that morning.

Respondent was charged with murder. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch.
38, || 9-1 (1985). At trial, he took the stand and admitted
killing Siniscalchi, but claimed he was acting under a sudden
and intense passion provoked by Siniscalchi, and was therefore only guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary
manslaughter. || 9-2. At the close of all the evidence, the
trial judge found that there was sufficient evidence supporting respondent's "heat of passion" defense to require an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and instructed the jury
as follows:

"To sustain the charge of murder, the State must prove
the following propositions:

"First: That the Defendant performed the acts which
caused the death of Scott Siniscalchi; and

"Second: That when the Defendant did so he intended
to kill or do great bodily harm to Scott Siniscalchi; or he
knew that his act would cause death or great bodily
harm to Scott Siniscalchi; or he knew that his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm
to Scott Siniscalchi; or he was committing the offense of
home invasion.

"If you find from your consideration of all the evidence
that each one of these propositions has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the Defendant
guilty.

"If you find from your consideration of all the evidence
that any one of these propositions has not been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the Defendant not guilty.. . . . .

slaughter Cases: An Affirmative Defense Approach, 59 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 23 (1982).

1 Respondent did not object to the

instructions. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the mur-der charge, and respondent was sentenced to 35 years'

imprisonment.Respondent unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on
appeal, then filed a petition for state postconviction relief.The Circuit Court dismissed the petition. But while respondent's appeal was pending, the Illinois Supreme Courtinvalidated the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murder
and voluntary manslaughter. People v. Reddick, 123 Ill. 2d
184, 526 N. E. 2d 141 (1988). According to the Supreme
Court, under Illinois law, the instructions should have placedon the prosecution the burden of

disproving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed a mitigatingmental state.

Id., at 197, 526 N. E. 2d, at 146. Respondent
sought to take advantage of Reddick on appeal, but theCourt of Appeals affirmed the denial of postconviction relief

on the ground that Reddick did not involve constitutionalerror, the only type of error that would support the grant of
relief. People v. Taylor, 181 Ill. App. 3d 538, 536 N. E. 2d
1312 (1989). The Illinois Supreme Court denied respond-ent's request for leave to appeal.

Having exhausted his state remedies, respondent soughtfederal habeas relief, attacking his conviction on the ground
that the jury instructions given at his trial violated due proc-ess. Eleven days later, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held as much in Falconer v. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129(1990). The defect identified by the

Falconer court was
quite different from that identified in Reddick: Because the

Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-2 (1987). The Illinois pattern jury instructions
were rewritten accordingly. 1 Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions--Criminal $ 7.02B (3d ed. 1992, Supp. 1993).

Opinion of the Court
murder instructions preceded the voluntary-manslaughter
instructions, but did not expressly direct the jury that it
could not return a murder conviction if it found that the defendant possessed a mitigating mental state, it was possible
for a jury to find that a defendant was guilty of murder without even considering whether he was entitled to a voluntarymanslaughter conviction instead. 905 F. 2d, at 1136. "Explicit misdirection on this scale," the Seventh Circuit held,
"violates the constitutional guarantee of due process." Id.,
at 1137. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals
placed principal reliance on Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S.
141 (1973).

At respondent's federal habeas proceeding, the State conceded that the jury instructions given at respondent's trial
were unconstitutional under Falconer, but argued that the
rule announced in Falconer was "new" within the meaning
of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and therefore could
not form the basis for federal habeas relief. The District
Court agreed, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 954 F. 2d
441 (1992). Although the Seventh Circuit now thought
Cupp was "too general to have compelled Falconer within
the meaning of Teague," 954 F. 2d, at 452, it concluded that
Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), and Connecticut v.
Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983) (plurality opinion), were "specific enough to have compelled" the result reached in Falconer, 954 F. 2d, at 453. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals
held that the rule announced in Falconer was not "new"
within the meaning of Teague, and that Teague therefore did
not bar the retroactive application of Falconer in respondent's case. Id., at 453. We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 814
(1992), and now reverse.

The retroactivity of Falconer under Teague and its progeny is the only question before us in this case. Subject to
two narrow exceptions, a case that is decided after a defendant's conviction and sentence become final may not provide

the basis for federal habeas relief if it announces a "newrule."

Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 227 (1992); Teague, supra, at305-311 (plurality opinion). Though we have offered various formulations of what constitutes a new rule, put "meaningfully for the majority of cases, a decision announces a newrule ` "if the result was not

dictated by precedent existing at
the time the defendant's conviction became final." ' " Butlerv.

McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 412 (1990) (quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 314 (1989), in turn quoting Teague,
supra, at 301 (emphasis in original)); see also Graham,
supra, at 467; Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990);
Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990); Penry v. Lynaugh,
492 U. S. 302, 329 (1989). "The `new rule' principle . . . validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts," 494 U. S., at 414, and thus
effectuates the States' interest in the finality of criminal convictions and fosters comity between federal and state courts.

We begin our analysis with the actual flaw found by the
Falconer court in the challenged jury instructions. It was
not that they somehow lessened the State's burden of proof
below that constitutionally required by cases such as In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970); nor was it that the instructions
affirmatively misstated applicable state law. (The Court of
Appeals in no way relied upon People v. Reddick, supra,
which the Illinois Supreme Court had subsequently held was
subject to prospective application only. People v. Flowers,
138 Ill. 2d 218, 561 N. E. 2d 674 (1990).) Rather, the flaw
identified by the Falconer court was that when the jury
instructions were read consecutively, with the elements of
murder set forth before the elements of voluntary manslaughter, a juror could conclude that the defendant was
guilty of murder after applying the elements of that offense
without continuing on to decide whether the elements of voluntary manslaughter were also made out, so as to justify
returning a verdict on that lesser offense instead.

341Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
In concluding that this defect violated due process, the
Falconer court relied on Cupp v. Naughten, supra. That
case involved a due process challenge to a jury instructionthat witnesses are presumed to tell the truth, which the

defendant claimed had the effect of shifting the burden of
proof on his innocence. Because the jury had been explicitlyinstructed on the defendant's presumption of innocence as

well as the State's burden of proving guilt beyond a reason-able doubt, we held that the instruction did not amount to a
constitutional violation. See 414 U. S., at 149.We think

Cupp is an unlikely progenitor of the rule announced in Falconer, a view now shared by the Seventh Circuit. The cases following Cupp in the Winship line establish that States must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
with respect to every element of the offense charged, but
that they may place on defendants the burden of proving
affirmative defenses. See Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228
(1987); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977). The
State argues that these later cases support the proposition
that any error committed in instructing a jury with respect
to an affirmative defense, which does not lessen the State's
Winship burden in proving every element of the offense
charged beyond a reasonable doubt, is one wholly of state
law. Cf. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 119-121, and n. 21
(1982) (challenge to correctness of self-defense instructions
under state law provides no basis for federal habeas relief).
We need not address this contention other than to say that
cases like Patterson and Martin make it crystal clear that
Cupp does not compel the result reached in Falconer.

In its decision in the present case, the Court of Appeals
offered two additional cases which it believed did dictate the
result in Falconer. The first is Boyde v. California, supra.
There, we clarified the standard for reviewing on federal habeas a claim that ambiguous jury instructions impermissibly
restricted the jury's consideration of "constitutionally relevant evidence." 494 U. S., at 380. Although Boyde was de508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT
342 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
cided after respondent's conviction and sentence becamefinal, it did not work a change in the law favoring criminal

defendants, and therefore may be considered in our Teagueanalysis. See

Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 373 (1993).
Nevertheless, Boyde was a capital case, with respect to
which we have held that the Eighth Amendment requires agreater degree of accuracy and factfinding than would be

true in a noncapital case. See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.390, 399 (1993);

Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980). Outside of the capital context, we have never said that the possi-bility of a jury misapplying state law gives rise to federal

constitutional error. To the contrary, we have held that instructions that contain errors of state law may not form the
basis for federal habeas relief. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.
62 (1991).

Moreover, under the standard fashioned in Boyde, the relevant inquiry is "whether there is a reasonable likelihood
that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way
that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant
evidence." 494 U. S., at 380. In Boyde, the petitioner argued that the trial court's instruction on California's "catchall" factor for determining whether a defendant should be
sentenced to death restricted the jury's consideration of certain mitigating evidence. Since "[t]he Eighth Amendment
requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to
all relevant mitigating evidence," id., at 377-378, this evidence was plainly constitutionally relevant. In this case, by
contrast, petitioner argues that the challenged instructions
prevented the jury from considering evidence of his affirmative defense. But in a noncapital case such as this there is
no counterpart to the Eighth Amendment's doctrine of "constitutionally relevant evidence" in capital cases.

The Court of Appeals also relied on the plurality opinion
in Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983). That case
dealt with the question whether an instruction that violates
due process under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510

508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT

343Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
(1979), may be subject to harmless-error analysis. But inthe course of deciding this question, the plurality discussed

the nature of Sandstrom error, and it is this discussion onwhich the Court of Appeals relied below.

Sandstrom is a
lineal descendant of Winship; it simply held that an instruction which creates a presumption of fact violates due processif it relieves the State of its burden of proving all of the

elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.The Court of Appeals read the

Johnson plurality's discussion
of Sandstrom as establishing the "due process principle" thatinstructions are unconstitutional if they lead "the jury to ignore exculpatory evidence in finding the defendant guilty
of murder beyond a reasonable doubt." 954 F. 2d, at 453
(emphasis added). But neither Sandstrom nor Johnson can
be stretched that far beyond Winship. The most that can
be said of the instructions given at respondent's trial is that
they created a risk that the jury would fail to consider evidence that related to an affirmative defense, with respect to
which Winship's due process guarantee does not apply. See
Martin v. Ohio, supra; Patterson v. New York, supra.

Respondent offers a separate (but related) rationale he
claims is supported by our cases and also compels the Seventh Circuit's ruling in Falconer: viz., the jury instructions
given at his trial interfered with his fundamental right to
present a defense. We have previously stated that "the
Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful
opportunity to present a complete defense.' " Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984)). But the cases in which we
have invoked this principle dealt with the exclusion of evidence, see, e. g., Crane v. Kentucky, supra; Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973), or the testimony of defense
witnesses, see, e. g., Webb v. Texas, 409 U. S. 95 (1972) (per
curiam); Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14 (1967). None of
them involved restrictions imposed on a defendant's ability
to present an affirmative defense. Drawing on these cases,

508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT
344 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

Opinion of the Court
respondent argues that the right to present a defense in-cludes the right to have the jury consider it, and that confusing instructions on state law which prevent a jury fromconsidering an affirmative defense therefore violate due
process.2 But such an expansive reading of our cases wouldmake a nullity of the rule reaffirmed in Estelle v. McGuire,
supra, that instructional errors of state law generally maynot form the basis for federal habeas relief. And the level
of generality at which respondent invokes this line of casesis far too great to provide any meaningful guidance for purposes of our Teague inquiry. See Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S.,at 491.

For the foregoing reasons, we disagree with the SeventhCircuit and respondent that our precedent foreordained the
result in Falconer, and therefore hold that the rule an-nounced in Falconer is "new" within the meaning of Teague.

3

2 Respondent also relies on Cool v. United States, 409 U. S. 100 (1972)
(per curiam). That case involved a due process challenge to an instruction that the jury should disregard defense testimony unless it believed
beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony was true. Relying on In
re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), and Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14
(1967), we held that this instruction required reversal of the defendant's
conviction because it "place[d] an improper burden on the defense and
allow[ed] the jury to convict despite its failure to find guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt." 409 U. S., at 102-103. This, in turn, we emphasized,
contravened Winship's command that the State must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 409 U. S., at 104. Cool is a progeny of
Winship, and therefore provides no predicate under Teague for the rule
announced in Falconer.

3 Strongly fortifying this conclusion is the fact that the instructions

deemed unconstitutional in Falconer were modeled after, and virtually
identical to, the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntary
manslaughter, which were formally adopted in 1981--five years before respondent's trial--but on which Illinois judges had relied since 1961. As
we have stated, the purpose of Teague's "new rule" principle is to "validat[e] reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made
by state courts." Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 414 (1990). The existence of such an institutionalized state practice over a period of years is

345Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
All that remains to be decided is whether this rule falls into
one of Teague's exceptions, under which a new rule may be
given retroactive effect on collateral review. The first exception applies to those rules that "plac[e] certain kinds of
primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the
criminal law-making authority to proscribe." Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S., at 307 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation
marks omitted). This exception is clearly inapplicable here,
since the rule announced in Falconer does not "decriminalize" any class of conduct. See Saffle v. Parks, supra, at 495.
Teague's second exception permits the retroactive application of " `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating
the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." 494 U. S., at 495 (quoting Teague, supra, at 311).
This exception is also inapplicable. Although the Falconer
court expressed concern that the jury might have been confused by the instructions in question, we cannot say that its
holding falls into that "small core of rules requiring `observance of those procedures that . . . are implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty.' " Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S., at 478

(quoting Teague, supra, at 311 (internal quotation marks

Because the rule announced in Falconer is "new" within
the meaning of Teague and does not fall into one of Teague's
exceptions, it cannot provide the basis for federal habeas

strong evidence of the reasonableness of the interpretations given existing
precedent by state courts.

4 Justice Blackmun in dissent would elevate the instructional defect

contained in the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntary
manslaughter not merely to the level of a federal constitutional violation,
but to one that is so fundamental as to come within Teague's second exception. He reaches this result by combining several different constitutional principles--the prohibition against ex post facto laws, the right to a
fair trial, and the right to remain silent--into an unrecognizable constitutional stew.

relief in respondent's case. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals is therefore

Reversed.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice White joins,
concurring in the judgment.

Kevin Taylor admitted that he had killed Scott Siniscalchi.
He contended, however, that he had "act[ed] under a suddenand intense passion resulting from serious provocation by

[Siniscalchi]." Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-2 (1985). If Tay-lor's account is to be believed, then, under the law of the
State of Illinois, he is not guilty of murder but rather ofmanslaughter.

Ibid. At trial, Taylor took the stand and
admitted to the two elements of murder. He asked only thatthe jury consider his state of mind when he acted and convict

him of voluntary manslaughter, acquitting him of murder.
Illinois law is clear that this put the jury to a choice: Taylor
could be convicted only of manslaughter or murder--not of
both. Indeed, because Taylor produced sufficient evidence
to raise the defense of sudden passion, Illinois law required
the State to negate Taylor's defense beyond a reasonable
doubt. People v. Reddick, 123 Ill. 2d 184, 197, 526 N. E. 2d
141, 146 (1988). As a result, the jury should not have been
permitted to convict Taylor of murder if there was so much
as a reasonable possibility that Taylor's manslaughter defense had merit. Ibid.

In Falconer v. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129 (1990), the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that instructions similar to those given at Taylor's trial did not comport with Illinois law and were ambiguous at best. In Taylor's case,
according to the Court of Appeals, this ambiguity resulted
in a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood those
instructions, and that once it found Taylor guilty of the two
elements of murder (to which Taylor had admitted), the jury
simply stopped deliberating without considering the possibility that Taylor was guilty only of manslaughter. 954 F. 2d

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
441, 442 (1992). In other words, the court concluded thatthere was a reasonable likelihood that the jury never considered Taylor's defense of sudden and provoked passion, eventhough the trial court thought there was sufficient evidence
of the defense for the issue to reach the jury and even though
the State bore the burden of proving its absence beyond areasonable doubt. This, the court held, violated due process. Id., at 450.The Court of Appeals, however, understood that our decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plurality opin-ion), bars the announcement of new rules on habeas corpus.
954 F. 2d, at 451. Accordingly, it examined our precedents
to determine whether its decision was "dictated" by our
prior decisions. In so doing, the court construed our cases
in Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), and Connecticut
v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983) (plurality opinion), as compelling its conclusion that the instructions used in Taylor's case
violated due process. 954 F. 2d, at 452-453. It therefore
held that its rule was not "new" and ordered that a writ of
habeas corpus issue unless Taylor was retried within 120
days. Id., at 453.

I agree with the majority today that the rule the Court of
Appeals announced was at least susceptible to debate among
reasonable jurists. See Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407,
415 (1990). For that reason, I agree that under Teague a
federal court cannot issue a writ of habeas corpus based on
the ambiguous instructions in dispute here. In so deciding,
however, I would not reach out to decide the merits of the
rule, nor would I construe our cases so narrowly as the Court
does. For that reason, I write separately.

Prior to Boyde, we phrased the standard for reviewing
jury instructions in a variety of ways, not all of which were
consistent. Compare Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, 384
(1988) (constitutional error occurs when there is a "substantial probability" the instructions precluded consideration of
constitutionally relevant evidence), with Sandstrom v. Mon508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT
348 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tana, 442 U. S. 510, 523 (1979) (constitutional error occurswhen jurors "could reasonably have concluded" that the instructions created a presumption of guilt on an element ofthe crime). In

Boyde, we clarified that when the claim is
that a single jury "instruction is ambiguous and therefore
subject to an erroneous interpretation," the proper inquiryis "whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury

has applied the challenged instruction in a way that preventsthe consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence."
494 U. S., at 380. As the Court notes, we chose the morerestrictive standard in that case, and, as a result,

Boyde itself
did not state a new rule. The Court, however, finds Boyde
inapplicable because it was a capital case. Ante, at 342.

It is true that we clarified the standard for reviewing jury
instructions in a capital case, but Boyde did not purport to
limit application of that standard to capital cases, nor have
we so limited it. In Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62 (1991),
for example, the Court reviewed an ambiguous state-law instruction in a noncapital case. Although I disagreed with
the Court's conclusion regarding the effect of that ambiguous
instruction, see id., at 76-80 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part), I agreed with the standard it
used in reaching its conclusion: " `whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution." Id., at
72 (quoting Boyde v. California, supra). It is clear that the
"reasonable likelihood" standard of Boyde applies to noncapital cases.

Although the Court's opinion today might be read as implying that erroneous jury instructions may never give rise
to constitutional error outside of capital cases, ante, at 342,
such an implication would misconstrue our precedent.
When the Court states that "instructions that contain errors
of state law may not form the basis for federal habeas relief,"
ibid. (citing Estelle v. McGuire, supra), it must mean that a
mere error of state law, one that does not rise to the level of

349Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
a constitutional violation, may not be corrected on federalhabeas. Some erroneous state-law instructions, however,

may violate due process and hence form the basis for relief,even in a noncapital case. In

McGuire, a majority of the
Court found that the particular erroneous instruction at
issue did not give rise to a constitutional violation, but thevery fact that the Court scrutinized the instruction belies

any assertion that erroneous instructions can violate dueprocess only in capital cases.

We have not held that the Eighth Amendment's require-ment that the jury be allowed to consider and give effect to
all relevant mitigating evidence in capital cases, see, e. g.,
Boyde, supra, applies to noncapital cases. Nevertheless, we
have held that other constitutional amendments create "constitutionally relevant evidence" that the jury must be able to
consider. See, e. g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 51 (1987)
("The right to testify on one's own behalf at a criminal trial
has sources in several provisions of the Constitution"); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 678-679 (1986) (Rehnquist, J.) ("[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). The category of "constitutionally relevant
evidence" is not limited to capital cases.

In this case, the question is not whether application of the
"reasonable likelihood" standard of Boyde is a new rule. It
is not. See ante, at 341-342; supra, at 348. Nor is the question whether jury instructions may be so erroneous under
state law as to rise to the level of a constitutional violation.
It is clear to me that they may. See, e. g., McGuire, 502
U. S., at 72; id., at 78 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part). The question is whether reasonable jurists could disagree over whether the particular erroneous
instruction at issue here--which we assume created a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not consider Taylor's affirmative defense once it determined the two elements of
murder were established--violated the Constitution.

350 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Our cases do not provide a clear answer to that question.Due process, of course, requires that the State prove every

element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In
re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). This straightforward proposition has spawned a number of corollary rules, among them
the rule that the State may not "us[e] evidentiary presump-tions in a jury charge that have the effect of relieving the

State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubtof every essential element of a crime."

Francis v. Franklin,
471 U. S. 307, 313 (1985). Accord, Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S.570, 580 (1986);

Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S., at 84-85
(plurality opinion); Sandstrom, supra, at 521-523. The
Court of Appeals extended these cases--which themselves
are the "logical extension" of Winship, see Rose, supra,
at 580--one step further. It read them as standing for

the proposition that any instruction that leads "the jury to
ignore exculpatory evidence in finding the defendant guilty
of murder beyond a reasonable doubt" violates due process;
it disregarded as meaningless the distinction between elements of the offense and affirmative defenses. 954 F. 2d,
at 453.

Our opinions in Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987), and
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), however, make
clear that at least in some circumstances the distinction is
not meaningless. In Patterson, we held that the Due Process Clause did not require the State to prove the absence
of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance
beyond a reasonable doubt; the State instead could place the
burden of proving the defense on the defendant. Id., at 210.
We reaffirmed this holding in Martin, supra, and rejected
petitioner's claim that requiring her to prove self-defense by
a preponderance of the evidence shifted to petitioner the
burden of disproving the elements of the crime. Id., at 233-
234. (Although Martin was decided after Taylor's conviction became final, its holding, like Boyde's, was not a new
rule.)

351Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
This case differs from Martin and Patterson in at leasttwo ways. First, Taylor had only the burden of production

and not the burden of persuasion; once he produced sufficientevidence for the issue to go to the jury, the State was required to prove the absence of his defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Reddick, 123 Ill. 2d, at 197, 526 N. E. 2d,at 146. Second, Taylor's contention does not concern the

allocation of burdens of proof; he argues that the jury didnot consider his defense at all. Nevertheless, I cannot say
that our prior cases compel the rule articulated by the Courtof Appeals. At the very least,

Martin and Patterson confirm that the rule the Court of Appeals promulgated here
goes beyond what we hitherto have said the Constitution
requires.

The purpose of Teague is to promote the finality of statecourt judgments. When a state court makes a "reasonable,
good-faith interpretatio[n]" of our precedents as they exist
at the time of decision, that decision should not be overturned on federal habeas review. Butler, 494 U. S., at 413-
414. Whatever the merits of the Court of Appeals' constitutional holding, an issue that is not before us, the Illinois
courts were not unreasonable in concluding that the error in
Taylor's instructions was not constitutional error. The
State is not required to allow the defense of sudden and provoked passion at all, and the State is free to allow it while
requiring the defendant to prove it. Martin, supra; Patterson, supra. It is not a begrudging or unreasonable application of these principles to hold that jury instructions that
create a reasonable likelihood the jury will not consider the
defense do not violate the Constitution.

Because our cases do not resolve conclusively the question
whether it violates due process to give an instruction that is
reasonably likely to prevent the jury from considering an
affirmative defense, or a hybrid defense such as the State of
Illinois permits, resolution of the issue on habeas would require us to promulgate a new rule. Like the Court, I be508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
lieve that this rule does not fall within either of Teague'sexceptions to nonretroactive application of new rules on habeas. The rule does not place any conduct, much less " `pri-mary, private individual conduct[,] beyond the power of the
criminal law-making authority to proscribe.' " Teague, 489
U. S., at 311 (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,675 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and

dissenting in part)). Nor does the rule embody a "proce-dur[e] without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction
is seriously diminished." 489 U. S., at 313. As noted above,the Constitution does not require the State to provide an
affirmative defense to murder; a rule that, once such a de-fense is provided, the instructions must not prevent the jury
from considering it is "a far cry from the kind of absolute
prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is implicit in the
concept of ordered liberty." Id., at 314 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

The rule the Court of Appeals promulgated is not compelled by precedent, nor does it fall within one of the two
Teague exceptions. I therefore agree with the Court that
the Court of Appeals erred in applying that rule in this case.
I do not join the Court's opinion, however, because it could
be read (wrongly, in my view) as suggesting that the Court
of Appeals' decision in this case applied not only a new rule,
but also an incorrect one. I would reserve that question
until we address it on direct review.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens joins,
dissenting.

The Court today holds that it cannot decide whether Kevin
Taylor has suffered a denial of due process, because Teague
v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and its progeny preclude the
announcement or application of a new rule on federal habeas
corpus. The Court further concludes, as it must in order to
avoid reaching the merits, that neither exception to Teague's
proscription of a new rule applies in this case. See ante, at

345. The second Teague exception permits the retroactiveapplication of " `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminalproceeding," Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (1990) (quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311). Unlike the Court, I am fullypersuaded that this exception does apply in this case. Therefore, even assuming, arguendo, that the majority is correctin concluding that Taylor asks this Court to announce a "new
rule," Teague does not preclude the retroactive applicationof that rule.

Taylor argues that the substantive criminal law existingat the time of a defendant's alleged offense must be the law
that governs the trial of that offense. I believe that he iscorrect and that the principle he asserts is a fundamental
one. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the Courtof Appeals.

I
At the time that Taylor was tried for the "murder" of ScottSiniscalchi, Illinois law defined murder and voluntary manslaughter as two distinct crimes, albeit with two elements incommon. To be guilty of either crime, a defendant had to
have (1) caused the death of the victim, and (2) intended tokill or cause great bodily harm to the victim.

1 The distinction between voluntary manslaughter and murder at thetime of Taylor's offense was that a defendant who acted

either "under a sudden and intense passion resulting fromserious provocation," or under an unreasonable (but honest)
belief that deadly force was justified to prevent the defend-ant's own imminent death or great bodily harm, was guilty
of voluntary manslaughter but not guilty of murder. Ill.Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-2 (1985). In other words, under Illinois law at the time of Taylor's offense, a person who killed

1 The intent element would also be satisfied if the defendant knew that
his acts would cause or create a strong probability of death or great bodily
harm, or if the defendant had been attempting or committing a forcible
felony at the time. See Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, |||| 9-1(2) and (3) (1985).

Blackmun, J., dissenting
under specific circumstances of provocation was innocent of
murder.

At the close of Taylor's trial, the presiding judge foundthat sufficient evidence in support of voluntary manslaughter

had been presented to require a jury instruction under Illinois law. The judge therefore determined that he would"let the Jury decide . . . whether that provocation existed

here or did not exist here." App. 96. No one has chal-lenged this finding on appeal. Yet the presiding judge did
not explain to the jury that provocation was an affirmativedefense to murder. Instead, after telling the jury about the
two elements of murder (intent and causation of death), thejudge stated: "If you find from your consideration of all the
evidence that each one of these propositions has been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the Defendantguilty."

Id., at 129. The judge went on to instruct the jury
that a person is guilty of voluntary manslaughter when hehas killed an individual while possessing the requisite state

of mind, and at "the time of the killing he acts under a sud-den and intense passion resulting from serious provocatin
[sic] by the deceased. Serious provocation is conduct suffi-cient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person."
Id., at 130. Finally, the judge gave the following instruction
in an apparent attempt to explain the relation between themurder and the voluntary manslaughter charges:

"As stated previously, the Defendant is charged with
committing the offense of murder and voluntary manslaughter. If you find the Defendant guilty, you mustfind him guilty of either offense; but not both. On the

other hand, if you find the Defendant not guilty, you
can find him not guilty on either or both offenses." Id.,
at 131.

Even the prosecutor thought these instructions may have
failed to inform the jury of the relation between the offenses
of murder and manslaughter under Illinois law. Id., at 98-

99. He accordingly suggested that the judge include an in-struction explaining that Taylor's provocation claim could

serve to constitute a complete defense to the murder charge.Id., at 99. The prosecutor indicated that he had raised this
possibility because "I just don't want to knowingly createerror here."

Id., at 101. The trial judge declined the sug-gestion and responded to the prosecutor's concern: "We're

not doing it knowingly; we're doing it out of ignorance."Ibid.

After deliberations, the jury announced that it had foundTaylor guilty of murder. It then returned a signed verdict
form to that effect. Id., at 131, 137. The jury nevermentioned the manslaughter charge and returned unsigned
both the guilty and not-guilty forms for that offense. Id.,at 139-140.

II
A jury instruction is unconstitutional if there is a "reason-able likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged

instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of con-stitutionally relevant evidence." Boyde v. California, 494
U. S. 370, 380 (1990).2 I explain in greater detail below whytestimony that demonstrates that a defendant killed under
provocation is constitutionally relevant evidence in a murdertrial in Illinois. A threshold question, however, is whether
the jury's instructions in this case created a reasonable like-lihood that the jury would not consider such provocation
evidence.No one appears to contest the proposition that a jury of
lay people would not understand from the instructions thatit should find Taylor not guilty of murder if it concluded that
he acted under provocation. The judge explained to the

2 The Court implies, ante, at 342, that the Boyde standard might be
confined to capital cases. The Court's citation of Estelle v. McGuire,
502 U. S. 62 (1991), however, belies that implication, because Estelle v.
McGuire reaffirmed the Boyde standard and was itself not a capital case.

jury that it could convict Taylor of either murder or man-slaughter (or neither), but not both. App. 131. In instructing that Taylor could not be found guilty of both offenses,however, the judge failed to explain that a defendant, in fact,
could satisfy the elements of both offenses. He failed to in-form the jury that indeed

whenever the elements of volun-tary manslaughter (intent, causation, and provocation) are

satisfied, the elements of murder (intent and causation) aresatisfied as well. And, of course, he therefore did not clarify
that the jury must choose manslaughter over murder in theevent that the elements of both offenses are made out.

The relation between murder and voluntary manslaughterin Illinois at the time of Taylor's offense was a complicated
one. Provocation was both a component of manslaughterand a defense to murder. The easy way to convey this idea
is to explain that to find a defendant guilty of murder, thejury must find (1) that there was intent, (2) that there was
causation, and (3) that there was no provocation. The prose-cutor explained to the judge that he might have had to provide such an instruction under Illinois law. See id., at 99.What the judge actually did, however, was simply to list
the elements of each offense, starting with murder, tell thejury that it could convict Taylor of only one but not of both,
and send the jury to deliberate. In the deliberation room,the jurors had four sheets of paper,

3 each of which provided

spaces for the jurors' signatures. The sheets indicated, re-spectively, verdicts of "Not Guilty of the offense of murder,"

"Guilty of the offense of murder," "Not Guilty of the offenseof Voluntary Manslaughter," and "Guilty of the offense of
Voluntary Manslaughter," in that order. See id., at 135, 137,139-140. The jurors signed neither the guilty nor the notguilty verdict forms regarding voluntary manslaughter.This is almost certainly because the instruction for murder

3 Two additional sheets referred to the crime of home invasion, for which
Taylor was tried and convicted. This conviction, however, is no longer at
issue in this case.

preceded the instruction for manslaughter, the verdict formsfor murder preceded the verdict forms for manslaughter, and

the jurors understood that once they had found Taylor guiltyof murder, they could not, consistent with the judge's instructions, find him guilty of manslaughter. There wastherefore no need, under the instructions they received, to
consider manslaughter and provocation. Taylor's jury neverknew that provocation made out a complete defense to
murder.The State itself concedes that the instructions "violated
state law by permitting the jury to find Taylor guilty of mur-der without considering his affirmative defense." Brief for
Petitioner 12. According to a unanimous Illinois SupremeCourt evaluating the same instructions given in another
case: "These instructions essentially assure that, if the juryfollows them, the jury cannot possibly convict a defendant of
voluntary manslaughter." People v. Reddick, 123 Ill. 2d 184,194, 526 N. E. 2d 141, 145 (1988). The Seventh Circuit concluded: "No matter how clearly either the State or the de-fense proved the existence of the mitigating `manslaughter
defenses,' the jury could nevertheless return a murder ver-dict in line with the murder instruction as given."

Falconerv. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129, 1136 (1990). Because of the jury's

ignorance, respondent Taylor suffered a fundamental depri-vation of his constitutional rights that seriously diminished
the likelihood of an accurate conviction.

III
To understand why an instruction that prevents the juryfrom considering provocation evidence violates the Constitution, it is necessary to examine the operation of the criminallaw in regulating the conduct of citizens in a free society.
As explained below, the instructions in this case in effectcreated an ex post facto law, diminished the likelihood of an
accurate conviction, and deprived Taylor of his right to afair trial.

1

This Court consistently has held that the Constitution re-quires a State to provide notice to its citizens of what conduct will subject them to criminal penalties and of whatthose penalties are. See Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423,
429 (1987) (explaining the constitutional prohibition againstex post facto laws, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3, $ 10, cl. 1);
Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, 169 (1925) (same); Buckleyv.

Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 77 (1976) (explaining the due processrequirement that defendants be on notice that their conduct

violates the criminal law); Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378U. S. 347, 351 (1964) (same). People can conform their conduct to the dictates of the criminal law only if they can knowwhat the criminal law has to say about their conduct.
Proper warning is a constitutional imperative.Illinois, through its criminal statutes, warned Taylor that
his actions, as conceded at trial, were against the law. Illinois, however, did not warn him that murder and voluntarymanslaughter would be treated as interchangeable or equivalent offenses. A defendant convicted of voluntary man-slaughter, for example, could be incarcerated for as short a
term as 4 years, and could be imprisoned for a maximumterm of 15 years. A convicted murderer, in contrast, could
be imprisoned for no fewer than 20 years and up to a maxi-mum of 40 years, absent aggravating factors. See Ill. Rev.
Stat., ch. 38, |||| 9-2(c), 1005-8-1(1) and (4) (1985). Under
Illinois law at the time of Taylor's acts, then, the offense thathe claims he committed--voluntary manslaughter--was not

treated as an offense of nearly the same seriousness as mur-der.

4 Nevertheless, in the presence of provocation evidence,

4 This distinction between murder and voluntary manslaughter is hardly
a recent innovation in the criminal law. "[T]he presence or absence of
the heat of passion on sudden provocation--has been, almost from the
inception of the common law of homicide, the single most important factor

Blackmun, J., dissenting
a murder instruction read without an adequate explanation
of the affirmative defense of provocation treats murder and
voluntary manslaughter as equivalent offenses. Because
provocation evidence was undisputedly present in this case,
the failure to explain its operation as a defense to murder
amounted to the application to Taylor of an ex post facto
murder law.

A useful analogy to the relation between voluntary manslaughter and murder in this case is the relation between
self-defense and murder elsewhere in the criminal law. In
those States in which self-defense is an affirmative defense
to murder, the Constitution does not require that the prosecution disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.
See, e. g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 233, 234 (1987). This
is because only elements of an offense impose this heavy burden of proof upon the State. Ibid. Despite its status as an
affirmative defense, however, self-defense converts what is
otherwise murder into justifiable homicide. In other words,
the person who kills in self-defense, instead of being guilty
of murder, is guilty of no offense at all.

It is easy to see in the context of self-defense how the
omission of an affirmative-defense instruction fundamentally
denies the defendant due process. Consider the following
hypothetical example. As a citizen who is presumed to
know the law, see Atkins v. Parker, 472 U. S. 115, 130 (1985),
Jane Doe chooses to kill John Smith when he threatens her
with substantial bodily harm or death, on the correct theory

360 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

Blackmun, J., dissenting
It may be more difficult to sympathize with Kevin Taylorthan with the hypothetical Jane Doe, because Doe acted legally and Taylor concededly did not. Not all crimes are
equal, however, and if Illinois announces that it will treat
murder more seriously than voluntary manslaughter, then
Taylor has a right to rely on that announcement when he
makes a decision to engage in conduct punishable as a less
serious crime. This Court in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.
684, 698 (1975), said:

"Indeed, when viewed in terms of the potential difference in restrictions of personal liberty attendant to each
conviction, the distinction . . . between murder and manslaughter may be of greater importance than the difference between guilt or innocence for many lesser crimes."

2
By equating voluntary manslaughter with murder and
thereby, in effect, applying an ex post facto murder law to
Taylor, the instructions in this case made it highly likely that
the jury would return an inaccurate murder conviction.

As explained above, under Illinois law at the time of Taylor's offense, the presence of provocation reduced murder to
voluntary manslaughter. This meant that state law defined
the category of murder to exclude voluntary manslaughter
and therefore considered a person who was guilty of voluntary manslaughter also to be innocent of murder. Any procedure that increased the likelihood of a murder conviction
despite the presence of provocation, thus also decreasing
the likelihood of a manslaughter conviction, was therefore a
procedure that diminished the likelihood of an accurate conviction by the jury. Because the procedure in this case
prevented the jury from even considering the voluntary
manslaughter option, it severely diminished the likelihood of
an accurate conviction. See Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S.
407, 416 (1990). The instructions given in this case essen508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:39 PAGES OPINPGT

361Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
tially ensured that a person guilty of voluntary manslaughterwould be convicted, wrongly, of murder.

Returning to the hypothetical example set forth above, theomission of a self-defense instruction in Jane Doe's case
would distort the definition of murder by causing the jury
to include killings in self-defense within that definition. Aperson who kills in self-defense, however, like a person who

kills under provocation, is not guilty of murder under statelaw and is therefore not subject to the penalties prescribed
for murder. Any conviction that results from the omissionof a state-law affirmative defense is therefore, in the case of
provocation and in the case of self-defense, an inaccurate
conviction.

The State suggests that the right asserted by Taylor is
the same as that recognized by this Court in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980). See Brief for Petitioner 17. In
Beck, this Court held that a capital defendant is entitled to
a lesser included offense instruction if there is evidence in
the record to support such an instruction. We left open the
question whether Beck applies in the noncapital context.
447 U. S., at 638, n. 14. The State here asserts that because
many Courts of Appeals have rejected such a right in the
noncapital context, this Court could do the same with respect
to Taylor's claim. See Brief for Petitioner 17, and n. 7.
This assertion is without merit.

Like the right Taylor claims, Beck entitles certain defendants to have the jury consider less drastic alternatives to
murder. This, however, is where the similarity between the
two rights ends. In Beck, the Court's concern and the reason for the required lesser included offense instruction was
that jurors might ignore their reasonable-doubt instruction.
Where the defendant is " `plainly guilty of some offense,' "
447 U. S., at 634, quoting Keeble v. United States, 412 U. S.
205, 213 (1973) (emphasis in original), there is a risk that
absent a lesser included offense instruction, the jurors will
convict a defendant of capital murder, thereby exposing him

362 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

Blackmun, J., dissenting
to the death penalty, because they do not want to set a guiltyperson free. In other words, the failure to provide a lesser

included offense instruction in the capital context is a prob-lem only to the extent that we fear that jurors will choose
to disregard or nullify their reasonable-doubt instruction.In Taylor's case, the concern is just the opposite--that the
jurors will follow their instructions and thereby convict thedefendant of murder because they are ignorant of the fact
that provocation reduces the offense to voluntary man-slaughter. The failure to include a proper voluntary manslaughter instruction literally distorts the definition ofmurder by extending it to include voluntary manslaughter
and thereby misinforming the jury.Whether or not we would choose to extend Beck and its
presumption of jury nullification to the noncapital defendanthas no bearing on the outcome of this case. The right at
issue here is one premised upon the notion that jurors faith-fully follow what they understand to be their instructions.
This premise clearly operates in the capital and noncapitalcontexts alike. See

Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200,211 (1987).

B
Through his instructions, then, the trial judge in this caseapplied an

ex post facto murder law to Taylor and therebymisled the jury as to the definition of murder. But the trial

judge also violated another of Taylor's constitutional rights.When the judge prevented Taylor's jurors from considering
his provocation defense, the judge deprived Taylor of hisSixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to a
fair trial.The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution guarantee every criminal defendant the right to remainsilent. Our precedents have explained that this right precludes the State from calling the defendant as a witness forthe prosecution. See,

e. g., South Dakota v. Neville, 459U. S. 553, 563 (1983) (the "classic Fifth Amendment viola508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:39 PAGES OPINPGT

363Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
tion" consists of requiring the defendant to testify at his owncriminal trial);

Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964) (the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause incorporates theFifth Amendment right to remain silent against the States).

The State must provide all evidence necessary to a conviction if the defendant chooses not to testify.Taylor gave up this important right and took the witness

stand to testify about his crime. He evidently did so to availhimself of the provocation defense provided by Illinois law.
Taylor admitted under oath that he broke into his formerwife's home and intentionally and fatally stabbed Scott Siniscalchi. App. 80-81. He also testified, however, that he had
been provoked by the victim. Id., at 76-81. In its closing
argument, the defense therefore asked the jury to find that
he had acted under sudden and intense passion when he
killed Siniscalchi and therefore was not guilty of murder.
Id., at 112-121.

When the judge instructed the jurors, he effectively told
them to disregard Taylor's provocation testimony. Absent
that testimony, of course, the most important evidence before the jurors when they deliberated was that Taylor had
taken the stand and had sworn to them that his actions violated both elements of the murder statute. As far as the
jurors could tell, Taylor had confessed to the crime of murder
in open court.

Taylor never indicated a desire to plead guilty to murder.
Indeed, he offered testimony that tended to show that he
was innocent of murder. Yet the trial judge failed to follow
the very statute that had prompted Taylor to testify. By so
doing, the judge effectively transformed exculpatory testimony into a plea of guilty to murder. When a defendant
intentionally pleads guilty to an offense, he has a constitutional right to be informed about the consequences of his
plea. See Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 509 (1984);
Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 436 (1983). Taylor,
however, was never apprised of the consequences of his testi508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:39 PAGES OPINPGT
364 GILMORE v. TAYLOR

Blackmun, J., dissenting
mony. Instead, he was affirmatively misled into unknowingly confessing to a crime of which he claimed he was innocent. The judge's erroneous instructions thereby vitiated
Taylor's right to a fair trial, guaranteed him by the Sixth
and Fourteenth Amendments.

IV
The omission of an adequate affirmative-defense instruction constitutes a profound violation of a defendant's constitutional rights. It creates an ex post facto law, misinforms
the jury as to the governing legal principles, and denies a
defendant his right to a fair trial. "Although the precise
contours of [the second Teague] exception may be difficult to
discern, we have usually cited Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335 (1963), holding that a defendant has the right to be
represented by counsel in all criminal trials for serious offenses, to illustrate the type of rule coming within the exception." Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S., at 495. The right to an
affirmative-defense instruction that jurors can understand
when there is evidence to support an affirmative defense is
as significant to the fairness and accuracy of a criminal proceeding as is the right to counsel. It is indeed critical in a
case like this one, where the defendant takes the stand and
concedes the elements of murder in order to prove his affirmative defense.

Kevin Taylor has not requested a rule that would unreasonably place stumbling blocks in the path of law enforcement, nor has he asked this Court to announce a rule that is
only marginally related to the underlying right to a fair trial.
On the contrary, he has asked that he be convicted of voluntary manslaughter if he is guilty of voluntary manslaughter,
that he be spared a sentence for murder if he is innocent of
murder, and that his judge not effectively instruct the jury
to disregard the exculpatory part of his testimony and attend

only to that which would ensure a conviction for murder. Ifhe is denied what he asks, he is denied a fair trial.

I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.

5 The Court's footnote 4, ante, at 345, added by The Chief Justice
after the dissenting opinion circulated, hardly deserves acknowledgment,
let alone comment. I had thought that this was a court of justice and that
a criminal defendant in this country could expect to receive a genuine
analysis of the constitutional issues in his case rather than the dismissive
and conclusory rhetoric with which Kevin Taylor is here treated. I adhere to my derided "constitutional stew."

Syllabus

MINNESOTA v. DICKERSON
certiorari to the supreme court of minnesota

No. 91-2019. Argued March 3, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
Based upon respondent's seemingly evasive actions when approached by

police officers and the fact that he had just left a building known for
cocaine traffic, the officers decided to investigate further and ordered
respondent to submit to a patdown search. The search revealed no
weapons, but the officer conducting it testified that he felt a small lump
in respondent's jacket pocket, believed it to be a lump of crack cocaine
upon examining it with his fingers, and then reached into the pocket
and retrieved a small bag of cocaine. The state trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the cocaine, and he was found guilty of
possession of a controlled substance. The Minnesota Court of Appeals
reversed. In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that both the
stop and the frisk of respondent were valid under Terry v. Ohio, 392
U. S. 1, but found the seizure of the cocaine to be unconstitutional. Refusing to enlarge the "plain-view" exception to the Fourth Amendment's
warrant requirement, the court appeared to adopt a categorical rule
barring the seizure of any contraband detected by an officer through the
sense of touch during a patdown search. The court further noted that,
even if it recognized such a "plain-feel" exception, the search in this
case would not qualify because it went far beyond what is permissible
under Terry.

Held:

1. The police may seize nonthreatening contraband detected through
the sense of touch during a protective patdown search of the sort permitted by Terry, so long as the search stays within the bounds marked
by Terry. Pp. 372-377.

(a) Terry permits a brief stop of a person whose suspicious conduct
leads an officer to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot, and a patdown search of the person for weapons when
the officer is justified in believing that the person may be armed and
presently dangerous. This protective search--permitted without a
warrant and on the basis of reasonable suspicion less than probable
cause--is not meant to discover evidence of crime, but must be strictly
limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which
might be used to harm the officer or others. If the protective search
goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it

is no longer valid under Terry and its fruits will be suppressed. Sibron
v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 65-66. Pp. 372-373.

(b) In Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1050, the seizure of contraband other than weapons during a lawful Terry search was justified by
reference to the Court's cases under the "plain-view" doctrine. That
doctrine--which permits police to seize an object without a warrant
if they are lawfully in a position to view it, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if they have a lawful right of access
to it--has an obvious application by analogy to cases in which an officer discovers contraband through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful search. Thus, if an officer lawfully pats down a suspect's
outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its
identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect's privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for
weapons. Cf., e. g., Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U. S. 765, 771. If the object
is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the realization that resort to a neutral magistrate under such circumstances would
be impracticable and would do little to promote the Fourth Amendment's objectives. Cf., e. g., Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321, 326-327.
Pp. 374-377.

2. Application of the foregoing principles to the facts of this case demonstrates that the officer who conducted the search was not acting
within the lawful bounds marked by Terry at the time he gained probable cause to believe that the lump in respondent's jacket was contraband.
Under the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the record, the officer never thought that the lump was a weapon, but did not immediately
recognize it as cocaine. Rather, he determined that it was contraband
only after he squeezed, slid, and otherwise manipulated the pocket's
contents. While Terry entitled him to place his hands on respondent's
jacket and to feel the lump in the pocket, his continued exploration of
the pocket after he concluded that it contained no weapon was unrelated
to the sole justification for the search under Terry. Because this further search was constitutionally invalid, the seizure of the cocaine that
followed is likewise unconstitutional. Pp. 377-379.

I
On the evening of November 9, 1989, two Minneapolis po-lice officers were patrolling an area on the city's north side in

a marked squad car. At about 8:15 p.m., one of the officersobserved respondent leaving a 12-unit apartment building on
Morgan Avenue North. The officer, having previously re-sponded to complaints of drug sales in the building's hallways and having executed several search warrants on thepremises, considered the building to be a notorious "crack
house." According to testimony credited by the trial court,respondent began walking toward the police but, upon spot*Fred E. Inbau, Wayne W. Schmidt, James P. Manak, and Robert H.

Opinion of the Court
ting the squad car and making eye contact with one of theofficers, abruptly halted and began walking in the opposite

direction. His suspicion aroused, this officer watched as re-spondent turned and entered an alley on the other side of
the apartment building. Based upon respondent's seem-ingly evasive actions and the fact that he had just left a
building known for cocaine traffic, the officers decided to stoprespondent and investigate further.

The officers pulled their squad car into the alley and or-dered respondent to stop and submit to a patdown search.
The search revealed no weapons, but the officer conductingthe search did take an interest in a small lump in respondent's nylon jacket. The officer later testified:

"[A]s I pat-searched the front of his body, I felt a lump,a small lump, in the front pocket. I examined it with

my fingers and it slid and it felt to be a lump of crackcocaine in cellophane." Tr. 9 (Feb. 20, 1990).

The officer then reached into respondent's pocket and re-trieved a small plastic bag containing one fifth of one gram
of crack cocaine. Respondent was arrested and charged inHennepin County District Court with possession of a controlled substance.Before trial, respondent moved to suppress the cocaine.
The trial court first concluded that the officers were justifiedunder

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), in stopping respond-ent to investigate whether he might be engaged in criminal

activity. The court further found that the officers were jus-tified in frisking respondent to ensure that he was not carrying a weapon. Finally, analogizing to the "plain-view" doc-trine, under which officers may make a warrantless seizure
of contraband found in plain view during a lawful search forother items, the trial court ruled that the officers' seizure of
the cocaine did not violate the Fourth Amendment:

"To this Court there is no distinction as to which sen-sory perception the officer uses to conclude that the ma508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
terial is contraband. An experienced officer may relyupon his sense of smell in DWI stops or in recognizing

the smell of burning marijuana in an automobile. Thesound of a shotgun being racked would clearly support
certain reactions by an officer. The sense of touch,grounded in experience and training, is as reliable as
perceptions drawn from other senses. `Plain feel,'therefore, is no different than plain view and will equally
support the seizure here." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-5.
His suppression motion having failed, respondent proceededto trial and was found guilty.

On appeal, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed.The court agreed with the trial court that the investigative
stop and protective patdown search of respondent were law-ful under Terry because the officers had a reasonable belief
based on specific and articulable facts that respondent wasengaged in criminal behavior and that he might be armed
and dangerous. The court concluded, however, that theofficers had overstepped the bounds allowed by

Terry inseizing the cocaine. In doing so, the Court of Appeals "decline[d] to adopt the plain feel exception" to the warrant re-quirement. 469 N. W. 2d 462, 466 (1991).

The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed. Like the Courtof Appeals, the State Supreme Court held that both the stop
and the frisk of respondent were valid under Terry, butfound the seizure of the cocaine to be unconstitutional. The
court expressly refused "to extend the plain view doctrineto the sense of touch" on the grounds that "the sense of touch
is inherently less immediate and less reliable than the senseof sight" and that "the sense of touch is far more intrusive
into the personal privacy that is at the core of the [F]ourth[A]mendment." 481 N. W. 2d 840, 845 (1992). The court
thus appeared to adopt a categorical rule barring the seizureof any contraband detected by an officer through the sense
of touch during a patdown search for weapons. The courtfurther noted that "[e]ven if we recognized a `plain feel' ex508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT

ception, the search in this case would not qualify" because"[t]he pat search of the defendant went far beyond what is

permissible under Terry." Id., at 843, 844, n. 1. As theState Supreme Court read the record, the officer conducting
the search ascertained that the lump in respondent's jacketwas contraband only after probing and investigating what he
certainly knew was not a weapon. See id., at 844.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 814 (1992), to resolve a
conflict among the state and federal courts over whethercontraband detected through the sense of touch during a
patdown search may be admitted into evidence.1 We nowaffirm.

or "plain-touch" corollary to the plain-view doctrine. See United States

(1992). Some state courts, however, like the Minnesota court in this case,
have rejected such a corollary. See People v. Diaz, 81 N. Y. 2d 106, 612
N. E. 2d 298 (1993); State v. Collins, 139 Ariz. 434, 435-438, 679 P. 2d 80,

2 Before reaching the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue, we must

address respondent's contention that the case is moot. After respondent
was found guilty of the drug possession charge, the trial court sentenced
respondent under a diversionary sentencing statute to a 2-year period of
probation. As allowed by the diversionary scheme, no judgment of conviction was entered and, upon respondent's successful completion of probation, the original charges were dismissed. See Minn. Stat. $ 152.18 (1992).
Respondent argues that the case has been rendered moot by the dismissal
of the original criminal charges. We often have observed, however, that

Opinion of the Court

A

The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States byway of the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.

643 (1961), guarantees "[t]he right of the people to be securein their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." Time and again, this Courthas observed that searches and seizures " `conducted outside
the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or mag-istrate, are

per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amend-ment--subject only to a few specifically established and well

delineated exceptions.' " Thompson v. Louisiana, 469 U. S.17, 19-20 (1984) (per curiam) (quoting Katz v. United States,
389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967) (footnotes omitted)); Mincey v. Ari-zona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also United States v.
Place, 462 U. S. 696, 701 (1983). One such exception was
"the possibility of a criminal defendant's suffering `collateral legal consequences' from a sentence already served" precludes a finding of mootness.
Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 108, n. 3 (1977) (per curiam); see
also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 391, n. 4 (1985); Sibron v. New York,
392 U. S. 40, 53-58 (1968). In this case, Minnesota law provides that the
proceeding which culminated in finding respondent guilty "shall not be
deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime or for any other purpose." Minn.
Stat. $ 152.18 (1992). The statute also provides, however, that a nonpublic
record of the charges dismissed pursuant to the statute "shall be retained
by the department of public safety for the purpose of use by the courts in
determining the merits of subsequent proceedings" against the respondent. Ibid. Construing this provision, the Minnesota Supreme Court has
held that "[t]he statute contemplates use of the record should [a] defendant
have `future difficulties with the law.' " State v. Goodrich, 256 N. W. 2d
506, 512 (1977). Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
has held that a diversionary disposition under $ 152.18 may be included in
calculating a defendant's criminal history category in the event of a subsequent federal conviction. United States v. Frank, 932 F. 2d 700, 701
(1991). Thus, we must conclude that reinstatement of the record of the
charges against respondent would carry collateral legal consequences and
that, therefore, a live controversy remains.

recognized in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), which heldthat "where a police officer observes unusual conduct which

leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experiencethat criminal activity may be afoot . . . ," the officer may
briefly stop the suspicious person and make "reasonable inquiries" aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions.
Id., at 30; see also Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 145-
146 (1972).

Terry further held that "[w]hen an officer is justified in
believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he isinvestigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others," the officer may conduct a
patdown search "to determine whether the person is in fact
carrying a weapon." 392 U. S., at 24. "The purpose of this
limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to
allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of
violence . . . ." Adams, supra, at 146. Rather, a protective search--permitted without a warrant and on the basis
of reasonable suspicion less than probable cause--must
be strictly "limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer
or others nearby." Terry, supra, at 26; see also Michigan
v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1049, and 1052, n. 16 (1983); Ybarra
v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85, 93-94 (1979). If the protective
search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the
suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under Terry and its
fruits will be suppressed. Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40,
65-66 (1968).

These principles were settled 25 years ago when, on the
same day, the Court announced its decisions in Terry and
Sibron. The question presented today is whether police
officers may seize nonthreatening contraband detected during a protective patdown search of the sort permitted by
Terry. We think the answer is clearly that they may, so
long as the officers' search stays within the bounds marked
by Terry.

374 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSON

Opinion of the Court

B
We have already held that police officers, at least undercertain circumstances, may seize contraband detected during

the lawful execution of a Terry search. In Michigan v.
Long, supra, for example, police approached a man who haddriven his car into a ditch and who appeared to be under the

influence of some intoxicant. As the man moved to reenterthe car from the roadside, police spotted a knife on the floorboard. The officers stopped the man, subjected him to apatdown search, and then inspected the interior of the vehicle for other weapons. During the search of the passengercompartment, the police discovered an open pouch containing
marijuana and seized it. This Court upheld the validity ofthe search and seizure under

Terry. The Court held firstthat, in the context of a roadside encounter, where police

have reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulablefacts to believe that a driver may be armed and dangerous,
they may conduct a protective search for weapons not onlyof the driver's person but also of the passenger compartment
of the automobile. 463 U. S., at 1049. Of course, the protec-tive search of the vehicle, being justified solely by the danger
that weapons stored there could be used against the officersor bystanders, must be "limited to those areas in which a
weapon may be placed or hidden." Ibid. The Court thenheld: "If, while conducting a legitimate Terry search of the
interior of the automobile, the officer should, as here, dis-cover contraband other than weapons, he clearly cannot be
required to ignore the contraband, and the Fourth Amend-ment does not require its suppression in such circumstances." Id., at 1050; accord, Sibron, 392 U. S., at 69-70(

White, J., concurring); id., at 79 (Harlan, J., concurring inresult).

The Court in Long justified this latter holding by refer-ence to our cases under the "plain-view" doctrine. See
Long, supra, at 1050; see also United States v. Hensley, 469U. S. 221, 235 (1985) (upholding plain-view seizure in context

Opinion of the Court
of Terry stop). Under that doctrine, if police are lawfully ina position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officershave a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it
without a warrant. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S. 128,
136-137 (1990); Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730, 739 (1983) (plu-rality opinion). If, however, the police lack probable cause

to believe that an object in plain view is contraband withoutconducting some further search of the object--

i. e., if "its
incriminating character [is not] `immediately apparent,' "
Horton, supra, at 136--the plain-view doctrine cannot justify its seizure. Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321 (1987).

We think that this doctrine has an obvious application by
analogy to cases in which an officer discovers contraband
through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful
search. The rationale of the plain-view doctrine is that if
contraband is left in open view and is observed by a police
officer from a lawful vantage point, there has been no invasion of a legitimate expectation of privacy and thus no
"search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment--or
at least no search independent of the initial intrusion that
gave the officers their vantage point. See Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U. S. 765, 771 (1983); Texas v. Brown, supra, at
740. The warrantless seizure of contraband that presents
itself in this manner is deemed justified by the realization
that resort to a neutral magistrate under such circumstances
would often be impracticable and would do little to promote
the objectives of the Fourth Amendment. See Hicks, supra,
at 326-327; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 467-
468, 469-470 (1971) (opinion of Stewart, J.). The same can
be said of tactile discoveries of contraband. If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's outer clothing and feels an
object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately
apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect's privacy
beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for
weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure

376 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSON

Opinion of the Court
would be justified by the same practical considerations thatinhere in the plain-view context.

3

The Minnesota Supreme Court rejected an analogy to theplain-view doctrine on two grounds: first, its belief that "the

sense of touch is inherently less immediate and less reliablethan the sense of sight," and second, that "the sense of touch
is far more intrusive into the personal privacy that is at thecore of the [F]ourth [A]mendment." 481 N. W. 2d, at 845.
We have a somewhat different view. First, Terry itselfdemonstrates that the sense of touch is capable of revealing
the nature of an object with sufficient reliability to supporta seizure. The very premise of

Terry, after all, is that offi-cers will be able to detect the presence of weapons through

the sense of touch and Terry upheld precisely such a seizure.Even if it were true that the sense of touch is generally less
reliable than the sense of sight, that only suggests that of-ficers will less often be able to justify seizures of unseen
contraband. Regardless of whether the officer detects thecontraband by sight or by touch, however, the Fourth
Amendment's requirement that the officer have probablecause to believe that the item is contraband before seizing

it ensures against excessively speculative seizures.4 The

3 "[T]he police officer in each [case would have] had a prior justification
for an intrusion in the course of which he came inadvertently across
a piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The doctrine serves to
supplement the prior justification . . . and permits the warrantless seizure." Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 466 (1971) (opinion of
Stewart, J.).

4 We also note that this Court's opinion in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S.

85 (1979), appeared to contemplate the possibility that police officers could
obtain probable cause justifying a seizure of contraband through the sense
of touch. In that case, police officers had entered a tavern and subjected
its patrons to patdown searches. While patting down the petitioner
Ybarra, an "officer felt what he described as `a cigarette pack with objects
in it,' " seized it, and discovered heroin inside. Id., at 88-89. The State
argued that the seizure was constitutional on the grounds that the officer
obtained probable cause to believe that Ybarra was carrying contraband
during the course of a lawful Terry frisk. Ybarra, supra, at 92. This

508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT

377Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
court's second concern--that touch is more intrusive into pri-vacy than is sight--is inapposite in light of the fact that the

intrusion the court fears has already been authorized by thelawful search for weapons. The seizure of an item whose
identity is already known occasions no further invasion ofprivacy. See

Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 66(1992); Horton, supra, at 141; United States v. Jacobsen, 466

U. S. 109, 120 (1984). Accordingly, the suspect's privacy in-terests are not advanced by a categorical rule barring the
seizure of contraband plainly detected through the sense oftouch.

III
It remains to apply these principles to the facts of thiscase. Respondent has not challenged the finding made by

the trial court and affirmed by both the Court of Appealsand the State Supreme Court that the police were justified
under Terry in stopping him and frisking him for weapons.Thus, the dispositive question before this Court is whether
the officer who conducted the search was acting within thelawful bounds marked by Terry at the time he gained probable cause to believe that the lump in respondent's jacket wascontraband. The State District Court did not make precise
findings on this point, instead finding simply that the officer,after feeling "a small, hard object wrapped in plastic" in respondent's pocket, "formed the opinion that the object . . .was crack . . . cocaine." App. to Pet. for Cert. C-2. The

Court rejected that argument on the grounds that "[t]he initial frisk of
Ybarra was simply not supported by a reasonable belief that he was armed
and presently dangerous," as required by Terry. 444 U. S., at 92-93.
The Court added: "[s]ince we conclude that the initial patdown of Ybarra
was not justified under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, we need
not decide whether or not the presence on Ybarra's person of `a cigarette
pack with objects in it' yielded probable cause to believe that Ybarra was
carrying any illegal substance." Id., at 93, n. 5. The Court's analysis
does not suggest, and indeed seems inconsistent with, the existence of a
categorical bar against seizures of contraband detected manually during a
Terry patdown search.

508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT
378 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSON

Opinion of the Court
District Court also noted that the officer made "no claim thathe suspected this object to be a weapon,"

id., at C-5, a finding affirmed on appeal, see 469 N. W. 2d, at 464 (the officer"never thought the lump was a weapon"). The Minnesota

Supreme Court, after "a close examination of the record,"
held that the officer's own testimony "belies any notion thathe `immediately' " recognized the lump as crack cocaine.

See 481 N. W. 2d, at 844. Rather, the court concluded, theofficer determined that the lump was contraband only after
"squeezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating the contentsof the defendant's pocket"--a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon. Ibid.

Under the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the
record before it, it is clear that the court was correct in holding that the police officer in this case overstepped the bounds
of the "strictly circumscribed" search for weapons allowed
under Terry. See Terry, 392 U. S., at 26. Where, as here,
"an officer who is executing a valid search for one item seizes
a different item," this Court rightly "has been sensitive to
the danger . . . that officers will enlarge a specific authorization, furnished by a warrant or an exigency, into the
equivalent of a general warrant to rummage and seize at
will." Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S., at 748 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Here, the officer's continued exploration of respondent's pocket after having concluded that it
contained no weapon was unrelated to "[t]he sole justification
of the search [under Terry:] . . . the protection of the police
officer and others nearby." 392 U. S., at 29. It therefore
amounted to the sort of evidentiary search that Terry expressly refused to authorize, see id., at 26, and that we have
condemned in subsequent cases. See Michigan v. Long, 463
U. S., at 1049, n. 14; Sibron, 392 U. S., at 65-66.

Once again, the analogy to the plain-view doctrine is apt.
In Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U. S. 321 (1987), this Court held
invalid the seizure of stolen stereo equipment found by police
while executing a valid search for other evidence. Although

508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT

379Cite as: 508 U. S. 366 (1993)
Scalia, J., concurring
the police were lawfully on the premises, they obtained prob-able cause to believe that the stereo equipment was contraband only after moving the equipment to permit officers toread its serial numbers. The subsequent seizure of the
equipment could not be justified by the plain-view doctrine,this Court explained, because the incriminating character of
the stereo equipment was not immediately apparent; rather,probable cause to believe that the equipment was stolen
arose only as a result of a further search--the moving of theequipment--that was not authorized by a search warrant or
by any exception to the warrant requirement. The facts ofthis case are very similar. Although the officer was lawfully
in a position to feel the lump in respondent's pocket, becauseTerry entitled him to place his hands upon respondent's
jacket, the court below determined that the incriminatingcharacter of the object was not immediately apparent to him.
Rather, the officer determined that the item was contrabandonly after conducting a further search, one not authorized by
Terry or by any other exception to the warrant requirement.Because this further search of respondent's pocket was constitutionally invalid, the seizure of the cocaine that followedis likewise unconstitutional.

Horton, 496 U. S., at 140.

IV
For these reasons, the judgment of the Minnesota Su-preme Court is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I take it to be a fundamental principle of constitutionaladjudication that the terms in the Constitution must be

given the meaning ascribed to them at the time of their rati-fication. Thus, when the Fourth Amendment provides that
"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses, papers, and effects, against

unreasonable searchesand seizures, shall not be violated" (emphasis added), it "is

508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT

to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreason-able search and seizure when it was adopted,"

Carroll v.
United States, 267 U. S. 132, 149 (1925); see also Californiav.

Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565, 583-584 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The purpose of the provision, in other
words, is to preserve that degree of respect for the privacyof persons and the inviolability of their property that existed

when the provision was adopted--even if a later, less virtu-ous age should become accustomed to considering all sorts
of intrusion "reasonable."My problem with the present case is that I am not entirely
sure that the physical search--the "frisk"--that produced
the evidence at issue here complied with that constitutional
standard. The decision of ours that gave approval to such
searches, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), made no serious
attempt to determine compliance with traditional standards,
but rather, according to the style of this Court at the time,
simply adjudged that such a search was "reasonable" by current estimations. Id., at 22-27.

There is good evidence, I think, that the "stop" portion of
the Terry "stop-and-frisk" holding accords with the common
law--that it had long been considered reasonable to detain
suspicious persons for the purpose of demanding that they
give an account of themselves. This is suggested, in particular, by the so-called night-walker statutes, and their
common-law antecedents. See Statute of Winchester, 13
Edw. I, Stat. 2, ch. 4 (1285); Statute of 5 Edw. III, ch. 14
(1331); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 13, $ 6, p. 129
(8th ed. 1824) ("It is holden that this statute was made in
affirmance of the common law, and that every private person
may by the common law arrest any suspicious night-walker,
and detain him till he give a good account of himself "); 1 E.
East, Pleas of the Crown, ch. 5, $ 70, p. 303 (1803) ("It is said
. . . that every private person may by the common law arrest
any suspicious night-walker, and detain him till he give a
good account of himself "); see also M. Dalton, The Country

Justice, ch. 104, pp. 352-353 (1727); A. Costello, Our PoliceProtectors: History of the New York Police 25 (1885) (citing

1681 New York City regulation); 2 Perpetual Laws of Massa-chusetts 1788-1798, ch. 82, $ 2, p. 410 (1797 Massachusetts
statute).I am unaware, however, of any precedent for a physical
search of a person thus temporarily detained for question-ing. Sometimes, of course, the temporary detention of a
suspicious character would be elevated to a full custodialarrest on probable cause--as, for instance, when a suspect
was unable to provide a sufficient accounting of himself. At
that point, it is clear that the common law would permit notjust a protective "frisk," but a full physical search incident

to the arrest. When, however, the detention did not rise tothe level of a full-blown arrest (and was not supported by
the degree of cause needful for that purpose), there appearsto be no clear support at common law for physically searching the suspect. See Warner, The Uniform Arrest Act, 28Va. L. Rev. 315, 324 (1942) ("At common law, if a watchman
came upon a suspiciously acting nightwalker, he might arresthim and then search him for weapons, but he had no right to
search before arrest"); Williams, Police Detention and ArrestPrivileges--England, 51 J. Crim. L., C. & P. S. 413, 418 (1960)
("Where a suspected criminal is also suspected of being of-fensively armed, can the police search him for arms, by tapping his pockets, before making up their minds whether toarrest him? There is no English authority . . .").

I frankly doubt, moreover, whether the fiercely proud menwho adopted our Fourth Amendment would have allowed
themselves to be subjected, on mere suspicion of beingarmed and dangerous, to such indignity--which is described
as follows in a police manual:

"Check the subject's neck and collar. A check shouldbe made under the subject's arm. Next a check should

be made of the upper back. The lower back should alsobe checked.

508us2$85D 02-13-97 18:09:52 PAGES OPINPGT
382 MINNESOTA v. DICKERSON

Scalia, J., concurring
"A check should be made of the upper part of theman's chest and the lower region around the stomach.

The belt, a favorite concealment spot, should be checked.The inside thigh and crotch area also should be searched.
The legs should be checked for possible weapons. Thelast items to be checked are the shoes and cuffs of the
subject." J. Moynahan, Police Searching Procedures 7(1963) (citations omitted).

On the other hand, even if a "frisk" prior to arrest wouldhave been considered impermissible in 1791, perhaps it
was considered permissible by 1868, when the FourteenthAmendment (the basis for applying the Fourth Amendment
to the States) was adopted. Or perhaps it is only since thattime that concealed weapons capable of harming the interrogator quickly and from beyond arm's reach have becomecommon--which might alter the judgment of what is "reasonable" under the original standard. But technologicalchanges were no more discussed in Terry than was the original state of the law.If I were of the view that Terry was (insofar as the power
to "frisk" is concerned) incorrectly decided, I might--even ifI felt bound to adhere to that case--vote to exclude the evidence incidentally discovered, on the theory that half a con-stitutional guarantee is better than none. I might also vote
to exclude it if I agreed with the original-meaning-is-irrelevant, good-policy-is-constitutional-law school of jurisprudence that the Terry opinion represents. As a policymatter, it may be desirable to

permit "frisks" for weapons,but not to encourage "frisks" for drugs by admitting evidence other than weapons.I adhere to original meaning, however. And though I do
not favor the mode of analysis in Terry, I cannot say thatits result was wrong. Constitutionality of the "frisk" in the
present case was neither challenged nor argued. Assuming,therefore, that the search was lawful, I agree with the
Court's premise that any evidence incidentally discovered in

the course of it would be admissible, and join the Court'sopinion in its entirety.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dis-senting in part.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. Unlike theCourt, however, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Minnesota and remand the case to that court forfurther proceedings.

The Court, correctly in my view, states that "the disposi-tive question before this Court is whether the officer who
conducted the search was acting within the lawful boundsmarked by Terry [v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968),] at the time he
gained probable cause to believe that the lump in respond-ent's jacket was contraband." Ante, at 377. The Court
then goes on to point out that the state trial court did notmake precise findings on this point, but accepts the appellate
findings made by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. I be-lieve that these findings, like those of the trial court, are
imprecise and not directed expressly to the question of theofficer's probable cause to believe that the lump was contraband. Because the Supreme Court of Minnesota employeda Fourth Amendment analysis which differs significantly
from that now adopted by this Court, I would vacate itsjudgment and remand the case for further proceedings there
in the light of this Court's opinion.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-2024. Argued February 24, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
New York law authorizes local school boards to adopt reasonable regulations permitting the after-hours use of school property for 10 specified
purposes, not including meetings for religious purposes. Pursuant to
this law, respondent school board (District) issued rules and regulations
allowing, inter alia, social, civic, and recreational uses of its schools
(Rule 10), but prohibiting use by any group for religious purposes (Rule
7). After the District refused two requests by petitioners, an evangelical church and its pastor (Church), to use school facilities for a religious
oriented film series on family values and child rearing on the ground
that the film series appeared to be church related, the Church filed suit
in the District Court, claiming that the District's actions violated,
among other things, the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech Clause.
The court granted summary judgment to the District, and the Court of
Appeals affirmed. It reasoned that the school property, as a "limited
public forum" open only for designated purposes, remained nonpublic
except for the specified purposes, and ruled that the exclusion of the
Church's film was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.

Held: Denying the Church access to school premises to exhibit the film

series violates the Freedom of Speech Clause. Pp. 390-397.

(a) There is no question that the District may legally preserve the
property under its control and need not have permitted after-hours use
for any of the uses permitted under state law. This Court need not
address the issue whether Rule 10, by opening the property to a wide
variety of communicative purposes, has opened the property for religious uses, because, even if the District has not opened its property for
such uses, Rule 7 has been unconstitutionally applied in this case. Access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter or speaker
identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable and viewpoint
neutral. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Ed. Fund, Inc., 473
U. S. 788, 806. That Rule 7 treats all religions and religious purposes
alike does not make its application in this case viewpoint neutral, however, for it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint by permitting school
property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues
and child rearing except those dealing with the subject from a religious

standpoint. Denial on this basis is plainly invalid under the holding in
Cornelius, supra, at 806, that the government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of
view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject. Pp. 390-394.

(b) Permitting District property to be used to exhibit the film series
would not have been an establishment of religion under the three-part
test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602. Since the series
would not have been shown during school hours, would not have been
sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, there
would be no realistic danger that the community would think that the
District was endorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit
to religion or the Church would have been incidental. Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 271-272. Nor is there anything in the record to
support the claim that the exclusion was justified on the ground that
allowing access to a "radical" church would lead to threats of public
unrest and violence. In addition, the Court of Appeals' judgment was
not based on the justification proffered here that the access rules' purpose is to promote the interests of the general public rather than sectarian or other private interests. Moreover, that there was no express
finding below that the Church's application would have been granted
absent the religious connection is beside the point for the purposes of
this opinion, which is concerned with the validity of the stated reason
for denying the application, namely, that the film series appeared to be
church related. Pp. 395-397.

Opinion of the Court
on school property because "[r]eligious purposes are not in-cluded in the enumerated purposes for which a school may

be used under section 414." In Deeper Life Christian Fel-lowship, Inc. v. Sobol, 948 F. 2d 79, 83-84 (1991), the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted Trietley as anauthoritative interpretation of state law. Furthermore, the
Attorney General of New York supports Trietley as an ap-propriate approach to deciding this case.

Pursuant to $ 414's empowerment of local school districts,the Board of Center Moriches Union Free School District
(District) has issued rules and regulations with respect tothe use of school property when not in use for school purposes. The rules allow only 2 of the 10 purposes authorizedby $ 414: social, civic, or recreational uses (Rule 10) and use
by political organizations if secured in compliance with $ 414(Rule 8). Rule 7, however, consistent with the judicial interpretation of state law, provides that "[t]he school premisesshall not be used by any group for religious purposes."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.The issue in this case is whether, against this background
of state law, it violates the Free Speech Clause of the FirstAmendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, to deny a church access to school prem-ises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious
purposes, a film series dealing with family and child-rearingissues faced by parents today.

chure provided on request of the District identified Dr. Dob-son as a licensed psychologist, former associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California,best-selling author, and radio commentator. The brochure
stated that the film series would discuss Dr. Dobson's viewson the undermining influences of the media that could only
be counterbalanced by returning to traditional, Christianfamily values instilled at an early stage. The brochure went
on to describe the contents of each of the six parts of theseries.

3 The District denied the first application, saying

period one year beginning in the next month. 959 F. 2d 381, 383 (CA2
1992). Within a few days the District wrote petitioners that the application "requesting use of the high school for your Sunday services" was
denied, citing both N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414 and the District's Rule 7 barring
uses for religious purposes. The Church did not challenge this denial in
the courts and the validity of this denial is not before us.

3 "Turn Your Heart Toward Home is available now in a series of six

discussion-provoking films:

"1) A FATHER LOOKS BACK emphasizes how swiftly time passes and
appeals to all parents to `turn their hearts toward home' during the allimportant child-rearing years. (60 minutes.)

"2) POWER IN PARENTING: THE YOUNG CHILD begins by exploring the inherent nature of power, and offers many practical helps for
facing the battlegrounds in child-rearing--bedtime, mealtime and other
confrontations so familiar to parents. Dr. Dobson also takes a look at
areas of conflict in marriage and other adult relationships. (60 minutes.)

"3) POWER IN PARENTING: THE ADOLESCENT discusses father/
daughter and mother/son relationships, and the importance of allowing
children to grow to develop as individuals. Dr. Dobson also encourages
parents to free themselves of undeserved guilt when their teenagers
choose to rebel. (45 minutes.)

"4) THE FAMILY UNDER FIRE views the family in the context of
today's society, where a "civil war of values" is being waged. Dr. Dobson
urges parents to look at the effects of governmental interference, abortion
and pornography, and to get involved. To preserve what they care about
most--their own families! (52 minutes.)

Note: This film contains explicit information regarding the pornography industry. Not recommended for young audiences.

"5) OVERCOMING A PAINFUL CHILDHOOD includes Shirley
Dobson's intimate memories of a difficult childhood with her alcoholic

that "[t]his film does appear to be church related and therefore your request must be refused." App. 84. The second
application for permission to use school premises for showing
the film series, which described it as a "Family oriented
movie--from a Christian perspective," id., at 91, was denied
using identical language.

The Church brought suit in the District Court, challenging
the denial as a violation of the Freedom of Speech and Assembly Clauses, the Free Exercise Clause, and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as well as the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As
to each cause of action, the Church alleged that the actions
were undertaken under color of state law, in violation of 42
U. S. C. $ 1983. The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, rejecting all the Church's claims.
With respect to the free-speech claim under the First
Amendment, the District Court characterized the District's
facilities as a "limited public forum." The court noted that
the enumerated purposes for which $ 414 allowed access to
school facilities did not include religious worship or instruction, that Rule 7 explicitly proscribes using school facilities
for religious purposes, and that the Church had conceded
that its showing of the film series would be for religious purposes. 770 F. Supp. 91, 92, 98-99 (EDNY 1991). The District Court stated that once a limited public forum is opened
to a particular type of speech, selectively denying access to
other activities of the same genre is forbidden. Id., at 99.
Noting that the District had not opened its facilities to orgafather. Mrs. Dobson recalls the influences which brought her to a loving
God who saw her personal circumstances and heard her cries for help.

"6) THE HERITAGE presents Dr. Dobson's powerful closing remarks.
Here he speaks clearly and convincingly of our traditional values which,
if properly employed and defended, can assure happy, healthy, strengthened homes and family relationships in the years to come. (60 minutes.)"

Opinion of the Court

nizations similar to Lamb's Chapel for religious purposes, theDistrict Court held that the denial in this case was viewpoint

neutral and, hence, not a violation of the Freedom of SpeechClause. Ibid. The District Court also rejected the assertion by the Church that denying its application demonstrateda hostility to religion and advancement of nonreligion not
justified under the Establishment of Religion Clause of theFirst Amendment. 736 F. Supp. 1247, 1253 (1990).

The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Dis-trict Court "in all respects." 959 F. 2d 381, 389 (CA2 1992).
It held that the school property, when not in use for schoolpurposes, was neither a traditional nor a designated public
forum; rather, it was a limited public forum open only fordesignated purposes, a classification that "allows it to remain
non-public except as to specified uses." Id., at 386. Thecourt observed that exclusions in such a forum need only be
reasonable and viewpoint neutral, ibid., and ruled that deny-ing access to the Church for the purpose of showing its film
did not violate this standard. Because the holding belowwas questionable under our decisions, we granted the petition for certiorari, 506 U. S. 813 (1992), which in principalpart challenged the holding below as contrary to the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment.4

violated the Establishment Clause because it and Rule 7's categorical refusal to permit District property to be used for religious purposes demonstrate hostility to religion. Because we reverse on another ground, we
need not decide what merit this submission might have.

Spock, 424 U. S. 828, 836 (1976); Adderley v. Florida, 385
U. S. 39, 47 (1966). It is also common ground that the
District need not have permitted after-hours use of its property for any of the uses permitted by N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414.
The District, however, did open its property for 2 of the 10
uses permitted by $ 414. The Church argued below that because under Rule 10 of the rules issued by the District,
school property could be used for "social, civic, and recreational" purposes, the District had opened its property for
such a wide variety of communicative purposes that restrictions on communicative uses of the property were subject to
the same constitutional limitations as restrictions in traditional public forums such as parks and sidewalks. Hence,
its view was that subject matter or speaker exclusions on
District property were required to be justified by a compelling state interest and to be narrowly drawn to achieve that
end. See Perry, supra, at 45; Cornelius, supra, at 800.
Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected
this submission, which is also presented to this Court.
The argument has considerable force, for the District's property is heavily used by a wide variety of private organizations, including some that presented a "close question,"
which the Court of Appeals resolved in the District's favor,
as to whether the District had in fact already opened its
property for religious uses. 959 F. 2d, at 387.5 We need

The Church claimed that the first three uses listed above demonstrated
that Rule 10 actually permitted the District property to be used for religious purposes as well as a great assortment of other uses. The first item
listed is particularly interesting and relevant to the issue before us. The
District Court referred to this item as "a lecture series by the Mind Center, purportedly a New Age religious group." Id., at 93. The Court of
Appeals described it as follows:

"The lecture series, `Psychology and The Unknown,' by Jerry Huck, was
sponsored by the Center Moriches Free Public Library. The library's
newsletter characterized Mr. Huck as a psychotherapist who would discuss
such topics as parapsychology, transpersonal psychology, physics and
metaphysics in his 4-night series of lectures. Mr. Huck testified that he
lectured principally on parapsychology, which he defined by `reference to
the human unconscious, the mind, the unconscious emotional system or
the body system.' When asked whether his lecture involved matters of
both a spiritual and a scientific nature, Mr. Huck responded: `It was all
science. Anything I speak on based on parapsychology, analytic, quantum
physicists [sic].' Although some incidental reference to religious matters
apparently was made in the lectures, Mr. Huck himself characterized such
matters as `a fascinating sideline' and `not the purpose of the [lecture].' "

light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpointneutral."

Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 806, citing Perry Education Assn., supra, at 49. The Court of Appeals appearedto recognize that the total ban on using District property

for religious purposes could survive First Amendment challenge only if excluding this category of speech was reason-able and viewpoint neutral. The court's conclusion in this

case was that Rule 7 met this test. We cannot agree withthis holding, for Rule 7 was unconstitutionally applied in
this case.6The Court of Appeals thought that the application of Rule
7 in this case was viewpoint neutral because it had been, andwould be, applied in the same way to all uses of school property for religious purposes. That all religions and all usesfor religious purposes are treated alike under Rule 7, however, does not answer the critical question whether it dis-criminates on the basis of viewpoint to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family
issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.

There is no suggestion from the courts below or from the
District or the State that a lecture or film about child rearing
and family values would not be a use for social or civic purposes otherwise permitted by Rule 10. That subject matter
is not one that the District has placed off limits to any and
all speakers. Nor is there any indication in the record before us that the application to exhibit the particular film series involved here was, or would have been, denied for any
reason other than the fact that the presentation would have

6 Although the Court of Appeals apparently held that Rule 7 was reasonable as well as viewpoint neutral, the court uttered not a word in support
of its reasonableness holding. If Rule 7 were to be held unreasonable, it
could be held facially invalid, that is, it might be held that the rule could in
no circumstances be applied to religious speech or religious communicative
conduct. In view of our disposition of this case, we need not pursue this
issue.

Opinion of the Court

been from a religious perspective. In our view, denial onthat basis was plainly invalid under our holding in

Cornelius,
supra, at 806, that

"[a]lthough a speaker may be excluded from a nonpublic
forum if he wishes to address a topic not encompassedwithin the purpose of the forum . . . or if he is not a

member of the class of speakers for whose especial bene-fit the forum was created . . . , the government violates

the First Amendment when it denies access to a speakersolely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an
otherwise includible subject."
The film series involved here no doubt dealt with a subject
otherwise permissible under Rule 10, and its exhibition wasdenied solely because the series dealt with the subject from

a religious standpoint. The principle that has emerged from
our cases "is that the First Amendment forbids the govern-ment to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints

or ideas at the expense of others." City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 804 (1984).
That principle applies in the circumstances of this case; asJudge Posner said for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh

Circuit, to discriminate "against a particular point of view. . . would . . . flunk the test . . . [of]

Cornelius, provided that
the defendants have no defense based on the establishment
clause." May v. Evansville-Vanderburgh School Corp., 787F. 2d 1105, 1114 (1986).

The District, as a respondent, would save its judgmentbelow on the ground that to permit its property to be used
for religious purposes would be an establishment of religion
forbidden by the First Amendment. This Court suggested
in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 271 (1981), that the interest of the State in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation "may be [a] compelling" one justifying an abridgment
of free speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment;
but the Court went on to hold that permitting use of univer508us2$86D 02-13-97 18:27:22 PAGES OPINPGT

395Cite as: 508 U. S. 384 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
sity property for religious purposes under the open access
policy involved there would not be incompatible with the
Court's Establishment Clause cases.

We have no more trouble than did the Widmar Court in
disposing of the claimed defense on the ground that the posited fears of an Establishment Clause violation are unfounded. The showing of this film series would not have
been during school hours, would not have been sponsored
by the school, and would have been open to the public, not
just to church members. The District property had repeatedly been used by a wide variety of private organizations.
Under these circumstances, as in Widmar, there would have
been no realistic danger that the community would think
that the District was endorsing religion or any particular
creed, and any benefit to religion or to the Church would
have been no more than incidental. As in Widmar, supra,
at 271-272, permitting District property to be used to exhibit
the film series involved in this case would not have been an
establishment of religion under the three-part test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971): The challenged governmental action has a secular purpose, does not
have the principal or primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, and does not foster an excessive entanglement
with religion.7

The District also submits that it justifiably denied use of
its property to a "radical" church for the purpose of proselytizing, since to do so would lead to threats of public unrest
and even violence. Brief for Respondent Center Moriches

7 While we are somewhat diverted by Justice Scalia's evening at the
cinema, post, at 398-399, we return to the reality that there is a proper
way to inter an established decision and Lemon, however frightening it
might be to some, has not been overruled. This case, like Corporation of
Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U. S. 327 (1987), presents no occasion to do so. Justice Scalia apparently was less haunted by the ghosts of the living when he joined the
opinion of the Court in that case.

UNION FREE SCHOOL DIST.

Opinion of the Court

Union Free School District et al. 4-5, 11-12, 24. There is
nothing in the record to support such a justification, which
in any event would be difficult to defend as a reason to deny
the presentation of a religious point of view about a subject the District otherwise opens to discussion on District
property.

We note that the New York State Attorney General, a respondent here, does not rely on either the Establishment
Clause or possible danger to the public peace in supporting
the judgment below. Rather, he submits that the exclusion
is justified because the purpose of the access rules is to promote the interests of the public in general rather than sectarian or other private interests. In light of the variety of
the uses of District property that have been permitted under
Rule 10, this approach has its difficulties. This is particularly so since Rule 10 states that District property may be
used for social, civic, or recreational use "only if it can be
non-exclusive and open to all residents of the school district
that form a homogeneous group deemed relevant to the
event." App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. At least arguably, the
Rule does not require that permitted uses need be open to
the public at large. However that may be, this was not the
basis of the judgment that we are reviewing. The Court of
Appeals, as we understand it, ruled that because the District
had the power to permit or exclude certain subject matters,
it was entitled to deny use for any religious purpose, including the purpose in this case. The Attorney General also defends this as a permissible subject-matter exclusion rather
than a denial based on viewpoint, a submission that we have
already rejected.

The Attorney General also argues that there is no express
finding below that the Church's application would have been
granted absent the religious connection. This fact is beside
the point for the purposes of this opinion, which is concerned
with the validity of the stated reason for denying the

Church's application, namely, that the film series sought tobe shown "appeared to be church related."

For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of theCourt of Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

Given the issues presented as well as the apparent
unanimity of our conclusion that this overt, viewpoint-baseddiscrimination contradicts the Free Speech Clause of the

First Amendment and that there has been no substantialshowing of a potential Establishment Clause violation, I
agree with Justice Scalia that the Court's citation of
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), is unsettling and
unnecessary. The same can be said of the Court's use of the
phrase "endorsing religion," see ante, at 395, which, as Ihave indicated elsewhere, cannot suffice as a rule of decision

consistent with our precedents and our traditions in this part
of our jurisprudence. See Allegheny County v. American
Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S.
573, 655 (1989) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and

part and concur in the judgment.

I join the Court's conclusion that the District's refusal to
allow use of school facilities for petitioners' film viewing,
while generally opening the schools for community activities,
violates petitioners' First Amendment free-speech rights
(as does N. Y. Educ. Law $ 414 (McKinney 1988 and Supp.
1993), to the extent it compelled the District's denial, see
ante, at 386-387). I also agree with the Court that allowing

danger" of a violation of the Establishment Clause, ante, at

395, but I cannot accept most of its reasoning in this regard.The Court explains that the showing of petitioners' film

on school property after school hours would not cause thecommunity to "think that the District was endorsing religion
or any particular creed," and further notes that access to
school property would not violate the three-part test articu-lated in

Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). Ante,
at 395.As to the Court's invocation of the

Lemon test: Like some
ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up inits grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed

and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence once again, frightening the little children and
school attorneys of Center Moriches Union Free School
District. Its most recent burial, only last Term, was, to
be sure, not fully six feet under: Our decision in Lee v.
Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 586-587 (1992), conspicuously
avoided using the supposed "test" but also declined the
invitation to repudiate it. Over the years, however, no
fewer than five of the currently sitting Justices have, in
their own opinions, personally driven pencils through the
creature's heart (the author of today's opinion repeatedly),
and a sixth has joined an opinion doing so. See, e. g.,
Weisman, supra, at 644 (Scalia, J., joined by, inter alios,
Thomas, J., dissenting); Allegheny County v. American
Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492

Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 820 (1973) (White, J.,
dissenting).

The secret of the Lemon test's survival, I think, is that itis so easy to kill. It is there to scare us (and our audience)

when we wish it to do so, but we can command it to returnto the tomb at will. See,

e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.
668, 679 (1984) (noting instances in which Court has notapplied

Lemon test). When we wish to strike down a practice it forbids, we invoke it, see, e. g., Aguilar v. Felton, 473
U. S. 402 (1985) (striking down state remedial education
program administered in part in parochial schools); when
we wish to uphold a practice it forbids, we ignore it entirely,
see Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983) (upholding
state legislative chaplains). Sometimes, we take a middle
course, calling its three prongs "no more than helpful signposts," Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 741 (1973). Such a
docile and useful monster is worth keeping around, at least
in a somnolent state; one never knows when one might
need him.

For my part, I agree with the long list of constitutional
scholars who have criticized Lemon and bemoaned the
strange Establishment Clause geometry of crooked lines
and wavering shapes its intermittent use has produced.
See, e. g., Choper, The Establishment Clause and Aid to
Parochial Schools--An Update, 75 Calif. L. Rev. 5 (1987);
Marshall, "We Know It When We See It": The Supreme
Court and Establishment, 59 S. Cal. L. Rev. 495 (1986);

dates or invalidates the government action in question--andtherefore cannot join the opinion of the Court today.*

I cannot join for yet another reason: the Court's statementthat the proposed use of the school's facilities is constitutional because (among other things) it would not signal en-dorsement of religion in general.

not the view of those who adopted our Constitution, whobelieved that the public virtues inculcated by religion are a

public good. It suffices to point out that during the summerof 1789, when it was in the process of drafting the First
Amendment, Congress enacted the Northwest TerritoryOrdinance that the Confederation Congress had adopted in
1787--Article III of which provides: "Religion, morality, andknowledge,

being necessary to good government and thehappiness of mankind, schools and the means of education

shall forever be encouraged." Unsurprisingly, then, indif-ference to "religion in general" is not what our cases, both
old and recent, demand. See, e. g., Zorach v. Clauson, 343U. S. 306, 313-314 (1952) ("When the state encourages reli*The Court correctly notes, ante, at 395, n. 7, that I joined the opinion

focused on that test, which had been the exclusive basis for the lower
court's judgment. Here, of course, the lower court did not mention
Lemon, and indeed did not even address any Establishment Clause argument on behalf of respondents. Thus, the Court is ultimately correct that

avoid Lemon there, as it is unnecessary to inject Lemon here.

GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL et al. v. SHALALA,

SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 91-2079. Argued March 22, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1395f(b)(1) requires the Secretary of Health and Human

Services to reimburse the lesser of the "customary charges" or the "reasonable cost[s]" of providers of health care services to Medicare beneficiaries, while $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) empowers the Secretary to issue regulations setting forth the methods to be used in computing reasonable
costs, which may include the establishment of appropriate cost limits.
Regulations issued pursuant to that authority impose such limits based
on a range of factors designed to approximate the cost of providing
general routine patient service, but permit various exceptions, exemptions, and adjustments to the limits. After their costs during the relevant period exceeded the corresponding cost limits, petitioner providers
filed an administrative appeal challenging the limits' validity. In ruling
for petitioners on expedited review, the District Court adopted their
interpretation that $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) (clause (ii))--which requires the
regulations to "provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective
adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the
aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining
costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive"--entitled them to
reimbursement of all costs they could show to be reasonable, regardless
of whether the costs surpassed the amount calculated under the regulations' cost limit schedule. In reversing, the Court of Appeals reasoned
that petitioners' request for adjustments would amount to a retroactive
change in the methods used to compute costs that would be invalid
under Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204. Instead, the
court adopted the Secretary's interpretation that clause (ii) permits only
a year-end book balancing to reconcile the actual "reasonable" costs
under the regulations with the interim, advance payments that the statute requires to be made during the year based on the provider's approximate, anticipatory estimates of what its reimbursable costs will be.

Held: Clause (ii) does not require the Secretary to afford petitioners an

opportunity to establish that they are entitled to reimbursement for
costs in excess of the limits stated in the regulations. Pp. 409-420.

(a) Clause (ii)'s language does not itself clearly settle the matter at
issue, but is ambiguous as to which of the parties' interpretations is
correct. Pp. 409-412.

(b) While Georgetown, supra, eliminated across-the-board retroactive
rulemaking from the scope of clause (ii), it did not foreclose either of
the parties' interpretations of the statute. Pp. 412-414.

(c) Confronted with an ambiguous statutory provision, this Court
generally will defer to a permissible interpretation espoused by the
agency entrusted with its implementation, particularly when the
agency's construction is contemporaneous. By providing in more than
one instance for the year-end book-balancing adjustment that, in the
Secretary's view, is mandated by clause (ii), regulations promulgated
soon after Medicare's enactment support the Secretary's current approach. On the other hand, those regulations nowhere mentioned a
mechanism for implementing the kind of substantive recalculation and
deviation from approved methods suggested by petitioners. Moreover,
the agency's development--and continued augmentation--of the various
exceptions, exemptions, and adjustments to the cost limits is difficult to
harmonize with an interpretation of clause (ii) that would give a provider the right to contest the application of any particular and statutorily authorized method to its own circumstances. Rather, it is consistent with a view that the cost limits by definition entailed generalizations
that would benefit some subscribers while harming others, and with a
desire to refine these approximations through the Secretary's creation
of exceptions and exemptions. Pp. 414-416.

(d) The Court rejects petitioners' argument that any deference to the
agency's current position is precluded by the fact that, over the years,
the agency has shifted from a book-balancing approach to a retroactive
rulemaking approach and then back again. The Secretary responds
that such inconsistency is attributable to the lower courts' erroneous
interpretations of clause (ii) and points out that the agency returned to
its initial position following Georgetown. How much weight should be
given to the agency's views in such a situation will depend on the facts
of individual cases. Cf. Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 37. Pp. 416-417.

(e) In the circumstances of this case, the Court defers to the Secretary's interpretation of clause (ii). Her restrictive reading of the clause
is at least as plausible as petitioners', closely fits the design of the statute as a whole and its objects and policy, and does not exceed her statutory authority, but comports with $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)'s broad delegation to
her. Pp. 417-420.

952 F. 2d 1017, affirmed.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
As a means of providing health care to the aged and dis-abled, Congress enacted the Medicare program in 1965. See

Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 291, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1395

et seq. Under the program, pro-viders of health care services can enter into agreements with

the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant towhich they are reimbursed for certain costs associated with
the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. To operate theprogram, the Secretary issued regulations imposing limits on
the amount of repayment based on a range of factors de-signed to approximate the cost of providing general routine
patient service. The question before us is whether the Sec-retary must afford the six petitioning hospitals an opportunity to establish that they are entitled to reimbursement forcosts in excess of such limits.

Opinion of the Court
ground to this case. To begin, Congress has required theSecretary to repay the lesser of the "reasonable cost" or

"customary charg[e]." See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395f(b)(1). Ratherthan attempt to define "reasonable cost" with precision, Congress empowered the Secretary to issue appropriate regula-tions setting forth the methods to be used in computing such
costs. See $ 1395x(v)(1)(A).1Prior to 1972, the Secretary's regulations contemplated reimbursement of the entirety of a provider's services to Medi-care patients unless its costs were found to be "substantially
out of line" with those of similar institutions. See, e. g., 20CFR $ 405.451(c) (1967).

2 In 1972, apparently fueled by concern that providers were passing on inefficient and excessiveexpenses, see H. R. Rep. No. 92-231, pp. 82-85 (1971); S. Rep.

No. 92-1230, pp. 188-189 (1972), Congress amended the stat-ute to specify that "reasonable costs" meant only those "actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurredcost[s] found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of
needed health services," 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A), and toauthorize the Secretary--as part of the "methods" of determining costs--to establish appropriate cost limits, see ibid.Accordingly, the Secretary promulgated regulations, updated yearly and establishing routine cost limits based onfactors such as the type of health care provider (hospital,
skilled nursing facility, etc.), type of services it rendered, itsgeographical location, size, and mix of patients treated. See

1 Section 1395x(v)(1)(A) provides in pertinent part that the Secretary
"shall" determine reasonable costs "in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in
determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services."

2 Regulations regarding the determination of reimbursable costs were

originally codified at 20 CFR $$ 405.401-405.454 (1967). They have twice
been redesignated, first in 1977, at 42 CFR pt. 405, see 42 Fed. Reg. 52826
(1977), and then in 1986, at 42 CFR pt. 413, see 51 Fed. Reg. 34790 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
20 CFR $ 405.460 (1975). Hospitals are divided in terms ofbed size, and of whether they are urban--i. e., located in a

Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)--or rural.As of 1979, the labor-related component of provider costs was
to be determined by a wage index keyed to the hospital'slocation. See,

e. g., 46 Fed. Reg. 33637 (1981).The regulations generally provide that reimbursable costs

must be within the cost limits. The regulations also allowfor adjustments to the limits as applied to a provider's
particular claim. A provider classified as a rural hospi-tal can apply for reclassification as an urban one. 42 CFR

$ 413.30(d) (1992). An exemption from the applicable costlimits can be obtained under certain specified situations--
e. g., when excess expenses are due to "extraordinary circum-stances," or when the provider is the sole hospital in a community, a new provider, or a rural hospital with fewer than50 beds. $ 413.30(e). In addition, exceptions are available
for, inter alia, "atypical services," extraordinary circum-stances beyond the provider's control, unusual labor costs, or
essential community services. $ 413.30(f ).3Two statutory provisions are of central importance to this
litigation. First, apparently to protect providers' liquidity,the statute contemplates a system of interim, advance payments during the year. Specifically, the Secretary "shall pe-riodically determine the amount which should be paid . . .
and the provider of services shall be paid, at such time ortimes as the Secretary believes appropriate (but not less
often than monthly) . . . the amounts so determined, with

3 Congress substantially modified the payment system by instituting the
Prospective Payment System (PPS), effective October 1, 1983. Under
this new system, providers are reimbursed a fixed amount for each discharge, based on the patient's diagnosis, and regardless of actual cost.
See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(d). Because the providers' claims in this litigation involve costs incurred from 1980 to 1983, PPS is not at issue. Moreover, PPS does not apply to skilled nursing facilities or home health
agencies, nor does it apply to all hospitals. See $$ 1395ww(d), (b); 42
CFR $$ 412.22-412.23 (1992).

necessary adjustments on account of previously madeoverpayments or underpayments." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395g(a).

These interim payments by definition are only approximateones, based on the provider's preaudit, estimated costs of
anticipated services. See 42 CFR $$ 413.64(e), (f) (1992).Second, the regulations were required to "provide for the
making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where,for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate
reimbursement produced by the methods of determiningcosts proves to be either inadequate or excessive." 42
U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) (clause (ii)).

B
Petitioners are six Nebraska hospitals certified as "pro-viders" of health care services and classified as "rural" for

Medicare purposes. Between 1980 and 1984, their costsexceeded the corresponding cost limits. Pursuant to 42
U. S. C. $ 1395oo, they filed an appeal to the Provider Reim-bursement Review Board (PRRB) in which they challenged
the validity of the applicable cost limits on two grounds.First, they claimed that the wage index that was used to
calculate reasonable cost of labor did not account for the useof part-time employees. Because petitioners used a greater
proportion of part-time employees than the national average,this had the effect of artificially lowering their index values.
In support of their claim, they pointed to Congress' decisionin 1983 ordering the Secretary to conduct a wage index
study to consider the distortion due to part-time employ-ment, Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1984, Pub. L. 98-369, $ 2316(a), 98 Stat. 1081, fol-lowed by the Secretary's own revision of the wage index in
1986 which accounted for part-time employees, 51 Fed. Reg.16772 (1986), and to Congress' directive that the revised
index be applied to discharges occurring after May 1, 1986,Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments
of 1985, Pub. L. 99-272, $ 9103(a), 100 Stat. 156. Second,

Opinion of the Court
they asserted that under the cost limits a rural hospital couldnot show that it incurred the same wage costs as its urban

counterparts when in fact its location next to urban hospitalsforced it to compete for employees by offering equivalent
compensation. Petitioners also complained that the costlimits were applied conclusively rather than presumptively.
Invoking clause (ii), which provides for "suitable retroactivecorrective adjustments," they argued that they were entitled
to reimbursement of all costs they could show to be reason-able, even if they were in excess of the applicable cost limit.

4

Because the PRRB believed that it lacked the authority toaward the desired relief, it granted petitioners' request for

expedited judicial review. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395oo(f )(1). Ad-hering to the Eighth Circuit's decision in

St. Paul-RamseyMedical Center v. Bowen, 816 F. 2d 417 (1987), the District

Court ruled for petitioners, holding that clause (ii) compelledthe Secretary to reimburse all costs shown to be reasonable,
regardless of whether they surpassed the amount calculatedunder the cost limit schedule.

5

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitreversed.

Good Samaritan Hospital v. Sullivan, 952 F. 2d1017 (1991). The court relied on our decision in Bowen v.

Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204 (1988), in whichwe held that clause (ii) does not permit retroactive rulemaking. 952 F. 2d, at 1023. It reasoned that petitioners'request for adjustments to correct "inequalities in the system . . . would amount to a retroactive change in the methodsused to compute costs that, after

Georgetown, is invalid."Id., at 1024. Instead, the Court of Appeals adopted the Secretary's more modest view of clause (ii) as permitting only a"year-end book balancing of the monthly installments" with

rural/urban classifications were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the

the amount determined to be "reasonable" under the applica-ble regulations. Ibid. Under this approach, clause (ii) establishes the mechanism through which the total of the in-terim payments extended pursuant to $ 1395g (which merely
purport to be estimates of actual costs) are reconciled withthe postaudit amounts determined at year's end to be owed

Opinion of the Court
the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustmentswhere, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the

aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of deter-mining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive."
Petitioners argue that the mandate is clear: The methods for
determining reasonable costs having been determined pursu-ant to $ 1395x(v)(1)(A), clause (ii) must be read to mean that

such methods nonetheless might yield "inadequate or exces-sive" amounts in any particular instance. Where such is the
case, it is submitted, the clause mandates a correction thatwill provide full reimbursement for reasonable costs.

In contrast, the Secretary asserts that the "aggregate reimbursement" refers to the sum total of the interim payments made pursuant to $ 1395g. These payments are, of
course, based on the methods chosen by the Secretary to
determine reasonable costs, but they are only anticipatory
estimates of what the providers' reimbursable costs will be,
made before all relevant data are available. At year's end,
when the provider's reimbursable costs for services actually
provided during that year are on hand, the preaudit "aggregate" of the interim payments can be compared to the postaudit amounts due under the methods. Because the interim
payments might have been erroneously calculated, their total
might not match amounts owed, and adjustments must be
performed to reconcile the two. See 42 CFR $$ 413.64(e),
(f) (1992).

In our view, the language of clause (ii) does not itself
clearly settle the issue before us. The clause is ambiguous
in two respects. First, the "aggregate reimbursement
produced by the methods of determining costs" could mean
either (in petitioners' view) the amount due given proper
application of the Secretary's regulations, or (in the Secretary's view) the total of the interim payments, themselves
derived from application of the methods to rough, incomplete
data. Second, the clause refers to "inadequate" and "excessive" reimbursements, but without at any point stating the

Opinion of the Court
standard against which inadequacy or excessiveness is to bemeasured. Petitioners contend that the implicit referent

must be the reasonable costs as established by the providers,without regard to the methods; the Secretary concludes that
it must be the reasonable costs as determined by the agencyapplying the methods.

Each of the conflicting constructions is plausible but eachhas its difficulty. Petitioners contend that although the interim reimbursements might lead to inaccurate repayments,they are not part of the methods of determining

costs towhich $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) refers, but rather are payment methods governed by $ 1395g. Moreover, the book-balancing rolethe Secretary would have us assign to clause (ii) arguably
is already performed by $ 1395g, which mandates periodicreimbursement "prior to audit or settlement by the General
Accounting Office . . . with necessary adjustments on accountof previously made overpayments or underpayments." The
Secretary counters that, while clause (ii) is directed at year-end adjustments and designed to ensure that providers are
reimbursed their reasonable costs, $ 1395g addresses periodicadjustments to be made during the course of the fiscal year;

$ 1395g thus has its own role to play and is not surplusage.8The Secretary also argues that words such as "corrective"
and "adjustments" more readily evoke the simple mathemati-cal rectifications that she contemplates than the complex
process of revisiting applicable methods and comparing theamounts paid with an ill-defined standard of "reasonable"
costs that is called for by petitioners' approach.9 It is true

8 The Secretary observes, however, that had clause (ii) not been enacted,
"the authority for some similar year-end mechanism might have been inferred under the Act as a whole, including 42 U. S. C. [$ ]1395g." Brief
for Respondent 27, n. 16.

9 Also of potential significance is Congress' reference to "aggregate reimbursement" as opposed to mere "reimbursement." "Aggregate" signifies "sum total," see Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 64 (9th ed. 1983), and
its use therefore might suggest that Congress had in mind the outcome of
adding up the interim payments.

Opinion of the Court
that $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) defines reasonable cost as "the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred
cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of
needed health services," and petitioners contend that this is
the yardstick against which reimbursements must be measured. But the statute proceeds to explain that reasonable
cost "shall be determined in accordance with regulations
establishing the method or methods to be used." In similar
fashion, the 1972 amendments allow for the provision of "limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred
costs of specific items or services or groups of items or
services to be recognized as reasonable." Ibid. (emphasis
added). In short, aside from the implementing agency's determination pursuant to its regulations, as to which Congress granted broad discretion, there is no available standard
of reasonableness that could form a ready basis for "correct[ion]" or "adjustmen[t]." 10

B

Because both the parties and the Court of Appeals are of
the view that Georgetown is controlling, we turn our attention for a moment to our decision in that case. In 1983, a
District Court struck down the Secretary's 1981 new cost

10 While both parties invoke legislative history, in this case it is of little,
if any, assistance. Petitioners point to a comment in the Committee Reports explaining that the cost limits were merely "presumptive" and that
"[p]roviders would, of course, have the right to obtain reconsideration of
their classification for purposes of cost limits applied to them and to obtain
relief from the effect of the cost limits on the basis of evidence of the need
for such an exception." S. Rep. No. 92-1230, pp. 188-189 (1972). As the
Secretary notes, it is entirely possible that by providing for exceptions,
exemptions, and reclassifications, the agency satisfied this demand. Indeed, the only specific exemption mentioned in the Committee Reports--
sole community hospitals--was put into effect by the agency. See id., at
188; 42 CFR $ 413.30(e)(1) (1992). The legislative history adduced by the
Secretary is no more persuasive.

rule for failure to comply with notice and comment requirements. After following proper procedures, the Secretary
promulgated the same rule in 1984 and sought to apply the
method retroactively for the time it had been held invalid.

(ii), the Secretary thus began to recoup "overpayments"

[it does not] provid[e] authority for the retroactive promulgation of cost-limit rules." Id., at 209. Rather,

"clause (ii) directs the Secretary to establish a procedure
for making case-by-case adjustment to reimbursement
payments where the regulations prescribing computation methods do not reach the correct result in individual cases. The structure and language of the statute
require the conclusion that the retroactivity provision
applies only to case-by-case adjudication, not to rulemaking." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

As we further stated: "[N]othing in clause (ii) suggests that
it permits changes in the methods used to compute costs;
rather, it expressly contemplates corrective adjustments to
the aggregate amounts or reimbursement produced pursuant
to those methods." Id., at 211 (emphasis in original).

But while Georgetown eliminated across-the-board, retroactive rulemaking from the scope of clause (ii), it did not
foreclose either of the two interpretations urged in this case:
case-by-case adjustments based on a comparison of interim
payments with "reasonable" costs as determined by the Secretary; and case-by-case adjustments based on a comparison

Confronted with an ambiguous statutory provision, we
generally will defer to a permissible interpretation espousedby the agency entrusted with its implementation. See

National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Boston & Maine
Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 417 (1992); Department of Treasury,
IRS v. FLRA, 494 U. S. 922, 933 (1990); K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S. 281, 291-292 (1988). Of particular relevance is the agency's contemporaneous construction which
"we have allowed . . . to carry the day against doubts thatmight exist from a reading of the bare words of a statute."

FHA v. The Darlington, Inc., 358 U. S. 84, 90 (1958). Seealso

Aluminum Co. of America v. Central Lincoln Peoples'
Utility Dist., 467 U. S. 380, 390 (1984).In this case, the regulatory framework put in place by the

agency in furtherance of the Medicare program supports thebook-balancing approach to clause (ii). Nowhere in the regulations was there mention of a mechanism for implementing
the kind of substantive recalculation and deviation fromapproved methods suggested by petitioners. On the other

hand, the regulations provided on more than one occasion forthe year-end book-balancing adjustment that, in the Secretary's opinion, is mandated by clause (ii). For instance,20 CFR $ 405.451(b)(1) (1967) stated:

"These regulations also provide for the making of suit-able retroactive adjustments after the provider has
submitted fiscal and statistical reports. The retroactiveadjustment will represent the difference between the
amount received by the provider during the year . . .
and the amount determined in accordance with an accepted method of cost apportionment to be the actual

cost of services rendered to beneficiaries during theyear."

11

Use of the words "suitable retroactive adjustment," bor-rowed from clause (ii), demonstrates the agency's understanding. As we wrote in Georgetown: "It is clear fromthe language of these provisions that they are intended to
implement the Secretary's authority under clause (ii)."488 U. S., at 211, n. 2 (emphasis added). What is more,
"[t]hese are the only regulations that expressly contemplatethe making of retroactive corrective adjustments."

Id., at212 (emphasis added). From the outset, then, the agency

viewed clause (ii) as a directive for retroactive adjustmentof payments for allowable costs, as determined by the
methods.In the aftermath of the 1972 amendments adding the cost
limit provision, the agency appears to have ascribed thesame role to clause (ii), namely to retroactively correct the
difference between interim payments and reasonable costs--only, as a result of the amendments, the adjustment would
now be based on the new definition of reasonable costs, whichincludes the cost limits that as a general rule were not to be
exceeded. As previously described, however, the regula-tions promulgated by the Secretary permitted various exceptions, exemptions, and adjustments to the limits. See 20CFR $ 405.460(f) (1975);

supra, at 406. A provider could ob-tain a reclassification "on the basis of evidence that [its] classification is at variance with the criteria specified in promul-gating limits." 20 CFR $ 405.460(f)(1) (1975). Exemptions
for sole community hospitals have expanded to include newproviders, rural hospitals with less than 50 beds; exceptions
now extend to atypical services, circumstances such asstrikes or floods, educational services, essential community

11 Other regulations, by comparison, appeared to be directed at the periodic preaudit adjustments to be made during the course of the year as
expressly required by $ 1395g. See, e. g., 20 CFR $ 405.454(e) (1967).

services, unusual labor costs. See 42 CFR $ 413.30 (1992).The agency's development--and continued augmentation--of

a list of situations in which the cost limits would be waivedis difficult to harmonize with an interpretation of clause (ii)
that would give a provider the right to contest the applica-tion of any particular and statutorily authorized method to
its own circumstances. Rather, it is consistent with a viewthat the cost limits by definition entailed generalizations that
would benefit some providers while harming others, andwith a desire to refine these approximations through the Secretary's creation of exceptions and exemptions.12

B
Petitioners argue that any deference to the agency's cur-rent position is unwarranted in light of its shifting views on

the matter. It is true that over the years the agency hasembraced a variety of approaches. Compare, e. g., Regents
of Univ. of California v. Heckler, 771 F. 2d 1182 (CA9 1985)(agency contends that clause (ii) permits only book balancing); Whitecliff v. United States, 210 Ct. Cl. 53, 536 F. 2d 347(1976) (same), with

Georgetown, supra (agency argues thatclause (ii) allows retroactive rulemaking). In response, the

Secretary attributes such inconsistency to the lower courts'erroneous interpretations of clause (ii). If providers could
obtain substantive retroactive adjustments in the event of

12 The agency's explanation of how it was computing cost limits in 1981
further illustrates this basic understanding: "The revised limits, like the
current limits, are set at 112 percent of the mean labor-related costs and
mean non-labor costs of each comparison group. The 12 percent allowance above the mean is intended to account for variations in costs that
are consistent with efficiency but are not explicitly accounted for under
our methodology for deriving and adjusting the limits, or by the exceptions or exemptions provided by our regulations." 46 Fed. Reg. 33639
(1981) (emphasis added). Like the exceptions and exemptions themselves, such an allowance cannot easily be reconciled with the notion that
clause (ii) permits adjustments whenever costs consistent with efficiency
are unaccounted for.

alleged underpayment, the argument goes, then so, in theface of alleged underpayment, would the agency. However,

in the aftermath of Georgetown, she notes that the agencyreturned to its earlier position.

The Secretary is not estopped from changing a view shebelieves to have been grounded upon a mistaken legal interpretation. See Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner,353 U. S. 180, 180-183 (1957). Indeed, "[a]n administrative
agency is not disqualified from changing its mind; and whenit does, the courts still sit in review of the administrative
decision and should not approach the statutory constructionissue

de novo and without regard to the administrative un-derstanding of the statutes."

NLRB v. Iron Workers, 434U. S. 335, 351 (1978). See also NLRB v. Curtin Matheson

Scientific, Inc., 494 U. S. 775, 787 (1990); NLRB v. J. Wein-garten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 265-266 (1975). On the other
hand, the consistency of an agency's position is a factor inassessing the weight that position is due. As we have
stated: "An agency interpretation of a relevant provisionwhich conflicts with the agency's earlier interpretation is
`entitled to considerably less deference' than a consistentlyheld agency view."

INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421,446, n. 30 (1987) (quoting Watt v. Alaska, 451 U. S. 259, 273

(1981)). How much weight should be given to the agency'sviews in such a situation, and in particular where its shifts
might have resulted from intervening and possibly errone-ous judicial decisions and its current position from one of
our own rulings, will depend on the facts of individual cases.Cf.

Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic SenatorialCampaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 37 (1981).

C
In the circumstances of this case, where the agency's inter-pretation of a statute is at least as plausible as competing ones, there is little, if any, reason not to defer to its con-struction. We should be especially reluctant to reject the

agency's current view which, as we see it, so closely fits "thedesign of the statute as a whole and . . . its object and policy."

Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990).Section 1395 explicitly delegates to the Secretary the
authority to develop regulatory methods for the estimation ofreasonable costs. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(A).

13 To be

sure, by virtue of their being generalizations, they necessar-ily will fail to yield exact numbers--to the detriment of

health care providers at times, to their benefit at other times.14Presumably, the methods could use a more exact mode of
calculating depreciation, cf. Daughters of Miriam Center for

the Aged v. Mathews, 590 F. 2d 1250 (CA3 1978), or to accountfor proximity to a college or university because it can distort

the wage index, cf. Austin, Texas, Brackenridge Hospital v.Heckler, 753 F. 2d 1307, 1316 (CA5 1985), or to a high-crime
zone in which heightened, and expensive, security is calledfor. All of these variables, and many others, affect actual
costs; factoring them in the methods undoubtedly wouldimprove their accuracy. But "[w]here, as here, the statute
expressly entrusts the Secretary with the responsibility for

13 Such a delegation of authority is not atypical in the context of the
Social Security Act. Indeed, we noted that "Congress has `conferred on
the Secretary exceptionally broad authority to prescribe standards for
applying certain sections of the Act.' " Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S.
458, 466 (1983) (quoting Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 43
(1981)).

14 There is no doubt that under petitioners' expansive reading of clause

(ii) nothing would prevent the Secretary from demanding reimbursement
where she could show that application of the methods resulted in overpayment. For instance, the modified wage index, whose generalized retroactive application we rejected in Georgetown, arguably could be imposed on
a hospital-by-hospital basis. Such an outcome, by undermining providers'
ability to predict costs, runs counter to one of Congress' apparent motivations in authorizing cost limits. See S. Rep. No. 92-1230, at 188 (because
limits on costs recognized as reasonable would be set prospectively, "the
provider would know in advance the limits to Government recognition of
incurred costs and have the opportunity to act to avoid having costs that
are not reimbursable").

implementing a provision by regulation, our review is lim-ited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary's statutory authority and whether theyare arbitrary and capricious." Heckler v. Campbell, 461
U. S. 458, 466 (1983) (footnote and citations omitted).Besides being textually defensible, the Secretary's restrictive reading of clause (ii) comports with this broad delega-tion of authority. Congress saw fit to empower the agency
to devise methods to estimate actual costs, and the agencyhas opted for the use of certain generalizations, with additional fine-tuning by way of exceptions, exemptions, reclassi-fications, and by making allowances for possible variations in
costs consistent with efficiency. See supra, at 406, n. 3.15What the agency forbids is the kind of wide-range, ad hoc
reassessments of the accuracy of the chosen methods implicitin petitioners' interpretation. Indeed, and for all practical
purposes, petitioners' contention is that the methods chosenby the agency did not take into account sufficient variables,

15 Moreover, we note that in its 1981 amendment to $ 1395x(v), Congress
explicitly endorsed the agency's method of implementing the statute by
providing that

"[t]he Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be
made . . . may not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of
health services) routine operating costs for the provision of general inpatient hospital services by a hospital to the extent these costs exceed 108
percent of the mean of such routine operating costs per diem for hospitals,
or, in the judgment of the Secretary, such lower percentage or such comparable or lower limit as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may
provide for such exemptions and exceptions to such limitation as he deems
appropriate." 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)(1)(L)(i) (1976 ed., Supp. V), repealed,
Pub. L. 97-248, $ 101(a)(2), 96 Stat. 335.

See also H. R. Rep. No. 97-158, pp. 326-327 (1981).

As remarked earlier, see n. 12, supra, the thrust of this scheme (imposing a firm ceiling set above the mean, purportedly to account for possible
inaccuracies in the methods, and allowing the Secretary to provide for
appropriate waivers) is at least at some variance with the notion that a
dissatisfied provider can exceed the imposed limits and invoke its own
waivers for any reason the Secretary has failed to take into account.

namely, the proportion of part-time workers and proximityto urban centers. It is, in all but name, a challenge to the

validity of the methods--albeit in an individual case--includ-ing the cost limits, the exceptions and the exemptions, and
to their adequacy as gauges of reasonable costs. The Secre-tary has construed the statute to allow such attacks, not

In the Court's view, the contrasting interpretations ofclause (ii) proffered by the petitioners and the Secretary are

in such equipoise that even slight deference to the Secretaryis enough to tip the balance her way. As I read it, however,
the language of clause (ii) plainly favors the petitioners.The Court focuses on two portions of clause (ii). First, it
says, the phrase "aggregate reimbursement produced by themethods of determining costs" may be understood, not only
as the petitioners would read it, but as the Secretary does:"the total of the interim payments . . . derived from application of the methods [of determining costs] to rough, incom16 In fact, petitioners invoked this provision below, see App. 13-14, but

plete data." Ante, at 410. Second, the Court finds that "in-adequate or excessive" may well mean, as the Secretary

suggests, inadequate or excessive as measured against "thereasonable costs as determined by the [Secretary] applying
the methods [of determining costs]." Ante, at 411. I think
the language of clause (ii) precludes these readings.Clause (ii) identifies its subject, "aggregate reimbursement," as the figure "produced by the methods of determin-ing costs." Thus, once we know what "the methods of
determining costs" are, we should be able to discover thenature of the "aggregate reimbursement" that is "produced
by" those methods. Section 1395x(v)(1)(A) makes it clear
that "methods" refers to the regulations implementing the
statutory mandate to pay providers of services "the cost
actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred
cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of
needed health services." The first sentence of $ 1395x(v)
(1)(A), which together with $ 1395hh authorizes the Secretary to issue such regulations, identifies them as "regulations
establishing the . . . methods to be used . . . in determining
. . . costs." And clause (i) of $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) uses the exact
same phrase as clause (ii): the regulations shall take into
account both direct and indirect costs, it says, so that "under
the methods of determining costs," patients who are not
Medicare beneficiaries will not subsidize beneficiaries, nor
will beneficiaries subsidize nonbeneficiaries. Thus, "the
methods of determining costs" are not procedures for estimating costs to make interim payments; rather, they are the
means for figuring the actual "reasonable cost of . . .
services."

The Secretary appears not to dispute this, but contends,
in the Court's words, that the phrase "produced by the methods of determining costs" actually means "derived from application of the methods to rough, incomplete data." Ante,
at 410. In other words, as the Secretary asserted at oral
argument, "what you're really doing is taking estimated data

508us2$87D 02-13-97 18:43:03 PAGES OPINPGT
422 GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL v. SHALALA

Souter, J., dissenting
but running them through the same methods that you'reeventually going to run the final data through in order to get

a result." Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-32. There is, however, anobvious difficulty with this proposed interpretation: the complete lack of any reference to "incomplete" or "estimated"
data in clause (ii). Two less obvious difficulties are evenmore telling.

First, nothing in Title XVIII of the Social Security Actspecifies that interim payments should be calculated by
applying to estimated data the complete, detailed methodol-ogy for reaching a final reasonable cost figure; the Secretary's own regulations, indeed, suggest just the opposite.
"The interim payment," states the relevant regulation, "may
be related to the last year's average per diem, or to charges,
or to any other ready basis of approximating costs." 42
CFR $ 413.60(a) (1992). And for purposes of devising preliminary estimates, this makes perfect sense; working
through a permissible method for determining costs in all its
detail may not improve the quality of an estimate if the raw
figures used are mostly guesswork. But this divergence of
methods for calculating interim payments and methods for
determining reasonable cost casts doubt on the Secretary's
proffered interpretation of "produced by the methods of determining costs." If interim, estimated payments may in
fact be calculated without strict adherence to the methods of
determining costs, it is hard to see why Congress would
choose to identify a series of interim payments as "the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs."

Second, the Secretary's interpretation assumes that "the
methods of determining costs" are no more than a series of
equations, which can be applied as readily to final, audited
cost figures as to mere projections. But the statute suggests that the term "methods" is not to be understood so
narrowly. In the words of the statute, for example, the regulations establishing the methods may not only "provide for

508us2$87D 02-13-97 18:43:04 PAGES OPINPGT

423Cite as: 508 U. S. 402 (1993)
Souter, J., dissenting
determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit,per capita, or other basis"; they may also "provide for the

use of estimates of costs of particular items or services."$ 1395x(v)(1)(A). Thus, as the statute conceives of them, the
methods encompass not only a set of equations, but a set
of determinations about whether to use actual costs or costestimates for particular items or services. This set of determinations is relevant, of course, not to reckoning interimpayments, but to calculating the final reimbursement due the
provider of health services. Accordingly, a figure that is"produced by the methods of determining costs" should, absent some contrary indication, be the final figure.

The Court asserts that a contrary indication may be found
in the use of the adjective "aggregate" to modify "reimbursement." " `Aggregate,' " says the Court, "signifies `sum total'
and its use therefore might suggest that Congress had in
mind the outcome of adding up the interim payments."
Ante, at 411, n. 9 (citation omitted). I find no such suggestion in the statute's use of that term, for "aggregate," unlike,
say, "cumulative," carries no necessary connotation of addition over time. More importantly, there is a far better explanation for the use of the term "aggregate." A health care
provider will, over the course of a fiscal year, provide many
different kinds of services to Medicare beneficiaries. Part
A Medicare benefits, for example, cover, among other things,
"inpatient hospital services," see 42 CFR $ 409.5 (1992), a
term that encompasses everything from bed and board, nursing services, and use of hospital facilities to medical social
services, drugs, biologicals, supplies, appliances and equipment, certain other diagnostic and therapeutic services, and
medical or surgical services provided by certain interns or
residents-in-training. $ 409.10(a). The statute plainly contemplates the use of different methods to determine the
costs of these various services, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1395x(v)
(1)(A) (stating that the regulations "may provide for using
different methods in different circumstances"), and the Sec508us2$87D 02-13-97 18:43:04 PAGES OPINPGT
424 GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL v. SHALALA

Souter, J., dissenting
retary has indeed provided for a number of different meth-ods. For instance, under the Secretary's "[d]epartmental

method" for apportioning costs, the provider's cost of "rou-tine services" is apportioned between Medicare and nonMedicare patients on an average cost per diem basis,
whereas the cost of "ancillary" services is apportioned onthe basis of the ratio of Medicare beneficiary charges to

total patient charges in each department. See 42 CFR$ 413.53(a)(1) (1992). The combined reimbursement for all of
the different services performed by a health care provider,as calculated under all of the different methods allowed by
the statute and specified in the regulations and other materials published by the Secretary, may aptly be labeled the "aggregate reimbursement."

As I thus read the statute, the term "aggregate" is important in making it clear not only that the "reimbursement"
considered in clause (ii) is the total amount received by a
provider for all of the services it has rendered to Medicare
beneficiaries, but that the amount received should be considered only as a whole. This focus on the total amount received means that a provider who shows that a method results in an understating of the reasonable cost of a particular
service will not necessarily be entitled to a "retroactive corrective adjustmen[t]" to recover that particular cost, for the
Government may be able to show that the same method, or
another method used by the provider, has overstated other
costs. (By the same token, of course, the Government will
not always deserve an adjustment when it shows that a
method has overstated a particular cost.) The text's direction to look only at the total reimbursement also means that
the provider will not be entitled to the prospective application of a more accurate method of its own devising, an insight
into the statute that is hardly new; as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 413, we recognized in Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 211 (1988) (emphasis in
original), that "nothing in clause (ii) suggests that it permits

Souter, J., dissenting
changes in the methods used to compute costs; rather, itexpressly contemplates corrective adjustments to the

aggregate amounts of reimbursement produced pursuant tothose methods."

This emphasis on the total, aggregate reimbursement
received by the health care provider makes sense in lightof the broader goals of the Medicare program, addressing

as it does Congress's concern that Medicare neither subsi-dize, nor be subsidized by, non-Medicare patients. See

$ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i). As long as the aggregate Medicare reim-bursement to a health care provider equals its total reasonable costs of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries,
that goal has been attained; the details of the methods used
do not matter. Thus, I can find no ambiguity in the phrase
"aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs"; it refers univocally to the total, final
amount due to a provider for services rendered to Medicare
beneficiaries under the regulations promulgated by the
Secretary.

The Court also finds ambiguity in the direction stated in
clause (ii) to provide for an adjustment if the reimbursement
proves to be "inadequate or excessive." While I agree with
the Court that clause (ii) does not itself "at any point stat[e]
the standard against which inadequacy or excessiveness is
to be measured," ante, at 410-411, the absence of an explicit
reference to a standard in clause (ii) does not keep us from
looking for other textual clues about that standard. In this
case, the strongest textual clue is found in the immediate
neighbor of clause (ii), clause (i). Together, clauses (i) and
(ii) form the fourth and last sentence of $ 1395x(v)(1)(A).
Whereas the third sentence of $ 1395x(v)(1)(A) is permissive,
the fourth sentence is mandatory; it concerns those things
that the Secretary's regulations "shall" take into account or
for which they "shall" provide. Clause (i) requires the regulations to take into account "both direct and indirect costs of
providers of services" so that "the necessary costs of effi508us2$87D 02-13-97 18:43:04 PAGES OPINPGT

ciently delivering covered services to individuals covered bythe insurance programs established by this subchapter will

not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costswith respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne
by such insurance programs." $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(i). The first
of these two undesired results, it will be noted, would occurif the aggregate reimbursement to the provider were inadequate, in the sense of failing to cover all reasonable costs;the second, if that reimbursement were excessive.

Clause (ii) does not contain as exhaustive a description ofits goal as clause (i); it simply requires the regulations to
provide for suitable corrective adjustments where the methods of determining costs produce a reimbursement that
"proves to be either inadequate or excessive." $ 1395x(v)(1)
(A)(ii). Reading the two clauses together, however, I think
it most reasonable to take clause (ii)'s "inadequate or excessive" as shorthand for the two consequences that were just
described in the same order, but more fully, in clause (i).
This construction has the further virtue, of course, of support in my reading of the phrase "aggregate reimbursement
produced by the methods of determining costs." For if that
phrase, as I contend, refers to the amount ultimately due the
provider as calculated under the Secretary's regulations
(that is, according to the Secretary's "methods"), then the
standard against which that amount is measured as "inadequate or excessive" must refer to some other figure (that
is, a figure produced by some different method); no amount
can be "inadequate or excessive" in relation to itself. Thus,
in context, the phrase "inadequate or excessive" is not
equivocal.

Broadening the context to all of Title XVIII only confirms
the view that clause (ii) requires regulations providing for
case-by-case exceptions to the methods for determining
costs. Section 1395x(v)(1)(A), where clause (ii) is located, is
a definitional, rather than an operative, provision; $ 1395x(v)
defines "[r]easonable costs." The chief operative provision

to which $ 1395x(v) relates is $ 1395f(b), which is titled"Amount paid to provider of services"; $ 1395f(b)(1) provides

that under the Medicare program, providers of services aregenerally to be paid "the lesser of (A) the reasonable cost of
such services, as determined under section 1395x(v) of this
title . . . or (B) the customary charges with respect to suchservices." "Payments to providers of services" are covered

under another section, 1395g. That section requires theSecretary "periodically [to] determine the amount which
should be paid . . . to each provider of services," and requires"the provider of services [to] be paid, at such time or times
as the Secretary believes appropriate (but not less often than
monthly) . . . the amounts so determined, with necessary
adjustments on account of previously made overpayments
or underpayments." $ 1395g(a). As the Court notes, ante,
at 411, the petitioners argue that this section's provision for
"necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments" provides for the very bookbalancing operation that the Secretary advances as the function of clause (ii), and thus renders clause (ii), as interpreted
by the Secretary, entirely superfluous. The Court nonetheless appears to accept the Secretary's explanation that

$ 1395g deals with periodic adjustments to be made during
the course of the fiscal year, whereas clause (ii) is directed at
year-end adjustments. Ibid. Two circumstances keep me
from doing the same.

First, nothing in the language of $ 1395g excludes "yearend adjustments" from its purview, or draws any distinction
at all between periodic and year-end adjustments. All payments to providers for services to Medicare beneficiaries are
made under the authority of $ 1395g, since it is the only section in Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to deal with
that subject; and $ 1395g thus authorizes all payments to be
"adjust[ed] on account of previously made overpayments or
underpayments." It is doubtless this breadth which leads
the Secretary to concede that had clause (ii) never been en508us2$87D 02-13-97 18:43:04 PAGES OPINPGT

acted, "the authority for some similar year-end mechanismmight have been inferred under the Act as a whole, including

42 U. S. C. 1395g." Brief for Respondent 27, n. 16.Second, the Secretary's proposed distinction between
year-end and periodic adjustments fails to explain why TitleXVIII would describe year-end, but not periodic, adjustments as "retroactive." The Secretary interprets "retroac-tive," as it appears in clause (ii), to mean only relating to a
period for which some payment has already been made, thusrejecting the more common, stricter legal sense of the word,
which implies the upsetting of some prior settled expectationor transaction. In this weak sense employed by the Secretary, however, the adjustments authorized by $ 1395g arejust as "retroactive" as those authorized under the Secretary's interpretation of clause (ii); they too relate to"previously made overpayments or underpayments." This
leaves the Secretary with no way to explain why Congress,in passing the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (which
established the Medicare program, and contained both pas-sages, see 79 Stat. 297, 323), chose to distinguish $ 1395g
"adjustments" from $ 1395x(v)(1)(A)(ii) "retroactive correc-tive adjustments."

For all of these reasons, I believe the text of the statuteunambiguously requires the promulgation of regulations
allowing providers (and the Secretary) to seek adjustmentson the grounds that, as calculated under the methods of determining costs, the total reimbursement for a fiscal periodis lower than (or higher than) the actual reasonable cost of
providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. I respectfullydissent from the Court's opposite conclusion.

ANTOINE v. BYERS & ANDERSON, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-7604. Argued March 30, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
Petitioner's appeal from a federal-court bank robbery conviction was delayed four years because respondent court reporter failed to provide a
trial transcript. In his civil damages action against respondent and her
former employer, also a respondent here, the Federal District Court
granted summary judgment in respondents' favor on the ground that
court reporters are entitled to absolute immunity. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: A court reporter is not absolutely immune from damages liability

for failing to produce a transcript of a federal criminal trial. Respondents bear the burden of establishing the justification for the absolute
immunity they claim, which depends on the immunity historically accorded officials like them at common law and the interests behind it,
Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 508. Since court reporters were not
among the class of persons protected by judicial immunity in the 19th
century, respondents suggest that common-law judges, who made handwritten notes during trials, be treated as their historical counterparts.
However, the functions of the two types of notetakers are significantly
different, since court reporters are charged by statute with producing
a "verbatim" transcript for inclusion in the official record, while
common-law judges exercise discretion and judgment in deciding exactly what and how much they will write. Moreover, were a commonlaw judge to perform a reporter's function, he or she might well be
acting in an administrative capacity, for which there is no absolute immunity. Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229. Because their job requires no discretionary judgment, court reporters are not entitled to
immunity as part of the judicial function. See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a court reporteris absolutely immune from damages liability for failing to

produce a transcript of a federal criminal trial.

I
In March 1986, after a 2-day trial, a jury convicted peti-tioner of bank robbery. Petitioner promptly appealed and

ordered a copy of the transcript from respondent Ruggen-berg, who had served as the court reporter. The court ordered Ruggenberg to produce a transcript by May 29, 1986.Over two years later, Ruggenberg had yet to provide a
transcript, despite a long series of hearings, court orders,and new filing deadlines. In July 1988, Ruggenberg finally
explained that she had lost many of her trial notes, thoughadditional notes and tapes were later to come to light. At
one point in the proceedings, Ruggenberg was fined and ar-rested as the Court of Appeals sought to obtain this and
other overdue transcripts. Eventually, making use of Rug-genberg's partial notes and materials submitted by the parties pursuant to Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of AppellateProcedure,

"Statement on the evidence or proceedings when no report was made

proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is unavailable,
the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings
from the best available means, including the appellant's recollection."

and the appellate process went forward. As a result of thedelay in obtaining a transcript, petitioner's appeal was not

heard until four years after his conviction. 950 F. 2d 1471,1472-1473 (CA9 1991); No. C88-260TB (WD Wash., Feb. 16,
1990), pp. 2-3, reprinted in App. 24.In 1990, the Court of Appeals set aside petitioner's conviction and remanded the case to the District Court to deter-mine whether petitioner's appeal had been prejudiced by
the lack of a verbatim transcript, and whether the delay inreceiving the transcript violated petitioner's constitutional
right to due process. United States v. Antoine, 906 F. 2d1379 (CA9). The District Court ruled against petitioner
on both issues and reinstated his conviction. No. C85-87T(WD Wash., Aug. 21, 1991), reprinted in App. 45. The Court
of Appeals then affirmed. 967 F. 2d 592 (CA9 1992) ( judgt.order), reprinted in App. 66.

In the meantime, before the Court of Appeals disposed ofhis first appeal in 1990, petitioner filed this civil action, seeking damages from Ruggenberg and respondent Byers & An-derson, Inc., the firm that had engaged her pursuant to its
contract to provide reporting services to the District Court.Following discovery, the District Court granted summary
judgment in favor of respondents on the ground that theywere entitled to absolute immunity. Petitioner's pendent

had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, and that $ 1983 does not
provide a basis for suit against federal agents, the Court of Appeals assumed that the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a federal claim

Opinion of the Court
nity is "justified and defined by the functions it protects and
serves," Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 227 (1988) (emphasis omitted), and that "the tasks performed by a court reporter in furtherance of her statutory duties are functionally
part and parcel of the judicial process," the Court of Appeals
held that actions within the scope of a reporter's authority
are absolutely immune. 950 F. 2d, at 1475-1476.

Some Circuits have held that court reporters are protected
only by qualified immunity.3 We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 506 U. S. 914 (1992).

II
The proponent of a claim to absolute immunity bears the
burden of establishing the justification for such immunity.4
In determining which officials perform functions that might
justify a full exemption from liability, "we have undertaken
`a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded
the relevant official at common law and the interests behind
it.' " Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 508 (1978) (quoting

nity defense on which the Court of Appeals based its decision, see Pet. for
Cert. i, we have no occasion to comment on the validity of petitioner's
underlying cause of action.

3 See McLallen v. Henderson, 492 F. 2d 1298, 1299-1300 (CA8 1974);

Slavin v. Curry, 574 F. 2d 1256, 1265-1266 (CA5 1978); Green v. Maraio,
722 F. 2d 1013, 1018 (CA2 1983). The Seventh Circuit, like the Ninth,
provides absolute immunity for court reporters. Scruggs v. Moellering,
870 F. 2d 376, 377, cert. denied, 493 U. S. 956 (1989).

4 We have consistently "emphasized that the official seeking absolute

immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for
the function in question. The presumption is that qualified rather than
absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties. We have been quite sparing in our recognition of
absolute immunity, and have refused to extend it any further than its justification would warrant." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 486-487 (1991)

The skilled, professional court reporter of today was unknown during the centuries when the common-law doctrine
of judicial immunity developed. See generally Ratteray,
Verbatim Reporting Comes of Age, 56 Judicature 368 (1973).
It was not until the late 19th century that official court reporters began to appear in state courts. Id., at 368-369.
Prior to enactment of the Court Reporter Act in 1944,6 the
federal system did not provide for official court reporting.7
Court reporters were not among the class of persons protected by judicial immunity in the 19th century.8

5 For purposes of immunity, we have not distinguished actions brought
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against state officials from Bivens actions brought
against federal officials. See Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 503-504

7 In a case decided in 1942, we pointed out:

"There is no law of the United States creating the position of official
court stenographer and none requiring the stenographic report of any
case, civil or criminal, and there is none providing for payment for the
services of a stenographer in reporting judicial proceedings. The practice
has been for the parties to agree that a designated person shall so report.
The one selected must be paid by private arrangement with one or more
of the parties to the litigation. The amount paid to him is not costs in
the cause nor taxable as such against any of the parties." Miller v.
United States, 317 U. S. 192, 197.

8 "Judicial Immunity . . . was an absolute immunity from all claims relating to the exercise of judicial functions. See, e. g., T. Cooley, Law of Torts
408-409 (1880). It extended not only to judges narrowly speaking, but to

`military and naval officers in exercising their authority to order courtsmartial for the trial of their inferiors, or in putting their inferiors under

Opinion of the Court
Faced with the absence of a common-law tradition involving court reporters themselves, respondents urge us to treat
as their historical counterparts common-law judges who
made handwritten notes during trials. We find the analogy
unpersuasive. The function performed by judicial notetakers at common law is significantly different from that performed by court reporters today. Whereas court reporters
are charged by statute with producing a "verbatim" transcript of each session of the court, for inclusion in the official
record, 28 U. S. C. $ 753(b), common-law judges exercise discretion and judgment in deciding exactly what, and how
much, they will write. Early judicial notetakers, for instance, left records from which the "narrative of the trial
cannot be reconstructed"; their notes were for their own purposes in charging the jury and were never entered into the
public record. Langbein, Shaping the Eighteenth-Century
Criminal Trial: A View from the Ryder Sources, 50 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (1983).9

tion from a road tax is not in fact exempt, or that one arrested is in default
for not having worked out the assessment; to members of a township board
in deciding upon the allowance of claims; to arbitrators, and to the collector of customs in exercising his authority to sell perishable property,
and in fixing upon the time for notice of sale.' Id., at 410-411 (footnotes
omitted).

"As is evident from the foregoing catalog, judicial immunity extended
not only to public officials but also to private citizens (in particular jurors
and arbitrators); the touchstone for its applicability was performance of
the function of resolving disputes between parties, or of authoritatively
adjudicating private rights." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S., at 499-500
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).

9 Indeed, the doctrine of judicial immunity was recognized in part to

avoid imposing on judges the obligation to make complete trial transcripts.

"If upon such allegations a judge could be compelled to answer in a civil
action for his judicial acts, not only would his office be degraded and his
usefulness destroyed, but he would be subjected for his protection to the
necessity of preserving a complete record of all the evidence produced
before him in every litigated case, and of the authorities cited and arguments presented, in order that he might be able to show to the judge
before whom he might be summoned by the losing party . . . that he had

435Cite as: 508 U. S. 429 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
There is a second problem with respondents' theory.Even had common-law judges performed the functions of a

court reporter, that would not end the immunity inquiry. Itwould still remain to consider whether judges, when performing that function, were themselves entitled to absoluteimmunity. We do not doubt that judicial notetaking as it is
commonly practiced is protected by absolute immunity, be-cause it involves the kind of discretionary decisionmaking
that the doctrine of judicial immunity is designed to protect.But if we could imagine a hypothetical case in which a
common-law judge felt himself bound to transcribe an entireproceeding verbatim, it is far less clear--and neither respondent refers us to any case law suggesting--that thisadministrative duty would be similarly protected. Indeed,
we have recently held that judges are not entitled to absoluteimmunity when acting in their administrative capacity.
Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229 (1988).We are also unpersuaded by the contention that our "functional approach" to immunity, see Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S.,at 486, requires that absolute immunity be extended to court
reporters because they are "part of the judicial function,"see 950 F. 2d, at 1476. The doctrine of judicial immunity is
supported by a long-settled understanding that the inde-pendent and impartial exercise of judgment vital to the judiciary might be impaired by exposure to potential damagesliability.

10 Accordingly, the "touchstone" for the doctrine's

applicability has been "performance of the function of resolvdecided as he did with judicial integrity . . . ." Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall.
335, 349 (1872).

10 "For it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper

administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority
vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequences to himself. Liability to answer to every
one who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge, would be
inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that
independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or
useful." Id., at 347. See also Mireles v. Waco, 502 U. S. 9, 10 (1991), and
cases cited therein.

ing disputes between parties, or of authoritatively adjudicat-ing private rights." 500 U. S., at 500 (

Scalia, J., concurringin judgment in part and dissenting in part). When judicial

immunity is extended to officials other than judges, it is be-cause their judgments are "functional[ly] comparab[le]" to
those of judges--that is, because they, too, "exercise a dis-cretionary judgment" as a part of their function. Imbler v.
Pachtman, 424 U. S., at 423, n. 20. Cf. Westfall v. Erwin,484 U. S. 292, 297-298 (1988) (absolute immunity from statelaw tort actions available to executive officials only whentheir conduct is discretionary).

The function performed by court reporters is not in this
category. As noted above, court reporters are required bystatute to "recor[d] verbatim" court proceedings in their entirety. 28 U. S. C. $ 753(b). They are afforded no discretionin the carrying out of this duty; they are to record, as accurately as possible, what transpires in court. See McLallenv.

Henderson, 492 F. 2d 1298, 1299 (CA8 1974) (court reporters not absolutely immune "because their duties are ministe-rial, not discretionary, in nature");

11 We do not mean to suggest that the

task is less than difficult, or that reporters who do it well are
less than highly skilled. But the difficulty of a job does notby itself make it functionally comparable to that of a judge.

Cf. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986) (police officernot entitled to absolute immunity for conduct involved in
applying for warrant). Nor is it sufficient that the task of a
court reporter is extremely important or, in the words of the

11 "A court stenographer, notwithstanding the fact that he is an officer
of the court, by the very nature of his work performs no judicial function.
His duties are purely ministerial and administrative; he has no power of
decision. The doctrine [of judicial immunity] has no application to the
facts with which we are confronted here." Waterman, 35 Misc. 2d, at 957,
232 N. Y. S. 2d, at 26.

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals, "indispensable to the appellate process."
950 F. 2d, at 1476. As we explained in Forrester, some of
the tasks performed by judges themselves, "even though
they may be essential to the very functioning of the courts,
have not . . . been regarded as judicial acts." 484 U. S.,
at 228. In short, court reporters do not exercise the kind
of judgment that is protected by the doctrine of judicial
immunity.

Finally, respondents argue that strong policy reasons support extension of absolute immunity to court reporters. According to respondents, given the current volume of litigation in the federal courts, some reporters inevitably will be
unable to meet deadlines. Absolute immunity would help to
protect the entire judicial process from vexatious lawsuits
brought by disappointed litigants when this happens. Requiring court reporters to defend against allegations like
those asserted here, on the other hand, would not only be
unfair, but would also aggravate the problem by contributing further to the caseload in the federal courts.

Assuming the relevance of respondents' policy arguments,
we find them unpersuasive for three reasons. First, our understanding is that cases of this kind are relatively rare. Respondents have not provided us with empirical evidence
demonstrating the existence of any significant volume of vexatious and burdensome actions against reporters, even in the
Circuits in which reporters are not absolutely immune. See
n. 3, supra. Second, if a large number of cases does materialize, and we have misjudged the significance of this burden,
then a full review of the countervailing policy considerations
by the Congress may result in appropriate amendment to
the Court Reporter Act. Third, and most important, we
have no reason to believe that the Federal Judiciary, which
surely is familiar with the special virtues and concerns of the
court reporting profession, will be unable to administer justice to its members fairly.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL BANK OF OREGON v.INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OF

AMERICA, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 92-484. Argued April 19, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993*
The Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753 (1916 Act), among other things,

authorized any national bank doing business in a community with a population not exceeding 5,000 to act as the agent for any insurance company. Although early editions of the United States Code included this
provision as section 92 of Title 12 (section 92), the 1952 Code and subsequent editions omitted section 92 with a note indicating that Congress
had repealed it in 1918. Nevertheless, interpreting section 92 to permit
banks located in small communities to sell insurance outside those communities, petitioner Comptroller of the Currency ruled in 1986 that petitioner national bank could sell insurance through its branch in a small
Oregon town to customers nationwide. Respondents, various trade organizations representing insurance agents, brought this suit challenging
the Comptroller's decision as inconsistent with section 92's terms. The
District Court disagreed with that assertion and granted summary
judgment for petitioners, noting that section 92 apparently was inadvertently repealed in 1918, but expressing the view that the provision
exists "in proprio vigore." Respondents did not challenge section 92's
validity in the District Court or the Court of Appeals, despite the latter
court's invitation to do so at oral argument. Only after that court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue did respondents even urge the
court to resolve the question, while still taking no position on the merits.
In reversing and remanding with instructions to enter judgment for
respondents, the Court of Appeals found first that, though the parties
had not on their own questioned section 92's validity, the court had a
duty to do so, and, second, that the relevant statutes, traditionally construed, demonstrated that section 92 was repealed in 1918.

Held:

1. The Court of Appeals had discretion to consider the validity of
section 92, and under the circumstances did not abuse it. There is no
doubt that the court had before it an Article III case or controversy

involving section 92's status. Though the parties did not lock horns
over that issue, they did clash over whether the Comptroller properly
relied on section 92 as authority for his ruling. A court properly presented with an issue is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but retains the independent power to identify
and apply the proper construction of governing law, Kamen v. Kemper
Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99, even where that construction
is that a law does not govern because it is not in force, cf. Cohens v.
Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 405 (Marshall, C. J.). Nor did prudence oblige
the court below to treat the unasserted argument that section 92 had
been repealed as having been waived, since a court may consider an
issue antecedent to and ultimately dispositive of the dispute before it,
even if the parties fail to identify and brief the issue. Arcadia v. Ohio
Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77. The court was asked to construe a statutory provision that the Code's keepers had suggested was no longer in
force, on appeal from a District Court justifying its reliance on the law
by the logic that, despite its "inadverten[t] repea[l]," section 92 remained in effect of its own force. After giving the parties ample opportunity to address the issue, the court acted without any impropriety in
refusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation on the question of
law as to section 92's validity. Pp. 445-448.

2. Section 92 was not repealed in 1918. Despite its omission from
the Code, section 92 must remain on the books if the Statutes at Large,
which provides "the legal evidence of laws" under 1 U. S. C. $ 112, so
dictates. Viewed in isolation, the deployment of certain quotation
marks in the 1916 Act appears to support the argument, adopted by the
Court of Appeals and pressed by respondents, that the Act places section 92 in Rev. Stat. $ 5202, and that section 92 was subsequently repealed when the War Finance Corporation Act, ch. 45, 40 Stat. 506 (1918
Act), eliminated the relevant portion of $ 5202. An examination of the
structure, language, and subject matter of the relevant statutes, however, provides overwhelming evidence that, despite the placement of the
quotation marks in question, the 1916 Act placed section 92 not in Rev.
Stat. $ 5202, but in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act. Since the 1918 Act
did not touch $ 13, it did not affect, much less repeal, section 92. It
would appear that the misplacement of the quotation marks in the 1916
Act was a simple scrivener's error by someone unfamiliar with the law's
object and design. Courts should disregard punctuation, or repunctuate, if necessary to render the true meaning of a statute. Hammock v.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Comptroller of the Currency recently relied on a statutory provision enacted in 1916 to permit national banks located in small communities to sell insurance to customers
outside those communities. These cases present the unlikely question whether Congress repealed that provision in
1918. We hold that no repeal occurred.

I
Almost 80 years ago, Congress authorized any national
bank "doing business in any place the population of which
does not exceed five thousand inhabitants . . . [to] act as the
agent for any fire, life, or other insurance company." Act of
Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753. In the first compilation of the
United States Code, this provision appeared as section 92 of
Title 12. See 12 U. S. C. $ 92 (1926 ed.); see also United
States Code editions of 1934, 1940, and 1946. The 1952
edition of the Code, however, omitted the insurance provision, with a note indicating that Congress had repealed it

INS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.

Opinion of the Court

in 1918.1 See 12 U. S. C. $ 92 (1952 ed.) (note). Though the
provision has also been left out of the subsequent editions
of the United States Code, including the current one (each
containing in substance the same note that appeared in 1952,
see United States Code editions of 1958, 1964, 1970, 1976,
1982, and 1988), the parties refer to it as "section 92," and so
will we.

Despite the absence of section 92 from the Code, Congress
has assumed that it remains in force, on one occasion actually
amending it. See Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions
Act of 1982, $ 403(b), 96 Stat. 1511; see also Competitive
Equality Banking Act of 1987, $ 201(b)(5), 101 Stat. 583 (imposing a 1-year moratorium on section 92 activities). The
regulators concerned with the provision's subject, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, have
likewise acted on the understanding that section 92 remains

1 The note states that "[t]he provisions of this section, which were added
to R. S. $ 5202 by act Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 461, 39 Stat. 753, were omitted in
the amendment of R. S. $ 5202 by act Apr. 5, 1918, ch. 45, $ 20, 40 Stat.
512, and therefore this section has been omitted from the Code." 12
U. S. C. $ 92 (1952 ed.) (note). We do not know what prompted the 1952
codifiers to reverse the judgment of their predecessors. The 1952 codifiers' decision, along with legislation that treated section 92 as valid law,
apparently prompted a House of Representatives Committee to take a
look at the status of section 92 in 1957. See Financial Institutions Act of
1957: Hearings on S. 1451 and H. R. 7206 before the House Committee on
Banking and Currency, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 989-990, 1010-1025,
1036-1040, 1060-1071 (1957). After hearing conflicting testimony, the
Committee took no action. See id., at 1090, 1199. Several years later,
congressional staffers explored the issue again and concluded, with the
codifiers, that Congress had repealed section 92 in 1918. See Consolidation of Bank Examining and Supervisory Functions: Hearings on H. R. 107
and H. R. 6885 before the Subcommittee on Bank Supervision and Insurance of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 89th Cong., 1st
Sess., 391 (1965). Though the conclusion was published in a House Subcommittee Report, see ibid., neither the Subcommittee nor full Committee
took up the matter, and at no time has Congress attempted to reenact
what staff thought had been repealed.

indeed it was a ruling by the Comptroller relying on section92 that precipitated these cases.

2

The ruling came on a request by United States NationalBank of Oregon (Bank), a national bank with its principal

place of business in Portland, Oregon, to sell insurance
through its branch in Banks, Oregon (population: 489), to cus-tomers nationwide. The Comptroller approved the request

in 1986, interpreting section 92 to permit national bankbranches located in communities with populations not exceeding 5,000 to sell insurance to customers not only insidebut also outside those communities. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. in No. 92-507, pp. 74a-79a. The Bank is the petitionerin the first of the cases we decide today; the Comptroller of
the Currency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
and the United States are the petitioners in the other.

Respondents in both cases are various trade organizations
representing insurance agents. They challenged the Comptroller's decision in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, claiming the Comptroller's ruling to be
"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise
not in accordance with law" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). Respondents argued,

2 Courts too, including this one, have assumed the validity of section 92.
See Commissioner v. First Security Bank of Utah, N. A., 405 U. S. 394,
401-402 (1972); Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc. v. Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve System, 266 U. S. App. D. C. 356, 360, n. 8, 835 F. 2d

Bank of Thief River Falls, 172 Minn. 310, 311-312, 215 N. W. 213, 213
(1927). But no court squarely addressed the question until the Court of
Appeals below.

Opinion of the Court

among other things, that the ruling was inconsistent with
section 92, which respondents maintained permits national
banks located in small communities to sell insurance only to
customers in those communities. The District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment for the federal parties and the Bank, a defendant-intervenor, on the ground
that the Comptroller's interpretation was "rational and consistent with [section 92]." National Assn. of Life Underwriters v. Clarke, 736 F. Supp. 1162, 1173 (1990) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). The District Court
thought it "worth noting that this section no longer appears
in the United States Code" as it "apparently was inadvertently repealed" in 1918; but because Congress, the Comptroller, and other courts have presumed its continuing validity,
the court was content to assume that the provision exists "in
proprio vigore," meaning, we take it, of its own force. Id.,
at 1163, n. 2.

Respondents had not asked the District Court to rule that
section 92 no longer existed, and they took the same tack
before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, merely noting in their opening brief that section 92 may
have been repealed in 1918 and then stating that all the relevant players had assumed its validity. The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, directed the parties to be prepared to
address the status of section 92 at oral argument, and after
oral argument (at which respondents' counsel declined to
argue that the provision was no longer in force) ordered supplemental briefing on the issue. In their supplemental brief,
respondents urged the court to decide the question, but took
no position on whether section 92 was valid law. The Court
of Appeals did decide the issue, reversing the District
Court's decision and remanding with instructions to enter
judgment for respondents. The court found first that,
though the parties had not on their own questioned the validity of section 92, the court had a "duty" to do so, Independent

at 735. Judge Silberman, dissenting, would have affirmedwithout addressing the validity of section 92, an issue he
thought was not properly before the court. Id., at 413-416,955 F. 2d, at 741-744. The Court of Appeals denied respondents' suggestion for rehearing en banc, with several judgesfiling separate statements. See 296 U. S. App. D. C. 115, 965
F. 2d 1077 (1992).The Bank and the federal parties separately petitioned for
certiorari, both petitions presenting the question whethersection 92 remains in force and the Bank presenting the additional question whether the Court of Appeals properly ad-dressed the issue. Because of a conflict on the important
question whether section 92 is valid law, see American LandTitle Assn. v. Clarke, 968 F. 2d 150, 151-154 (CA2 1992), cert.
pending, Nos. 92-482, 92-645, we granted the petitions. 506U. S. 1032 (1992). We now reverse.

II
Before turning to the status of section 92, we address theBank's threshold question, whether the Court of Appeals

erred in considering the issue at all. Respondents did notchallenge the validity of section 92 before the District Court;
they did not do so in their opening brief in the Court ofAppeals or, despite the court's invitation, at oral argument.
Not until the Court of Appeals ordered supplementalbriefing on the status of section 92 did respondents even urge
the court to resolve the issue, while still taking no positionon the merits. The Bank contends that the Court of Appeals lacked the authority to consider whether section 92remains the law and, alternatively, that it abused its discretion in doing so. There is no need to linger long overeither argument.

446 UNITED STATES NAT. BANK OF ORE. v. INDEPENDENT

INS. AGENTS OF AMERICA, INC.

Opinion of the Court

"The exercise of judicial power under Art. III of the Con-stitution depends on the existence of a case or controversy,"

and "a federal court [lacks] the power to render advisoryopinions."

Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975); see
also Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 97 (1968). The Bank maintains that there was no case or controversy about the valid-ity of section 92, and that in resolving the status of the provision the Court of Appeals violated the Article III prohibitionagainst advisory opinions.

There is no doubt, however, that from the start respond-ents' suit was the "pursuance of an honest and actual antagonistic assertion of rights by one [party] against another,"
Muskrat v. United States, 219 U. S. 346, 359 (1911) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted), that "valuable legal
rights . . . [would] be directly affected to a specific and substantial degree" by a decision on whether the Comptroller's
ruling was proper and lawful, Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co.
v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 262 (1933), and that the Court of
Appeals therefore had before it a real case and controversy
extending to that issue. Though the parties did not lock
horns over the status of section 92, they did clash over
whether the Comptroller properly relied on section 92 as authority for his ruling, and "[w]hen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains
the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law," Kamen v. Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99 (1991), even where the proper
construction is that a law does not govern because it is not
in force. "The judicial Power" extends to cases "arising
under . . . the Laws of the United States," Art. III, $ 2, cl. 1,
and a court properly asked to construe a law has the constitutional power to determine whether the law exists, cf.
Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 405 (1821) ("[I]f, in any controversy depending in a court, the cause should depend on
the validity of such a law, that would be a case arising under

Opinion of the Court
the constitution, to which the judicial power of the UnitedStates would extend") (Marshall, C. J.). The contrary conclusion would permit litigants, by agreeing on the legal issuepresented, to extract the opinion of a court on hypothetical
Acts of Congress or dubious constitutional principles, an
opinion that would be difficult to characterize as anythingbut advisory.

Nor did prudence oblige the Court of Appeals to treat theunasserted argument that section 92 had been repealed as
having been waived. Respondents argued from the start,as we noted, that section 92 was not authority for the Comptroller's ruling, and a court may consider an issue "antecedent to . . . and ultimately dispositive of " the dispute before
it, even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief. Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77 (1990); cf. Cardinal
Chemical Co. v. Morton Int'l, Inc., ante, at 88-89, n. 9 (addressing a legal question as to which the parties agreed on
the answer). The omission of section 92 from the United
States Code, moreover, along with the codifiers' indication
that the provision had been repealed, created honest doubt
about whether section 92 existed as law, and a court "need
not render judgment on the basis of a rule of law whose
nonexistence is apparent on the face of things, simply because the parties agree upon it." United States v. Burke,
504 U. S. 229, 246 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
While the Bank says that by initially accepting the widespread assumption that section 92 remains in force, respondents forfeited their right to have the Court of Appeals consider whether the law exists, "[t]here can be no estoppel in
the way of ascertaining the existence of a law," South Ottawa v. Perkins, 94 U. S. 260, 267 (1877). In addressing the
status of section 92, the Court of Appeals did not stray beyond its constitutional or prudential boundaries.

The Court of Appeals, accordingly, had discretion to consider the validity of section 92, and under the circumstances
did not abuse it. The court was asked to determine under

Opinion of the Court

the APA whether the Comptroller's ruling was in accordancewith a statutory provision that the keepers of the United

States Code had suggested was no longer in force, on appealfrom a District Court justifying its reliance on the law by
the logic that, despite its "inadverten[t] repea[l]," section 92
remained in effect of its own force. 736 F. Supp., at 1163,n. 2. After giving the parties ample opportunity to address

the issue, the Court of Appeals acted without any impropri-ety in refusing to accept what in effect was a stipulation on
a question of law. Cf. Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co.,243 U. S. 281, 289 (1917). We need not decide whether the
Court of Appeals had, as it concluded, a "duty" to addressthe status of section 92 (which would imply error in declining
to do so), for the court's decision to consider the issue was
certainly no abuse of its discretion.

III

A

Though the appearance of a provision in the current edition of the United States Code is "prima facie" evidence thatthe provision has the force of law, 1 U. S. C. $ 204(a), it is

the Statutes at Large that provides the "legal evidence of
laws," $ 112, and despite its omission from the Code section
92 remains on the books if the Statutes at Large so dictates.3
Cf. United States v. Welden, 377 U. S. 95, 98, n. 4 (1964);
Stephan v. United States, 319 U. S. 423, 426 (1943) (per curiam). The analysis that underlies our conclusion that section 92 is valid law calls for familiarity with several provisions appearing in the Statutes at Large. This section
provides the necessary statutory background.

3 When Congress has enacted a title of the Code as positive law (as it
has done, for instance, with Title 11, the Bankruptcy Code, see $ 101, 92
Stat. 2549), the text of the Code provides "legal evidence of the laws." 1
U. S. C. $ 204(a). But Congress has not enacted as positive law Title 12,
in which section 92 for a time appeared.

449Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The background begins in 1863 and 1864, when the Civil
War Congress enacted and then reenacted the National Bank
Act, which launched the modern national banking system by
providing for federal chartering of private commercial banks
and empowering the newly created national banks to issue
and accept a uniform national currency. Act of Feb. 25,
1863, ch. 58, 12 Stat. 665; Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, 13 Stat.
99; see E. Symons, Jr., & J. White, Banking Law 22-25 (3d
ed. 1991); see also 12 U. S. C. $ 38. In a section important
for these cases, the National Bank Act set limits on the
indebtedness of national banks, subject to certain exceptions.
See $ 42, 12 Stat. 677 (1863 Act); $ 36, 13 Stat. 110 (1864 Act).
Ten years later, Congress adopted the indebtedness provision again as part of the Revised Statutes of the United
States, a massive revision, reorganization, and reenactment
of all statutes in effect at the time, accompanied by a simultaneous repeal of all prior ones. Rev. Stat. $$ 1-5601 (1874);
see also Dwan & Feidler, The Federal Statutes--Their History and Use, 22 Minn. L. Rev. 1008, 1012-1015 (1938).4
Title 62 of the Revised Statutes, containing $$ 5133 through
5243, included the Nation's banking laws, and, with a few
stylistic alterations, the National Bank Act's indebtedness
provision became $ 5202 of the Revised Statutes:

Sec. 5202. No association shall at any time be indebted, or in any way liable, to an amount exceeding the
amount of its capital stock at such time actually paid

4 The 1874 edition of the Revised Statutes marked the last time Congress codified United States laws by reenacting all of them. An 1878
edition of the Revised Statutes updated the original Revised Statutes, but
was not enacted as positive law. See Act of Mar. 9, 1878, ch. 26, 20 Stat.
27; Act of Mar. 2, 1877, ch. 82, 19 Stat. 268. In 1919, the House Committee
on the Revision of the Laws of the United States began work on what
eventually became the United States Code, the first edition of which was
published in 1926. See 44 Stat., pt. 1; Dwan & Feidler, 22 Minn. L. Rev.,
at 1018-1021.

In 1913 Congress amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 by adding afifth exception to the indebtedness limit. The amendment
was a detail of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (FederalReserve Act or 1913 Act), which created Federal Reserve
banks and the Federal Reserve Board and required thenational banks formed pursuant to the National Bank Act
to become members of the new Federal Reserve System.Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251; see P. Studenski
& H. Krooss, Financial History of the United States 255-262 (2d ed. 1963). The amendment came in $ 13 of the 1913
Act, the first five paragraphs of which set forth the powers ofthe new Federal Reserve banks, such as the authority to
accept and discount various forms of notes and commercialpaper, including those issued by national banks. Federal
Reserve Act, $ 13, 38 Stat. 263-264. This (subject to ellipsis)followed:

1913 Act, the 1916 Act employed quotation marks, and thosequotation marks proved critical to the Court of Appeals's

12 U. S. C. $ 92. After the quotation marks closed, the 1916Act went on to amend $ 14 of the Federal Reserve Act, introducing the amendment with a phrase not surrounded by quo-tation marks and then placing the revised language of $ 14
within quotation marks. 39 Stat. 754. The pattern was re-peated for amendments of $$ 16, 24, and 25 of the Federal

indebtedness limit:

Opinion of the Court

simply stated: the 1916 Act placed section 92 in Rev. Stat.$ 5202, and the 1918 Act eliminated all of Rev. Stat. $ 5202

except the indebtedness provision (to which it added a sixthexception), thus repealing section 92. Our discussion begins
with the first premise of that argument, and there it ends,for we conclude with petitioners that the 1916 Act placed
section 92 not in Rev. Stat. $ 5202 but in $ 13 of the FederalReserve Act; since the 1918 Act did not touch $ 13, it did not
affect, much less repeal, section 92.A reader following the path of punctuation of the 1916 Act
would no doubt arrive at the opposite conclusion, that thestatute added section 92 to Rev. Stat. $ 5202. The 1916 Act
reads, without quotation marks, Section fifty-two hundredand two of the Revised Statutes of the United States is
hereby amended so as to read as follows.6 39 Stat. 753.That phrase is followed by a colon and then opening quotation marks; closing quotation marks do not appear until sev-eral paragraphs later, and the paragraph that was later codified as 12 U. S. C. $ 92 is one of those within the opening andclosing quotation marks. The unavoidable inference from
familiar rules of punctuation is that the 1916 Act placed sec-tion 92 in Rev. Stat. $ 5202.

A statute's plain meaning must be enforced, of course, andthe meaning of a statute will typically heed the commands
of its punctuation. But a purported plain-meaning analysisbased only on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs
the risk of distorting a statute's true meaning. Along withpunctuation, text consists of words living "a communal existence," in Judge Learned Hand's phrase, the meaning ofeach word informing the others and "all in their aggregate
tak[ing] their purport from the setting in which they areused."

quotations in the text from the 1916 and 1913 Acts appear in italics so as
not to introduce quotation marks absent from the Statutes at Large. See

1941). Over and over we have stressed that "[i]n expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or
member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole
law, and to its object and policy." United States v. Heirs of
Boisdore', 8 How. 113, 122 (1849) (quoted in more than a dozen
cases, most recently Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 35
(1990)); see also King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215,
221 (1991). No more than isolated words or sentences is
punctuation alone a reliable guide for discovery of a statute's
meaning. Statutory construction "is a holistic endeavor,"
United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest
Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988), and, at a minimum,
must account for a statute's full text, language as well as
punctuation, structure, and subject matter.

Here, though the deployment of quotation marks in the
1916 Act points in one direction, all of the other evidence
from the statute points the other way. It points so certainly,
in our view, as to allow only the conclusion that the punctuation marks were misplaced and that the 1916 Act put section
92 not in Rev. Stat. $ 5202 but in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.7

The first thing to notice, we think, is the 1916 Act's structure. The Act begins by stating [t]hat the Act entitled

7 Contrary to respondents' argument, the Marshall Field doctrine does
not preclude us from asking whether the statute means something other
than what the punctuation dictates. The Marshall Field doctrine, indeed, is irrelevant to this case. In Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143
U. S. 649, 672 (1892), the Court stated that a law consists of the "enrolled
bill," signed in open session by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, see also 1 U. S. C. $ 106, but there
is no doubt in these cases that the 1916 Act as printed in the Statutes at
Large is identical to the enrolled bill. The Marshall Field doctrine concerns " `the nature of the evidence' the Court [may] consider in determining whether a bill had actually passed Congress," United States v. MunozFlores, 495 U. S. 385, 391, n. 4 (1990) (quoting Marshall Field, supra, at
670); it places no limits on the evidence a court may consider in determining the meaning of a bill that has passed Congress.

Opinion of the Court
third phrase, which "hereby amended" Rev. Stat. $ 5202, andthat close before the fourth, and the argument that the 1916

Act placed section 92 in Rev. Stat. $ 5202 hinges on the as-sumption that the third phrase is a directory phrase like each
of the others. But the structure of the Act supports another
possibility, that the third phrase does not introduce a newamendment at all. Of the seven phrases, only the third does

not in terms refer to a section of the Federal Reserve Act.Congress, to be sure, was free to take a detour from its work
on the Federal Reserve Act to revise the Revised Statutes.But if Congress had taken that turn, one would expect some
textual indication of the point where once its work on Rev.
Stat. $ 5202 was done it returned to revision of the Federal
Reserve Act. None of the directory phrases that follow the
phrase mentioning Rev. Stat. $ 5202, however, refers back to
the Federal Reserve Act. The failure of the fourth phrase,
for example, to say something like "subsection (e) of section
fourteen of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is hereby
amended" suggests that the Congress never veered from its
original course, that the object of the 1916 Act was singlemindedly to revise sections of the Federal Reserve Act, and
that amending the Revised Statutes was beyond the 1916
law's scope.

Further evidence that the 1916 Act amended only the Federal Reserve Act comes from the 1916 Act's title: An Act To
amend certain sections of the Act entitled "Federal reserve
Act," approved December twenty-third, nineteen hundred
and thirteen. During this era the titles of statutes that revised pre-existing laws appear to have typically mentioned
each of the laws they revised. See, e. g., Act of Sept. 26,
1918, ch. 177, 40 Stat. 967 ("An Act to amend and reenact
sections four, eleven, sixteen, nineteen, and twenty-two of
the Act approved December twenty-third, nineteen hundred
and thirteen, and known as the Federal reserve Act, and sections fifty-two hundred and eight and fifty-two hundred and
nine, Revised Statutes"). Cf. ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 ("Federal

Reserve Act"). Absent a comprehensive review it is impos-sible to know the extent of exceptions to this general rule, if

any, and we would not cast aside the 1916 Act's punctuationbased solely on the Act's title. Nevertheless, the omission
of the Revised Statutes from the 1916 Act's title does provide
supporting evidence for the inference from the Act's struc-ture, that the Act did not amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. Cf.

INS
v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S.183, 189 (1991) (titles within a statute "can aid in resolving

an ambiguity in the legislation's text").One must ask, however, why the 1916 Act stated that

Section fifty-two hundred and two of the Revised Statutes of the
United States is hereby amended so as to read as follows, 39
Stat. 753, if it did not amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. The answer
emerges from comparing the 1916 Act with the statute that
all agree it did amend, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and
noticing that the identical directory phrase appeared in $ 13
of the 1913 Act, which did amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. As enacted in 1913, $ 13 contained several paragraphs granting
powers to Federal Reserve banks; it then included a paragraph amending Rev. Stat. $ 5202 (by adding a fifth exception
to the indebtedness limit for "[l]iabilities incurred under the
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act"), a paragraph that
began Section fifty-two hundred and two of the Revised Statutes of the United States is hereby amended so as to read as
follows. 38 Stat. 264. The 1916 Act, in the portion following the phrase introducing a revision of $ 13 of the 1913 Act,
proceeded in the same manner. It contained several paragraphs granting powers to Federal Reserve banks, paragraphs that are somewhat revised versions of the ones that
appeared in the 1913 Act, followed by the phrase introducing
an amendment to Rev. Stat. $ 5202 and then the language of
Rev. Stat. $ 5202 as it appeared in the 1913 Act. The similarity of the language of the 1916 and 1913 Acts suggests
that, in order to amend $ 13 in 1916, Congress restated the
1913 version of $ 13 in its entirety, revising the portion it

intended to change and leaving the rest unaltered, includingthe portion that had amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202.

In defending the Court of Appeals's contrary conclusionthat the 1916 Act amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202, respondents

argue that any other reading would render meaningless thelanguage in the 1916 Act that purports to amend that section
of the Revised Statutes. But the 1916 Congress would havehad good reason to carry forward that portion of the 1913
Act containing Rev. Stat. $ 5202, even though in 1916 it didnot intend to amend it any further. The 1916 Act revised

$ 13 of the 1913 Act by completely restating it with a mixtureof old and new language (providing that $ 13 is amended "to
read as follows," 39 Stat. 752), and a failure to restate Rev.Stat. $ 5202 with its 1913 amendment could have been taken
to indicate its repeal.The final and decisive evidence that the 1916 Act placed
section 92 in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act rather thanRev. Stat. $ 5202 is provided by the language and subject
matter of section 92 and the paragraphs surrounding it, para-graphs within the same opening and closing quotation marks.
In the paragraph preceding section 92, the 1916 Act grantedthe Federal Reserve Board authority to regulate the

discount and rediscount and the purchase and sale byany Federal reserve bank of any bills receivable and of
domestic and foreign bills of exchange, and of accept-ances authorized by

this Act . . . .

39 Stat. 753 (emphasis added). "[T]his Act" must mean theFederal Reserve Act, since it was $ 13 of the Federal Re9 A comparison of the layout of the two Acts supplies further support
for the conclusion that the 1916 Act restated the 1913 Act in full, and did
not newly amend Rev. Stat. $ 5202. With one exception, a paragraph
break separates each of the introductory phrases in the 1916 Act from the
text that follows within quotation marks. The exception is the phrase
mentioning Rev. Stat. $ 5202, the text within quotation marks following
on the same line after only a space. That, significantly, is precisely the
layout of the amendment to Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in $ 13 of the 1913 Act.

Opinion of the Court

serve Act that granted banks the authority to discount andrediscount. Use of "this Act" in the discount-and-rediscount

paragraph is powerful proof that the 1916 Act placed thatparagraph in the Act to which it necessarily refers, the Federal Reserve Act. That is crucial because section 92 travels
together with the paragraphs that surround it; neither thelanguage nor, certainly, the punctuation of the 1916 Act justifies separating them. Because the 1916 Act placed the para-graph preceding section 92 in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve
Act, it follows that the 1916 Act placed section 92 there too.We are not persuaded by respondents' argument that the
term "this Act" in the discount-and-rediscount paragraph is
an antecedent reference to "the Federal reserve Act," which
is mentioned in the prior paragraph (in the fifth exception
clause of Rev. Stat. $ 5202). 39 Stat. 753; see also 38 Stat.
264 (1913 Act). If respondents are right, then the 1916 Act
may be read as placing the discount-and-rediscount paragraph (and section 92, which necessarily accompanies it) in
Rev. Stat. $ 5202. But while the antecedent interpretation
is arguable as construing "this Act" in the discount-andrediscount paragraph, that reading cannot attach to the other
uses of "this Act" in the 1916 Act, see 39 Stat. 752, 753, 754,
since none is within the vicinity of a reference to the Federal
Reserve Act. Presumptively, " `identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same
meaning,' " Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries,
Inc., ante, at 159 (quoting Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.
v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932)), and since nothing
rebuts that presumption here, we are of the view that each
use of "this Act" in the 1916 Act refers to the Act in which
the language is contained. Rather than aiding respondents,
then, the single full reference to "the Federal reserve Act"
in the portion of the 1916 Act that amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202
cuts against them. The fact that it was not repeated in the
next paragraph confirms that the statute's quotation of Rev.
Stat. $ 5202 had ended.

461Cite as: 508 U. S. 439 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Finally, the subject matter of the discount-and-rediscountparagraph (located, again, within the same opening and closing quotation marks as section 92) confirms that the 1916 Actplaced section 92 in the Federal Reserve Act. The discountand-rediscount paragraph subjects certain powers of FederalReserve banks to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
The logic of locating this provision in the Federal ReserveAct is obvious, whereas there would have been no reason
for Congress to place it in Rev. Stat. $ 5202, which narrowlyaddressed the indebtedness of national banks, or even in the
National Bank Act (from which Rev. Stat. $ 5202 derived),
which concerned not public Federal Reserve banks or the
Federal Reserve Board, but private national banks. Simi-larly, the paragraph following section 92, which authorizes

Federal Reserve banks to acquire foreign drafts or bills ofexchange from member banks and subjects transactions involving foreign acceptances to Federal Reserve Board regu-lations, fits far more comfortably with $ 13 of the Federal
Reserve Act than with Rev. Stat. $ 5202. While we do notdisagree with respondents insofar as they assert that Congress could have placed section 92, granting powers of insurance agency to some national banks (and without mentioningFederal Reserve banks or the Federal Reserve Board), in

Rev. Stat. $ 5202, Congress could also reasonably have dealtwith the insurance provision as part of the Federal Reserve
Act, which Congress had before it for amendment in 1916.There is no need to break that tie, however, because there is
no way around the conclusion that the 1916 Act placed sec-tion 92 in the same statutory location as it must have placed
its neighbors, in $ 13 of the Federal Reserve Act.10

10 Respondents point out that it would not have been absurd for Congress to have amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1916 Act.
We agree, and of course there is no dispute that Congress three years
earlier amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1913 Act. Both
drafting choices strike us as odd, though neither would be without plausible reason. The 1913 Congress might well have thought it convenient to

Opinion of the Court

Against the overwhelming evidence from the structure,
language, and subject matter of the 1916 Act there stands
only the evidence from the Act's punctuation, too weak to
trump the rest. In these unusual cases, we are convinced
that the placement of the quotation marks in the 1916 Act
was a simple scrivener's error, a mistake made by someone
unfamiliar with the law's object and design. Courts, we
have said, should "disregard the punctuation, or repunctuate, if need be, to render the true meaning of the statute."
Hammock v. Loan & Trust Co., 105 U. S. 77, 84-85 (1882)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The true
meaning of the 1916 Act is clear beyond question, and so
we repunctuate. The 1916 Act should be read as if closing
quotation marks do not appear at the end of the paragraph
before the phrase Section fifty-two hundred and two of
the Revised Statutes of the United States is hereby amended
so as to read as follows, 39 Stat. 753, and as if the opening
quotation marks that immediately follow that phrase instead
precede it. Accordingly, the 1916 Act placed within $ 13
of the Federal Reserve Act each of the paragraphs between
the phrases that introduce the amendments to $$ 13 and 14
of the Federal Reserve Act, including the paragraph that
was later codified as 12 U. S. C. $ 92. Because the 1918 Act
did not amend the Federal Reserve Act, it did not repeal

add the exception from Rev. Stat. $ 5202's indebtedness limit for "[l]iabilities incurred under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act" immediately after the language in the Federal Reserve Act that could result in
the liabilities of concern, language that authorized national banks to accept
certain drafts and bills of exchange. 38 Stat. 264. And the 1916 Congress could conceivably have found it similarly convenient to amend Rev.
Stat. $ 5202, which appeared in the Act it was amending at the time. The
point of our analysis, however, is not that Congress could not possibly
have amended Rev. Stat. $ 5202 in the middle of the 1916 Act, but that the
best reading of the Act, despite the punctuation marks, is that Congress
did something else.

Opinion of the Court
section 92, despite the Court of Appeals's conclusion to thecontrary.

11

Section 92 remains in force, and the judgment of the Courtof Appeals is therefore reversed. These cases are remanded

for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

11 Because we conclude that the meaning of the 1916 Act is plain, and
because respondents do not argue that the law's plain meaning is "demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters," Griffin v. Oceanic
Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 571 (1982), we need not consider the 1916
Act's legislative history. Nor need we consider, again because the statute's meaning is unambiguous, what if any weight to accord the longstanding assumption of both the Comptroller and the Federal Reserve Board
that section 92 survived the 1918 amendment of Rev. Stat. $ 5202. See
Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158, 171
(1989).

We note finally, since respondents raise the point, that our remark in
Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 502 (1936), that the 1916 Act
"amends [sections of the Federal Reserve Act], and $ 5202 of the Revised
Statutes" is obviously not controlling, coming as it did in an opinion that
did not present the question we decide in these cases. Were we to consider our past remarks about the statutes we discuss here, we would also
have to account for Commissioner v. First Security Bank of Utah, N. A.,
405 U. S., at 401-402, and n. 12, in which the Court treated section 92 as
valid law, despite noting its absence from the United States Code. Neither case tells us anything helpful for resolving this one, though together
they contain a valuable reminder about the need to distinguish an opinion's
holding from its dicta.

RAKE et al. v. WADE, TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 92-621. Argued March 22, 1993--Decided June 7, 1993
At the time they initiated separate Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings,

petitioners, two pairs of debtors, and another married couple were in
arrears on long-term promissory notes held by respondent Wade, which
were secured by the debtors' home mortgages and did not provide for
interest on arrearages. The value of the residence owned by each pair
exceeded each note's outstanding balance, making Wade an oversecured
creditor. In their Chapter 13 plans, the debtors proposed to make all
future payments due on the notes and cure the default on the mortgages
by paying off the arrearages without interest. Wade objected to each
plan on the ground that he was entitled to interest and attorney's fees,
but the Bankruptcy Court overruled the objections, and the District
Court affirmed. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that $ 506(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code entitled Wade to postpetition interest on the
arrearages and other charges, even if the mortgage instruments were
silent on the subject and state law would not require interest to be paid.

Held: Wade is entitled to preconfirmation and postconfirmation interest

on arrearages paid off under petitioners' plans. Pp. 467-475.

(a) Three interrelated Bankruptcy Code provisions determine
whether Wade is entitled to interest. Section 506(b) provides holders
of oversecured claims with an unqualified right to postpetition interest,
regardless of whether the agreement giving rise to the claim provides
for interest, United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,
241, until a plan's confirmation date. Section 1322(b)(2) prohibits debtors from modifying the rights of home mortgage lenders, while

$ 1322(b)(5) authorizes debtors to cure any defaults on a long-term debt
and maintain payments on the debt for the life of the plan. Finally,

$ 1325(a)(5) states that "with respect to each allowed secured claim
provided for by the plan," a plan may be confirmed if, inter alia, the
holder of the claim retains the lien, $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(i), and the value of
the property distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not
less than the claim's present dollar value as of the confirmation date,

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). Pp. 467-470.

(b) Under $ 506(b)'s clear language, Wade is entitled to preconfirmation interest on the arrearages. That section directs that postpetition
interest be paid on all oversecured claims, Ron Pair, supra, at 245, and

465Cite as: 508 U. S. 464 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
the parties have acknowledged that such interest accrues from the petition date until a plan is confirmed. Section 1322(b)(5) does not operate
to the exclusion of $ 506(b). While it authorizes a plan to provide for
payments on arrearages to effectuate a cure after the plan's effective
date, it does not dictate the cure's terms. Specifically, it gives no indication that the arrearages cured under the plan may not include interest
otherwise available under $ 506(b). This construction of the provisions
gives effect to both. Pp. 470-472.

(c) Wade is also entitled to postconfirmation interest under $ 1325(a)
(5). There is no support for petitioners' claim that $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii)
applies only to secured claims that have been modified by a Chapter 13
plan and thus does not apply to home mortgages which, under $ 1322(b),
are exempt from modification. The plans essentially split each of
Wade's claims into two claims--the underlying debt and the arrearages.
While payments on the underlying debt were simply "maintained," each
plan treated the arrearages as a distinct claim to be paid off within the
life of the plan pursuant to its repayment schedule. Thus, the arrearages, which are part of Wade's home mortgage claims, were "provided
for" by the plans, and he is entitled to interest under $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).
Other provisions of Chapter 13 containing the phrase "provided for by
the plan" make clear that petitioners' plans provided for Wade's claims.

Opinion of the Court
pursuant to $ 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C.$ 1322(b)(5), must pay postpetition interest on the arrearages. We conclude that the holder of the mortgage is enti-tled to such interest under $$ 506(b) and 1325(a)(5) of the
Code. I

Petitioners Donald and Linda Rake, petitioners Earnestand Mary Yell, and respondents Ronnie and Rosetta Hannon 1 initiated three separate Chapter 13 bankruptcy pro-ceedings in the Northern District of Oklahoma. In each
case the debtors were in arrears on a long-term promissorynote assigned to respondent William J. Wade, trustee (hereinafter respondent). The notes allowed a $5 charge for eachmissed payment but did not provide for interest on arrearages. Payment on the notes was secured by a first mort-gage on the principal residence owned by each pair of debtors. The mortgage instruments provided that in the eventof a default by the debtors, the holder of the note (now respondent as assignee) had the right to declare the remainderof indebtedness due and payable and to foreclose on the property. Because the value of the residence owned by each pairof debtors exceeded the outstanding balance on the corresponding notes, respondent was an oversecured creditor.In their Chapter 13 plans the debtors proposed to pay
directly to respondent all future payments of principal and
interest due on the notes. The plans also provided that thedebtors would cure the default on the mortgages by paying

off the arrearages, without interest, over the terms of theplans. Respondent objected to each plan, on the ground
that he was entitled to attorney's fees and interest on thearrearages. The Bankruptcy Court overruled respondent's
objections, and respondent appealed to the District Court forthe Northern District of Oklahoma, which consolidated the

cases and affirmed. The District Court held that the Chap-ter 13 provisions relating to the "curing of defaults"--11

U. S. C. $$ 1322(b)(2) and 1322(b)(5)--"do not alter the con-tract between the parties governing such matters as interest, if any, to be paid on arrearage," and that allowing inter-est on arrearages would be "improper," since the notes did
not provide for it. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-24.The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
reversed. Wade v. Hannon, 968 F. 2d 1036 (1992). Thecourt held that $ 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, as interpreted in United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489U. S. 235 (1989), entitles an oversecured creditor to postpetition interest on arrearages and other charges paid off undera Chapter 13 plan, "even if the mortgage instruments are
silent on the subject and state law would not require interestto be paid." 968 F. 2d, at 1042. The Tenth Circuit relied in
part on the Sixth Circuit's decision in In re Colgrove, 771F. 2d 119 (1985), which reached the same result but rested
its decision on $ 1325(a)(5) as well as $ 506(b) of the Bank-ruptcy Code. Four other Courts of Appeals have held that
under the "cure" and "modification" provisions of $ 1322(b)a mortgagee is not entitled to interest on home mortgage
arrearages.2 We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.506 U. S. 972 (1992).

Opinion of the Court
whether respondent is entitled to interest on those arrearages: $$ 506(b), 1322(b), and 1325(a)(5).

Section 506(b), which applies to Chapter 13 proceedings
pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 103(a), provides that holders of
oversecured claims are "allowed" postpetition interest on
their claims.4 In Ron Pair we held that the right to postpetition interest under $ 506(b) is "unqualified" and exists regardless of whether the agreement giving rise to the claim
provides for interest. 489 U. S., at 241. It is generally recognized that the interest allowed by $ 506(b) will accrue until
payment of the secured claim or until the effective date of
the plan. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy || 506.05, p. 506-43,
and n. 5c (15th ed. 1993) (hereinafter Collier). Respondent
concedes, and his amicus the United States agrees, that because $ 506(b) "has the effect of allowing a claim to the creditor, . . . the rights granted under Section 506(b) are relevant
only until confirmation of the plan." Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 11, n. 7. Accord, Tr. of Oral Arg. 24, 34.
Petitioners also agree that $ 506(b) applies only from the date
of filing through the confirmation date. Brief for Petitioners
10, 13.

Two paragraphs of $ 1322(b) are relevant here: $$ 1322(b)
(2) and 1322(b)(5). Section 1322(b)(2) authorizes debtors to
modify the rights of secured claim holders, but it provides
protection for home mortgage lenders by creating a specific
"no modification" exception for holders of claims secured only

4 Section 506(b) states: "To the extent that an allowed secured claim is
secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there
shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and
any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement
under which such claim arose." Under this provision, an oversecured
creditor is entitled to postpetition interest on its claim only "to the extent
that such interest, when added to the principal amount of the claim," does
not "exceed the value of the collateral." United Savings Assn. of Texas
v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 372 (1988).

Opinion of the Court
by a lien on the debtor's principal residence.5 Section1322(b)(5) expressly authorizes debtors to cure any defaults

on a long-term debt, such as a mortgage, and to maintainpayments on the debt during the life of the plan.

6 Under

$ 1322(b)(5), a plan may provide for the curing of any defaultsand the maintenance of payments on a long-term debt "notwithstanding" $ 1322(b)(2)'s prohibition against modificationsof the rights of home mortgage lenders.

The final provision bearing on this case--$ 1325(a)(5)--states that "with respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan," one of three requirements must besatisfied before the plan may be confirmed: (1) the holder
of the claim has accepted the plan, $ 1325(b)(5)(A); (2)the debtor surrenders the property securing such claim
to the secured creditor, $ 1325(a)(5)(C); or (3) the holder ofthe secured claim retains the lien securing such claim,

$ 1325(a)(5)(B)(i), and "the value, as of the effective date ofthe plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on
account of such claim is not less than the allowed amountof such claim," $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). Thus, unless the creditor
accepts the plan or the debtor surrenders the collateral tothe creditor, $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) guarantees that property distributed under a plan on account of a claim, including de-ferred cash payments in satisfaction of the claim, see 5 Collier || 1325.06[4][b][ii], must equal the present dollar value ofsuch claim as of the confirmation date. Petitioners, respondent, and the United States agree that "[s]ection 1325(a)(5)(B)

rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a
security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence,
or of holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders
of any class of claims."

6 Section 1322(b)(5) states that "notwithstanding" $ 1322(b)(2), a plan

may "provide for the curing of any default within a reasonable time and
maintenance of payments while the case is pending on any unsecured claim
or secured claim on which the last payment is due after the date on which

Curiae 11-12, and n. 8. III

Although petitioners and respondent generally agree asto the requirements of $$ 506(b) and 1325(a)(5), petitioners
argue that those provisions do not apply when the debtorcures a default on a home mortgage under $ 1322(b)(5).
Some courts have construed the "cure" and "modification"provisions of $ 1322(b) so broadly as to render $$ 506(b) and
1325(a)(5) inapplicable to the curing of defaults on homemortgages.

E. g., Landmark Financial Services v. Hall,918 F. 2d 1150, 1153-1155 (CA4 1990). Petitioners contend

that this is precisely what $ 1322(b) requires.

A
Turning first to $ 506(b), petitioners concede that respond-ent holds an oversecured claim, which includes arrearages

7

and that " `an oversecured creditor is ordinarily entitled toan allowance for postpetition interest on its secured claim

under Chapter 13.' " Reply Brief for Petitioners 2 (quoting
In re Laguna, 944 F. 2d 542, 544 (CA9 1991) (footnote omit-ted), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 966 (1992)). They argue, however, that $ 1322(b)(5) "operate[s] to the exclusion of the pro-visions of $ 506(b)," Brief for Petitioners 9, and that $ 506(b)
thus "does not require the payment of . . . preconfirmationinterest on home mortgage arrearages in Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings," Reply Brief for Petitioners 1. Because$ 1322(b)(5) does not expressly negate $ 506(b), petitioners
suggest that " `[d]espite some broad language in Ron Pair,

. . . $ 506(b) is inapplicable in the context of [Chapter 13]mortgage cures.' " Brief for Petitioners 13 (quoting

Hall,
supra, at 1154).Petitioners' interpretation of $$ 506(b) and 1322(b)(5) does

not comport with the terms of those provisions. Under

$ 506(b) the holder of an oversecured claim is allowed intereston his claim to the extent of the value of the collateral. Section 506(b) "directs that postpetition interest be paid on alloversecured claims,"

Ron Pair, 489 U. S., at 245 (emphasis
added), and, as the parties acknowledge, such interest ac-crues as part of the allowed claim from the petition date until

the confirmation or effective date of the plan. See supra, at
468. The arrearages owed on the mortgages held by respondent are plainly part of respondent's oversecured claims.
Under the unqualified terms of $ 506(b), therefore, respondent is entitled to preconfirmation interest on these arrearages. Where the statutory language is clear, our " `sole
function . . . is to enforce it according to its terms.' " Ron
Pair, supra, at 241 (quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242
U. S. 470, 485 (1917)). Accord, Connecticut Nat. Bank v.
Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992).

Section 1322(b)(5), on the other hand, states that a Chapter
13 plan may "provide for the curing of any default and
the maintenance of payments" on certain claims. While

$ 1322(b)(5) authorizes a Chapter 13 plan to provide for payments on arrearages to effectuate a cure after the effective
date of the plan, nothing in that provision dictates the terms
of the cure. In particular, $ 1322(b)(5) provides no indication
that the allowed amount of the arrearages cured under the
plan may not include interest otherwise available as part of
the oversecured claim under $ 506(b). We generally avoid
construing one provision in a statute so as to suspend or
supersede another provision. To avoid "deny[ing] effect to
a part of a statute," we accord " `significance and effect . . .
to every word.' " Ex parte Public Nat. Bank of New York,

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 112, 115 (1879)). Construing $$ 506(b) and 1322(b)(5)together, and giving effect to both, we conclude that

$ 1322(b)(5) authorizes a debtor to cure a default on a homemortgage by making payments on arrearages under a Chapter 13 plan, and that where the mortgagee's claim is over-secured, $ 506(b) entitles the mortgagee to preconfirmation
interest on such arrearages.

B
Petitioners make virtually the same argument with re-spect to postconfirmation interest under $ 1325(a)(5). Petitioners concede that under $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) secured credi-tors are entitled to the "present value of [their] claims, which
implies the payment of interest." Reply Brief for Petition-ers 5.

8 Petitioners contend, however, that $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii)

"applies only to secured claims which have been modifiedin the Chapter 13 plan, and which, by reason of Section

1322(b)(2), may not include home mortgages." Ibid. Sincenothing in the Code states that $ 1325(a)(5) applies only to
"modified" claims, petitioners turn to those Court of Appealsdecisions that have held that "the legislative history indicates that $ 1322(b) was intended to create a special excep-tion to $ 1325(a)(5)(B)."

Hall, 918 F. 2d, at 1154-1155; Appeal of Capps, 836 F. 2d 773,776 (CA3 1987).

8 When a claim is paid off pursuant to a stream of future payments, a
creditor receives the "present value" of its claim only if the total amount
of the deferred payments includes the amount of the underlying claim
plus an appropriate amount of interest to compensate the creditor for the
decreased value of the claim caused by the delayed payments. This generally involves a determination of an appropriate discount rate and a discounting of the stream of deferred payments back to the present dollar
value of the claim at confirmation. See 5 Collier || 1325.06[4][b][iii][B].
Because the issue is not presented in this case, we express no view on the
appropriate rate of interest that debtors must pay on arrearages cured
pursuant to $ 1322(b)(5).

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners' interpretation of $$ 1322(b) and 1325(a)(5) isrefuted by the plain language of the Code. Section

1325(a)(5) applies by its terms to "each allowed secured claimprovided for by the plan." The most natural reading of the
phrase to "provid[e] for by the plan" is to "make a provisionfor" or "stipulate to" something in a plan. See,

e. g., Ameri-can Heritage Dictionary 1053 (10th ed. 1981) ("provide for"

defined as "to make a stipulation or condition"). Petitioners'plans clearly "provided for" respondent's home mortgage
claims by establishing repayment schedules for the satisfac-tion of the arrearages portion of those claims. As authorized by $ 1322(b)(5), the plans essentially split each of re-spondent's secured claims into two separate claims--the
underlying debt and the arrearages. While payments ofprincipal and interest on the underlying debts were simply
"maintained" according to the terms of the mortgage docu-ments during the pendency of petitioners' cases, each plan
treated the arrearages as a distinct claim to be paid offwithin the life of the plan pursuant to repayment schedules
established by the plans. Thus, the arrearages, which are apart of respondent's home mortgage claims, were "provided
for" by the plans, and respondent is entitled to interest onthem under $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).

9

9 Petitioners' argument that "modified" claims cannot include home
mortgage claims that have been "cured" does not withstand scrutiny.
When a plan cures a default and reinstates payments on a claim, the
creditor's contractual rights arising from the default--which in this case
included the right to declare all payments due and payable, accelerate
the debt, possess the property, collect rents generated by the property,
and foreclose on the property, see App. 14-15, 29-30--are abrogated
and therefore "modified." These modifications are allowed under $ 1322
(b)(5) "notwithstanding" the fact that $ 1322(b)(2) generally prohibits
the modification of the rights of home mortgage holders. Petitioners'
construction of $ 1322(b)(2) also leads to the incongruous result that only
home mortgage claims would be denied the benefits of $ 1325(a)(5). By
prohibiting modifications of the rights of holders of home mortgage claims,
Congress could not have intended, in our view, to afford the holders of
these claims less protection than the holders of other secured claims.

474 RAKE v. WADE

Opinion of the Court
Other provisions of Chapter 13 containing the phrase "pro-vided for by the plan" make clear that petitioners' plans provided for respondent's home mortgage claim. See United
Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (statutory terms are often
"clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme--becausethe same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that

makes [their] meaning clear, or because only one of the per-missible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law") (citation omitted). Title 11U. S. C. $ 1328(a) (1988 ed., Supp. III), for example, utilizes
the phrase "provided for by the plan" in dealing with thedischarge of debts under Chapter 13.

10 As used in $ 1328(a),

that phrase is commonly understood to mean that a plan"makes a provision" for, "deals with," or even "refers to" a

claim. See 5 Collier || 1328.01, at 1328-9. In addition,

$ 1328(a) unmistakably contemplates that a plan "provides
for" a claim when the plan cures a default and allows for the
maintenance of regular payments on that claim, as authorized by $ 1322(b)(5). Section 1328(a) states that "all debts
provided for by the plan" are dischargeable, and then lists
three exceptions.11 One type of claim that is "provided for
by the plan" yet excepted from discharge under $ 1328(a) is

10 Section 1328(a) provides:
"As soon as practicable after completion by the debtor of all payments
under the plan, unless the court approves a written waiver of discharge
executed by the debtor after the order for relief under this chapter, the
court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the
plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any debt--

"(1) provided for under section 1322(b)(5) of this title;
"(2) of the kind specified in paragraph (5) or (8) of section 523(a) or
523(a)(9) of this title; or

"(3) for restitution included in a sentence on the debtor's conviction of
a crime."

11 Section 1328(a)(1) refers to "debts" rather than claims, but a debt

under the Code is simply "liability on a claim." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(12) (1988
ed., Supp. III).

not "provided for by the plan," there would be no reasonto make an exception for them in $ 1328(a)(1). Under

Syllabus

WISCONSIN v. MITCHELL
certiorari to the supreme court of wisconsin

No. 92-515. Argued April 21, 1993--Decided June 11, 1993
Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim
on account of the victim's race. The State Court of Appeals rejected
his challenge to the law's constitutionality, but the State Supreme Court
reversed. Relying on R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, it held that the
statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the legislature
has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the State's contention
that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional victim selection.
It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because
the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech would have a chilling
effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted for offenses subject to
penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished antidiscrimination laws,
which have long been held constitutional, on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination, whereas the state statute punishes
the subjective mental process.

Held: Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing him.
Pp. 483-490.

(a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by a state
court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme Court did
not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining the meaning
of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized the statute's
practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus, after resolving
any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this Court may form its own
judgment about the law's operative effect. The State's argument that
the statute punishes only conduct does not dispose of Mitchell's claim,
since the fact remains that the same criminal conduct is more heavily
punished if the victim is selected because of his protected status than if
no such motive obtains. Pp. 483-485.

(b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges have
traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition to evidence
bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing judge may not take
into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs, however obnoxious to
most people, the Constitution does not erect a per se barrier to the

admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are protected by the First Amendment.
Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U. S. 159; Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939
(plurality opinion). That Dawson and Barclay did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement provision does not make them inapposite. Barclay involved the consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence a defendant to death, the most severe
"enhancement" of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under
the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination
laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge. Nothing in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, supra, compels a different result here. The
ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at speech, while the one
here is aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what it sees as the greater individual
and societal harm inflicted by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for the provision over and above mere disagreement
with offenders' beliefs or biases. Pp. 485-488.

(c) Because the statute has no "chilling effect" on free speech, it is
not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect of a citizen suppressing
his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he commits a serious offense against
person or property is too speculative a hypothesis to support this claim.
Moreover, the First Amendment permits the admission of previous
declarations or statements to establish the elements of a crime or to
prove motive or intent, subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and the like. Haupt v. United States, 330 U. S. 631.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the
Court.

Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's race. The question presented
in this case is whether this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold
that it is not.

On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black
men and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment

Opinion of the Court
complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the
group discussed a scene from the motion picture "Mississippi
Burning," in which a white man beat a young black boy who
was praying. The group moved outside and Mitchell asked
them: " `Do you all feel hyped up to move on some white
people?' " Brief for Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, a
young white boy approached the group on the opposite side
of the street where they were standing. As the boy walked
by, Mitchell said: " `You all want to fuck somebody up?
There goes a white boy; go get him.' " Id., at 4-5. Mitchell
counted to three and pointed in the boy's direction. The
group ran toward the boy, beat him severely, and stole his
tennis shoes. The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four days.

After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County,
Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis. Stat.

$$ 939.05 and 940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. $$ 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e). But because the jury
found that Mitchell had intentionally selected his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for Mitchell's
offense was increased to seven years under $ 939.645. That
provision enhances the maximum penalty for an offense
whenever the defendant "[i]ntentionally selects the person
against whom the crime . . . is committed . . . because of the
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry of that person . . . ." $ 939.645(1)(b).1

1 At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
statute provided:

"(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties for the underlying
crime are increased as provided in sub. (2):

"(a) Commits a crime under chs. 939 to 948.
"(b) Intentionally selects the person against whom the crime under par.
(a) is committed or selects the property which is damaged or otherwise
affected by the crime under par. (a) because of the race, religion, color,

Opinion of the Court
The Circuit Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprison-ment for the aggravated battery.

Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief inthe Circuit Court. Then he appealed his conviction and
sentence, challenging the constitutionality of Wiscon-sin's penalty-enhancement provision on First Amendment
grounds.2 The Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Mitch-ell's challenge, 163 Wis. 2d 652, 473 N. W. 2d 1 (1991), but the
Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court
disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of that person or
the owner or occupant of that property.

"(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily a misdemeanor other than a Class A misdemeanor, the revised maximum fine is
$10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment is one year in
the county jail.

"(b) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily a Class A misdemeanor, the penalty increase under this section changes the status of the
crime to a felony and the revised maximum fine is $10,000 and the revised
maximum period of imprisonment is 2 years.

"(c) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is a felony, the maximum fine
prescribed by law for the crime may be increased by not more than $5,000
and the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed by law for the crime
may be increased by not more than 5 years.

"(3) This section provides for the enhancement of the penalties applicable for the underlying crime. The court shall direct that the trier of fact
find a special verdict as to all of the issues specified in sub. (1).

"(4) This section does not apply to any crime if proof of race, religion,
color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry is required
for a conviction for that crime." Wis. Stat. $ 939.645 (1989-1990).

The statute was amended in 1992, but the amendments are not at issue in
this case.

2 Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment equal

protection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held
that Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and rejected his vagueness
challenge outright. 163 Wis. 2d 652, 473 N. W. 2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address both claims. 169 Wis. 2d 153, 158,
n. 2, 485 N. W. 2d 807, 809, n. 2 (1992). Mitchell renews his Fourteenth
Amendment claims in this Court. But since they were not developed
below and plainly fall outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do not reach them either.

482 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELL

Opinion of the Court
held that the statute "violates the First Amendment directlyby punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive

thought." 169 Wis. 2d 153, 163, 485 N. W. 2d 807, 811 (1992).It rejected the State's contention "that the statute punishes
only the `conduct' of intentional selection of a victim." Id.,at 164, 485 N. W. 2d, at 812. According to the court, "[t]he
statute punishes the `because of ' aspect of the defendant'sselection, the

reason the defendant selected the victim, themotive behind the selection." Ibid. (emphasis in original).

And under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), "theWisconsin legislature cannot criminalize bigoted thought
with which it disagrees." 169 Wis. 2d, at 171, 485 N. W. 2d,at 815.

The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. It
reasoned that, in order to prove that a defendant intention-ally selected his victim because of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to introduce evidence of thedefendant's prior speech, such as racial epithets he may have
uttered before the commission of the offense. This eviden-tiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would have
a "chilling effect" on those who feared the possibility ofprosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement.
See id., at 174, 485 N. W. 2d, at 816. Finally, the court dis-tinguished antidiscrimination laws, which have long been
held constitutional, on the ground that the Wisconsin statutepunishes the "subjective mental process" of selecting a victim because of his protected status, whereas antidiscrimina-tion laws prohibit "objective acts of discrimination."

Id., at176, 485 N. W. 2d, at 817.

We granted certiorari because of the importance of thequestion presented and the existence of a conflict of author3 Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have upheld it. See

ity among state high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision,4
506 U. S. 1033 (1992). We reverse.

Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted
thought and not conduct. There is no doubt that we are
bound by a state court's construction of a state statute.
R. A. V., supra, at 381; New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,
769, n. 24 (1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).
In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts had defined
the term " `breach of the peace,' " in a city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include " `stirs the public to anger
. . . or creates a disturbance.' " Id., at 4. We held this con4 Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions similar
to the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code
Ann. $ 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp. 1993); Fla. Stat. $ 775.085 (1991); Mont.
Code Ann. $ 45-5-222 (1992); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, $ 1455 (Supp. 1992).
Proposed federal legislation to the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H. R. 4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed to
pass the Senate, S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state high
courts are divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,
e. g., State v. Plowman, 314 Ore. 157, 838 P. 2d 558 (1992) (upholding Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St. 3d 566, 597 N. E. 2d
450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis. 2d 153, 485 N. W. 2d 807
(1992) (case below) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,
bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States. See,
e. g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium et al.
as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici
Curiae 4-7; Brief for the City of Atlanta et al. as Amici Curiae 3-12. In
1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, Pub. L. 101-275,

$ 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp.
III), directing the Attorney General to compile data "about crimes that
manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,
or ethnicity." Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
reported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of intimidation, 1,301 incidents of
vandalism, 796 simple assaults, 773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders.

Opinion of the Court
struction to be binding on us. But here the Wisconsin Su-preme Court did not, strictly speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining the meaning of aparticular statutory word or phrase. Rather, it merely
characterized the "practical effect" of the statute for First
Amendment purposes. See 169 Wis. 2d, at 166-167, 485N. W. 2d, at 813 ("Merely because the statute refers in a

literal sense to the intentional `conduct' of selecting, does notmean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought").This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities as
to the meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form our
own judgment as to its operative effect.

The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted
thought, as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead
punishes only conduct. While this argument is literally
correct, it does not dispose of Mitchell's First Amendment
challenge. To be sure, our cases reject the "view that an
apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled
`speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376 (1968); accord, R. A. V., supra,
at 385-386; Spence v. Washington, 418 U. S. 405, 409 (1974)
(per curiam); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 555 (1965).
Thus, a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.
See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 628
(1984) ("[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their
communicative impact . . . are entitled to no constitutional
protection"); NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S.
886, 916 (1982) ("The First Amendment does not protect
violence").

But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the
same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the
victim is selected because of his race or other protected sta508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT

485Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
tus than if no such motive obtained. Thus, although thestatute punishes criminal conduct, it enhances the maximum

penalty for conduct motivated by a discriminatory point ofview more severely than the same conduct engaged in for
some other reason or for no reason at all. Because the only
reason for the enhancement is the defendant's discriminatorymotive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates theFirst Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.

Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a widevariety of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in
determining what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820-821 (1991);
United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972); Williams
v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949). The defendant's motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See
1 W. LeFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 3.6(b),
p. 324 (1986) ("Motives are most relevant when the trial
judge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommon
for a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because he
was acting with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad motives"); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.

137, 156 (1987) ("Deeply ingrained in our legal tradition is
the idea that the more purposeful is the criminal conduct,
the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the more severely it ought to be punished"). Thus, in many States the
commission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the
capital sentencing statute. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 13-703(F)(5) (1989); Fla. Stat. $ 921.1415(f) (Supp. 1992);
Miss. Code Ann. $ 99-19-101(5)(f) (Supp. 1992); N. C. Gen.
Stat. $ 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo. Stat. $ 6-2-102(h)(vi)
(Supp. 1992).

But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into
consideration by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware,

508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT
486 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELL

Opinion of the Court
503 U. S. 159 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced evidence at a capital sentencing hearing that the defendant was
a member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because "the
evidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstract
beliefs," we held that its admission violated the defendant's
First Amendment rights. Id., at 167. In so holding, however, we emphasized that "the Constitution does not erect a
per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because those
beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment." Id., at 165. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S.
939 (1983) (plurality opinion), we allowed the sentencing
judge to take into account the defendant's racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed that
the defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Army
and desire to provoke a "race war" were related to the murder of a white man for which he was convicted. See id.,
at 942-944. Because "the elements of racial hatred in [the]
murder" were relevant to several aggravating factors, we
held that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence into
account in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,
and n. 7.

Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite
because they did not involve application of a penaltyenhancement provision. But in Barclay we held that it was
permissible for the sentencing court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe "enhancement" of all.
And the fact that the Wisconsin Legislature has decided, as a
general matter, that bias-motivated offenses warrant greater
maximum penalties across the board does not alter the result
here. For the primary responsibility for fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S.
263, 274 (1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393
(1958).

487Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancementstatute is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays thesame role under the Wisconsin statute as it does under
federal and state antidiscrimination laws, which we have
previously upheld against constitutional challenge. See
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S., at 628; Hishon
v. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 78 (1984); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 176 (1976). Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, for example, makes it unlawful for anemployer to discriminate against an employee "

because of
such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."
42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, we
rejected the argument that Title VII infringed employers'
First Amendment rights. And more recently, in R. A. V. v.
St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 389-390, we cited Title VII (as well as
18 U. S. C. $ 242 and 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible content-neutral regulation of conduct.

Nothing in our decision last Term in R. A. V. compels a
different result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to a municipal ordinance prohibiting the use
of " `fighting words' that insult, or provoke violence, `on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.' " 505 U. S., at
391 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St.
Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance only proscribed a class of "fighting words" deemed
particularly offensive by the city--i. e., those "that contain
. . . messages of `bias-motivated' hatred," 505 U. S., at 392--
we held that it violated the rule against content-based
discrimination. See id., at 392-394. But whereas the
ordinance struck down in R. A. V. was explicitly directed
at expression (i. e., "speech" or "messages"), id., at 392,
the statute in this case is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment.

Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is thought

508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT
488 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELL

Opinion of the Court
to inflict greater individual and societal harm. For example,according to the State and its

amici, bias-motivated crimes
are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinctemotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest. See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers' Commit-tee for Civil Rights Under Law as

Amicus Curiae 18-22;
Brief for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus
Curiae 17-19; Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al.
as Amici Curiae 9-10; Brief for Congressman Charles E.Schumer et al. as

Amici Curiae 8-9. The State's desire to
redress these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision over and above
mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases. As
Blackstone said long ago, "it is but reasonable that among
crimes of different natures those should be most severely
punished, which are the most destructive of the public safety
and happiness." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.

Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because of its "chilling effect" on free speech. Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that
the statute is "overbroad" because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations may be used to prove that
the defendant intentionally selected his victim on account of
the victim's protected status. Consequently, the argument
goes, the statute impermissibly chills free expression with
respect to such matters by those concerned about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We find no
merit in this contention.

The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated
and unlikely than that contemplated in traditional "overbreadth" cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin
citizen suppressing his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear
that if he later commits an offense covered by the statute,

508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT

489Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
these opinions will be offered at trial to establish that heselected his victim on account of the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty enhancement. To staywithin the realm of rationality, we must surely put to one
side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute,
such as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis. Stat.$ 941.01 (1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, to

conceive of a situation where such offenses would be raciallymotivated. We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen
suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of suchbeliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he commits
a more serious offense against person or property. This is
simply too speculative a hypothesis to support Mitchell's
overbreadth claim.

The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime
or to prove motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations or statements is commonly admitted in
criminal trials subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and the like. Nearly half a century ago, in
Haupt v. United States, 330 U. S. 631 (1947), we rejected a
contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt
was tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the
Constitution (Art. III, $ 3), may depend very much on proof
of motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out of "adherence to the enemy" rather than "parental
solicitude," id., at 641, the Government introduced evidence
of conversations that had taken place long prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements showing
Haupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argument
that this evidence was improperly admitted. While "[s]uch
testimony is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the
statements are not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion with our own government or quite
proper appreciation of the land of birth," we held that "these

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY

et al. v. FABE, SUPERINTENDENT OFINSURANCE OF OHIO

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-1513. Argued December 8, 1992--Decided June 11, 1993
In proceedings under Ohio law to liquidate an insolvent insurance company, the United States asserted that its claims as obligee on various of
the company's surety bonds were entitled to first priority under 31
U. S. C. $ 3713(a)(1)(A)(iii). Respondent Fabe, the liquidator appointed
by the state court, brought a declaratory judgment action in the Federal
District Court to establish that priority in such proceedings is governed
by an Ohio statute that ranks governmental claims behind (1) administrative expenses, (2) specified wage claims, (3) policyholders' claims, and
(4) general creditors' claims. Fabe argued that the federal priority
statute does not pre-empt the Ohio law because the latter falls within

$ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which provides, inter alia: "No
Act of Congress shall be construed to . . . supersede any law enacted by
any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . ."
The court granted summary judgment for the United States on the
ground that the state statute does not involve the "business of insurance" under the tripartite standard articulated in Union Labor Life Ins.
Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119, 129. The Court of Appeals disagreed and,
in reversing, held that the Ohio scheme regulates the "business of insurance" because it protects the interests of the insured.

Held: The Ohio priority statute escapes federal pre-emption to the extent

that it protects policyholders, but it is not a law enacted for the purpose of
regulating the business of insurance to the extent that it is designed to
further the interests of creditors other than policyholders. Pp. 499-510.

(a) The McCarran-Ferguson Act's primary purpose was to restore to
the States broad authority to tax and regulate the insurance industry
in response to United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322
U. S. 533. Pp. 499-500.

(b) The Ohio statute, to the extent that it regulates policyholders, is
a law enacted "for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."
Because that phrase refers to statutes aimed at protecting or regulating,
directly or indirectly, the relationship between the insurance company
and its policyholders, SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U. S. 453,
460, the federal priority statute must yield to the conflicting Ohio stat508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
ute to the extent that the latter furthers policyholders' interests. Pireno does not support petitioners' argument to the contrary, since the
actual performance of an insurance contract satisfies each prong of the
Pireno test: performance of the terms of an insurance policy (1) facilitates the transfer of risk from the insured to the insurer; (2) is central
to the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and (3)
is confined entirely to entities within the insurance industry. Thus,
such actual performance is an essential part of the "business of insurance." Because the Ohio statute is integrally related to the performance of insurance contracts after bankruptcy, it is a law "enacted . . . for
the purpose of regulating the business of insurance" within the meaning
of $ 2(b). This plain reading of the McCarran-Ferguson Act comports
with the statute's purpose. Pp. 500-506.

(c) Petitioners' contrary interpretation based on the legislative history is at odds with $ 2(b)'s plain language and unravels upon close inspection. Pp. 506-508.

(d) The preference accorded by Ohio to the expenses of administering
the insolvency proceeding is reasonably necessary to further the goal
of protecting policyholders, since liquidation could not even commence
without payment of administrative costs. The preferences conferred
upon employees and other general creditors, however, do not escape
pre-emption because their connection to the ultimate aim of insurance
is too tenuous. Pp. 508-510.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal priority statute, 31 U. S. C. $ 3713, accords first
priority to the United States with respect to a bankrupt
debtor's obligations. An Ohio statute confers only fifth
priority upon claims of the United States in proceedings to
liquidate an insolvent insurance company. Ohio Rev. Code
Ann. $ 3903.42 (1989). The federal priority statute preempts the inconsistent Ohio law unless the latter is exempt
from pre-emption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59
Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 et seq. In order to
resolve this case, we must decide whether a state statute
establishing the priority of creditors' claims in a proceeding
to liquidate an insolvent insurance company is a law enacted
"for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,"
within the meaning of $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,
15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b).

We hold that the Ohio priority statute escapes preemption to the extent that it protects policyholders. Accordingly, Ohio may effectively afford priority, over claims of the
United States, to the insurance claims of policyholders and
to the costs and expenses of administering the liquidation.

Opinion of the Court
But when Ohio attempts to rank other categories of claimsabove those pressed by the United States, it is not free from

federal pre-emption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

I
The Ohio priority statute was enacted as part of a complexand specialized administrative structure for the regulation

of insurance companies from inception to dissolution. Thestatute proclaims, as its purpose, "the protection of the interests of insureds, claimants, creditors, and the public gen-erally." $ 3903.02(D). Chapter 3903 broadly empowers the
State's Superintendent of Insurance to place a financially im-paired insurance company under his supervision, or into rehabilitation, or into liquidation. The last is authorized whenthe superintendent finds that the insurer is insolvent, that
placement in supervision or rehabilitation would be futile,and that "further transaction of business would be hazardous, financially or otherwise, to [the insurer's] policyholders,its creditors, or the public." $ 3903.17(C). As liquidator,
the superintendent is entitled to take title to all assets,$ 3903.18(A); to collect and invest moneys due the insurer,

$ 3903.21(A)(6); to continue to prosecute and commence in thename of the insurer any and all suits and other legal proceedings, $ 3903.21(A)(12); to collect reinsurance and unearnedpremiums due the insurer, $$ 3903.32 and 3903.33; to evaluate
all claims against the estate, $ 3903.43; and to make paymentsto claimants to the extent possible, $ 3903.44. It seems fair
to say that the effect of all this is to empower the liquidatorto continue to operate the insurance company in all ways but
one--the issuance of new policies.Pursuant to this statutory framework, the Court of Common Pleas for Franklin County, Ohio, on April 30, 1986,declared American Druggists' Insurance Company insolvent. The court directed that the company be liquidated,and it appointed respondent, Ohio's Superintendent of Insurance, to serve as liquidator. The United States, as obligee

Opinion of the Court
on various immigration, appearance, performance, and payment bonds issued by the company as surety, filed claims
in excess of $10.7 million in the state liquidation proceedings. The United States asserted that its claims were entitled to first priority under the federal statute, 31 U. S. C.

$ 3713(a)(1)(A)(iii), which provides: "A claim of the United
States Government shall be paid first when . . . a person
indebted to the Government is insolvent and . . . an act of
bankruptcy is committed." 1

Respondent Superintendent brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio seeking to establish that the
federal priority statute does not pre-empt the Ohio law
designating the priority of creditors' claims in insuranceliquidation proceedings. Under the Ohio statute, as noted
above, claims of federal, state, and local governments are
entitled only to fifth priority, ranking behind (1) administrative expenses, (2) specified wage claims, (3) policyholders' claims, and (4) claims of general creditors. $ 3903.42.2

1 In its entirety, $ 3713 reads:
"(a)(1) A claim of the United States Government shall be paid first
when--

"(A) a person indebted to the Government is insolvent and--
"(i) the debtor without enough property to pay all debts makes a voluntary assignment of property;

"(ii) property of the debtor, if absent, is attached; or
"(iii) an act of bankruptcy is committed; or
"(B) the estate of a deceased debtor, in the custody of the executor or
administrator, is not enough to pay all debts of the debtor.

"(2) This subsection does not apply to a case under title 11.
"(b) A representative of a person or an estate (except a trustee acting
under title 11) paying any part of a debt of the person or estate before
paying a claim of the Government is liable to the extent of the payment
for unpaid claims of the Government."

"The priority of distribution of claims from the insurer's estate shall be
in accordance with the order in which each class of claims is set forth in

496 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY v. FABE

Opinion of the Court
Respondent argued that the Ohio priority scheme, rather
than the federal priority statute, governs the priority of
claims of the United States because it falls within the antithis section. Every claim in each class shall be paid in full or adequate
funds retained for such payment before the members of the next class
receive any payment. No subclasses shall be established within any class.
The order of distribution of claims shall be:

"(A) Class 1. The costs and expenses of administration, including but
not limited to the following:

"(1) The actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the
assets of the insurer;

"(2) Compensation for all services rendered in the liquidation;
"(3) Any necessary filing fees;
"(4) The fees and mileage payable to witnesses;
"(5) Reasonable attorney's fees;
"(6) The reasonable expenses of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association in handling claims.

"(B) Class 2. Debts due to employees for services performed to the
extent that they do not exceed one thousand dollars and represent payment for services performed within one year before the filing of the complaint for liquidation. Officers and directors shall not be entitled to the
benefit of this priority. Such priority shall be in lieu of any other similar
priority that may be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of
employees.

"(C) Class 3. All claims under policies for losses incurred, including
third party claims, all claims against the insurer for liability for bodily
injury or for injury to or destruction of tangible property that are not
under policies, and all claims of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty
association. All claims under life insurance and annuity policies, whether
for death proceeds, annuity proceeds, or investment values, shall be
treated as loss claims. That portion of any loss, indemnification for which
is provided by other benefits or advantages recovered by the claimant,
shall not be included in this class, other than benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligations of support or by
way of succession at death or as proceeds of life insurance, or as gratuities.
No payment by an employer to an employee shall be treated as a gratuity.
Claims under nonassessable policies for unearned premium or other premium refunds.

"(D) Class 4. Claims of general creditors.
"(E) Class 5. Claims of the federal or any state or local government.
Claims, including those of any governmental body for a penalty or forfeit508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:08 PAGES OPINPGT

The District Court granted summary judgment for theUnited States. Relying upon the tripartite standard for divining what constitutes the "business of insurance," as artic-ulated in

Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119(1982), the court considered three factors:

" `first, whether the practice has the effect of transfer-ring or spreading a policyholder's risk;

second, whetherthe practice is an integral part of the policy relationship

between the insurer and the insured; and third, whetherthe practice is limited to entities within the insurance

ure, shall be allowed in this class only to the extent of the pecuniary loss
sustained from the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty
or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby.
The remainder of such claims shall be postponed to the class of claims
under division (H) of this section.

"(F) Class 6. Claims filed late or any other claims other than claims
under divisions (G) and (H) of this section.

"(G) Class 7. Surplus or contribution notes, or similar obligations, and
premium refunds on assessable policies. Payments to members of domestic mutual insurance companies shall be limited in accordance with law.

"(H) Class 8. The claims of shareholders or other owners."
3 Section 1012 reads:

"(a) State regulation
"The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be
subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or
taxation of such business.

"(b) Federal regulation
"No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless
such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That
after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the
Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the
Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, . . . shall be applicable to the business
of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State
Law."

industry.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a (quoting Pireno,458 U. S., at 129).

Reasoning that the liquidation of an insolvent insurer pos-sesses none of these attributes, the court concluded that the
Ohio priority statute does not involve the "business of insur-ance." App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.

A divided Court of Appeals reversed. 939 F. 2d 341 (CA61991). The court held that the Ohio priority scheme regulates the "business of insurance" because it protects the in-terests of the insured.

Id., at 350-351. Applying Pireno,the court determined that the Ohio statute (1) transfers and

spreads the risk of insurer insolvency; (2) involves an inte-gral part of the policy relationship because it is designed to
maintain the reliability of the insurance contract; and (3) fo-cuses upon the protection of policyholders by diverting the
scarce resources of the liquidating entity away from othercreditors. 939 F. 2d, at 351-352.

4

Relying upon the same test to reach a different result, onejudge dissented. He reasoned that the liquidation of insolvent insurers is not a part of the "business of insurance"because it (1) has nothing to do with the transfer of risk
between insurer and insured that is effected by means of theinsurance contract and that is complete at the time the contract is entered; (2) does not address the relationship between insurer and the insured, but the relationship amongthose left at the demise of the insurer; and (3) is not confined

to policyholders, but governs the rights of all creditors. Id.,at 353-354 (opinion of Jones, J.).

against an insolvent insurer is a "law enacted . . . for thepurpose of regulating the business of insurance," within the

meaning of $ 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.5

II
The McCarran-Ferguson Act was enacted in response tothis Court's decision in

United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U. S. 533 (1944). Prior to that deci-sion, it had been assumed that "[i]ssuing a policy of insurance

is not a transaction of commerce," Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall.168, 183 (1869), subject to federal regulation. Accordingly,
"the States enjoyed a virtually exclusive domain over theinsurance industry." St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.
Barry, 438 U. S. 531, 539 (1978).The emergence of an interconnected and interdependent
national economy, however, prompted a more expansive ju-risprudential image of interstate commerce. In the intervening years, for example, the Court held that interstatecommerce encompasses the movement of lottery tickets from
State to State, Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321 (1903), the trans-port of five quarts of whiskey across state lines in a private
automobile, United States v. Simpson, 252 U. S. 465 (1920),and the transmission of an electrical impulse over a wire
between Alabama and Florida, Pensacola Telegraph Co. v.Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U. S. 1 (1878). It was not
long before the Court was forced to come to terms with thesedecisions in the insurance context. Thus, in South-Eastern
Underwriters, it held that an insurance company that con-ducted a substantial part of its business across state lines
was engaged in interstate commerce and thereby was sub-ject to the antitrust laws. This result, naturally, was widely
perceived as a threat to state power to tax and regulate the

Opinion of the Court
insurance industry. To allay those fears, Congress movedquickly to restore the supremacy of the States in the realm

of insurance regulation. It enacted the McCarran-FergusonAct within a year of the decision in South-Easter n
Underwriters.The first section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act makes its
mission very clear: "Congress hereby declares that the con-tinued regulation and taxation by the several States of the
business of insurance is in the public interest, and that si-lence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to
impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such busi-ness by the several States." 15 U. S. C. $ 1011. Shortly
after passage of the Act, the Court observed: "ObviouslyCongress' purpose was broadly to give support to the existing and future state systems for regulating and taxing thebusiness of insurance." Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,
328 U. S. 408, 429 (1946). Congress achieved this purpose intwo ways. The first "was by removing obstructions which
might be thought to flow from [Congress'] own power,whether dormant or exercised, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Act itself or in future legislation."
Id., at 429-430. The second "was by declaring expresslyand affirmatively that continued state regulation and taxation of this business is in the public interest and that thebusiness and all who engage in it `shall be subject to' the
laws of the several states in these respects." Id., at 430.

"[T]he starting point in a case involving construction ofthe McCarran-Ferguson Act, like the starting point in any

case involving the meaning of a statute, is the language ofthe statute itself." Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal
Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 210 (1979). Section 2(b) of theMcCarran-Ferguson Act provides: "No Act of Congress shall
be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law en-acted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business

Opinion of the Court
of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to thebusiness of insurance." 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b). The parties

agree that application of the federal priority statute would"invalidate, impair, or supersede" the Ohio priority scheme
and that the federal priority statute does not "specifically
relat[e] to the business of insurance." All that is left for usto determine, therefore, is whether the Ohio priority statute

is a law enacted "for the purpose of regulating the businessof insurance."

This Court has had occasion to construe this phrase onlyonce. On that occasion, it observed: "Statutes aimed at protecting or regulating this relationship [between insurer andinsured], directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the `business of insurance,' " within the meaning of the phrase. SEC
v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U. S. 453, 460 (1969). Theopinion emphasized that the focus of McCarran-Ferguson is

upon the relationship between the insurance company andits policyholders:

"The relationship between insurer and insured, the typeof policy which could be issued, its reliability, interpretation, and enforcement--these were the core of the `busi-ness of insurance.' Undoubtedly, other activities of insurance companies relate so closely to their status asreliable insurers that they too must be placed in the
same class. But whatever the exact scope of the statu-tory term, it is clear where the focus was--it was on
the relationship between the insurance company and the
policyholder." Ibid.

In that case, two Arizona insurance companies merged and
received approval from the Arizona Director of Insurance,
as required by state law. The Securities and Exchange
Commission sued to rescind the merger, alleging that the
merger-solicitation papers contained material misstatements, in violation of federal law. This Court held that, insofar as the Arizona law was an attempt to protect the inter508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:08 PAGES OPINPGT
502 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY v. FABE

Opinion of the Court
ests of an insurance company's shareholders, it did not fallwithin the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

Ibid.
The Arizona statute, however, also required the Director,before granting approval, to make sure that the proposed

merger "would not `substantially reduce the security of and
service to be rendered to policyholders.' " Id., at 462. TheCourt observed that this section of the statute "clearly relates to the `business of insurance.' " Ibid. But becausethe "paramount federal interest in protecting shareholders
[was] perfectly compatible with the paramount state interestin protecting policyholders,"

id., at 463, the Arizona statute
did not preclude application of the federal securities laws.

In the present case, on the other hand, there is a direct
conflict between the federal priority statute and Ohio law.
Under the terms of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C.

$ 1012(b), therefore, federal law must yield to the extent the
Ohio statute furthers the interests of policyholders.

Minimizing the analysis of National Securities, petitioners
invoke Royal Drug and Pireno in support of their argument
that the liquidation of an insolvent insurance company is not
part of the "business of insurance" exempt from pre-emption
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Those cases identified
the three criteria, noted above, that are relevant in determining what activities constitute the "business of insurance."
See Pireno, 458 U. S., at 129. Petitioners argue that the
Ohio priority statute satisfies none of these criteria. According to petitioners, the Ohio statute merely determines the
order in which creditors' claims will be paid, and has nothing
to do with the transfer of risk from insured to insurer. Petitioners also contend that the Ohio statute is not an integral
part of the policy relationship between insurer and insured
and is not limited to entities within the insurance industry
because it addresses only the relationship between policyholders and other creditors of the defunct corporation.

To be sure, the Ohio statute does not directly regulate
the "business of insurance" by prescribing the terms of the

503Cite as: 508 U. S. 491 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
insurance contract or by setting the rate charged by the in-surance company. But we do not read

Pireno to suggest
that the business of insurance is confined entirely to the writ-ing of insurance contracts, as opposed to their performance.

Pireno and Royal Drug held only that "ancillary activities"
that do not affect performance of the insurance contract orenforcement of contractual obligations do not enjoy the antitrust exemption for laws regulating the "business of insur-ance."

Pireno, 458 U. S., at 134, n. 8. In Pireno, we held
that use of a peer review committee to advise the insurer asto whether charges for chiropractic services were reasonable

and necessary was not part of the business of insurance.
The peer review practice at issue in that case had nothing to
do with whether the insurance contract was performed; it
dealt only with calculating what fell within the scope of the
contract's coverage. Id., at 130. We found the peer review
process to be "a matter of indifference to the policyholder,
whose only concern is whether his claim is paid, not why it
is paid" (emphases in original). Id., at 132. Similarly, in
Royal Drug, we held that an insurer's agreements with participating pharmacies to provide benefits to policyholders
was not part of the business of insurance. "The benefit
promised to Blue Shield policyholders is that their premiums
will cover the cost of prescription drugs except for a $2
charge for each prescription. So long as that promise is
kept, policyholders are basically unconcerned with arrangements made between Blue Shield and participating pharmacies." 440 U. S., at 213-214 (footnote omitted).

There can be no doubt that the actual performance of an
insurance contract falls within the "business of insurance,"
as we understood that phrase in Pireno and Royal Drug.
To hold otherwise would be mere formalism. The Court's
statement in Pireno that the "transfer of risk from insured
to insurer is effected by means of the contract between the
parties . . . and . . . is complete at the time that the contract
is entered," 458 U. S., at 130, presumes that the insurance

Opinion of the Court
contract in fact will be enforced. Without performance ofthe terms of the insurance policy, there is no risk transfer

at all. Moreover, performance of an insurance contract alsosatisfies the remaining prongs of the Pireno test: It is central
to the policy relationship between insurer and insured and isconfined entirely to entities within the insurance industry.
The Ohio priority statute is designed to carry out the en-forcement of insurance contracts by ensuring the payment of
policyholders' claims despite the insurance company's inter-vening bankruptcy. Because it is integrally related to the
performance of insurance contracts after bankruptcy, Ohio'slaw is one "enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance." 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b).Both Royal Drug and Pireno, moreover, involved the
scope of the antitrust immunity located in the second clauseof $ 2(b). We deal here with the

first clause, which is not so
narrowly circumscribed. The language of $ 2(b) is unambig-uous: The first clause commits laws "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance" to the States,
while the second clause exempts only "the business of insur-ance" itself from the antitrust laws. To equate laws "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insur-ance" with the "business of insurance" itself, as petitioners
urge us to do, would be to read words out of the statute.This we refuse to do.

6 The dissent contends that our reading of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
"runs counter to the basic rule of statutory construction that identical
words used in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the
same meaning." Post, at 515. This argument might be plausible if the
two clauses actually employed identical language. But they do not. As
explained above, the first clause contains the word "purpose," a term that
is significantly missing from the second clause. By ignoring this word,
the dissent overlooks another maxim of statutory construction: "that a
court should ` "give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute." ' " Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1990), quoting
United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955), and Montclair
v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883).

Opinion of the Court
The broad category of laws enacted "for the purpose ofregulating the business of insurance" consists of laws that

possess the "end, intention, or aim" of adjusting, managing,or controlling the business of insurance. Black's Law Dictionary 1236, 1286 (6th ed. 1990). This category necessarily
encompasses more than just the "business of insurance."For the reasons expressed above, we believe that the actual

performance of an insurance contract is an essential part ofthe "business of insurance." Because the Ohio statute is
"aimed at protecting or regulating" the performance of aninsurance contract,

National Securities, 393 U. S., at 460, it
follows that it is a law "enacted for the purpose of regulating
the business of insurance," within the meaning of the first
clause of $ 2(b).

Our plain reading of the McCarran-Ferguson Act also comports with the statute's purpose. As was stated in Royal
Drug, the first clause of $ 2(b) was intended to further Congress' primary objective of granting the States broad regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The second
clause accomplishes Congress' secondary goal, which was to
carve out only a narrow exemption for "the business of insurance" from the federal antitrust laws. 440 U. S., at 218,
n. 18. Cf. D. Howard, Uncle Sam versus the Insurance Commissioners: A Multi-Level Approach to Defining the "Business of Insurance" Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 25
Willamette L. Rev. 1 (1989) (advocating an interpretation
of the two clauses that would reflect their dual purposes);
Note, The Definition of "Business of Insurance" Under the
McCarran-Ferguson Act After Royal Drug, 80 Colum. L.
Rev. 1475 (1980) (same).

Petitioners, however, also contend that the Ohio statute is
not an insurance law but a bankruptcy law because it comes
into play only when the insurance company has become insolvent and is in liquidation, at which point the insurance company no longer exists. We disagree. The primary purpose
of a statute that distributes the insolvent insurer's assets to

506 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY v. FABE

Opinion of the Court
policyholders in preference to other creditors is identical tothe primary purpose of the insurance company itself: the

payment of claims made against policies. And "mere mat-ters of form need not detain us." National Securities, 393
U. S., at 460. The Ohio statute is enacted "for the purposeof regulating the business of insurance" to the extent that it
serves to ensure that, if possible, policyholders ultimatelywill receive payment on their claims. That the policyholder
has become a creditor and the insurer a debtor is notrelevant.

IV
Finding little support in the plain language of the statute,petitioners resort to its legislative history. Petitioners rely

principally upon a single statement in a House Report:

"It is not the intention of Congress in the enactmentof this legislation to clothe the States with any power to

regulate or tax the business of insurance beyond thatwhich they had been held to possess prior to the decision
of the United States Supreme Court in the SoutheasternUnderwriters Association case." H. R. Rep. No. 143,
79th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1945).
From this statement, petitioners argue that the McCarran-Ferguson Act was an attempt to "turn back the clock" to the

time prior to South-Eastern Underwriters. At that time,petitioners maintain, the federal priority statute would have
superseded any inconsistent state law.Even if we accept petitioners' premise, the state of the
law prior to South-Eastern Underwriters is far from clear.Petitioners base their argument upon

United States v. Knott,298 U. S. 544 (1936), which involved the use and disposition

of funds placed with the Florida treasurer as a condition ofan insurer's conducting business in the State. According to
petitioners, Knott stands for the proposition that the federalpriority statute pre-empted inconsistent state laws even before South-Eastern Underwriters. But this proffered anal-ogy to

Knott unravels upon closer inspection. In that case,

507Cite as: 508 U. S. 491 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
the Court applied the federal priority statute only when theState had not specifically legislated the priority of claims.

298 U. S., at 549-550 ("But it is settled that an inchoate lienis not enough to defeat the [Federal Government's] priority . . . . Unless the law of Florida effected . . . eithera transfer of title from the company, or a specific perfected
lien in favor of the Florida creditors, the United States isentitled to priority"). Moreover, other cases issued at the
same time reached a different result. See, e. g., Conway v.
Imperial Life Ins. Co., 207 La. 285, 21 So. 2d 151 (1945) (Lou-isiana statute specifically providing that deposited securities

are held by state treasurer in trust for benefit and protectionof policyholders supersedes federal priority statute).

More importantly, petitioners' interpretation of the statuteis at odds with its plain language. The McCarran-Ferguson
Act did not simply overrule South-Eastern Underwritersand restore the status quo. To the contrary, it transformed
the legal landscape by overturning the normal rules of pre-emption. Ordinarily, a federal law supersedes any inconsistent state law. The first clause of $ 2(b) reverses this by im-posing what is, in effect, a clear-statement rule, a rule that
state laws enacted "for the purpose of regulating the busi-ness of insurance" do not yield to conflicting federal statutes
unless a federal statute specifically requires otherwise.That Congress understood the effect of its language becomes
apparent when we examine other parts of the legislative his-tory.

7 The second clause of $ 2(b) also broke new ground: It

7 Elaborating upon the purpose animating the first clause of $ 2(b) of the
McCarran-Ferguson Act, Senator Ferguson observed:

"What we have in mind is that the insurance business, being interstate
commerce, if we merely enact a law relating to interstate commerce, or if
there is a law now on the statute books relating in some way to interstate
commerce, it would not apply to insurance. We wanted to be sure that
the Congress, in its wisdom, would act specifically with reference to insurance in enacting the law." 91 Cong. Rec. 1487 (1945).

This passage later confirms that "no existing law and no future law should,
by mere implication, be applied to the business of insurance" (statement
of Mr. Mahoney). Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
"embod[ied] a legislative rejection of the concept that the
insurance industry is outside the scope of the antitrust
laws--a concept that had prevailed before the South-Eastern
Underwriters decision." Royal Drug, 440 U. S., at 220.

Petitioners' argument appears to find its origin in the
Court's statement in National Securities that "[t]he
McCarran-Ferguson Act was an attempt to turn back the
clock, to assure that the activities of insurance companies in
dealing with their policyholders would remain subject to
state regulation." 393 U. S., at 459. The Court was referring to the primary purpose underlying the Act, namely,
to restore to the States broad authority to tax and regulate
the insurance industry. Petitioners would extrapolate from
this general statement an invitation to engage in a detailed
point-by-point comparison between the regime created by
McCarran-Ferguson and the one that existed before. But it
is impossible to compare our present world to the one that
existed at a time when the business of insurance was believed to be beyond the reach of Congress' power under the
Commerce Clause.

V

We hold that the Ohio priority statute, to the extent that
it regulates policyholders, is a law enacted for the purpose
of regulating the business of insurance. To the extent that
it is designed to further the interests of other creditors, however, it is not a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the
business of insurance. Of course, every preference accorded
to the creditors of an insolvent insurer ultimately may redound to the benefit of policyholders by enhancing the reliability of the insurance company. This argument, however,
goes too far: "But in that sense, every business decision made
by an insurance company has some impact on its reliability
. . . and its status as a reliable insurer." Royal Drug, 440
U. S., at 216-217. Royal Drug rejected the notion that such

Opinion of the Court
indirect effects are sufficient for a state law to avoid pre-emption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Id., at 217.

We also hold that the preference accorded by Ohio to theexpenses of administering the insolvency proceeding is reasonably necessary to further the goal of protecting policy-holders. Without payment of administrative costs, liquidation could not even commence. The preferences conferredupon employees and other general creditors, however, do not
escape pre-emption because their connection to the ultimateaim of insurance is too tenuous. Cf.

Langdeau v. UnitedStates, 363 S. W. 2d 327 (Tex. Civ. App. 1962) (state statute

according preference to employee wage claims is not a lawenacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance). By this decision, we rule only upon the clash of prior-ities as pronounced by the respective provisions of the federal statute and the Ohio Code. The effect of this decisionupon the Ohio Code's remaining priority provisions--includ8 The dissent assails our holding at both ends, contending that it at once
goes too far and not quite far enough. On the one hand, the dissent suggests that our holding is too "broad" in the sense that "any law which
redounds to the benefit of policyholders is, ipso facto, a law enacted to
regulate the business of insurance." Post, at 511. But this is precisely the
argument we reject in the text, as evidenced by the narrowness of our
actual holding. Uncomfortable with our distinction between the priority
given to policyholders and the priority afforded other creditors, the dissent complains, on the other hand, that this is evidence of a "serious flaw."
Post, at 517. But the dissent itself concedes that a state statute regulating
the liquidation of insolvent insurance companies need not be treated as a
package which stands or falls in its entirety. Post, at 518. Given this
concession, it is the dissent's insistence upon an all-or-nothing approach to
this particular statute that is flawed. The dissent adduces no support for
its assertion that we must deal with the various priority provisions of the
Ohio law as if they were all designed to further a single end. That was
not the approach taken by this Court in National Securities, which carefully parsed a state statute with dual goals and held that it regulated the
business of insurance only to the extent that it protected policyholders.
Supra, at 502. And the dissent misinterprets our pronouncement on the
clash of priorities as a "compromise holding," post, at 517, forgetting that
the severability of the various priority provisions is a question of state law.

ing any issue of severability--is a question of state law to be
addressed upon remand. Cf. Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S.
7, 17-18 (1975) (invalidating state statute specifying greater
age of majority for males than for females and remanding to
state court to determine age of majority applicable to both
groups under state law).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part
and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to that court
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice
Souter, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

With respect and full recognition that the statutory question the majority considers with care is difficult, I dissent
from the opinion and judgment of the Court.

We consider two conflicting statutes, both attempting to
establish priority for claims of the United States in proceedings to liquidate an insolvent insurance company. The first
is the federal priority statute, 31 U. S. C. $ 3713, which requires a debtor's obligations to the United States to be given
first priority in insolvency proceedings. The second, Ohio's
insurance company liquidation statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 3903.42 (1989), provides that claims of the Federal Government are to be given fifth priority in proceedings to liquidate
an insolvent insurer. Under usual principles of pre-emption,
the federal priority statute trumps the inconsistent state
law. See Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,
373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963). The question is whether the
McCarran-Ferguson Act, which provides an exemption from
pre-emption for certain state laws "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance," 59 Stat. 34, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b), alters this result.

Relying primarily on our decision in SEC v. National
Securities, Inc., 393 U. S. 453 (1969), the majority concludes

Kennedy, J., dissenting
that portions of Ohio's priority statute are saved from pre-emption by the McCarran-Ferguson Act. I agree that

National Securities is the right place to begin the analysis. Asthe Court points out,

National Securities is the one case in
which we have considered the precise statutory provision
that is controlling here to determine whether a state lawapplicable to insurance companies was a law enacted for the

purpose of regulating the business of insurance. I disagree,however, with the Court's interpretation of that precedent.

The key to our analysis in National Securities was theconstruction of the term "business of insurance." In

National Securities we said that statutes designed to protect
or regulate the relationship between an insurance company
and its policyholder, whether this end is accomplished in a
direct or an indirect way, are laws regulating the business of
insurance. 393 U. S., at 460. While noting that the exact
scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act was unclear, we observed that in passing the Act "Congress was concerned with
the type of state regulation that centers around the contract
of insurance." Ibid. There is general agreement that the
primary concerns of an insurance contract are the spreading
and the underwriting of risk, see 1 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of
Insurance Law $ 1.3 (2d ed. 1984); R. Keeton, Insurance Law

$ 1.2(a) (1971), and we have often recognized this central
principle. See Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S.
119, 127, and n. 7 (1982); Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v.
Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 211-212 (1979).

When the majority applies the holding of National Securities to the case at bar, it concludes that the Ohio statute is
not pre-empted to the extent it regulates the "performance
of an insurance contract," ante, at 505, by ensuring that "policyholders ultimately will receive payment on their claims,"
ante, at 506. Under the majority's reasoning, see ante, at
493, 508, any law which redounds to the benefit of policyholders is, ipso facto, a law enacted to regulate the business of
insurance. States attempting to discern the scope of powers

Kennedy, J., dissenting
reserved for them under the McCarran-Ferguson Act will
find it difficult, as do I, to reconcile our precedents in this
area with the decision the Court reaches today. The majority's broad holding is not a logical extension of our decision
in National Securities and indeed is at odds with it.

The function of the Ohio statute before us is to regulate
the priority of competing creditor claims in proceedings to
liquidate an insolvent insurance company. On its face, the
statute's exclusive concentration is not policyholder protection, but creditor priority. The Ohio statute states that its
comprehensive purpose is "the protection of the interests of
insureds, claimants, creditors, and the public generally, with
minimum interference with the normal prerogatives of the
owners and managers of insurers." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 3903.02(D) (1989). It can be said that Ohio's insolvency
scheme furthers the interests of policyholders to the extent
the statute gives policyholder claims priority over the claims
of the defunct insurer's other creditors. But until today
that result alone would not have qualified Ohio's liquidation
statute as a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the
business of insurance. The Ohio law does not regulate or
implicate the "true underwriting of risks, the one earmark
of insurance." SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of
America, 359 U. S. 65, 73 (1959) (footnote omitted). To be
sure, the Ohio priority statute increases the probability that
an insured's claim will be paid in the event of insurer insolvency. But such laws, while they may "furthe[r] the interests of policyholders," ante, at 502, have little to do with the
relationship between an insurer and its insured, National
Securities, 393 U. S., at 460, and as such are not laws regulating the business of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson
Act. The State's priority statute does not speak to the
transfer of risk embodied in the contract of insurance between the parties. Granting policyholders priority of payment over other creditors does not involve the transfer of

513Cite as: 508 U. S. 491 (1993)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
risk from insured to insurer, the type of risk spreading thatis the essence of the contract of insurance.

Further, insurer insolvency is not an activity of insurancecompanies that "relate[s] so closely to their status as reliable
insurers," ibid., as to qualify liquidation as an activity constituting the "core of the `business of insurance.' " Ibid. Re-spondent maintains, and the majority apparently agrees, that

nothing is more central to the reliability of an insurer thanfacilitating the payment of policyholder claims in the event
of insurer insolvency. This assertion has a certain intuitiveappeal, because certainly the payment of claims is of primary
concern to policyholders, and policyholders have a vital interest in the financial strength and solvency of their insurers.
But state insolvency laws requiring policyholder claims to be
paid ahead of the claims of the rest of the insurer's creditors
do not increase the reliability or the solvency of the insurer;
they operate, by definition, too late in the day for that. Instead they operate as a state-imposed safety net for the benefit of those insured. In my view, the majority too easily
dismisses the fact that the policyholder has become a creditor
and the insurer a debtor by reason of the insurance company's demise. Ante, at 506. Whereas we said in National
Securities that the focus of the McCarran-Ferguson Act is
the relationship between insurer and insured, 393 U. S., at
460, the Ohio statute before us regulates a different relationship: the relationship between the policyholder and the other
competing creditors. This is not the regulation of the business of insurance, but the regulation of creditors' rights in
an insolvency proceeding.

I do not share the view of the majority that it is fair to
characterize the effect of Ohio's liquidation scheme as "empower[ing] the liquidator to continue to operate the [insolvent] insurance company in all ways but one--the issuance
of new policies." Ante, at 494. The change accomplished
by the Ohio statute is not just a cosmetic change in management. Once the Ohio Court of Common Pleas directs the

514 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY v. FABE

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Superintendent of Insurance to liquidate an insolvent insurance company, the process of winding up the activities of the
insolvent insurance company begins. No new policies issue,
and existing policies are recalled and settled. See $ 3903.19.
The Ohio priority statute does not regulate the ongoing business of insurance; it facilitates disbursement of a defunct insurance business' assets in a way the Ohio Legislature deems
equitable. As we were careful to note in National Securities, the McCarran-Ferguson Act "did not purport to make
the States supreme in regulating all the activities of insurance companies." 393 U. S., at 459 (emphasis omitted). The
McCarran-Ferguson Act does not displace the standard preemption analysis for the state regulation of insurance companies; it does so for the state regulation of the business of
insurance. Ibid. That the Ohio statute is within the class
of state laws applicable to insurance companies does not
mean the law regulates an integral aspect of the contractual
insurance transaction.

In my view, one need look no further than our opinion in
National Securities to conclude that the Ohio insolvency
statute is not a law "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating
the business of insurance." Even so, our decisions in Pireno
and Royal Drug further undercut the Court's holding, despite the majority's attempt to distinguish them. My disagreement with the Court on this point turns on a close interpretation of 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b), which states as follows:

"No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate,
impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for
the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, . . .
unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That . . . [the federal antitrust statutes] shall be applicable to the business of insurance to
the extent that such business is not regulated by State
Law."

Kennedy, J., dissenting
The phrase "business of insurance" is used three times andin two different clauses of the Act. The first clause of

$ 1012(b) is directed to the States, and provides that statelaws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of
insurance are saved from pre-emption if there is no conflicting federal law which relates specifically to the business ofinsurance. The second clause of $ 1012(b) is directed at insurers, and allows insurers an exemption from the federalantitrust laws for activities regulated by state law which
qualify as the business of insurance. Respondent has ar-gued that cases such as

Royal Drug and Pireno, which addressed whether certain activities of insurers constituted the
"business of insurance" under the second clause of $ 1012(b),
do not control cases in which the first clause of $ 1012(b) is
at issue. On the way to accepting respondent's suggestion,
the majority observes, ante, at 504, that the phrase "business
of insurance" in the first clause of $ 1012(b) is "not so narrowly circumscribed" as the identical phrase in the second
clause.

It is true that laws enacted for the purpose of regulating
the business of insurance are something different from activities of insurers constituting the business of insurance, ibid.,
but in my mind this distinction does not compel a conclusion that cases such as Royal Drug and Pireno have no application here. As an initial matter, it would be unusual to
conclude that the meaning of the phrase "business of insurance" is transformed from one clause to the next. Such
a conclusion runs counter to the basic rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the
same Act are intended to have the same meaning. Sullivan
v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990); Atlantic Cleaners &
Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932). While
maxims of statutory construction admit of exceptions, there
are other obstacles to adopting the view that cases such as
Royal Drug and Pireno apply only in the antitrust realm.
First, nothing in Royal Drug or Pireno discloses a purpose

508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:09 PAGES OPINPGT
516 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY v. FABE

Kennedy, J., dissenting
to limit their reach in this way. Indeed while we havehad numerous opportunities to examine and to apply the

McCarran-Ferguson Act in different contexts, we have neverhinted that the meaning of the phrase "business of insurance" changed whether we addressed laws "enacted for the
purpose of regulating the business of insurance" or activitiesof insurers constituting the "business of insurance." Further, the suggestion that Pireno's three-tier test has applica-tion only in antitrust cases is discredited by our decisions
citing the Pireno test in contexts unrelated to antitrust.For instance, we have employed the

Pireno test to determine
whether certain state laws fall within the pre-emption saving clause of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41,
48-49 (1987); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,
471 U. S. 724, 742-743 (1985).

Royal Drug and Pireno are best viewed as refinements
of this Court's analysis in National Securities, tailored to
address activities of insurance companies that would implicate the federal antitrust laws were it not for the McCarranFerguson Act. Although these cases were decided in accordance with the rule that exemptions from the antitrust
laws are to be construed narrowly, see Pireno, 458 U. S., at
126; Royal Drug, 440 U. S., at 231, I see no reason why general principles derived from them are not applicable to any
case involving the scope of the term "business of insurance"
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

An examination of Pireno and Royal Drug reveals that
those decisions merely expand upon the statements we made
about the business of insurance in National Securities. In
National Securities, we determined that the essence of the
business of insurance involves those activities central to the
relationship between the insurer and the insured. 393 U. S.,
at 460. Pireno reiterates that principle and identifies three
factors which shed light on the task of determining whether
a particular activity has the requisite connection to the

508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:09 PAGES OPINPGT

517Cite as: 508 U. S. 491 (1993)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
policyholder and insurance company relationship as to consti-tute the business of insurance.

Pireno considers: "[F]irst,
whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spread-ing a policyholder's risk;

second, whether the practice is an
integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer
and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited toentities within the insurance industry." 458 U. S., at 129.

The Ohio statute here does not qualify as regulating thebusiness of insurance under

Pireno's tripartite test for the
same reason that it fails to do so under National Securities:It regulates an activity which is too removed from the

contractual relationship between the policyholder and the
insurance company. First, the risk of insurer insolvency
addressed by the statute is distinct from the risk the policyholder seeks to transfer in an insurance contract. The
transfer of risk from insured to insurer is effected "by means
of the contract between the parties--the insurance policy--
and that transfer is complete at the time that the contract is
entered." Id., at 130. As to the second prong, the Ohio
statute does not regulate the relationship between the insured and the insurer, but instead addresses the relationship
among all creditors the insurer has left in the lurch. Finally,
it is plain that the statute is not limited to entities within
the insurance industry. The statute governs the rights of
all creditors of insolvent insurance companies, including employees, general creditors, and stockholders, as well as government entities.

Quite apart from my disagreement with the majority over
which of our precedents have relevance to the issue before
us, I think the most serious flaw of its analytic approach is
disclosed in the compromise holding it reaches. The Court
comes to the conclusion that the Ohio insolvency statute is a
regulation of the business of insurance only to the extent
that policyholder claims (as well as administrative expenses
necessary to facilitate the payment of those claims) are given
priority ahead of the claims of the Federal Government. At

one level the majority opinion may seem rather satisfying,for it gives something to Ohio's regulatory scheme (policyholder claims displace the federal priority) and somethingto the federal scheme (the Federal Government's priority
displaces all other claimants). The equitable result is attractive enough given the conflicting interests here. ButI should have thought that a law enacted to determine the

priority of creditor claims in proceedings to liquidate an in-solvent insurance company either is the regulation of the
business of insurance or is not. Of course a single state stat-utory scheme may regulate many aspects of insurance businesses, some of which may, and some of which may not, constitute the "business of insurance" under our precedents.
For instance in National Securities we held that an Arizona
law authorizing a state official to approve mergers of insurance companies was a law regulating the business of insurance to the extent the official acted to ensure that the merger
did not "substantially reduce the security of and service to
be rendered to policyholders," 393 U. S., at 462, but not when
the official acted to ensure that the merger was not "[i]nequitable to the stockholders of any insurer," id., at 457. But
the subject of the regulation in the case before us is quite
different from the portion of the Arizona statute held to be
the business of insurance in National Securities. The Arizona law regulated the business of insurance because by
allowing a state official to ensure that the merger of two
insurance companies did not reduce the "security of and
service to be rendered policyholders," id., at 462, the state
law functioned to preserve the reliability of an ongoing insurance business. In contrast, as explained, supra, at 513, the
Ohio liquidation statute before us does not increase the reliability or solvency of the insurer. Instead it operates to allocate the assets of a defunct insurer. This is so whether the
claims of policyholders are ranked first under the state law
or dead last. The inquiry under McCarran-Ferguson is
whether a law regulating the priority of creditor claims reg508us2$92L 02-21-97 22:24:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
ulates the business of insurance. If so, the order in whichOhio chooses to rank creditor (and policyholder) priority is

beyond the concern of the Act.Even though Ohio's insurance liquidation statute is not a
law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business ofinsurance, I underscore that no provision of federal law
precludes Ohio from establishing procedures to address theliquidation of insolvent insurance companies. The State's
prerogative to do so, however, does not emanate fromits recognized power to enact laws regulating the business
of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, but from thelongstanding decision of Congress to exempt insurance companies from the federal bankruptcy code. 11 U. S. C. $$ 109(b)(2), (d). The States are not free to enact legislation inconsistent with the federal priority statute, and in my viewthe majority errs in applying the McCarran-Ferguson Act
to displace the traditional principles of pre-emption thatshould apply. I would reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.

CHURCH OF THE LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC.,

et al. v. CITY OF HIALEAH

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-948. Argued November 4, 1992--Decided June 11, 1993
Petitioner church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion, which

employs animal sacrifice as one of its principal forms of devotion. The
animals are killed by cutting their carotid arteries and are cooked and
eaten following all Santeria rituals except healing and death rites.
After the church leased land in respondent city and announced plans to
establish a house of worship and other facilities there, the city council
held an emergency public session and passed, among other enactments,
Resolution 87-66, which noted city residents' "concern" over religious
practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or safety, and declared
the city's "commitment" to prohibiting such practices; Ordinance 87-40,
which incorporates the Florida animal cruelty laws and broadly punishes "[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily or cruelly . . . kills any animal," and
has been interpreted to reach killings for religious reasons; Ordinance
87-52, which defines "sacrifice" as "to unnecessarily kill . . . an animal
in a . . . ritual . . . not for the primary purpose of food consumption,"
and prohibits the "possess[ion], sacrifice, or slaughter" of an animal if it
is killed in "any type of ritual" and there is an intent to use it for food,
but exempts "any licensed [food] establishment" if the killing is otherwise permitted by law; Ordinance 87-71, which prohibits the sacrifice of
animals, and defines "sacrifice" in the same manner as Ordinance 87-52;
and Ordinance 87-72, which defines "slaughter" as "the killing of animals for food" and prohibits slaughter outside of areas zoned for slaughterhouses, but includes an exemption for "small numbers of hogs and/or
cattle" when exempted by state law. Petitioners filed this suit under
42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging violations of their rights under, inter alia,
the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Although acknowledging that the foregoing ordinances are not religiously neutral, the
District Court ruled for the city, concluding, among other things, that
compelling governmental interests in preventing public health risks and
cruelty to animals fully justified the absolute prohibition on ritual sacrifice accomplished by the ordinances, and that an exception to that prohibition for religious conduct would unduly interfere with fulfillment of
the governmental interest because any more narrow restrictions would

be unenforceable as a result of the Santeria religion's secret nature.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
936 F. 2d 586, reversed.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A-1, II-A-3, II-B, III, and IV, concluding that the laws in
question were enacted contrary to free exercise principles, and they are
void. Pp. 531-540, 542-547.

(a) Under the Free Exercise Clause, a law that burdens religious
practice need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest if
it is neutral and of general applicability. Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872. However, where
such a law is not neutral or not of general application, it must undergo
the most rigorous of scrutiny: It must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest. Neutrality and general applicability are interrelated, and failure
to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication that the other has not
been satisfied. Pp. 531-532.

(b) The ordinances' texts and operation demonstrate that they are not
neutral, but have as their object the suppression of Santeria's central
element, animal sacrifice. That this religious exercise has been targeted is evidenced by Resolution 87-66's statements of "concern" and
"commitment," and by the use of the words "sacrifice" and "ritual" in
Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71. Moreover, the latter ordinances'
various prohibitions, definitions, and exemptions demonstrate that they
were "gerrymandered" with care to proscribe religious killings of animals by Santeria church members but to exclude almost all other animal
killings. They also suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary to achieve their stated ends. The legitimate governmental interests in protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals
could be addressed by restrictions stopping far short of a flat prohibition
of all Santeria sacrificial practice, such as general regulations on the
disposal of organic garbage, on the care of animals regardless of why
they are kept, or on methods of slaughter. Although Ordinance 87-72
appears to apply to substantial nonreligious conduct and not to be overbroad, it must also be invalidated because it functions in tandem with the
other ordinances to suppress Santeria religious worship. Pp. 533-540.

(c) Each of the ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests
only against conduct motivated by religious belief and thereby violates
the requirement that laws burdening religious practice must be of general applicability. Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71 are substantially
underinclusive with regard to the city's interest in preventing cruelty

Syllabus
to animals, since they are drafted with care to forbid few animal killings
but those occasioned by religious sacrifice, while many types of animal
deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons are either not prohibited or
approved by express provision. The city's assertions that it is "selfevident" that killing for food is "important," that the eradication of insects and pests is "obviously justified," and that euthanasia of excess
animals "makes sense" do not explain why religion alone must bear the
burden of the ordinances. These ordinances are also substantially underinclusive with regard to the city's public health interests in preventing the disposal of animal carcasses in open public places and the
consumption of uninspected meat, since neither interest is pursued by
respondent with regard to conduct that is not motivated by religious
conviction. Ordinance 87-72 is underinclusive on its face, since it does
not regulate nonreligious slaughter for food in like manner, and respondent has not explained why the commercial slaughter of "small numbers"
of cattle and hogs does not implicate its professed desire to prevent
cruelty to animals and preserve the public health. Pp. 542-546.

(d) The ordinances cannot withstand the strict scrutiny that is required upon their failure to meet the Smith standard. They are not
narrowly tailored to accomplish the asserted governmental interests.
All four are overbroad or underinclusive in substantial respects because
the proffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analogous nonreligious conduct and those interests could be achieved by narrower
ordinances that burdened religion to a far lesser degree. Moreover,
where, as here, government restricts only conduct protected by the
First Amendment and fails to enact feasible measures to restrict other
conduct producing substantial harm or alleged harm of the same sort,
the governmental interests given in justification of the restriction cannot be regarded as compelling. Pp. 546-547.

Opinion of the Court
Our review confirms that the laws in question were en-acted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive,

or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violatedthe Nation's essential commitment to religious freedom.
The challenged laws had an impermissible object; and in allevents the principle of general applicability was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense of the laws werepursued only with respect to conduct motivated by religious
beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and re-verse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
A

This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, whichoriginated in the 19th century. When hundreds of thousands of members of the Yoruba people were brought asslaves from western Africa to Cuba, their traditional African
religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism.The resulting syncretion, or fusion, is Santeria, "the way of
the saints." The Cuban Yoruba express their devotion tospirits, called

orishas, through the iconography of Catholicsaints, Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites,

and Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments. 723F. Supp. 1467, 1469-1470 (SD Fla. 1989); 13 Encyclopedia of
Religion 66 (M. Eliade ed. 1987); 1 Encyclopedia of the Amer-ican Religious Experience 183 (C. Lippy & P. Williams eds.
1988).The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy ofthe

orishas. The basis of the Santeria religion is the nur-ture of a personal relation with the

orishas, and one of theprincipal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice. 13 Encyclopedia of Religion, supra, at 66. The sacrifice of animalsas part of religious rituals has ancient roots. See generally
12 id., at 554-556. Animal sacrifice is mentioned throughoutthe Old Testament, see 14 Encyclopaedia Judaica 600, 600-

Opinion of the Court
605 (1971), and it played an important role in the practice ofJudaism before destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem, see id., at 605-612. In modern Islam, there is an an-nual sacrifice commemorating Abraham's sacrifice of a ram
in the stead of his son. See C. Glasse' , Concise Encyclopediaof Islam 178 (1989); 7 Encyclopedia of Religion,

supra, at 456.According to Santeria teaching, the orishas are powerful

but not immortal. They depend for survival on the sacrifice.Sacrifices are performed at birth, marriage, and death rites,
for the cure of the sick, for the initiation of new membersand priests, and during an annual celebration. Animals sacrificed in Santeria rituals include chickens, pigeons, doves,ducks, guinea pigs, goats, sheep, and turtles. The animals
are killed by the cutting of the carotid arteries in the neck.The sacrificed animal is cooked and eaten, except after healing and death rituals. See 723 F. Supp., at 1471-1472; 13Encyclopedia of Religion,

supra, at 66; M. Gonza' lez-Wippler,The Santeri'a Experience 105 (1982).

Santeria adherents faced widespread persecution in Cuba,so the religion and its rituals were practiced in secret. The
open practice of Santeria and its rites remains infrequent.See 723 F. Supp., at 1470; 13 Encyclopedia of Religion,

supra,at 67; M. Gonza' lez-Wippler, Santeri'a: The Religion 3-4

(1989). The religion was brought to this Nation most oftenby exiles from the Cuban revolution. The District Court
estimated that there are at least 50,000 practitioners inSouth Florida today. See 723 F. Supp., at 1470.

Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc.(Church), is a not-for-profit corporation organized under

Florida law in 1973. The Church and its congregants prac-tice the Santeria religion. The president of the Church is
petitioner Ernesto Pichardo, who is also the Church's priestand holds the religious title of

Italero, the second highest inthe Santeria faith. In April 1987, the Church leased land in

Opinion of the Court
the city of Hialeah, Florida, and announced plans to establisha house of worship as well as a school, cultural center, and

museum. Pichardo indicated that the Church's goal was tobring the practice of the Santeria faith, including its ritual
of animal sacrifice, into the open. The Church began the
process of obtaining utility service and receiving the neces-sary licensing, inspection, and zoning approvals. Although

the Church's efforts at obtaining the necessary licenses andpermits were far from smooth, see 723 F. Supp., at 1477-1478,
it appears that it received all needed approvals by early Au-gust 1987.

The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many members of the Hialeah community, and
the announcement of the plans to open a Santeria church in
Hialeah prompted the city council to hold an emergency public session on June 9, 1987. The resolutions and ordinances
passed at that and later meetings are set forth in the Appendix following this opinion.

A summary suffices here, beginning with the enactments
passed at the June 9 meeting. First, the city council
adopted Resolution 87-66, which noted the "concern" expressed by residents of the city "that certain religions may
propose to engage in practices which are inconsistent with
public morals, peace or safety," and declared that "[t]he City
reiterates its commitment to a prohibition against any and
all acts of any and all religious groups which are inconsistent
with public morals, peace or safety." Next, the council approved an emergency ordinance, Ordinance 87-40, which incorporated in full, except as to penalty, Florida's animal cruelty laws. Fla. Stat. ch. 828 (1987). Among other things,
the incorporated state law subjected to criminal punishment
"[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily or cruelly . . . kills any animal." $ 828.12.

The city council desired to undertake further legislative
action, but Florida law prohibited a municipality from enacting legislation relating to animal cruelty that conflicted with

527Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
state law. $ 828.27(4). To obtain clarification, Hialeah's cityattorney requested an opinion from the attorney general of

Florida as to whether $ 828.12 prohibited "a religious groupfrom sacrificing an animal in a religious ritual or practice"
and whether the city could enact ordinances "making religious animal sacrifice unlawful." The attorney general re-sponded in mid-July. He concluded that the "ritual sacrifice

of animals for purposes other than food consumption" wasnot a "necessary" killing and so was prohibited by $ 828.12.
Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 87-56, Annual Report of the Atty. Gen.146, 147, 149 (1988). The attorney general appeared to define "unnecessary" as "done without any useful motive, in a
spirit of wanton cruelty or for the mere pleasure of destruction without being in any sense beneficial or useful to the
person killing the animal." Id., at 149, n. 11. He advised
that religious animal sacrifice was against state law, so that
a city ordinance prohibiting it would not be in conflict. Id.,
at 151.

The city council responded at first with a hortatory enactment, Resolution 87-90, that noted its residents' "great
concern regarding the possibility of public ritualistic animal
sacrifices" and the state-law prohibition. The resolution declared the city policy "to oppose the ritual sacrifices of animals" within Hialeah and announced that any person or organization practicing animal sacrifice "will be prosecuted."

In September 1987, the city council adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance 87-52 defined "sacrifice" as "to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture, or mutilate an animal in a public
or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of
food consumption," and prohibited owning or possessing an
animal "intending to use such animal for food purposes." It
restricted application of this prohibition, however, to any individual or group that "kills, slaughters or sacrifices animals
for any type of ritual, regardless of whether or not the flesh
or blood of the animal is to be consumed." The ordinance

528 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of the Court
contained an exemption for slaughtering by "licensed estab-lishment[s]" of animals "specifically raised for food purposes." Declaring, moreover, that the city council "has de-termined that the sacrificing of animals within the city limits
is contrary to the public health, safety, welfare and morals of
the community," the city council adopted Ordinance 87-71.That ordinance defined "sacrifice" as had Ordinance 87-52,

and then provided that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any person,persons, corporations or associations to sacrifice any animal
within the corporate limits of the City of Hialeah, Florida."The final Ordinance, 87-72, defined "slaughter" as "the killing of animals for food" and prohibited slaughter outside of
areas zoned for slaughterhouse use. The ordinance provided an exemption, however, for the slaughter or processing
for sale of "small numbers of hogs and/or cattle per week in
accordance with an exemption provided by state law." All
ordinances and resolutions passed the city council by unanimous vote. Violations of each of the four ordinances were
punishable by fines not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not
exceeding 60 days, or both.

Following enactment of these ordinances, the Church and
Pichardo filed this action pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida. Named as defendants were the city of Hialeah and
its mayor and members of its city council in their individual
capacities. Alleging violations of petitioners' rights under,
inter alia, the Free Exercise Clause, the complaint sought a
declaratory judgment and injunctive and monetary relief.
The District Court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants, finding that they had absolute immunity
for their legislative acts and that the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the council did not constitute an official policy of harassment, as alleged by petitioners. 688 F. Supp.
1522 (SD Fla. 1988).

After a 9-day bench trial on the remaining claims, the District Court ruled for the city, finding no violation of petition508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:06 PAGES OPINPGT

529Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
ers' rights under the Free Exercise Clause. 723 F. Supp.1467 (SD Fla. 1989). (The court rejected as well petitioners'

other claims, which are not at issue here.) Although ac-knowledging that "the ordinances are not religiously neutral," id., at 1476, and that the city's concern about animal
sacrifice was "prompted" by the establishment of the Churchin the city,

id., at 1479, the District Court concluded that the
purpose of the ordinances was not to exclude the Churchfrom the city but to end the practice of animal sacrifice, for

whatever reason practiced, id., at 1479, 1483. The court alsofound that the ordinances did not target religious conduct
"on their face," though it noted that in any event "specifically
regulating [religious] conduct" does not violate the First
Amendment "when [the conduct] is deemed inconsistent with
public health and welfare." Id., at 1483-1484. Thus, the
court concluded that, at most, the ordinances' effect on petitioners' religious conduct was "incidental to [their] secular
purpose and effect." Id., at 1484.

The District Court proceeded to determine whether the
governmental interests underlying the ordinances were compelling and, if so, to balance the "governmental and religious
interests." The court noted that "[t]his `balance depends
upon the cost to the government of altering its activity to
allow the religious practice to continue unimpeded versus
the cost to the religious interest imposed by the government
activity.' " Ibid., quoting Grosz v. City of Miami Beach, 721
F. 2d 729, 734 (CA11 1983), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 827 (1984).
The court found four compelling interests. First, the court
found that animal sacrifices present a substantial health risk,
both to participants and the general public. According to
the court, animals that are to be sacrificed are often kept in
unsanitary conditions and are uninspected, and animal remains are found in public places. 723 F. Supp., at 1474-1475,
1485. Second, the court found emotional injury to children
who witness the sacrifice of animals. Id., at 1475-1476,
1485-1486. Third, the court found compelling the city's in508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:06 PAGES OPINPGT
530 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of the Court
terest in protecting animals from cruel and unnecessary killing. The court determined that the method of killing used
in Santeria sacrifice was "unreliable and not humane, and
that the animals, before being sacrificed, are often kept in
conditions that produce a great deal of fear and stress in
the animal." Id., at 1472-1473, 1486. Fourth, the District
Court found compelling the city's interest in restricting the
slaughter or sacrifice of animals to areas zoned for slaughterhouse use. Id., at 1486. This legal determination was not
accompanied by factual findings.

Balancing the competing governmental and religious interests, the District Court concluded the compelling governmental interests "fully justify the absolute prohibition on ritual sacrifice" accomplished by the ordinances. Id., at 1487.
The court also concluded that an exception to the sacrifice
prohibition for religious conduct would " `unduly interfere
with fulfillment of the governmental interest' " because any
more narrow restrictions--e. g., regulation of disposal of animal carcasses--would be unenforceable as a result of the secret nature of the Santeria religion. Id., at 1486-1487, and
nn. 57-59. A religious exemption from the city's ordinances,
concluded the court, would defeat the city's compelling interests in enforcing the prohibition. Id., at 1487.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in
a one-paragraph per curiam opinion. Judgt. order reported
at 936 F. 2d 586 (1991). Choosing not to rely on the District
Court's recitation of a compelling interest in promoting the
welfare of children, the Court of Appeals stated simply that
it concluded the ordinances were consistent with the Constitution. App. to Pet. for Cert. A2. It declined to address
the effect of Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources
of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), decided after the District Court's opinion, because the District Court "employed
an arguably stricter standard" than that applied in Smith.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, whichhas been applied to the States through the Fourteenth

Amendment, see Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303(1940), provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof . . . ." (Emphasis added.) The city does not arguethat Santeria is not a "religion" within the meaning of the

First Amendment. Nor could it. Although the practice ofanimal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some, "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or compre-hensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection." Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment
Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 714 (1981). Given the historicalassociation between animal sacrifice and religious worship,

see supra, at 524-525, petitioners' assertion that animal sac-rifice is an integral part of their religion "cannot be deemed
bizarre or incredible." Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 489 U. S. 829, 834, n. 2 (1989). Neither thecity nor the courts below, moreover, have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct animal sac-rifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners'
First Amendment claim.In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general propositionthat a law that is neutral and of general applicability need
not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even
if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particularreligious practice.

Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, supra. Neutrality and general applicability are interrelated, and, as becomes apparent in thiscase, failure to satisfy one requirement is a likely indication

that the other has not been satisfied. A law failing to satisfythese requirements must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance

A
In our Establishment Clause cases we have often statedthe principle that the First Amendment forbids an official

purpose to disapprove of a particular religion or of religionin general. See, e. g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248 (1990) (plu-rality opinion);

School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473U. S. 373, 389 (1985); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 56

(1985); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1968);School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 225
(1963); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 15-16(1947). These cases, however, for the most part have addressed governmental efforts to benefit religion or particularreligions, and so have dealt with a question different, at least
in its formulation and emphasis, from the issue here. Petition-ers allege an attempt to disfavor their religion because of
the religious ceremonies it commands, and the Free ExerciseClause is dispositive in our analysis.

At a minimum, the protections of the Free Exercise Clausepertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all
religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because itis undertaken for religious reasons. See, e. g., Braunfeld v.
Brown, 366 U. S. 599, 607 (1961) (plurality opinion); Fowlerv. Rhode Island, 345 U. S., at 69-70. Indeed, it was "historical instances of religious persecution and intolerance thatgave concern to those who drafted the Free Exercise
Clause." Bowen v. Roy, 476 U. S. 693, 703 (1986) (opinion ofBurger, C. J.). See J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States $$ 991-992 (abridged ed. 1833) (re-print 1987); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 467 (1868)
(reprint 1972); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 464,and n. 2 (1961) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.);

sult); Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333, 342 (1890). These prin-ciples, though not often at issue in our Free Exercise Clause

cases, have played a role in some. In McDaniel v. Paty, 435U. S. 618 (1978), for example, we invalidated a state law that
disqualified members of the clergy from holding certain pub-lic offices, because it "impose[d] special disabilities on the
basis of . . . religious status," Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 877. Onthe same principle, in Fowler v. Rhode Island, supra, we

found that a municipal ordinance was applied in an unconsti-tutional manner when interpreted to prohibit preaching in a
public park by a Jehovah's Witness but to permit preachingduring the course of a Catholic mass or Protestant church
service. See also Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268,272-273 (1951). Cf.

Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228 (1982)(state statute that treated some religious denominations

more favorably than others violated the EstablishmentClause).

1
Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is neverpermissible,

McDaniel v. Paty, supra, at 626 (plurality opin-ion); Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, at 303-304, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices becauseof their religious motivation, the law is not neutral, see
Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.
Smith, supra, at 878-879; and it is invalid unless it is justifiedby a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance

that interest. There are, of course, many ways of demon-strating that the object or purpose of a law is the suppression
of religion or religious conduct. To determine the object ofa law, we must begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice
without a secular meaning discernible from the language orcontext. Petitioners contend that three of the ordinances
fail this test of facial neutrality because they use the words

508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:06 PAGES OPINPGT
534 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of the Court
"sacrifice" and "ritual," words with strong religious connota-tions. Brief for Petitioners 16-17. We agree that these

words are consistent with the claim of facial discrimination,but the argument is not conclusive. The words "sacrifice"
and "ritual" have a religious origin, but current use admits
also of secular meanings. See Webster's Third New Inter-national Dictionary 1961, 1996 (1971). See also 12 Encyclopedia of Religion, at 556 ("[T]he word sacrifice ultimatelybecame very much a secular term in common usage"). The
ordinances, furthermore, define "sacrifice" in secular terms,without referring to religious practices.

We reject the contention advanced by the city, see Brief
for Respondent 15, that our inquiry must end with the text
of the laws at issue. Facial neutrality is not determinative.
The Free Exercise Clause, like the Establishment Clause,
extends beyond facial discrimination. The Clause "forbids
subtle departures from neutrality," Gillette v. United States,
401 U. S. 437, 452 (1971), and "covert suppression of particular religious beliefs," Bowen v. Roy, supra, at 703 (opinion of
Burger, C. J.). Official action that targets religious conduct
for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality. The Free
Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility
which is masked as well as overt. "The Court must survey
meticulously the circumstances of governmental categories
to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders." Walz v.
Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U. S. 664, 696 (1970)
(Harlan, J., concurring).

The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances. First, though use of
the words "sacrifice" and "ritual" does not compel a finding
of improper targeting of the Santeria religion, the choice of
these words is support for our conclusion. There are further respects in which the text of the city council's enactments discloses the improper attempt to target Santeria.

Opinion of the Court
Resolution 87-66, adopted June 9, 1987, recited that "resi-dents and citizens of the City of Hialeah have expressed their

concern that certain religions may propose to engage in prac-tices which are inconsistent with public morals, peace or
safety," and "reiterate[d]" the city's commitment to prohibit
"any and all [such] acts of any and all religious groups." Noone suggests, and on this record it cannot be maintained,

that city officials had in mind a religion other than Santeria.It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria
sacrifice when the ordinances' operation is considered.Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation
is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse impact
will not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting.
For example, a social harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from discrimination. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S., at 442. See, e. g.,
Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1879); Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890). See also Ely, Legislative and Administrative Motivation in Constitutional Law, 79 Yale L. J.
1205, 1319 (1970). The subject at hand does implicate, of
course, multiple concerns unrelated to religious animosity,
for example, the suffering or mistreatment visited upon the
sacrificed animals and health hazards from improper disposal. But the ordinances when considered together disclose an object remote from these legitimate concerns. The
design of these laws accomplishes instead a "religious gerrymander," Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, supra, at
696 (Harlan, J., concurring), an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.

It is a necessary conclusion that almost the only conduct
subject to Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71 is the religious
exercise of Santeria church members. The texts show that
they were drafted in tandem to achieve this result. We
begin with Ordinance 87-71. It prohibits the sacrifice of animals, but defines sacrifice as "to unnecessarily kill . . . an
animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the

508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:06 PAGES OPINPGT
536 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of the Court
primary purpose of food consumption." The definition ex-cludes almost all killings of animals except for religious sacrifice, and the primary purpose requirement narrows theproscribed category even further, in particular by exempting
kosher slaughter, see 723 F. Supp., at 1480. We need not
discuss whether this differential treatment of two religionsis itself an independent constitutional violation. Cf.

Larson
v. Valente, 456 U. S., at 244-246. It suffices to recite thisfeature of the law as support for our conclusion that Santeria

alone was the exclusive legislative concern. The net resultof the gerrymander is that few if any killings of animals are
prohibited other than Santeria sacrifice, which is proscribed
because it occurs during a ritual or ceremony and its primary
purpose is to make an offering to the orishas, not food consumption. Indeed, careful drafting ensured that, although
Santeria sacrifice is prohibited, killings that are no more necessary or humane in almost all other circumstances are
unpunished.

Operating in similar fashion is Ordinance 87-52, which prohibits the "possess[ion], sacrifice, or slaughter" of an animal
with the "inten[t] to use such animal for food purposes."
This prohibition, extending to the keeping of an animal as
well as the killing itself, applies if the animal is killed in "any
type of ritual" and there is an intent to use the animal for
food, whether or not it is in fact consumed for food. The
ordinance exempts, however, "any licensed [food] establishment" with regard to "any animals which are specifically
raised for food purposes," if the activity is permitted by zoning and other laws. This exception, too, seems intended to
cover kosher slaughter. Again, the burden of the ordinance,
in practical terms, falls on Santeria adherents but almost no
others: If the killing is--unlike most Santeria sacrifices--unaccompanied by the intent to use the animal for food, then it
is not prohibited by Ordinance 87-52; if the killing is specifically for food but does not occur during the course of "any
type of ritual," it again falls outside the prohibition; and if

537Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
the killing is for food and occurs during the course of a ritual,it is still exempted if it occurs in a properly zoned and licensed establishment and involves animals "specificallyraised for food purposes." A pattern of exemptions parallels the pattern of narrow prohibitions. Each contributes to
the gerrymander.Ordinance 87-40 incorporates the Florida animal cruelty

statute, Fla. Stat. $ 828.12 (1987). Its prohibition is broadon its face, punishing "[w]hoever . . . unnecessarily . . . kills
any animal." The city claims that this ordinance is the epit-ome of a neutral prohibition. Brief for Respondent 13-14.
The problem, however, is the interpretation given to the
ordinance by respondent and the Florida attorney general.
Killings for religious reasons are deemed unnecessary,
whereas most other killings fall outside the prohibition.
The city, on what seems to be a per se basis, deems hunting,
slaughter of animals for food, eradication of insects and
pests, and euthanasia as necessary. See id., at 22. There
is no indication in the record that respondent has concluded
that hunting or fishing for sport is unnecessary. Indeed, one
of the few reported Florida cases decided under $ 828.12 concludes that the use of live rabbits to train greyhounds is not
unnecessary. See Kiper v. State, 310 So. 2d 42 (Fla. App.),
cert. denied, 328 So. 2d 845 (Fla. 1975). Further, because it
requires an evaluation of the particular justification for the
killing, this ordinance represents a system of "individualized
governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct," Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.
v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 884. As we noted in Smith, in circumstances in which individualized exemptions from a general
requirement are available, the government "may not refuse
to extend that system to cases of `religious hardship' without
compelling reason." Ibid., quoting Bowen v. Roy, 476 U. S.,
at 708 (opinion of Burger, C. J.). Respondent's application
of the ordinance's test of necessity devalues religious reasons
for killing by judging them to be of lesser import than nonre508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:06 PAGES OPINPGT

ligious reasons. Thus, religious practice is being singledout for discriminatory treatment. Id., at 722, and n. 17

(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in result);id., at 708 (opinion of Burger, C. J.); United States v. Lee,
455 U. S. 252, 264, n. 3 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment).

We also find significant evidence of the ordinances' im-proper targeting of Santeria sacrifice in the fact that they
proscribe more religious conduct than is necessary to achievetheir stated ends. It is not unreasonable to infer, at least
when there are no persuasive indications to the contrary,that a law which visits "gratuitous restrictions" on religious
conduct, McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S., at 520 (opinion ofFrankfurter, J.), seeks not to effectuate the stated governmental interests, but to suppress the conduct because of itsreligious motivation.

The legitimate governmental interests in protecting thepublic health and preventing cruelty to animals could be addressed by restrictions stopping far short of a flat prohibitionof all Santeria sacrificial practice.* If improper disposal, not
the sacrifice itself, is the harm to be prevented, the city couldhave imposed a general regulation on the disposal of organic
garbage. It did not do so. Indeed, counsel for the city con-ceded at oral argument that, under the ordinances, Santeria
sacrifices would be illegal even if they occurred in licensed,inspected, and zoned slaughterhouses. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.
See also id., at 42, 48. Thus, these broad ordinances prohibitSanteria sacrifice even when it does not threaten the city's

*Respondent advances the additional governmental interest in prohibiting the slaughter or sacrifice of animals in areas of the city not zoned for
slaughterhouses, see Brief for Respondent 28-31, and the District Court
found this interest to be compelling, see 723 F. Supp. 1467, 1486 (SD Fla.
1989). This interest cannot justify Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71,
for they apply to conduct without regard to where it occurs. Ordinance
87-72 does impose a locational restriction, but this asserted governmental
interest is a mere restatement of the prohibition itself, not a justification
for it. In our discussion, therefore, we put aside this asserted interest.

Opinion of the Court
interest in the public health. The District Court acceptedthe argument that narrower regulation would be unenforceable because of the secrecy in the Santeria rituals and thelack of any central religious authority to require compliance
with secular disposal regulations. See 723 F. Supp., at
1486-1487, and nn. 58-59. It is difficult to understand, how-ever, how a prohibition of the sacrifices themselves, which

occur in private, is enforceable if a ban on improper disposal,which occurs in public, is not. The neutrality of a law is
suspect if First Amendment freedoms are curtailed to pre-vent isolated collateral harms not themselves prohibited by
direct regulation. See, e. g., Schneider v. State, 308 U. S.
147, 162 (1939).

Under similar analysis, narrower regulation would achieve
the city's interest in preventing cruelty to animals. With
regard to the city's interest in ensuring the adequate care of
animals, regulation of conditions and treatment, regardless
of why an animal is kept, is the logical response to the city's
concern, not a prohibition on possession for the purpose of
sacrifice. The same is true for the city's interest in prohibiting cruel methods of killing. Under federal and Florida law
and Ordinance 87-40, which incorporates Florida law in this
regard, killing an animal by the "simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument"--the method used in kosher slaughter--is approved
as humane. See 7 U. S. C. $ 1902(b); Fla. Stat. $ 828.23(7)(b)
(1991); Ordinance 87-40, $ 1. The District Court found that,
though Santeria sacrifice also results in severance of the carotid arteries, the method used during sacrifice is less reliable and therefore not humane. See 723 F. Supp., at 1472-
1473. If the city has a real concern that other methods are
less humane, however, the subject of the regulation should
be the method of slaughter itself, not a religious classification
that is said to bear some general relation to it.

Ordinance 87-72--unlike the three other ordinances--
does appear to apply to substantial nonreligious conduct and

not to be overbroad. For our purposes here, however, thefour substantive ordinances may be treated as a group for

neutrality purposes. Ordinance 87-72 was passed the sameday as Ordinance 87-71 and was enacted, as were the three
others, in direct response to the opening of the Church. Itwould be implausible to suggest that the three other ordinances, but not Ordinance 87-72, had as their object the sup-pression of religion. We need not decide whether Ordinance
87-72 could survive constitutional scrutiny if it existed sepa-rately; it must be invalidated because it functions, with the
rest of the enactments in question, to suppress Santeria reli-gious worship.

2
In determining if the object of a law is a neutral one underthe Free Exercise Clause, we can also find guidance in our

equal protection cases. As Justice Harlan noted in the re-lated context of the Establishment Clause, "[n]eutrality in its
application requires an equal protection mode of analysis."
Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U. S., at 696(concurring opinion). Here, as in equal protection cases, we

may determine the city council's object from both direct andcircumstantial evidence. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977).Relevant evidence includes, among other things, the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specificseries of events leading to the enactment or official policy

in question, and the legislative or administrative history,including contemporaneous statements made by members
of the decisionmaking body. Id., at 267-268. These objec-tive factors bear on the question of discriminatory object.
Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,279, n. 24 (1979).

That the ordinances were enacted " `because of,' notmerely `in spite of,' " their suppression of Santeria religious
practice, id., at 279, is revealed by the events preceding theirenactment. Although respondent claimed at oral argument

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
that it had experienced significant problems resulting fromthe sacrifice of animals within the city before the announced

opening of the Church, Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, 46, the city councilmade no attempt to address the supposed problem before its
meeting in June 1987, just weeks after the Church announced
plans to open. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June9 session, both of which are in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the citycouncil, and other city officials toward the Santeria religion
and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd thatattended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by
council members critical of Santeria with cheers and the
brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman
Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in prerevolution Cuba "people were put in jail for practicing this
religion," the audience applauded. Taped excerpts of Hialeah City Council Meeting, June 9, 1987.

Other statements by members of the city council were in
a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after
noting his belief that Santeria was outlawed in Cuba, questioned: "[I]f we could not practice this [religion] in our homeland [Cuba], why bring it to this country?" Councilman Cardoso said that Santeria devotees at the Church "are in
violation of everything this country stands for." Councilman Mejides indicated that he was "totally against the sacrificing of animals" and distinguished kosher slaughter because
it had a "real purpose." The "Bible says we are allowed to
sacrifice an animal for consumption," he continued, "but for
any other purposes, I don't believe that the Bible allows
that." The president of the city council, Councilman Echevarria, asked: "What can we do to prevent the Church from
opening?"

Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments.
The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city
council that Santeria was a sin, "foolishness," "an abomination to the Lord," and the worship of "demons." He advised

Opinion of the Court
the city council: "We need to be helping people and sharing
with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." He concluded: "I would exhort you . . . not to permit this Church to
exist." The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66
indicated: "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens . . . ." Ibid. Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This
history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santeria worshippers because of its religious motivation.

3

In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The
ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion.
The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeria
adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by
their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of
the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe
religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular
killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious
conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate
ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not
neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing
to reach this conclusion.

B

We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise
Clause, the rule that laws burdening religious practice must
be of general applicability. Employment Div., Dept. of
Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 879-881.
All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental
effect of burdening religious practice. The Free Exercise
Clause "protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment," Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla.,
480 U. S. 136, 148 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), and inequality results when a legislature decides that

Opinion of the Court
the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthyof being pursued only against conduct with a religious

motivation.The principle that government, in pursuit of legitimate interests, cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only
on conduct motivated by religious belief is essential to theprotection of the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise

Clause. The principle underlying the general applicabilityrequirement has parallels in our First Amendment jurisprudence. See, e. g., Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 501 U. S. 663,669-670 (1991);

University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493
U. S. 182, 201 (1990); Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v.
Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585 (1983);
Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S., at 245-246; Presbyterian
Church in U. S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial
Presbyterian Church, 393 U. S. 440, 449 (1969). In this case
we need not define with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general application, for these
ordinances fall well below the minimum standard necessary
to protect First Amendment rights.

Respondent claims that Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and
87-71 advance two interests: protecting the public health and
preventing cruelty to animals. The ordinances are underinclusive for those ends. They fail to prohibit nonreligious
conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater
degree than Santeria sacrifice does. The underinclusion is
substantial, not inconsequential. Despite the city's proffered interest in preventing cruelty to animals, the ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but those
occasioned by religious sacrifice. Many types of animal
deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons are either not prohibited or approved by express provision. For example,
fishing--which occurs in Hialeah, see A. Khedouri & F.
Khedouri, South Florida Inside Out 57 (1991)--is legal. Extermination of mice and rats within a home is also permitted.

animals," Fla. Stat. $ 828.058 (1987); destruction of animals
judicially removed from their owners "for humanitarian reasons" or when the animal "is of no commercial value,"

$ 828.073(4)(c)(2); the infliction of pain or suffering "in the

"to pursue or take wildlife or to participate in any hunting,"

$ 828.122(6)(b), and "to hunt wild hogs," $ 828.122(6)(e).

The city concedes that "neither the State of Florida nor
the City has enacted a generally applicable ban on the killing
of animals." Brief for Respondent 21. It asserts, however,
that animal sacrifice is "different" from the animal killings
that are permitted by law. Ibid. According to the city, it
is "self-evident" that killing animals for food is "important";
the eradication of insects and pests is "obviously justified";
and the euthanasia of excess animals "makes sense." Id., at
22. These ipse dixits do not explain why religion alone
must bear the burden of the ordinances, when many of these
secular killings fall within the city's interest in preventing
the cruel treatment of animals.

The ordinances are also underinclusive with regard to the
city's interest in public health, which is threatened by the
disposal of animal carcasses in open public places and the
consumption of uninspected meat, see Brief for Respondent
32, citing 723 F. Supp., at 1474-1475, 1485. Neither interest
is pursued by respondent with regard to conduct that is not
motivated by religious conviction. The health risks posed
by the improper disposal of animal carcasses are the same
whether Santeria sacrifice or some nonreligious killing preceded it. The city does not, however, prohibit hunters from
bringing their kill to their houses, nor does it regulate disposal after their activity. Despite substantial testimony at
trial that the same public health hazards result from improper disposal of garbage by restaurants, see 11 Record 566,

Opinion of the Court
590-591, restaurants are outside the scope of the ordinances.
Improper disposal is a general problem that causes substantial health risks, 723 F. Supp., at 1485, but which respondent
addresses only when it results from religious exercise.

The ordinances are underinclusive as well with regard to
the health risk posed by consumption of uninspected meat.
Under the city's ordinances, hunters may eat their kill and
fishermen may eat their catch without undergoing governmental inspection. Likewise, state law requires inspection
of meat that is sold but exempts meat from animals raised
for the use of the owner and "members of his household and
nonpaying guests and employees." Fla. Stat. $ 585.88(1)(a)
(1991). The asserted interest in inspected meat is not pursued in contexts similar to that of religious animal sacrifice.

Ordinance 87-72, which prohibits the slaughter of animals
outside of areas zoned for slaughterhouses, is underinclusive
on its face. The ordinance includes an exemption for "any
person, group, or organization" that "slaughters or processes
for sale, small numbers of hogs and/or cattle per week in
accordance with an exemption provided by state law." See
Fla. Stat. $ 828.24(3) (1991). Respondent has not explained
why commercial operations that slaughter "small numbers"
of hogs and cattle do not implicate its professed desire to
prevent cruelty to animals and preserve the public health.
Although the city has classified Santeria sacrifice as slaughter, subjecting it to this ordinance, it does not regulate other
killings for food in like manner.

We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests only against conduct
motivated by religious belief. The ordinances "ha[ve] every
appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to
impose upon [Santeria worshippers] but not upon itself."

Opinion of the Court
precise evil is what the requirement of general applicabilityis designed to prevent.

III
A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral ornot of general application must undergo the most rigorous of

scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment,a law restrictive of religious practice must advance " `interests of the highest order' " and must be narrowly tailored inpursuit of those interests.

McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S., at628, quoting
Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 215 (1972).The compelling interest standard that we apply once a law

fails to meet the Smith requirements is not "water[ed] . . .down" but "really means what it says." Employment Div.,
Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S., at888. A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive
treatment or advances legitimate governmental interestsonly against conduct with a religious motivation will survive
strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what wehave already said that these ordinances cannot withstand
this scrutiny.First, even were the governmental interests compelling,
the ordinances are not drawn in narrow terms to accomplishthose interests. As we have discussed, see

supra, at 538-540, 543-546, all four ordinances are overbroad or underinclusive in substantial respects. The proffered objectivesare not pursued with respect to analogous nonreligious conduct, and those interests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to a far lesser degree. Theabsence of narrow tailoring suffices to establish the invalidity of the ordinances. See Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc.
v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 232 (1987).Respondent has not demonstrated, moreover, that, in the

context of these ordinances, its governmental interests arecompelling. Where government restricts only conduct protected by the First Amendment and fails to enact feasible

Opinion of the Court
measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial
harm or alleged harm of the same sort, the interest given in
justification of the restriction is not compelling. It is established in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that "a law cannot
be regarded as protecting an interest `of the highest order'
. . . when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly
vital interest unprohibited." Florida Star v. B. J. F., supra,
at 541-542 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (citation omitted). See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,
119-120 (1991). Cf. Florida Star v. B. J. F., supra, at 540-
541; Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97, 104-
105 (1979); id., at 110 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). As we show above, see supra, at 543-546, the
ordinances are underinclusive to a substantial extent with
respect to each of the interests that respondent has asserted,
and it is only conduct motivated by religious conviction that
bears the weight of the governmental restrictions. There
can be no serious claim that those interests justify the
ordinances.

IV

The Free Exercise Clause commits government itself to
religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion
or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights
it secures. Those in office must be resolute in resisting importunate demands and must ensure that the sole reasons
for imposing the burdens of law and regulation are secular.
Legislators may not devise mechanisms, overt or disguised,
designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices.
The laws here in question were enacted contrary to these
constitutional principles, and they are void.

Reversed.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
"Section 11. Effective Date."This Ordinance shall become effective when passed

by the City Council of the City of Hialeah and signed bythe Mayor of the City of Hialeah."

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice joins,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
The Court analyzes the "neutrality" and the "generalapplicability" of the Hialeah ordinances in separate sections
(Parts II-A and II-B, respectively), and allocates variousinvalidating factors to one or the other of those sections. If
it were necessary to make a clear distinction between thetwo terms, I would draw a line somewhat different from the
Court's. But I think it is not necessary, and would franklyacknowledge that the terms are not only "interrelated,"

ante,
at 531, but substantially overlap.

The terms "neutrality" and "general applicability" are not
to be found within the First Amendment itself, of course, but
are used in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources
of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), and earlier cases to
describe those characteristics which cause a law that prohibits an activity a particular individual wishes to engage in for
religious reasons nonetheless not to constitute a "law . . .
prohibiting the free exercise" of religion within the meaning
of the First Amendment. In my view, the defect of lack of
neutrality applies primarily to those laws that by their terms
impose disabilities on the basis of religion (e. g., a law excluding members of a certain sect from public benefits, cf. McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618 (1978)), see Bowen v. Roy, 476
U. S. 693, 703-704 (1986) (opinion of Burger, C. J.); whereas
the defect of lack of general applicability applies primarily
to those laws which, though neutral in their terms, through
their design, construction, or enforcement target the practices of a particular religion for discriminatory treatment,
see Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U. S. 67 (1953). But certainly a law that is not of general applicability (in the sense

508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:07 PAGES OPINPGT
558 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of Scalia, J.
I have described) can be considered "nonneutral"; and cer-tainly no law that is nonneutral (in the relevant sense) can

be thought to be of general applicability. Because I agreewith most of the invalidating factors set forth in Part II of
the Court's opinion, and because it seems to me a matter of
no consequence under which rubric ("neutrality," Part II-A,or "general applicability," Part II-B) each invalidating factor

is discussed, I join the judgment of the Court and all of itsopinion except section 2 of Part II-A.

I do not join that section because it departs from theopinion's general focus on the object of the

laws at issue to
consider the subjective motivation of the lawmakers, i. e.,
whether the Hialeah City Council actually intended to disfavor the religion of Santeria. As I have noted elsewhere, it
is virtually impossible to determine the singular "motive" of
a collective legislative body, see, e. g., Edwards v. Aguillard,
482 U. S. 578, 636-639 (1987) (dissenting opinion), and this
Court has a long tradition of refraining from such inquiries,
see, e. g., Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 130-131 (1810) (Marshall, C. J.); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 383-384
(1968).

Perhaps there are contexts in which determination of
legislative motive must be undertaken. See, e. g., United
States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303 (1946). But I do not think

that is true of analysis under the First Amendment (or the
Fourteenth, to the extent it incorporates the First). See
Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at 639 (Scalia, J., dissenting).
The First Amendment does not refer to the purposes for
which legislators enact laws, but to the effects of the laws
enacted: "Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the
free exercise [of religion] . . . ." This does not put us in the
business of invalidating laws by reason of the evil motives of
their authors. Had the Hialeah City Council set out resolutely to suppress the practices of Santeria, but ineptly
adopted ordinances that failed to do so, I do not see how
those laws could be said to "prohibi[t] the free exercise" of

559Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
Opinion of Souter, J.
religion. Nor, in my view, does it matter that a legislatureconsists entirely of the purehearted, if the law it enacts in

fact singles out a religious practice for special burdens. Hadthe ordinances here been passed with no motive on the part
of any councilman except the ardent desire to prevent cru-elty to animals (as might in fact have been the case), they
would nonetheless be invalid.

Justice Souter, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

This case turns on a principle about which there is no dis-agreement, that the Free Exercise Clause bars government
action aimed at suppressing religious belief or practice. TheCourt holds that Hialeah's animal-sacrifice laws violate that
principle, and I concur in that holding without reservation.Because prohibiting religious exercise is the object of the
laws at hand, this case does not present the more difficultissue addressed in our last free-exercise case, Employment
Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.872 (1990), which announced the rule that a "neutral, generally applicable" law does not run afoul of the Free ExerciseClause even when it prohibits religious exercise in effect.
The Court today refers to that rule in dicta, and despite mygeneral agreement with the Court's opinion I do not join
Part II, where the dicta appear, for I have doubts aboutwhether the

Smith rule merits adherence. I write sepa-rately to explain why the

Smith rule is not germane to thiscase and to express my view that, in a case presenting the

issue, the Court should reexamine the rule Smith declared.

I
According to Smith, if prohibiting the exercise of religionresults from enforcing a "neutral, generally applicable" law,

the Free Exercise Clause has not been offended. Id., at878-880. I call this the

Smith rule to distinguish it from thenoncontroversial principle, also expressed in Smith though

560 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of Souter, J.
established long before, that the Free Exercise Clause is of-fended when prohibiting religious exercise results from a law

that is not neutral or generally applicable. It is this noncon-troversial principle, that the Free Exercise Clause requires
neutrality and general applicability, that is at issue here.But before turning to the relationship of

Smith to this case,it will help to get the terms in order, for the significance of

the Smith rule is not only in its statement that the FreeExercise Clause requires no more than "neutrality" and
"general applicability," but also in its adoption of a particu-lar, narrow conception of free-exercise neutrality.

That the Free Exercise Clause contains a "requirement forgovernmental neutrality,"

Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205,220 (1972), is hardly a novel proposition; though the term

does not appear in the First Amendment, our cases haveused it as shorthand to describe, at least in part, what the
Clause commands. See, e. g., Jimmy Swaggart Ministriesv. Board of Equalization of Cal., 493 U. S. 378, 384 (1990);
Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security
Div., 450 U. S. 707, 717 (1981); Yoder, supra, at 220; Commit-tee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S.

756, 792-793 (1973); School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp,374 U. S. 203, 222 (1963); see also McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S.
618, 627-629 (1978) (plurality opinion) (invalidating a nonneu-tral law without using the term). Nor is there anything
unusual about the notion that the Free Exercise Clauserequires general applicability, though the Court, until today,
has not used exactly that term in stating a reason for inval-idation. See

Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U. S. 67 (1953);cf. Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r

of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585 (1983); Larson v. Valente, 456U. S. 228, 245-246 (1982).

1 A law that is not generally applicable according to the Court's definition (one that "selective[ly] impose[s] burdens only on conduct motivated

test for neutrality. Accordingly, the cases stating that the Free Exercise

While general applicability is, for the most part, self-explanatory, free-exercise neutrality is not self-revealing.

Cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 627 (1992) (Souter, J.,concurring) (considering Establishment Clause neutrality).
A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purposemay lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding something that
religion requires or requiring something that religion for-bids. Cf. McConnell & Posner, An Economic Approach to
Issues of Religious Freedom, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 35 (1989)("[A] regulation is not neutral in an economic sense if, whatever its normal scope or its intentions, it arbitrarily imposesgreater costs on religious than on comparable nonreligious
activities"). A secular law, applicable to all, that prohibitsconsumption of alcohol, for example, will affect members of
religions that require the use of wine differently from mem-bers of other religions and nonbelievers, disproportionately
burdening the practice of, say, Catholicism or Judaism. With-out an exemption for sacramental wine, Prohibition may fail
the test of religion neutrality.2It does not necessarily follow from that observation, of
course, that the First Amendment requires an exemptionfrom Prohibition; that depends on the meaning of neutrality
as the Free Exercise Clause embraces it. The point here isthe unremarkable one that our common notion of neutrality
is broad enough to cover not merely what might be calledformal neutrality, which as a free-exercise requirement

Clause requires neutrality are also fairly read for the proposition that the
Clause requires general applicability.

2 Our cases make clear, to look at this from a different perspective, that

an exemption for sacramental wine use would not deprive Prohibition of
neutrality. Rather, "[s]uch an accommodation [would] `reflec[t] nothing
more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face of religious
differences.' " Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 235, n. 22 (1972) (quoting
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 409 (1963)); see also Lee v. Weisman, 505
U. S. 577, 627 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring). The prohibition law in
place earlier this century did in fact exempt "wine for sacramental purposes." National Prohibition Act, Title II, $ 3, 41 Stat. 308.

would only bar laws with an object to discriminate againstreligion, but also what might be called substantive neutrality, which, in addition to demanding a secular object, wouldgenerally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neu-tral laws. See generally Laycock, Formal, Substantive, and
Disaggregated Neutrality Toward Religion, 39 DePaul L.Rev. 993 (1990). If the Free Exercise Clause secures only
protection against deliberate discrimination, a formal re-quirement will exhaust the Clause's neutrality command; if
the Free Exercise Clause, rather, safeguards a right to en-gage in religious activity free from unnecessary governmental interference, the Clause requires substantive, as well asformal, neutrality.

3

Though Smith used the term "neutrality" without a mod-ifier, the rule it announced plainly assumes that free-exercise

neutrality is of the formal sort. Distinguishing betweenlaws whose "object" is to prohibit religious exercise and
those that prohibit religious exercise as an "incidental ef-fect," Smith placed only the former within the reaches of
the Free Exercise Clause; the latter, laws that satisfy formalneutrality, Smith would subject to no free-exercise scrutiny
at all, even when they prohibit religious exercise in applica-tion. 494 U. S., at 878. The four Justices who rejected the
Smith rule, by contrast, read the Free Exercise Clause asembracing what I have termed substantive neutrality. The
enforcement of a law "neutral on its face," they said, may"nonetheless offend [the Free Exercise Clause's] requirement

3 One might further distinguish between formal neutrality and facial
neutrality. While facial neutrality would permit discovery of a law's object or purpose only by analysis of the law's words, structure, and operation, formal neutrality would permit enquiry also into the intentions of
those who enacted the law. Compare ante, at 540-542 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Stevens, J.) with ante, p. 557 (opinion of Scalia, J.,
joined by Rehnquist, C. J.). For present purposes, the distinction between formal and facial neutrality is less important than the distinction
between those conceptions of neutrality and substantive neutrality.

for government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exer-cise of religion."

Id., at 896 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined
by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.) (internal quota-tion marks and citations omitted). The rule these Justices

saw as flowing from free-exercise neutrality, in contrast to
the Smith rule, "requir[es] the government to justify anysubstantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a

compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored toachieve that interest."

Id., at 894 (emphasis added).
The proposition for which the Smith rule stands, then, isthat formal neutrality, along with general applicability, are

sufficient conditions for constitutionality under the Free Exercise Clause. That proposition is not at issue in this case,
however, for Hialeah's animal-sacrifice ordinances are not
neutral under any definition, any more than they are generally applicable. This case, rather, involves the noncontroversial principle repeated in Smith, that formal neutrality
and general applicability are necessary conditions for freeexercise constitutionality. It is only "this fundamental nonpersecution principle of the First Amendment [that is] implicated here," ante, at 523, and it is to that principle that the
Court adverts when it holds that Hialeah's ordinances "fail
to satisfy the Smith requirements," ante, at 532. In applying that principle the Court does not tread on troublesome
ground.

In considering, for example, whether Hialeah's animalsacrifice laws violate free-exercise neutrality, the Court
rightly observes that "[a]t a minimum, the protections of the
Free Exercise Clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or
prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons," ibid., and correctly finds Hialeah's laws to fail those
standards. The question whether the protections of the
Free Exercise Clause also pertain if the law at issue, though
nondiscriminatory in its object, has the effect nonetheless of
placing a burden on religious exercise is not before the Court

today, and the Court's intimations on the matter are there-fore dicta.

The Court also rightly finds Hialeah's laws to fail the testof general applicability, and as the Court "need not define
with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a pro-hibition is of general application, for these ordinances fall
well below the minimum standard necessary to protect FirstAmendment rights,"

ante, at 543, it need not discuss therules that apply to prohibitions found to be generally applicable. The question whether "there are areas of conduct pro-tected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment
and thus beyond the power of the State to control, evenunder regulations of general applicability,"

Yoder, 406 U. S.,at 220, is not before the Court in this case, and, again, suggestions on that score are dicta.

II
In being so readily susceptible to resolution by applyingthe Free Exercise Clause's "fundamental nonpersecution

principle," ante, at 523, this is far from a representative free-exercise case. While, as the Court observes, the Hialeah
City Council has provided a rare example of a law actuallyaimed at suppressing religious exercise, ante, at 523-524,
Smith was typical of our free-exercise cases, involving as itdid a formally neutral, generally applicable law. The rule
Smith announced, however, was decidedly untypical of thecases involving the same type of law. Because Smith left
those prior cases standing, we are left with a free-exercisejurisprudence in tension with itself, a tension that should
be addressed, and that may legitimately be addressed, byreexamining the

Smith rule in the next case that would turnupon its application.

A
In developing standards to judge the enforceability of for-mally neutral, generally applicable laws against the mandates of the Free Exercise Clause, the Court has addressed

565Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)

the concepts of neutrality and general applicability by indi-cating, in language hard to read as not foreclosing the Smith

rule, that the Free Exercise Clause embraces more thanmere formal neutrality, and that formal neutrality and general applicability are not sufficient conditions for free-exercise constitutionality:

"In a variety of ways we have said that `[a] regulationneutral on its face may, in its application, nonetheless
offend the constitutional requirement for governmentalneutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.' " Thomas, 450 U. S., at 717 (quoting Yoder, supra,at 220).
"[T]o agree that religiously grounded conduct mustoften be subject to the broad police power of the State
is not to deny that there are areas of conduct protected
by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and
thus beyond the power of the State to control, even underregulations of general applicability." 450 U. S., at 717.

Not long before the Smith decision, indeed, the Court specifically rejected the argument that "neutral and uniform"requirements for governmental benefits need satisfy only a

reasonableness standard, in part because "[s]uch a test has
no basis in precedent." Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals
Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136, 141 (1987) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Rather, we have said, "[o]ur cases have es-tablished that `[t]he free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observationof a central religious belief or practice and, if so, whether
a compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.' "
Swaggart Ministries, 493 U. S., at 384-385 (quoting Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680, 699 (1989)).

Thus we have applied the same rigorous scrutiny to bur-dens on religious exercise resulting from the enforcement of

formally neutral, generally applicable laws as we have ap-plied to burdens caused by laws that single out religious ex508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:07 PAGES OPINPGT

ercise: " `only those interests of the highest order and thosenot otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to

the free exercise of religion.' " McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S.,at 628 (plurality opinion) (quoting Yoder, supra, at 215).
Compare McDaniel, supra, at 628-629 (plurality opinion)(applying that test to a law aimed at religious conduct) with
Yoder, supra, at 215-229 (applying that test to a formallyneutral, general law). Other cases in which the Court has
applied heightened scrutiny to the enforcement of formallyneutral, generally applicable laws that burden religious exercise include Hernandez v. Commissioner, supra, at 699;
Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 489 U. S.
829, 835 (1989); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n,
supra, at 141; Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S.

Thomas, supra, at 718; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S.
398, 403 (1963); and Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296,304-307 (1940).

Though Smith sought to distinguish the free-exercisecases in which the Court mandated exemptions from secular
laws of general application, see 494 U. S., at 881-885, I am
not persuaded. Wisconsin v. Yoder, and Cantwell v. Connecticut, according to Smith, were not true free-exercise
cases but "hybrid[s]" involving "the Free Exercise Clausein conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as

freedom of speech and of the press, or the right of parents. . . to direct the education of their children."

Smith, supra,
at 881, 882. Neither opinion, however, leaves any doubt that"fundamental claims of religious freedom [were] at stake."

Yoder, supra, at 221; see also Cantwell, supra, at 303-307.4

4 Yoder, which involved a challenge by Amish parents to the enforcement
against them of a compulsory school attendance law, mentioned the parental rights recognized in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925),
as Smith pointed out. See Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources
of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 881, n. 1 (citing Yoder, 406 U. S., at
233). But Yoder did so only to distinguish Pierce, which involved a

And the distinction Smith draws strikes me as ultimatelyuntenable. If a hybrid claim is simply one in which another

constitutional right is implicated, then the hybrid exceptionwould probably be so vast as to swallow the Smith rule, and,
indeed, the hybrid exception would cover the situation exem-plified by

Smith, since free speech and associational rightsare certainly implicated in the peyote ritual. But if a hybrid

claim is one in which a litigant would actually obtain an ex-emption from a formally neutral, generally applicable law
under another constitutional provision, then there wouldhave been no reason for the Court in what Smith calls the
hybrid cases to have mentioned the Free Exercise Clauseat all.

Smith sought to confine the remaining free-exercise ex-emption victories, which involved unemployment compensasubstantive due process challenge to a compulsory school attendance law
and which required merely a showing of " `reasonable[ness].' " 406 U. S.,
at 233 (quoting Pierce, supra, at 535). Where parents make a "free exercise claim," the Yoder Court said, the Pierce reasonableness test is inapplicable and the State's action must be measured by a stricter test, the test
developed under the Free Exercise Clause and discussed at length earlier
in the opinion. See 406 U. S., at 233; id., at 213-229. Quickly after the
reference to parental rights, the Yoder opinion makes clear that the case
involves "the central values underlying the Religion Clauses." Id., at
234. The Yoders raised only a free-exercise defense to their prosecution
under the school-attendance law, id., at 209, and n. 4; certiorari was
granted only on the free-exercise issue, id., at 207; and the Court plainly
understood the case to involve "conduct protected by the Free Exercise
Clause" even against enforcement of a "regulatio[n] of general applicability," id., at 220.

As for Cantwell, Smith pointed out that the case explicitly mentions
freedom of speech. See 494 U. S., at 881, n. 1 (citing Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S., at 307). But the quote to which Smith refers occurs in a
portion of the Cantwell opinion (titled: "[s]econd," and dealing with a
breach-of-peace conviction for playing phonograph records, see 310 U. S.,
at 307) that discusses an entirely different issue from the section of Cantwell that Smith cites as involving a "neutral, generally applicable law"
(titled: "[f]irst," and dealing with a licensing system for solicitations, see
Cantwell, supra, at 303-307). See Smith, supra, at 881.

Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136 (1987); Thomas v.
Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S.707 (1981); and

Sherbert, supra, as "stand[ing] for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system tocases of `religious hardship' without compelling reason."

494 U. S., at 884. But prior to Smith the Court had alreadyrefused to accept that explanation of the unemployment compensation cases. See Hobbie, supra, at 142, n. 7; Bowen v.
Roy, 476 U. S. 693, 715-716 (1986) (opinion of Blackmun, J.);
id., at 727-732 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Brennan
and Marshall, JJ.); id., at 733 (White, J., dissenting). And,
again, the distinction fails to exclude Smith: "If Smith is
viewed as an unemployment compensation case, the distinction is obviously spurious. If Smith is viewed as a hypothetical criminal prosecution for peyote use, there would be
an individual governmental assessment of the defendants'
motives and actions in the form of a criminal trial." McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and the Smith Decision, 57
U. Chi. L. Rev. 1109, 1124 (1990). Smith also distinguished
the unemployment compensation cases on the ground that
they did not involve "an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct." 494 U. S., at 884.
But even Chief Justice Burger's plurality opinion in Bowen
v. Roy, on which Smith drew for its analysis of the unemployment compensation cases, would have applied its reasonableness test only to "denial of government benefits" and not to
"governmental action or legislation that criminalizes religiously inspired activity or inescapably compels conduct that
some find objectionable for religious reasons," Bowen v. Roy,
supra, at 706 (opinion of Burger, C. J., joined by Powell and
Rehnquist, JJ.); to the latter category of governmental action, it would have applied the test employed in Yoder, which
involved an across-the-board criminal prohibition and which
Chief Justice Burger's opinion treated as an ordinary free508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Yoder, 406 U. S., at 218; see also McDaniel v.
Paty, 435 U. S., at 628, n. 8 (noting cases in which courtsconsidered claims for exemptions from general criminal prohibitions, cases the Court thought were "illustrative of the
general nature of free-exercise protections and the delicatebalancing required by our decisions in [

Sherbert and Yoder,]
when an important state interest is shown").As for the cases on which

Smith primarily relied as establishing the rule it embraced, Reynolds v. United States, 98U. S. 145 (1879), and

Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310
U. S. 586 (1940), see Smith, supra, at 879, their subsequent
treatment by the Court would seem to require rejection of
the Smith rule. Reynolds, which in upholding the polygamy
conviction of a Mormon stressed the evils it saw as associated with polygamy, see 98 U. S., at 166 ("polygamy leads to
the patriarchal principle, and . . . fetters the people in stationary despotism"); id., at 165, 168, has been read as consistent with the principle that religious conduct may be regulated by general or targeting law only if the conduct "pose[s]
some substantial threat to public safety, peace or order."
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S., at 403; see also United States
v. Lee, 455 U. S., at 257-258; Bob Jones University, 461 U. S.,
at 603; Yoder, supra, at 230. And Gobitis, after three Justices who originally joined the opinion renounced it for disregarding the government's constitutional obligation "to accommodate itself to the religious views of minorities," Jones
v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584, 624 (1942) (opinion of Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ.), was explicitly overruled in West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943); see
also id., at 643-644 (Black and Douglas, JJ., concurring).

Since holding in 1940 that the Free Exercise Clause applies to the States, see Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.

296, the Court repeatedly has stated that the Clause sets
strict limits on the government's power to burden religious
exercise, whether it is a law's object to do so or its unantici508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:07 PAGES OPINPGT

pated effect. Smith responded to these statements bysuggesting that the Court did not really mean what it said,

detecting in at least the most recent opinions a lack ofcommitment to the compelling-interest test in the context of
formally neutral laws. Smith, supra, at 884-885. But evenif the Court's commitment were that palid, it would argue
only for moderating the language of the test, not for elimi-nating constitutional scrutiny altogether. In any event, I
would have trouble concluding that the Court has not meantwhat it has said in more than a dozen cases over several
decades, particularly when in the same period it repeatedlyapplied the compelling-interest test to require exemptions,
even in a case decided the year before Smith. See Frazeev. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 489 U. S. 829
(1989).5 In sum, it seems to me difficult to escape the con5 Though Smith implied that the Court, in considering claims for exemptions from formally neutral, generally applicable laws, has applied a "water[ed] down" version of strict scrutiny, 494 U. S., at 888, that appraisal
confuses the cases in which we purported to apply strict scrutiny with the
cases in which we did not. We did not purport to apply strict scrutiny in
several cases involving discrete categories of governmental action in
which there are special reasons to defer to the judgment of the political
branches, and the opinions in those cases said in no uncertain terms that
traditional heightened scrutiny applies outside those categories. See
O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 349 (1987) ("[P]rison regulations
. . . are judged under a `reasonableness' test less restrictive than that
ordinarily applied to alleged infringements of fundamental constitutional
rights"); Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U. S. 503, 507 (1986) ("Our review of
military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more
deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society"); see also Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361,
385-386 (1974); Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437, 462 (1971). We
also did not purport to apply strict scrutiny in several cases in which the
claimants failed to establish a constitutionally cognizable burden on religious exercise, and again the opinions in those cases left no doubt that
heightened scrutiny applies to the enforcement of formally neutral, general laws that do burden free exercise. See Jimmy Swaggart Ministries
v. Board of Equalization of Cal., 493 U. S. 378, 384-385 (1990) ("Our cases

clusion that, whatever Smith's virtues, they do not include acomfortable fit with settled law.

B
The Smith rule, in my view, may be reexamined consist-ently with principles of stare decisis. To begin with, the

Smith rule was not subject to "full-dress argument" prior toits announcement.

Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 676-677(1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). The State of Oregon in

Smith contended that its refusal to exempt religious peyoteuse survived the strict scrutiny required by "settled free exercise principles," inasmuch as the State had "a compellinginterest in regulating" the practice of peyote use and could
not "accommodate the religious practice without compromishas placed a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious
belief or practice and, if so, whether a compelling governmental interest
justifies the burden") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);
Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U. S. 439, 450
(1988) ("[T]his Court has repeatedly held that indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions, are
subject to [the] scrutiny" employed in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398
(1963); see also Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U. S. 599, 606-607 (1961) (plurality opinion). Among the cases in which we have purported to apply strict
scrutiny, we have required free-exercise exemptions more often than we
have denied them. Compare Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security, 489 U. S. 829 (1989); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of
Fla., 480 U. S. 136 (1987); Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment
Security Div., 450 U. S. 707 (1981); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205
(1972); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940), with Hernandez v.
Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680 (1989); Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461
U. S. 574 (1983); United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982). And of the
three cases in which we found that denial of an exemption survived strict
scrutiny (all tax cases), one involved the government's "fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education," Bob
Jones University, supra, at 604; in a second the Court "doubt[ed] whether
the alleged burden . . . [was] a substantial one," Hernandez, supra, at 699;
and the Court seemed to be of the same view in the third, see Lee, supra,
at 261, n. 12. These cases, I think, provide slim grounds for concluding
that the Court has not been true to its word.

id., at 5-36; Reply Brief for Petitioners in Smith, pp. 6-20. Respondents joined issue on theoutcome of strict scrutiny on the facts before the Court, see

Brief for Respondents in Smith, pp. 14-41, and neither party
squarely addressed the proposition the Court was to em-brace, that the Free Exercise Clause was irrelevant to the

dispute. Sound judicial decisionmaking requires "both avigorous prosecution and a vigorous defense" of the issues in
dispute, Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412,419 (1978), and a constitutional rule announced

sua sponte is
entitled to less deference than one addressed on full briefing
and argument. Cf. Ladner v. United States, 358 U. S. 169,
173 (1958) (declining to address "an important and complex"
issue concerning the scope of collateral attack upon criminal
sentences because it had received "only meagre argument"
from the parties, and the Court thought it "should have the
benefit of a full argument before dealing with the question").

The Smith rule's vitality as precedent is limited further by
the seeming want of any need of it in resolving the question
presented in that case. Justice O'Connor reached the
same result as the majority by applying, as the parties had
requested, "our established free exercise jurisprudence," 494
U. S., at 903, and the majority never determined that the
case could not be resolved on the narrower ground, going
instead straight to the broader constitutional rule. But the
Court's better practice, one supported by the same principles
of restraint that underlie the rule of stare decisis, is not to
" `formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.' "

United States, 295 U. S. 602, 627 (1935); see also Kastigar v.
United States, 406 U. S. 441, 454-455 (1972).

I do not, of course, mean to imply that a broad constitutional rule announced without full briefing and argument
necessarily lacks precedential weight. Over time, such a decision may become "part of the tissue of the law," Radovich
v. National Football League, 352 U. S. 445, 455 (1957)
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting), and may be subject to reliance in a way that new and unexpected decisions are not.
Cf. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505
U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992). Smith, however, is not such a
case. By the same token, by pointing out Smith's recent
vintage I do not mean to suggest that novelty alone is
enough to justify reconsideration. "[S]tare decisis," as Justice Frankfurter wrote, "is a principle of policy and not a
mechanical formula," Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119
(1940), and the decision whether to adhere to a prior decision,
particularly a constitutional decision, is a complex and difficult one that does not lend itself to resolution by application
of simple, categorical rules, but that must account for a variety of often competing considerations.

The considerations of full briefing, necessity, and novelty
thus do not exhaust the legitimate reasons for reexamining
prior decisions, or even for reexamining the Smith rule.
One important further consideration warrants mention here,
however, because it demands the reexamination I have in
mind. Smith presents not the usual question of whether to
follow a constitutional rule, but the question of which constitutional rule to follow, for Smith refrained from overruling
prior free-exercise cases that contain a free-exercise rule
fundamentally at odds with the rule Smith declared.
Smith, indeed, announced its rule by relying squarely upon

the precedent of prior cases. See 494 U. S., at 878 ("Ourdecisions reveal that the . . . reading" of the Free Exercise

Clause contained in the Smith rule "is the correct one").Since that precedent is nonetheless at odds with the

Smith
rule, as I have discussed above, the result is an intolerable
tension in free-exercise law which may be resolved, consist-ently with principles of

stare decisis, in a case in which the
tension is presented and its resolution pivotal.While the tension on which I rely exists within the body

of our extant case law, a rereading of that case law will not,of course, mark the limits of any enquiry directed to reexamining the Smith rule, which should be reviewed in light not
only of the precedent on which it was rested but also of the
text of the Free Exercise Clause and its origins. As for
text, Smith did not assert that the plain language of the Free
Exercise Clause compelled its rule, but only that the rule
was "a permissible reading" of the Clause. Ibid. Suffice
it to say that a respectable argument may be made that
the pre-Smith law comes closer to fulfilling the language of

the Free Exercise Clause than the rule Smith announced.
"[T]he Free Exercise Clause . . . , by its terms, gives special
protection to the exercise of religion," Thomas, 450 U. S., at
713, specifying an activity and then flatly protecting it
against government prohibition. The Clause draws no distinction between laws whose object is to prohibit religious
exercise and laws with that effect, on its face seemingly
applying to both.

Nor did Smith consider the original meaning of the Free
Exercise Clause, though overlooking the opportunity was no
unique transgression. Save in a handful of passing remarks,
the Court has not explored the history of the Clause since
its early attempts in 1879 and 1890, see Reynolds v. United
States, 98 U. S., at 162-166, and Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S.
333, 342 (1890), attempts that recent scholarship makes clear
were incomplete. See generally McConnell, The Origins
and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion,

103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409 (1990).6 The curious absence of history from our free-exercise decisions creates a stark contrast
with our cases under the Establishment Clause, where historical analysis has been so prominent.7

This is not the place to explore the history that a century
of free-exercise opinions have overlooked, and it is enough
to note that, when the opportunity to reexamine Smith presents itself, we may consider recent scholarship raising serious questions about the Smith rule's consonance with the
original understanding and purpose of the Free Exercise
Clause. See McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, supra; Durham, Religious Liberty and the Call of Conscience, 42 DePaul L. Rev.

of Justice, Report to the Attorney General, Religious Liberty under the Free Exercise Clause 38-42 (1986) (predating
Smith). There appears to be a strong argument from the

6 Reynolds denied the free-exercise claim of a Mormon convicted of polygamy, and Davis v. Beason upheld against a free-exercise challenge a
law denying the right to vote or hold public office to members of organizations that practice or encourage polygamy. Exactly what the two cases
took from the Free Exercise Clause's origins is unclear. The cases are
open to the reading that the Clause sometimes protects religious conduct
from enforcement of generally applicable laws, see supra, at 569 (citing
cases); that the Clause never protects religious conduct from the enforcement of generally applicable laws, see Smith, 494 U. S., at 879; or that the
Clause does not protect religious conduct at all, see Yoder, 406 U. S., at
247 (Douglas, J., dissenting in part); McConnell, The Origins and Historical

576 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Opinion of Souter, J.
Clause's development in the First Congress, from its origins
in the post-Revolution state constitutions and pre-Revolution
colonial charters, and from the philosophy of rights to which
the Framers adhered, that the Clause was originally understood to preserve a right to engage in activities necessary to
fulfill one's duty to one's God, unless those activities threatened the rights of others or the serious needs of the State.
If, as this scholarship suggests, the Free Exercise Clause's
original "purpose [was] to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions thereof by civil authority," School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 223,
then there would be powerful reason to interpret the Clause
to accord with its natural reading, as applying to all laws
prohibiting religious exercise in fact, not just those aimed at
its prohibition, and to hold the neutrality needed to implement such a purpose to be the substantive neutrality of our
pre-Smith cases, not the formal neutrality sufficient for constitutionality under Smith.8

8 The Court today observes that "historical instances of religious persecution and intolerance . . . gave concern to those who drafted the Free
Exercise Clause." Ante, at 532 (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted). That is no doubt true, and of course it supports the proposition
for which it was summoned, that the Free Exercise Clause forbids religious persecution. But the Court's remark merits this observation: the
fact that the Framers were concerned about victims of religious persecution by no means demonstrates that the Framers intended the Free Exercise Clause to forbid only persecution, the inference the Smith rule requires. On the contrary, the eradication of persecution would mean
precious little to a member of a formerly persecuted sect who was nevertheless prevented from practicing his religion by the enforcement of "neutral, generally applicable" laws. If what drove the Framers was a desire
to protect an activity they deemed special, and if "the [Framers] were
well aware of potential conflicts between religious conviction and social
duties," A. Adams & C. Emmerich, A Nation Dedicated to Religious Liberty 61 (1990), they may well have hoped to bar not only prohibitions of
religious exercise fueled by the hostility of the majority, but prohibitions
flowing from the indifference or ignorance of the majority as well.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
The scholarship on the original understanding of the FreeExercise Clause is, to be sure, not uniform. See, e. g., Hamburger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption: AnHistorical Perspective, 60 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 915 (1992);
Bradley, Beguiled: Free Exercise Exemptions and the SirenSong of Liberalism, 20 Hofstra L. Rev. 245 (1991). And
there are differences of opinion as to the weight appropri-ately accorded original meaning. But whether or not one
considers the original designs of the Clause binding, the in-terpretive significance of those designs surely ranks in the
hierarchy of issues to be explored in resolving the tensioninherent in free-exercise law as it stands today.

III
The extent to which the Free Exercise Clause requiresgovernment to refrain from impeding religious exercise defines nothing less than the respective relationships in ourconstitutional democracy of the individual to government
and to God. "Neutral, generally applicable" laws, drafted asthey are from the perspective of the nonadherent, have the
unavoidable potential of putting the believer to a choice be-tween God and government. Our cases now present competing answers to the question when government, while pur-suing secular ends, may compel disobedience to what one
believes religion commands. The case before us is rightlydecided without resolving the existing tension, which remains for another day when it may be squarely faced.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in the judgment.

The Court holds today that the city of Hialeah violated theFirst and Fourteenth Amendments when it passed a set of
restrictive ordinances explicitly directed at petitioners' reli-gious practice. With this holding I agree. I write separately to emphasize that the First Amendment's protectionof religion extends beyond those rare occasions on which the
government explicitly targets religion (or a particular reli508us2$93F 03-17-97 14:46:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
gion) for disfavored treatment, as is done in this case. Inmy view, a statute that burdens the free exercise of religion

"may stand only if the law in general, and the State's refusalto allow a religious exemption in particular, are justified by a
compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive
means." Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of
Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 907 (1990) (dissenting opinion).
The Court, however, applies a different test. It applies thetest announced in

Smith, under which "a law that is neutral
and of general applicability need not be justified by a compel-ling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental

effect of burdening a particular religious practice." Ante, at531. I continue to believe that

Smith was wrongly decided,
because it ignored the value of religious freedom as an affirmative individual liberty and treated the Free ExerciseClause as no more than an antidiscrimination principle. See

494 U. S., at 908-909. Thus, while I agree with the resultthe Court reaches in this case, I arrive at that result by a
different route.When the State enacts legislation that intentionally or
unintentionally places a burden upon religiously motivatedpractice, it must justify that burden by "showing that it is
the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling
state interest." Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 718 (1981). See also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 215 (1972). A State may no
more create an underinclusive statute, one that fails truly to
promote its purported compelling interest, than it may create an overinclusive statute, one that encompasses more protected conduct than necessary to achieve its goal. In the
latter circumstance, the broad scope of the statute is unnecessary to serve the interest, and the statute fails for that
reason. In the former situation, the fact that allegedly
harmful conduct falls outside the statute's scope belies a governmental assertion that it has genuinely pursued an interest "of the highest order." Ibid. If the State's goal is important enough to prohibit religiously motivated activity, it

579Cite as: 508 U. S. 520 (1993)
Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
will not and must not stop at religiously motivated activity.Cf.

Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U. S. 374, 390 (1978) (invalidating certain restrictions on marriage as "grossly underinclu-sive with respect to [their] purpose");

Supreme Court of
N. H. v. Piper, 470 U. S. 274, 285, n. 19 (1985) (a rule excluding nonresidents from the bar of New Hampshire "is under-inclusive . . . because it permits lawyers who move away

from the State to retain their membership in the bar").In this case, the ordinances at issue are both overinclusive
and underinclusive in relation to the state interests they pur-portedly serve. They are overinclusive, as the majority correctly explains, because the "legitimate governmental inter-ests in protecting the public health and preventing cruelty
to animals could be addressed by restrictions stopping far
short of a flat prohibition of all Santeria sacrificial practice."
Ante, at 538. They are underinclusive as well, because
"[d]espite the city's proffered interest in preventing cru-elty to animals, the ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by religious sacri-fice."

Ante, at 543. Moreover, the "ordinances are also
underinclusive with regard to the city's interest in publichealth . . . ."

Ante, at 544.
When a law discriminates against religion as such, as do
the ordinances in this case, it automatically will fail strict
scrutiny under Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 402-403, 407
(1963) (holding that governmental regulation that imposes a
burden upon religious practice must be narrowly tailored to
advance a compelling state interest). This is true because
a law that targets religious practice for disfavored treatment
both burdens the free exercise of religion and, by definition,
is not precisely tailored to a compelling governmental
interest.

Thus, unlike the majority, I do not believe that "[a] law
burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny."
Ante, at 546. In my view, regulation that targets religion in
this way, ipso facto, fails strict scrutiny. It is for this reason

580 CHURCH OF LUKUMI BABALU AYE, INC. v. HIALEAH

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
that a statute that explicitly restricts religious practicesviolates the First Amendment. Otherwise, however, "[t]he

First Amendment . . . does not distinguish between laws thatare generally applicable and laws that target particular religious practices." Smith, 494 U. S., at 894 (opinion concur-ring in judgment).

It is only in the rare case that a state or local legislaturewill enact a law directly burdening religious practice as such.
See ibid. Because respondent here does single out religionin this way, the present case is an easy one to decide.

A harder case would be presented if petitioners were re-questing an exemption from a generally applicable anticruelty law. The result in the case before the Court today,and the fact that every Member of the Court concurs in that
result, does not necessarily reflect this Court's views of thestrength of a State's interest in prohibiting cruelty to animals. This case does not present, and I therefore decline toreach, the question whether the Free Exercise Clause would
require a religious exemption from a law that sincerely pur-sued the goal of protecting animals from cruel treatment.
The number of organizations that have filed amicus briefson behalf of this interest,* however, demonstrates that it is
not a concern to be treated lightly.

LOCAL 144 NURSING HOME PENSION FUND

et al. v. DEMISAY et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-610. Argued January 11, 1993--Decided June 14, 1993
For several years, respondent employers had made contributions to two

trust funds (collectively, Greater Funds) on behalf of their employees.
In 1984, however, the employers ended their participation in the Greater
Funds and agreed, in collective-bargaining agreements with the relevant union, to establish a new set of trust funds (collectively, Southern
Funds). To help finance the change between the funds, the employers
and other respondents brought an action to compel petitioners, the
Greater Funds and their trustees, to transfer to the Southern Funds
that portion of the Greater Funds' reserves attributable to respondents'
past contributions. Respondents asserted a right to relief under, inter
alia, $ 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, which prohibits payments from employers to union representatives, $$ 302(a) and (b),
but affords an exception under $ 302(c)(5) for payments to an employee
trust fund if certain conditions are met, including that the trust fund be
"established . . . for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees,"
and that the payments be "held in trust for the purpose of paying"
employee benefits. Respondents' theory was that, unless the reserves
attributable to the employers' past contributions were transferred, the
Greater Funds would fail to meet $ 302(c)(5)'s conditions and would thus
suffer from a "structural defect" which could be remedied by the federal
courts pursuant to the power conferred by $ 302(e) to "restrain violations of this section." The District Court granted petitioners' motion
for summary judgment, finding no such "structural defect" in the
Greater Funds, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for
the District Court to shape an appropriate remedy.

Held: A federal court does not have authority under $ 302(e) to issue injunctions against a trust fund or its trustees requiring the trust funds to
be administered in the manner described in $ 302(c)(5). Section 302(e)
provides district courts with jurisdiction "to restrain violations of this
section," and a violation of $ 302 occurs when payments prohibited by

$$ 302(a) and (b) are made. The exception to violation set forth in

$ 302(c)(5) describes the character of the trust to which payments are
allowed, leaving it originally to state trust law, and now to federal trust
law under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, to

Opinion of the Court
Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund and the New YorkCity Nursing Home-Local 144 Welfare Fund (collectively,

Greater Funds)--were established pursuant to collective-bargaining agreements between the Greater Employer Association and the relevant union, Local 144 of the Hotel, Hospital, Nursing Home and Allied Services Employees Union,Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (Local

144). Prior to 1981, the respondent employers made contri-butions to the Greater Funds on behalf of their employees in
accordance with the terms of collective-bargaining agree-ments negotiated between the Greater Employer Association and Local 144.In 1981, the respondent employers broke away from the
Greater Employer Association and executed independent
collective-bargaining agreements with Local 144. The ini-tial agreements required continuing employer contributions

to the Greater Funds, but those concluded in 1984 providedfor establishment of a new set of trust funds, the Local 144
Southern New York Residential Health Care Facilities Asso-ciation Pension Fund and the Local 144 Southern New York
Residential Health Care Facilities Association Welfare Fund(Southern Funds). At approximately the same time, the
respondent employers ended their participation in the
Greater Funds.

In negotiating the transfer from the Greater Funds to the
Southern Funds, the "primary concern" of Local 144 was to
make sure that the shift would not cause its members to lose
benefits. 935 F. 2d 528, 530 (CA2 1991). To address that
concern, the respondent employers guaranteed in their
collective-bargaining agreements that the Southern Funds
would recognize all credited service time earned under the
Greater Funds and, more generally, that employees would
not lose any benefits as a result of the withdrawal from the
Greater Funds. See 710 F. Supp. 58, 60-61 (SDNY 1989).
That guarantee obviously created some peculiar liabilities
for the Southern Funds. For example, an employee who had
earned nine years' credited service time under the Greater

508us2$94K 02-19-97 13:58:36 PAGES OPINPGT
584 LOCAL 144 NURSING HOME PENSION FUND v. DEMISAY

Opinion of the Court
Funds would, after just one more year of service, acquire
vested rights to pension benefits pursuant to the 10-year
vesting requirement of the Southern Funds--even though
the Southern Funds had received only one year of employer
contributions for that employee. See id., at 61, n. 4. The
Southern Funds' assumption of these liabilities, however, did
not alter the obligations of the Greater Funds, which were
not parties to the collective-bargaining agreements: They
remained liable to the departing employees for all vested
benefits. See id., at 61, and n. 5, 65; 935 F. 2d, at 530-531.

To help cover the Southern Funds' liabilities and in general to help finance the change from the Greater Funds to
the Southern Funds, the respondent employers--joined by
several of their employees and the trustees of the Southern Funds--brought this action to compel petitioners, the
Greater Funds and the Greater Funds' trustees, to transfer
an appropriate fractional share of the Greater Funds' assets
to the Southern Funds. They asserted right to relief under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA), 29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. III),
and under $ 302 of the LMRA; only the latter claim is at
issue here.

The relevant portions of $ 302 are set forth in the margin.1
To describe respondents' claim, it is necessary to sketch

1 Section 302, 29 U. S. C. $ 186 (1988 ed. and Supp. III), provides in part:

the structure of that provision. Subsection (a) prohibits anemployer (or an association of employers, such as the Greater

Employer Association) from, inter alia, making payments toany representative of its employees, including the employees'
union and union officials. Paragraph (b)(1) is the "reciprocal" of subsection (a), Arroyo v. United States, 359 U. S. 419,
423 (1959), making it unlawful for employee representatives
to receive the payments prohibited by subsection (a). The
prohibitions of subsection (a) and paragraph (b)(1) are drawn
broadly and would prevent payments to union employee
health and welfare funds such as those at issue here. See
generally United States v. Ryan, 350 U. S. 299, 304-305
(1956); Goetz, Employee Benefit Trusts under Section 302

delivery of any money or other thing of value prohibited by subsection (a)
of this section.. . . . .

"(c) . . . The provisions of this section shall not be applicable . . . (5) with
respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established
by [the representative of the employees], for the sole and exclusive benefit
of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents (or
of such employees, families, and dependents jointly with the employees of
other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents): Provided, That (A) such payments are held in trust for the purpose
of paying . . . for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents,
for medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death of employees,
. . . (B) the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is
specified in a written agreement with the employer . . . ; and (C) such
payments as are intended to be used for the purpose of providing pensions
or annuities for employees are made to a separate trust which provides
that the funds held therein cannot be used for any purpose other than
paying such pensions or annuities; . . .. . . . .

shown, and subject to the provisions of section 381 of title 28 (relating to

trust fund so long as certain conditions are met, including
that the trust fund be "established . . . for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the employees," and that the payments
be "held in trust for the purpose of paying" employee
benefits.

Respondents' theory is that the Greater Funds cannot
meet those last quoted conditions unless they transfer to the
Southern Funds the portion of their reserves that is attributable to the respondents' past contributions. If they fail to
do so, according to respondents, they will suffer from a
"structural defect" which can be remedied by federal courts
pursuant to the power conferred by $ 302(e) to "restrain violations of this section."

The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment. Though it agreed with respondents that it
had power to "review a challenge that the Greater Funds
are structurally deficient under [$ 302(c)(5)'s] `sole and exclusive' benefit standard," 710 F. Supp., at 61, 62, it found no
"structural defect," since there was no allegation of corruption in the Greater Funds and since the transfer of assets
would not further any collective-bargaining policies. Id., at
64. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
Greater Funds "would suffer from a `structural defect' " unless the funds transferred a portion of their assets to the
Southern Funds. 935 F. 2d, at 534. It remanded for the
District Court "to shape an appropriate remedy guided by
the principle that a fair portion of the reserves reflecting
contributions made to the Greater Funds on behalf of the
[respondents' employees] should be reallocated to the Southern Funds." Ibid. We granted certiorari, 505 U. S. 1203
(1992).

Opinion of the Court

II
Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals reliedon the Second Circuit's earlier decision in

Local 50, Bakeryand Confectionery Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. Local 3,

Bakery and Confectionery Workers Union, AFL-CIO, 733F. 2d 229 (1984), which held that federal courts have " `jurisdiction under [$ 302(e)] to enforce a trust fund's compliancewith the statutory standards set forth in subsection (c)(5)
by eliminating those offensive features in the structure oroperation of the trust that would cause it to fail to qualify
for a (c)(5) exception.' " Id., at 234 (quoting Associated Contractors of Essex Cty., Inc. v. Laborers Int'l Union of NorthAmerica, 559 F. 2d 222, 225 (CA3 1977)). Local 50 and the

decision below are among a large body of conflicting casesbearing upon federal courts' powers under $ 302(e) to supervise the administration of $ 302(c)(5) trust funds. A numberof courts have held that $ 302(e) confers broad supervisory
powers. See, e. g., Ponce v. Construction Laborers Pension
Trust for Southern California, 628 F. 2d 537, 541-542 (CA91980); Lewis v. Mill Ridge Coals, Inc., 298 F. 2d 552, 558

(CA6 1962). Others have held that it confers no supervisorypowers at all. See, e. g., Ader v. Hughes, 570 F. 2d 303, 306
(CA10 1978); Bowers v. Ulpiano Casal, Inc., 393 F. 2d 421(CA1 1968);

Moses v. Ammond, 162 F. Supp. 866, 871-872(SDNY 1958). Still others have acknowledged supervisory

powers limited in various respects. See Riley v. MEBA
Pension Trust, 570 F. 2d 406, 412-413 (CA2 1977); Knauss
v. Gorman, 583 F. 2d 82, 86-87 (CA3 1978). Our most recentcase in this area expressly reserved the question. See

Mine
Workers Health and Retirement Funds v. Robinson, 455
U. S. 562, 573, n. 12 (1982).We hold today that $ 302(e) does not provide authority for

a federal court to issue injunctions against a trust fund orits trustees requiring the trust funds to be administered in
the manner described in $ 302(c)(5). By its unmistakable

Opinion of the Court
language, $ 302(e) provides district courts with jurisdiction
"to restrain violations of this section." A "violation" of

$ 302 occurs when the substantive restrictions in $$ 302(a)
and (b) are disobeyed, which happens, not when funds are
administered by the trust fund, but when they are "pa[id],
len[t], or deliver[ed]" to the trust fund, $ 302(a), or when they
are "receive[d], or accept[ed]" by the trust fund, or "request[ed], [or] demand[ed]" for the trust fund, $ 302(b)(1).
And the exception to violation set forth in paragraph (c)(5)
relates, not to the purpose for which the trust fund is in fact
used (an unrestricted fund that happens to be used "for the
sole and exclusive benefit of the employees" does not qualify); but rather to the purpose for which the trust fund is
"established," $ 302(c)(5), and for which the payments are
"held in trust," $ 302(c)(5)(A).2 The trustees' failure to

2 Justice Stevens asserts that our holding is "uninvited," post, at 601,
was "quite unanticipated by the submissions of the parties" post, at 595,
and has been reached "[w]ithout the benefit of argument . . . by either
litigant," ibid. That is not so. The Summary of Argument in petitioners'
brief began with the assertion that $ 302(c)(5) was only "a narrow exception to a broad criminal prohibition." Brief for Petitioners 7. The first
subdivision of the Argument elaborated on that point, arguing that the
provision conferred no authority "to oversee the administration of employee benefit plans." Id., at 8. And the next subdivision, entitled
"Lower Federal Courts Have Misconstrued Section 302(c)(5) in Asserting
Broad Jurisdiction over the Regulation of Employee Benefit Plans," systematically criticized the lower court jurisprudence permitting regulation
of benefit plans, including cases from almost every Circuit. Id., at 11-18.
The subdivision concluded: "[T]he federal courts simply do not have the
power, by reason of Section 302(c)(5), to restructure and regulate employee benefit plans." Id., at 18 (footnote omitted). By attacking the
basic authority of federal courts to regulate $ 302(c)(5) trust funds, petitioners raised the issue we decide here, and amply discussed the considerations bearing upon it. Respondents evidently understood the import of
petitioners' argument. They devoted an entire subdivision of their brief
to the topic "Federal Courts Have Authority To Remedy Violations Of
Section 302(c)(5) In Civil Cases." See Brief for Respondents 17-19. In
response to our point here, Justice Stevens quotes a passage from a

Opinion of the Court
comply with these latter purposes may be a breach of their
contractual or fiduciary obligations and may subject them
to suit for such breach; but it is no violation of $ 302.3

A few courts and some academic commentators have
drawn an analogy between $$ 301 and 302 of the LMRA and
have suggested that, as $ 301 has been held to create a
federal common law governing labor contracts, see Textile
Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448 (1957), so too
should $ 302 be viewed as authorizing the development of "a
specialized body of federal common law of trust administration." Goetz, Developing Federal Labor Law of Welfare and
Pension Plans, 55 Cornell L. Rev. 911, 930 (1970). One court

different section of petitioners' brief and claims that it is "disingenuous"
to characterize that argument as a broad attack on a federal court's power.
Post, at 598, n. 4. We do not do so.

3 Justice Stevens concludes that "it is perfectly clear that funds are

no longer `held in trust for the purpose' of benefiting employees if, immediately after deposit into a legitimate trust fund, they are diverted for some
improper purpose." Post, at 597-598, n. 3. It is true that funds are "no
longer" held in trust if they are misappropriated (just as it is true that
funds are "no longer" held in trust when they are paid out in the form of
pensions), but it is also irrelevant. If the payments, when received by the
relevant employee representative, "are held in trust" and that trust satisfies the other requirements of $ 302(c)(5) (including that it have been "established" for the proper purposes), the exception in $ 302(c)(5) applies and
the payments do not violate $ 302. This was our precise holding in Arroyo v. United States, 359 U. S. 419 (1959). The union official in that case,
immediately upon receiving the employer's contributions to the trust fund,
had begun diverting the funds to improper purposes. See id., at 422.
Indeed, "the evidence could properly support an inference that the [union
official's] purpose from the outset was to appropriate the [contributions to
the fund] for his own use." Id., at 423 (emphasis added). Nevertheless,
we held that the employer's payments were "within the precise language
of $ 302(c)." Ibid. We deemed the payments to have been "held in trust
for the purpose" of benefiting employees since they were made to a trust
fund established for that purpose. See id., at 421, 423. Justice Stevens criticizes us for relying on this "half" of Arroyo while disregarding
the other "half," see, post, at 595, n. 1, but the "half" to which we adhere
is holding, and the "half" we disregard, dictum.

Opinion of the Court
has said, quoting Lincoln Mills, supra, at 457, that "jurisdic-tion in a case of this kind can be found within the `penumbra

of express statutory mandate' of Section 302." Lugo v. Employees Retirement Fund of Illumination Products Industry, 366 F. Supp. 99, 103 (EDNY 1973), quoted approvingly
in Alvares v. Erickson, 514 F. 2d 156, 166 (CA9), cert. denied,423 U. S. 874 (1975). See also

Nedd v. United Mine Workers
of America, 556 F. 2d 190, 203 (CA3 1977), cert. denied, 434U. S. 1013 (1978). A comparison of $ 302(e) with $ 301(a)

shows that the analogy to Lincoln Mills is inapt. The latterprovides a federal cause of action for any "violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization." Subsection $ 302(e), by contrast, provides no cause of action for
a "violation of the fiduciary duties imposed pursuant to an
employee benefit trust fund"; rather, it allows federal courts
to "restrain violations" of $ 302, which, as we have explained,
occur when payments to a nonqualifying trust are made or
received.

The text of $ 302 requires that, if payments are to be exempt from its prohibition, they must be "held in trust for the
purpose of paying" employee benefits and the trust must be
"established" for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees. There is nothing to suggest that this had the ambitious purpose of establishing an entire body of federal trust
law, rather than merely describing the character of the trust
to which payments are allowed, leaving it to state law to
determine when breaches of that trust have occurred and
how they may be remedied. As observed by the court in
Moses v. Ammond, 162 F. Supp., at 872, n. 14, $ 302(c)(5) is
akin to a provision such as $ 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a) (1988 ed. and Supp. III), which (in
connection with 26 U. S. C. $ 501 (1988 ed. and Supp. III))
provides a tax exemption for employer-created pension trust
funds so long as, inter alia, they are "created . . . for the
exclusive benefit of [the employer's] employees or their beneficiaries." No one would contend that that provision confers

Opinion of the Court
upon the federal courts authority to govern and enforce the
trusts, and there is no more reason to reach such a conclusion here.

Respondents point to our statement in Arroyo v. United
States, 359 U. S., at 426-427, that "[c]ontinuing compliance
with [the standards of $ 302(c)(5)] in the administration of
welfare funds was made explicitly enforceable in federal district courts by civil proceedings under $ 302(e)." See also
Robinson, 455 U. S., at 573, n. 12 (referring to this passage).
The statement is perhaps susceptible of the reading that
"compliance" was "made . . . enforceable" by authorizing district courts to prohibit further payments to an entity that
was not established, or does not hold its funds in trust, for
the requisite purposes. But in any case, Arroyo was a criminal prosecution brought under $ 302(d), and the statement
was therefore pure dictum.4 Also dictum was our statement
in NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., 453 U. S. 322, 331 (1981), later
quoted in Robinson, supra, at 570, that "the `sole purpose'
of $ 302(c)(5) is to ensure that employee benefit trust funds
`are legitimate trust funds, used actually for the specified
benefits to the employees of the employers who contribute to
them . . . .' " (Emphasis added.) This obiter quotation of a
line from the floor debate on the LMRA cannot convert (1) a

4 While Justice Stevens does not dispute that this statement was dictum, he argues that "the reasoning that led us to [that] conclusion . . . is
not so easily dismissed." Post, at 596 (emphasis added). We disagree.
As one will see by reading the relevant passage from Arroyo (set forth in
the concurrence, post, at 596-597), the "reasoning" consisted of leaping
from the correct premise, that Congress limited the purposes for which
exempt trust funds could be used, to the entirely unsupported conclusion,
that $ 302(e) rather than state trust law was to be the means by which
that limitation was enforced. It is an ipse dixit, rather than a reasoned
conclusion--and, to boot, an ipse dixit contradicted by the very holding of
the case in which it was pronounced. Arroyo held that malfeasance in
the administration of trust funds did not create federal criminal liability
under $ 302, and there is no basis in either text or reason why it should
nonetheless create federal civil liability.

Opinion of the Court
statutory statement of trust obligations that must exist toobtain an exemption into (2) a statutory authorization to

enforce trust obligations.5Consistently with the text of $ 302(c)(5), and the structure
of $ 302 in general, we view the "sole and exclusive benefit"and "held in trust" provisions of that paragraph as neither
creating nor imposing a federal trust law standard, butrather as simply requiring a trust obligation for the specified
purposes, defined and enforced originally under state law,see Restatement (Second) of Trusts $ 170(1) (1959), and now
under ERISA.6 Cf. Amax Coal, supra, at 329-330. Re-spondents do not deny that the Greater Funds are held
subject to such a trust obligation. The fiduciaries of theGreater Funds are subject to the fiduciary obligations of
ERISA, including the so-called exclusive benefit require-ment of 29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(i), and are liable under 29
U. S. C. $ 1109(a) to legal and equitable remedies for fail-ure in those obligations. Since the Greater Funds are
entities that qualify under $ 302(c)(5), equitable relief under$ 302(e) restraining future payments to them would not be
appropriate.

5 Justice Stevens' concluding words are that our action today is "a radical departure from the doctrine of judicial restraint." Post, at 601. We
have already refuted his claim that our ruling is reached uninvited and
without benefit of argument. See supra, at 588-589, n. 2. His lack-ofrestraint criticism seems principally directed, however, at our "departure
from [the] understanding" of $ 302(c)(5), post, at 601, reflected in the dicta of
earlier cases--such as the excerpt that he quotes from Mine Workers Health
and Retirement Funds v. Robinson, 455 U. S. 562, 573, n. 12 (1982) (Stevens, J.), see post, at 600. This seems to us a topsy-turvy version of judicial
restraint. It was, if anything, those dicta themselves--uninvited, unargued, and unnecessary to the Court's holdings--which insulted that virtue;
and we would add injury to insult by according them precedential effect.

6 Title 29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1) (1988 ed. and Supp. III) provides: "[A] fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and--(A) for the exclusive purpose
of: (i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and (ii)
defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan."

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
In addition to the $ 302 claim, respondents' complaintasserted two ERISA claims, one based on ERISA's asset

transfer rules, 29 U. S. C. $ 1414, and the other on ERISA'sabove-mentioned fiduciary duty provision, $ 1104. The District Court ruled against respondents on both claims but,because of its ruling on $ 302, the Court of Appeals did not
reach them. Neither do we and, on remand, the Court ofAppeals will be free to consider them.

* * *
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this

opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice White and
Justice Blackmun join, concurring in the judgment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversedbecause petitioners' failure to transfer assets to respondents'

Southern Funds did not violate $ 302(c)(5) of the Labor Man-agement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C. $ 186(c)(5)
(1988 ed., Supp. III). Because the Court unnecessarily de-cides that $ 302(e) of the LMRA would not authorize injunctive relief even had petitioners violated the specific stand-ards of $ 302(c)(5), I do not join its opinion.

As the Court explains, see ante, at 582-584, this case arosewhen respondent employers withdrew from the Greater
Funds, a multiemployer trust fund, and negotiated an inde-pendent union agreement establishing the Southern Funds.
Respondents then sought a transfer to the Southern Fundsof that portion of the Greater Funds' assets representing respondents' past contributions on behalf of their employees.935 F. 2d 528, 531 (CA2 1991). The Court of Appeals agreed
that a transfer was necessary, reasoning that retention bythe Greater Funds of the assets contributed by respondents
would violate the "sole and exclusive benefit" provision of

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment

$ 302(c)(5). Id., at 533-534; see ante, at 586. We granted
certiorari to review that holding. See Pet. for Cert. i.

I would decide this case on the narrow ground presented:
that the refusal to make the transfer at issue did not violate

$ 302(c)(5), 29 U. S. C. $ 186(c)(5) (1988 ed., Supp. III). That
provision allows payments into trusts not only "for the sole
and exclusive benefit of the employees of [the contributing]
employer," but also for the benefit of "such employees,
families, and dependents jointly with the employees of other
employers making similar payments, and their families and
dependents." To the extent respondents' previous contributions to the Greater Funds have not been used already to
benefit respondents' own employees, they now will be used
for the benefit of "employees of other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents." Ibid.
Hence, the Greater Funds continue to operate within the
constraints of $ 302(c)(5), and no transfer is required.

That some portion of respondents' contributions will go to
benefit the employees of other contributors is, of course, in
the nature of a multiemployer plan. Such plans operate precisely as suggested by the language of $ 302(c)(5), by pooling
employer contributions for the joint benefit of all participating employees. Segregation of funds by an employer is
neither feasible nor contemplated. "An employer's contributions are not solely for the benefit of its employees or employees who have worked for it alone." Concrete Pipe &
Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension
Trust for Southern Cal., post, at 638. See also Stinson v.
Ironworkers Dist. Council of Southern Ohio and Vicinity
Benefit Trust, 869 F. 2d 1014, 1021-1022 (CA7 1989) (use of
employer's contributions for benefit of other than own employees does not violate "sole and exclusive benefit" requirement); British Motor Car Distributors, Ltd. v. San Francisco Automotive Industries Welfare Fund, 882 F. 2d 371,
377-378 (CA9 1989) (same).

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
In short, I agree with the United States, appearing as
amicus curiae, that petitioners did not violate $ 302(c)(5)
when they refused to transfer some proportional shareof assets to the Southern Funds. The Court eschews this

straightforward rule of decision, however, in favor of a far
broader approach, quite unanticipated by the submissions ofthe parties. Without the benefit of argument on the point

by either litigant, the Court reaches out to overrule decadesof case law by deciding that $ 302(e) does not authorize a
civil remedy for violations of $ 302(c)(5). In my view, thisreinvention of $ 302 of the LMRA is as unwise as it is
uninvited.Section 302(c)(5) performs two distinct functions in the
statutory scheme. First, as an exception to the criminal
prohibitions of $$ 302(a) and (b), $ 302(c)(5) provides a "safeharbor" for contributions to legitimate pension funds. See

ante, at 586. Second, $ 302(c)(5) sets forth certain standardsthat must be observed in the ongoing administration of such
funds. The importance of both these functions is illustratedby our decision in

Arroyo v. United States, 359 U. S. 419
(1959), which involved a contribution lawful when made andthereafter diverted to an unlawful use. Because the payment was to a legitimate trust fund, we held, the transaction
fell within $ 302(c)(5)'s exception, so that receipt of the pay-ment was not a criminal violation of $ 302(b).

Id., at 423-
424. At the same time, however, $ 302(e) was available toprovide a civil remedy for the violation of $ 302(c)(5) that

occurred when the funds subsequently were diverted. Id.,
at 426-427.1

1 The majority relies heavily on one half of Arroyo while disregarding the
other. See ante, at 589, n. 3. I note here only that the Court in Arroyo
never determined that funds diverted after establishment of a trust are
"held in trust for the purpose" of benefiting employees, ante, at 589, n. 3; to
the contrary, its reliance on $ 302(e) to remedy such abuses supports quite
the opposite conclusion. In any event, what Arroyo held is that payment

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The majority repudiates this understanding of $ 302(c)(5)'s
operation, reflected also in NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., 453
U. S. 322, 331 (1981), and Mine Workers Health and Retirement Funds v. Robinson, 455 U. S. 562, 570-572 (1982), as
"pure dictum." Ante, at 591. But the reasoning that led us
to our conclusion in Arroyo is not so easily dismissed. As
we explained in that case, $ 302(c)(5) was enacted not merely
to exempt specified conduct from the prohibitions of $$ 302(a)
and (b), but also to ensure that union trust funds, once established, would continue to benefit the designated employees.
359 U. S., at 424-427.

"Congress believed that if welfare funds were established which did not define with specificity the benefits
payable thereunder, a substantial danger existed that
such funds might be employed to perpetuate control of
union officers, for political purposes, or even for personal
gain. See 92 Cong. Rec. 4892-4894, 4899, 5181, 5345-
5346; S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., at 52; 93
Cong. Rec. 4678, 4746-4747. To remove these dangers,
specific standards were established to assure that welfare funds would be established only for purposes which
Congress considered proper and expended only for the
purposes for which they were established. See Cox,
Some Aspects of the Labor Management Relations Act,
[61 Harv. L. Rev. 274, 290 (1947)]. Continuing compliance with these standards in the administration of
welfare funds was made explicitly enforceable in federal
district courts by civil proceedings under $ 302(e). The
legislative history is devoid of any suggestion that
defalcating trustees were to be held accountable under
federal law, except by way of the injunctive remedy

and receipt of trust funds do not violate $$ 302(a) and (b) if the funds are later
diverted, not that the later diversion does not violate $ 302(c)(5).

provided in that subsection." Id., at 426-427 (footnote

omitted).2

We made the same point in Robinson, stating that " `the
sole purpose of $ 302(c)(5) is to ensure that employee benefit
trust funds are legitimate trust funds, used actually for the
specified benefits to the employees of the employers who contribute to them . . . .' " 455 U. S., at 570 (quoting Amax
Coal, 453 U. S., at 331) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Our view that $ 302(c)(5) imposed continuing obligations on
the actual use of trust funds, we found, was "amply supported by the legislative history," 455 U. S., at 571, which
reflected a concern that "funds contributed by their employers for the benefit of the employees and their families might
be diverted to other union purposes or even to the private
benefit of faithless union leaders," id., at 572. See also id.,
at 570-572, and nn. 8-10, and sources cited therein. To prevent trust funds once legitimate from turning into vehicles
for kickbacks and racketeering, $ 302(c)(5) requires not only
that trust funds be "established" for proper purposes, but
also that "employer contributions be administered for the
sole and exclusive benefit of employees." Id., at 572 (emphasis added).3

2 When the Court characterizes this passage as "leaping" to an "entirely
unsupported conclusion," see ante, at 591, n. 4, it ignores the abundant
support for that conclusion in the legislative history cited in Justice Stewart's opinion.

3 Though we did not belabor the point in Robinson, as it was then (as

until today) undisputed, it should be noted that the relevant statutory
text supports the conclusion that $ 302(c)(5) creates ongoing obligations for
trustees. According to the majority, $ 302(c)(5)'s requirements of a trust
"established" for the benefit of employees and funds "held in trust for the
purpose" of paying employees relate to the purpose for which a trust is
first established; hence, they are fulfilled entirely, if ever, at the time of
establishment. See ante, at 588, 592. Even on this narrow question, I

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
The proposition that $ 302(c)(5)'s specific statutory stand-ards are enforceable on a continuing basis has never been

questioned before today, by this Court or by any court ofappeals. It is true, as the majority notes, ante, at 587, that
the precise scope of the civil remedy authorized by $ 302(e)has been the subject of controversy. Some courts have read

$ 302(e) quite broadly to authorize relief in cases of "un-reasonable" or "arbitrary and capricious" trust administration. See, e. g., Phillips v. Alaska Hotel and Restaurant
Employees Pension Fund, 944 F. 2d 509, 515 (CA9 1991);Stinson v. Ironworkers District Council of Southern Ohio

and Vicinity Benefit Trust, 869 F. 2d, at 1019.4 Others haveread $ 302(e) more narrowly, as limited to remedying "violations of basic structure, as determined by the Congress, notviolations of fiduciary obligations or standards of prudence
in the administration of the trust fund." Bowers v. Ulpiano
Casal, Inc., 393 F. 2d 421, 424 (CA1 1968). For present purdiately after deposit into a legitimate trust fund, they are diverted for
some improper purpose.

More important, however, is the fact that other provisions of $ 302(c)(5)
clearly set forth standards for the continuing administration of trust funds.
By their very terms, these standards demand compliance on an ongoing
basis. See $ 302(c)(5)(B) (employees and employers must be equally represented in fund administration); $ 302(c)(5)(C) (payments to be used for pensions or annuities must be made to a separate trust). The obvious purpose of $ 302(e)--a subsection largely overlooked by the majority--is to
provide a vehicle for enforcing $ 302(c)(5)'s ongoing obligations, among
them the requirement that funds be held in trust for the benefit of
employees.

4 As the majority notes, petitioners argue that $ 302(c)(5) does not authorize such broad jurisdiction to "restructure and regulate employee benefit plans." See ante, at 588, n. 2. More precisely, the position with
which respondents take issue in the cited pages of their brief, see ibid.,
is that "a collectively bargained term of an employee benefit plan is not
subject to federal court review for reasonableness under Section 302 of
LMRA." Brief for Petitioners 19; see Brief for Respondents 18. It is
disingenuous, to say the least, to characterize petitioners' argument as one
"attacking the basic authority of federal courts to regulate $ 302(c)(5) trust
funds." Ante, at 588, n. 2. See n. 6, infra.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
poses, however, the important point is that every Courtof Appeals has assumed that the federal courts may, at

a minimum, enforce compliance with $ 302(c)(5)'s expresscommands.

Our unanimous opinion in Robinson is consistent with thiswell-established body of case law. In

Robinson, we considered and rejected one of the broader views of $ 302(c)(5),
holding that the provision does not empower the federalcourts to impose a nonstatutory "reasonableness" requirement on trust fund eligibility criteria established bycollective-bargaining agreement. 455 U. S., at 574. We
also left open the question whether $ 302(e) authorizes en-forcement of the traditional fiduciary duties of trustees.

6 The Court seems to assume that the question reserved in Robinson

was the very different one it answers today. See ante, at 587.

Petitioners, on the other hand, share our understanding of what was
decided in Robinson and what remained open for decision. Notwithstanding the protestations of the majority, see ante, at 588-589, n. 2, petitioners'
argument on this point was limited to the proposition that $ 302(c)(5) does
not "establish federal fiduciary standards for trustees of employee benefit
plans," Brief for Petitioners 10. Petitioners never argue that $ 302(e) does
not provide a remedy when the specific standards of $ 302(c)(5) are violated; to the contrary, petitioners cite with approval the holding from Bow508us2$94K 02-19-97 13:58:37 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
however, is the one that the Court reaches out to answertoday. We unequivocally stated:

"It is, of course, clear that compliance with the specificstandards of $ 302(c)(5) in the administration of welfare
funds is enforceable in federal district courts under$ 302(e) of the LMRA." Ibid.

7

The Court now seems to assume that it is confronted witha choice between "establishing an entire body of federal trust

law," ante, at 590, on the one hand, and limiting the scope of$ 302(e) to injunctions against the making or acceptance of
prohibited payments, on the other. As Robinson makesclear, however, there is no need to go so far in either direction; our understanding that $ 302(e) provides a remedy forviolations of $ 302(c)(5)'s specific standards is independent of
any view as to whether $ 302(e) makes general fiduciary du-ties enforceable in federal court.

ers, supra, that the only violations "within the federal courts' authority
involved the failure to meet the specific requirements of Section 302(c)(5)."
Brief for Petitioners 12 (emphasis in original). Nor do petitioners ever
argue that $ 302(c)(5)'s "exclusive benefit" obligation is satisfied finally at
the time of trust establishment; rather, petitioners understand $ 302(c)(5)
to require that a trust "(1) use employer contributions only for specified
types of benefits; (2) use those assets only for benefits for employees and
families of the contributing employer and the employees and families of
other contributing employers . . . ." Id., at 8 (emphasis added).

7 Had this basic proposition been challenged in Robinson--and had the

Court as then constituted found any merit in the challenge--then it would
have been unnecessary to go on to decide whether the discrimination in
that case violated $ 302(c)(5) as "unreasonable." In other words, this
proposition provided the framework for all of the reasoning in Robinson,
just as it provided the framework for all of our post-Arroyo cases under
this statute. Whether or not the label "dicta," see ante, at 592, n. 5, is
appropriately applied to such a proposition, our statement in Robinson
represented an interpretation of an important federal statute that had
been accepted uniformly by the bar, the judiciary, and the Congress for
over three decades, since Arroyo was decided in 1959. The Court today
simply ignores the interest in adhering to settled rules of law that undergirds the doctrines of stare decisis and judicial restraint.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
In my view, if a trust fund is not complying with the stand-ards of $ 302(c)(5)--if, for instance, it is making annual contributions to the Red Cross--then a federal court is authorizedby $ 302(e) to enjoin the improper diversion of funds. There
is no sensible reason why the court should instead be re-stricted to enjoining future payments to the fund, or receipt
of those payments, as violations of $$ 302(a) and (b). Con-gress intended $ 302(c)(5) to operate as a guarantee against
diversion of trust funds, and this purpose is effectuated bythe reading we have always before given $ 302. Today's departure from this understanding seriously undermines thefunctioning of the statute. The Court's action is not only
uninvited and unnecessary; it is a radical departure from thedoctrine of judicial restraint.

CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CALIFORNIA,INC.

v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSIONTRUST FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-904. Argued December 1, 1992--Decided June 14, 1993
The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA)

amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA) to provide that in certain circumstances an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer plan incurs as "withdrawal liability" a
share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits, 29 U. S. C. $$ 1381, 1391.
Withdrawal liability is assessed by means of a notification by the "plan
sponsor" and a demand for payment. $ 1399(b). An unresolved dispute is referred to arbitration, where (1) the sponsor's factual determinations are "presumed correct" unless a contesting party "shows by a
preponderance of the evidence that the determination was unreasonable
or clearly erroneous," $ 1401(a)(3)(A); and (2) the sponsor's actuary's calculation of a plan's unfunded vested benefits is presumed correct unless
a contesting party "shows by a preponderance of the evidence" that,
inter alia, "the actuarial assumptions and methods" used in a calculation "were, in the aggregate, unreasonable," $ 1401(a)(3)(B). Petitioner
Concrete Pipe and Products of California, Inc., is an employer charged
with withdrawal liability by the trustees of respondent, a multiemployer
pension plan (Plan). After losing in arbitration, Concrete Pipe filed an
action to set aside or modify the arbitrator's decision and raised a constitutional challenge to the MPPAA, but the District Court granted the
Plan's motion to confirm the award. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. The MPPAA does not unconstitutionally deny Concrete Pipe an
impartial adjudicator by placing the determination of withdrawal liability in the plan sponsor, here the trustees, subject to $ 1401's presumptions. Pp. 616-636.

(a) Even assuming that the possibility of trustee bias toward imposing the greatest possible withdrawal liability would suffice to bar the
trustees from serving as adjudicators of Concrete Pipe's withdrawal
liability because of their fiduciary obligations to beneficiaries of the
Plan, the Due Process Clause is not violated here because the first
adjudication in this case was the arbitration proceeding, not the trustees' initial liability determination. The trustees' statutory notification

and demand obligations are undertaken in an enforcement capacity.
Pp. 616-620.

(b) Nor did the arbitrator's adjudication deny Concrete Pipe its
right to procedural due process. While the $ 1401(a)(3)(A) presumption
shifts the burden of persuasion to the employer, the statute is incoherent with respect to the degree of certainty required to overturn a plan
sponsor's factual determination. In light of the assumed bias, deference to a plan sponsor's determination would raise a substantial due
process question. The uncertainty raised by this incoherent statute is
resolved by applying the canon requiring that an ambiguous statute be
construed to avoid serious constitutional problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to Congress's intent. Thus, the presumption is
construed to place the burden on the employer to disprove an alleged
fact by a preponderance permitting independent review by the arbitrator of the trustees' factual determinations. The approach taken by the
arbitrator and courts below in this case is not inconsistent with this
Court's interpretation of the first presumption. Pp. 621-631.

(c) The $ 1401(a)(3)(B) presumption also raises no procedural due
process issue. The assumptions and methods used in calculating withdrawal liability are selected in the first instance not by the trustees, but
by the plan actuary, $ 1393(c), who is a trained professional subject to
regulatory standards. The technical nature of the assumptions and
methods, and the necessity for applying the same ones in several contexts, limit an actuary's opportunity to act unfairly toward a withdrawing employer. Moreover, since $ 1401(a)(3)(B) speaks not about the reasonableness of the trustees' conclusions of historical fact, but about the
aggregate reasonableness of the actuary's assumptions and methods in
calculating the dollar liability figure, an employer's burden to overcome
the presumption is simply to show that an apparently unbiased professional, whose obligations tend to moderate any claimed inclination to
come down hard on withdrawing employers, has based a calculation on
a combination of methods and assumptions that falls outside the range
of reasonable actuarial practice. Pp. 631-636.

2. The MPPAA, as applied, does not deny substantive due process
in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The imposition of withdrawal liability is clearly rational here because Concrete Pipe's liability is based
on a proportion of its contributions during its participation in the Plan.
Pp. 636-641.

3. The MPPAA, as applied, did not take Concrete Pipe's property
without just compensation. The application of a regulatory statute that
is otherwise within Congress's powers may not be defeated by private
contractual provisions, such as those protecting Concrete Pipe from liability beyond what was specified in its collective-bargaining and trust

agreements. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
475 U. S. 211, 223-224. Examining Concrete Pipe's relationship with the
Plan in light of the three factors the Court has said have particular significance for takings claims confirms this. First, the Government did not
physically invade or permanently appropriate Concrete Pipe's assets for
its own use. Second, Concrete Pipe has failed to show that having to pay
out an estimated 46% of shareholder equity is an economic impact out of
proportion to its experience with the Plan, since diminution in a property's
value, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a taking. See,
e. g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 384. Third,
the conditions on its contractual promises did not give Concrete Pipe
a reasonable expectation that it would not be faced with liability for
promised benefits. At the time it began making payments to the Plan,
pension plans had long been subject to federal regulation. Indeed, withdrawing employers already faced contingent liability under ERISA, and
Concrete Pipe's reliance on ERISA's original limitation of contingent
withdrawal liability to 30% of net worth is misplaced, there being no reasonable basis to expect that the legislative ceiling would never be lifted,

employee participating in such a plan need not work for oneemployer for any particular continuous period. Because

service credit is portable, employees of an employer partici-pating in the plan may receive such credit for any work done
for any participating employer. An employee obtains a
vested right to secure benefits upon retirement after accru-ing a certain length of service for participating employers;

benefits vest under the Plan in this case when an employeeaccumulates 10 essentially continuous years of credit. See
Brief for Petitioner 28.Multiemployer plans like the one before us have features
that are beneficial in industries where

"there [is] little if any likelihood that individual employers would or could establish single-employer plans fortheir employees . . . [,] where there are hundreds and

perhaps thousands of small employers, with countlessnumbers of employers going in and out of business each
year, [and where] the nexus of employment has focused
on the relationship of the workers to the union to whichthey belong, and/or the industry in which they are employed, rather than to any particular employer." Multi-employer Pension Plan Termination Insurance Program:

Multiemployer plans provide the participating employers
with such labor market benefits as the opportunity to offer
a pension program (a significant part of the covered employees' compensation package) with cost and risk-sharing mechanisms advantageous to the employer. The plans, in consequence, help ensure that each participating employer will

to move from one employer and one job to another without

Since the enactment of ERISA in 1974, the Plan has beensubject to the provisions of the statute as a "defined benefit
plan." Such a plan is one that does not qualify as an " `indi-vidual account plan' or `defined contribution plan,' " which
provide, among other things, for an individual account foreach covered employee and for benefits based solely upon the
amount contributed to the covered employee's account. See29 U. S. C. $$ 1002(35), 1002(34), 1002(7). Concrete Pipe has
not challenged the determination that the Plan falls withinthe statutory definition of defined benefit plan, and no issue
as to that is before the Court.

A
We have canvassed the history of ERISA and the MPPAAbefore. See

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A.Gray & Co., supra; Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty

Corporation, supra. ERISA was designed "to ensure thatemployees and their beneficiaries would not be deprived of
anticipated retirement benefits by the termination of pensionplans before sufficient funds have been accumulated in
[them]. . . . Congress wanted to guarantee that if a workerhas been promised a defined pension benefit upon retirement--and if he has fulfilled whatever conditions are re-quired to obtain a vested benefit--he will actually receive
it." Id., at 214 (citations and internal quotation marks omit-ted). As enacted in 1974, ERISA created the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) to administer and enforcea pension plan termination insurance program, to which contributors to both single-member and multiemployer planswere required to pay insurance premiums. 29 U. S. C.

$$ 1302(a), 1306 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). Under the termsof the statute as originally enacted, the guarantee of basic

Opinion of the Court

benefits by multiemployer plans that terminated was not to
be mandatory until 1978, and for terminations prior to that
time, any guarantee of benefits upon plan termination was
discretionary with PBGC. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1381(c)(2)-(4) (1976
ed.). If PBGC did choose to extend a guarantee when a
multiemployer plan terminated with insufficient assets to
pay promised benefits, an employer that had contributed to
the plan in the five preceding years was liable to PBGC for
the shortfall in proportion to its share of contributions during that 5-year period, up to 30 percent of the employer's
net worth. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1362(b), 1364 (1976 ed.). "In other
words, any employer withdrawing from a multiemployer
plan was subject to a contingent liability that was dependent
upon the plan's termination in the next five years and the
PBGC's decision to exercise its discretion and pay guaranteed benefits." Gray, 467 U. S., at 721.

"As the date for mandatory coverage of multiemployer
plans approached, Congress became concerned that a significant number of plans were experiencing extreme financial
hardship." Ibid. Indeed, the possibility of liability upon
termination of a plan created an incentive for employers to
withdraw from weak multiemployer plans. Connolly, 475
U. S., at 215. The consequent risk to the insurance system
was unacceptable to Congress, which in 1978 postponed the
mandatory guarantee pending preparation by the PBGC of
a report "analyzing the problems of multiemployer plans and
recommending possible solutions." Ibid. PBGC issued
that report on July 1, 1978. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Multiemployer Study Required by P. L. 95-214
(1978). "To alleviate the problem of employer withdrawals,
the PBGC suggested new rules under which a withdrawing
employer would be required to pay whatever share of the
plan's unfunded liabilities was attributable to that employer's
participation." Connolly, 475 U. S., at 216 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Opinion of the Court
Congress ultimately agreed, see id., at 217, and passed theMPPAA, which was signed into law by the President on September 26, 1980. Under certain provisions of the MPPAA(which when enacted had an effective date of April 29, 1980,
29 U. S. C. $ 1461(e)(2)(A) (1976 ed., Supp. V)), if an employerwithdraws from a multiemployer plan, it incurs "withdrawal
liability" in the form of "a fixed and certain debt to thepension plan."

Gray, supra, at 725. An employer's with-drawal liability is its "proportionate share of the plan's `unfunded vested benefits,' " that is, "the difference between thepresent value of vested benefits" (benefits that are currently
being paid to retirees and that will be paid in the future tocovered employees who have already completed some specified period of service, 29 U. S. C. $ 1053) "and the currentvalue of the plan's assets. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1381, 1391."

Gray,supra, at 725.

B

The MPPAA provides the procedure for calculating andassessing withdrawal liability. The plan's actuary, who is

subject to regulatory and professional standards, 29 U. S. C.$$ 1241, 1242; 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(35), must determine the
present value of the plan's liability for vested benefits.3 Inthe absence of regulations promulgated by the PBGC, the
actuary must employ "actuarial assumptions and methodswhich, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account
the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) andwhich, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate
of anticipated experience under the plan." 29 U. S. C.

2 In various places the statute uses the terms "participant" and "beneficiary," and these terms are defined at 29 U. S. C. $$ 1002(7), 1002(8). For
simplicity, we will use the term "covered employee" to refer depending on
context both to those earning service credits and to those entitled to
benefits.

3 Even if no employer withdraws, ERISA requires an assessment of the

plan's liability at least annually. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1082(c)(9) (1988 ed.,
Supp. III).

610 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of the Court

$ 1393(a)(1).4 The assumptions must cover such matters as
mortality of covered employees, likelihood of benefits vesting, and, importantly, future interest rates. After settling
the present value of vested benefits, the actuary calculates
the unfunded portion by deducting the value of the plan's
assets. $ 1393(c).

In order to determine a particular employer's withdrawal
liability, the unfunded vested liability is allocated under one
of several methods provided by law. $ 1391. In this case,
the Plan used the presumptive method of $ 1391(b), which
bases withdrawal liability on the proportion of total employer contributions to the plan made by the withdrawing
employer during certain 5-year periods. See $$ 1391(b)(2)
(E)(ii), (b)(3)(B), (b)(4)(D)(ii). In essence, the withdrawal
liability imposes on the withdrawing employer a share of

the unfunded vested liability proportional to the employer's
share of contributions to the plan during the years of its
participation.

Withdrawal liability is assessed in a notification by the
"plan sponsor" (here the trustees, see $ 1301(a)(10)(A)) and a
demand for payment. $ 1399(b). The statute requires notification and demand to be made "[a]s soon as practicable after
an employer's complete or partial withdrawal." $ 1399(b)(1).
A "complete withdrawal"

"occurs when an employer--

"(1) Permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, or

"(2) permanently ceases all covered operations under
the plan." $ 1383(a).5

4 While the PBGC is also authorized to promulgate regulations governing such assumptions under 29 U. S. C. $ 1393(a), it has not done so. See
Brief for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. as Amicus Curiae 7, n. 7.

5 There is an exception to this definition that applies to the building and

construction industry, see $ 1383(b), but neither party argues that it pertains in this case.

Opinion of the Court
"[T]he date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessa-tion of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations." $ 1383(e).The statute provides that if an employer objects after
notice and demand for withdrawal liability, and the partiescannot resolve the dispute, $ 1399(b)(2), it shall be referred
to arbitration. See $ 1401(a)(1). Two presumptions may at-tend the arbitration. First, "any determination made by a
plan sponsor under [29 U. S. C. $$ 1381-1399 and 1405 (1988ed. and Supp. III)] is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of theevidence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly
erroneous." 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(A). Second, the spon-sor's calculation of a plan's unfunded vested benefits

"is presumed correct unless a party contesting the de-termination shows by a preponderance of evidence
that--
"(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in thedetermination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable

(taking into account the experience of the plan and rea-sonable expectations), or
"(ii) the plan's actuary made a significant error in apply-ing the actuarial assumptions or methods." $ 1401(a)
(3)(B).
The statute provides for judicial review of the arbitrator'sdecision by an action in the district court to enforce, vacate,

or modify the award. See $ 1401(b)(2). In any such action"there shall be a presumption, rebuttable only by a clear
preponderance of the evidence, that the findings of fact madeby the arbitrator were correct." $ 1401(c).

Opinion of the Court

Building Industry of California, Inc., the Engineering Con-tractors Association, and the Southern California Contractors Association, Inc. App. 75, || 6 (stipulation of facts filedin the District Court). Under $ 302(c)(5)(B) of the Labor
Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C.$ 186(c)(5)(B), when a union participates in management of a
plan permitted by the LMRA, the plan must be administeredjointly by representatives of labor and management. Accordingly, half of the Plan's trustees are selected by the Laborers,and half by these contractors' associations. Concrete Pipe
has never been a member of any of the contractors' associations that are parties to the Trust Agreement.

In 1976, Concrete Pipe, which is a wholly owned subsidiaryof Concrete Pipe and Products Co., Inc., purchased certain

assets of another company, Cen-Vi-Ro, including a concretepipe manufacturing plant near Shafter, California, which
Concrete Pipe continued to operate much as Cen-Vi-Ro haddone. Cen-Vi-Ro had collective-bargaining agreements with
several unions including the Laborers, and Concrete Pipeabided by the agreement with the latter by contributing to
the Plan at a specified rate for each hour worked by a
covered employee.6 In 1978, Concrete Pipe negotiated anew 3-year contract with the Laborers that called for continuing contributions to be made to the Plan based on hours
worked by covered employees in the collective-bargainingunit.

7 The collective-bargaining agreement specified that it

would remain in effect until June 30, 1981, and thereafterfrom year to year unless either Concrete Pipe or the Laborers gave notice of a desire to renegotiate or terminate it.
" `Such written notice [was to] be given at least sixty (60)

6 The average rate for covered employees at which Concrete Pipe contributed to the Plan in 1977 was $1.14 per hour, and Concrete Pipe's contributions for 1977 totaled $29,337.71.

7 The collective-bargaining agreement provided for contributions for

each laborer at a rate of $1.20 per hour. In 1978 Concrete Pipe's total
contribution to the Plan was $49,913.04, and in 1979 it was $20,826.60.

days prior to June 30 . . . [and if] no agreement [was] reachedby June 30 . . . the Employer or the [Laborers might] thereafter give written notice to the other that on a specified date[at least] fifteen (15) days [thereafter] the Agreement
[should] be considered terminated.' " App. 76.

In August 1979, Concrete Pipe stopped production at theShafter facility. Although the details do not matter here,

by October 1979, work by employees covered by the agree-ment with the Laborers had virtually ceased, and Concrete
Pipe eventually stopped making contributions to the Plan.In the spring of 1981, Concrete Pipe and the Laborers each
sent the other a timely notice of a desire to renegotiate
the collective-bargaining agreement. Concrete Pipe subsequently bargained to an impasse and, on November 30, 1981,
sent the Laborers a letter withdrawing recognition of that
union as an employee representative, and giving notice of
intent to terminate the 1978 collective-bargaining agreement. At about the same time, however, in November 1981,
Concrete Pipe reopened the Shafter plant to produce 7,000
tons of concrete pipe needed to fill two orders for which it
had successfully bid. It hired employees in classifications
covered by its prior agreement with the Laborers, but did
not contribute to the Plan for their work.

In January 1982, the Plan notified Concrete Pipe of withdrawal liability claimed to amount to $268,168.81. See id.,
at 89-94. Although the demand letter did not specify the
date on which the Plan contended that "complete withdrawal" from it had taken place, it referred to the failure of
Concrete Pipe to make contributions to the Plan since February 1981, and stated that "[w]e are further advised that you
have not signed a renewal of a collective bargaining agreement obligating you to continue contributions to the Plan
on behalf of the Construction laborers currently in your
employ." Id., at 90.

The Plan filed suit seeking the assessed withdrawal liability. Concrete Pipe countersued to bar collection, contending

Opinion of the Court

that "complete withdrawal" had occurred when operations atthe Shafter plant ceased in August 1979, a date prior to the

effective date of the MPPAA, and challenging the MPPAAon constitutional grounds. These cases were consolidated in
the United States District Court for the Central District ofCalifornia, which

sua sponte ordered the parties to arbitratethe issue of whether withdrawal occurred prior to the effective date of the MPPAA.8The arbitration took place in two phases. In the first, the
arbitrator determined that Concrete Pipe had not withdrawnfrom the Plan prior to the effective date of the MPPAA.
App. 216. In the second phase, explicitly applying the pre-sumption of 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(B), the arbitrator found
that Concrete Pipe had failed to meet its burden of showingthe actuarial assumptions and methods to be unreasonable
in the aggregate. App. 400. For reasons not at issue here,the arbitrator did rule partially in Concrete Pipe's favor,
and reduced the withdrawal liability from $268,168.81 to$190,465.57.

Concrete Pipe then filed a third action in the DistrictCourt, to set aside or modify the arbitrator's decision, and
again raised its constitutional challenge. Id., at 406. TheDistrict Court treated Concrete Pipe's subsequent motion
for summary judgment as a petition to vacate the arbitra-tor's award, which it denied, and granted a motion by the
Plan to confirm the award. Construction Laborers PensionTrust for Southern California v. Cen-Vi-Ro Concrete Pipe

liability provisions of the MPPAA was September 26, 1980, in reliance on
the Ninth Circuit's decision in Shelter Framing Corp. v. Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, 705 F. 2d 1502 (1983), which held the retroactivity
provision of the MPPAA unconstitutional. App. 198. The decision in
Shelter Framing was reversed by this Court in Pension Benefit Guaranty

Concrete Pipe challenges the assessment of withdrawal liability on several grounds, the first being that by placing
determination of withdrawal liability in the trustees, subject
to the presumptions provided by $ 1401, the MPPAA is unconstitutional because it denies Concrete Pipe an impartial
adjudicator. This is not the first time this legal question
has been before the Court. See Pension Benefit Guaranty

Opinion of the Court

A

1

Concrete Pipe and its amici point to several potentialsources of trustee bias toward imposing the greatest possible

withdrawal liability. The one they emphasize most stronglyhas roots in the fact that "all of the trustees, including those
selected by employers, are fiduciaries of the fund, 29 U. S. C.$ 1002(21)([A]), and thus owe an exclusive duty to the fund."
Id., at 139 (emphasis omitted). As we said in another casediscussing employee benefit pension plans permitted under
LMRA:

"Under principles of equity, a trustee bears an unwaver-ing duty of complete loyalty to the beneficiary of the

trust, to the exclusion of the interests of all other par-ties. To deter the trustee from all temptation and to
prevent any possible injury to the beneficiary, the ruleagainst a trustee dividing his loyalties must be enforced
with `uncompromising rigidity.'. . . . .
"In sum, the duty of the management-appointed trusteeof an employee benefit fund under $ 302(c)(5) is directly
antithetical to that of an agent of the appointingparty. . . . ERISA essentially codified the strict fiduciary
standards that a $ 302(c)(5) trustee must meet. [Title29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)] requires a trustee to `discharge
his duties . . . solely in the interest of the participants[i. e., covered employees] and beneficiaries.' " NLRB v.
Amax Coal Co., 453 U. S. 322, 329-332 (1981) (citationsand footnote omitted).

The resulting tug away from the interest of the employer isfueled by the threat of personal liability for any breach of
the trustees' fiduciary responsibilities, obligations, or duties,29 U. S. C. $ 1109, which may be enforced by civil actions
brought by the Secretary of Labor or any covered employeeor beneficiary of the plan, $ 1132(a)(2).

617Cite as: 508 U. S. 602 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
The trustees could act in a biased fashion for several rea-sons. The most obvious would be in attempting to maximize

assets available for the beneficiaries of the trust by makingfindings to enhance withdrawal liability. The next would
not be so selfless, for if existing underfunding was the consequence of prior decisions of the trustees, those decisionscould, if not offset, leave the trustees open to personal liability. See Brief for American Trucking Associations, Inc., as
Amicus Curiae 9. A risk of bias may also inhere in the
mere fact that, fiduciary obligations aside, the trustees areappointed by the unions and by employers. Union trustees

may be thought to have incentives, unrelated to the question
of withdrawal, to impose greater rather than lesser withdrawal liability. Employer trustees may be responsive to
concerns of those employers who continue to contribute,
whose future burdens may be reduced by high withdrawal
liability, and whose competitive position may be enhanced to
boot. See Brief for Midwest Motor Express, Inc., et al. as
Amici Curiae 8, citing Note, Trading Fairness for Efficiency:
Constitutionality of the Dispute Resolution Procedures of
the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980,
71 Geo. L. J. 161, 168 (1982).

As against these supposed threats to the trustees' neutrality, due process requires a "neutral and detached judge in
the first instance," Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S.
57, 61-62 (1972), and the command is no different when a
legislature delegates adjudicative functions to a private
party, see Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U. S. 188, 195 (1982).
"That officers acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity
are disqualified by their interest in the controversy to be
decided is, of course, the general rule." Tumey v. Ohio, 273
U. S. 510, 522 (1927). Before one may be deprived of a protected interest, whether in a criminal or civil setting, see
Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U. S. 238, 242, and n. 2 (1980),
one is entitled as a matter of due process of law to an adjudicator who is not in a situation " `which would offer a possible

Opinion of the Court

temptation to the average man as a judge . . . which might
lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true . . . ."
Ward, supra, at 60 (quoting Tumey, supra, at 532). Even
appeal and a trial de novo will not cure a failure to provide
a neutral and detached adjudicator. 409 U. S., at 61.

"[J]ustice," indeed, "must satisfy the appearance of justice,
and this stringent rule may sometimes bar trial [even] by
judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very
best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties." Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., supra, at 243 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This, too, is no
less true where a private party is given statutory authority
to adjudicate a dispute, and we will assume that the possibility of bias, if only that stemming from the trustees' statutory
role and fiduciary obligation, would suffice to bar the trustees
from serving as adjudicators of Concrete Pipe's withdrawal
liability.

2

The assumption does not win the case for Concrete Pipe,
however, for a further strand of governing law has to be
applied. Not all determinations affecting liability are adjudicative, and the " `rigid requirements' . . . designed for officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions, are not
applicable to those acting in a prosecutorial or plaintiff-like
capacity." 446 U. S., at 248. Where an initial determination is made by a party acting in an enforcement capacity,
due process may be satisfied by providing for a neutral adjudicator to "conduct a de novo review of all factual and legal
issues." Cf. id., at 245; see also id., at 247-248, and n. 9;
cf. Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 58 (1975) ("Clearly, if

the initial view of the facts based on the evidence derived
from nonadversarial processes as a practical or legal matter
foreclosed fair and effective consideration at a subsequent
adversary hearing leading to ultimate decision, a substantial due process question would be raised").

Opinion of the Court
The distinction between adjudication and enforcement dis-poses of the claim that the assumed bias or appearance of

bias in the trustees' initial determination of withdrawal lia-bility alone violates the Due Process Clause, much as it did
the similar claim in Marshall v. Jerrico. Although we were
faced there with a federal agency administrator who deter-mined violations of a child labor law and assessed penalties

under the statute, we concluded that the administrator couldnot be held to the high standards required of those "whose
duty it is to make the final decision and whose impartialityserves as the ultimate guarantee of a fair and meaningful
proceeding in our constitutional regime." 446 U. S., at 250.Of the administrator there we said, "He is not a judge. He
performs no judicial or quasi-judicial functions. He hears no
witnesses and rules on no disputed factual or legal questions.The function of assessing a violation is akin to that of a

prosecutor or civil plaintiff." Id., at 247.

This analysis applies with equal force to the trustees, who,
we find, act only in an enforcement capacity. The statute
requires the plan sponsor, here the trustees, to notify the
employer of the amount of withdrawal liability and to demand payment, 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(b)(1), actions that bear the
hallmarks of an assessment, not an adjudication. The trustees are not required to hold a hearing, to examine witnesses,
or to adjudicate the disputes of contending parties on matters of fact or law.11 In Marshall, we observed that an employer "except[ing] to a penalty . . . is entitled to a de novo
hearing before an administrative law judge," 446 U. S., at
247, and we concluded that this latter proceeding was the

11 While the employer "may ask the plan sponsor to review any specific
matter relating to the determination of the employer's liability and the
schedule of payments," 29 U. S. C. $ 1399(b)(2), and while the plan sponsor
must then respond, ibid., this hardly amounts to "adjudication." The statute does not require the employer to exhaust the avenue of making a
request of the plan sponsor prior to initiating arbitration proceedings.
See $ 1401(a)(1).

"initial adjudication," id., at 247, n. 9. Likewise here, weconclude that the first adjudication is the proceeding that

occurs before the arbitrator, not the trustees' initial determi-nation of liability.

12

B
This does not end our enquiry, however, for Concrete Pipegoes on to argue that the statutory presumptions preserve

the trustees' bias by limiting the arbitrator's autonomy todetermine withdrawal liability, and thereby work to deny the
employer a fair adjudication.

1
Under the first provision at issue here, "any determinationmade by the plan sponsor under [29 U. S. C. $$ 1381-1399 and

1405] is presumed correct unless the party contesting thedetermination shows by a preponderance of the evidence
that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erro-neous." 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(A). Concrete Pipe argues
that this presumption denied it an impartial adjudicator onthe issue of its withdrawal date, thus raising a constitutional
question on which the Courts of Appeals have divided.13

12 "[W]e need not say with precision what limits there may be on a financial or personal interest of one who performs a prosecutorial function,"
Marshall, 446 U. S., at 250 (footnote omitted), as that issue is not within
the scope of the questions on which we granted certiorari in this case.

13 The Courts of Appeals for the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, and District of Columbia Circuits have found the provision at issue constitutional,
while the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has struck it down. Compare Keith Fulton & Sons, Inc. v. New England Teamsters and Trucking

Opinion of the Court
The parties apparently agree that this presumption applies only to factual determinations, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for Respondent 24 (deferring to brief for the
PBGC as amicus curiae); Brief for Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation as Amicus Curiae 10, and n. 11, and this position is consistent with a PBGC regulation requiring the arbitrator "[i]n reaching his decision [to] follow applicable law, as
embodied in statutes, regulations, court decisions, interpretations of the agencies charged with the enforcement of the
Act, and other pertinent authorities," 29 CFR $ 2641.4(a)(1)
(1992). We will assume for purposes of this case that the
regulation reflects a sound reading of the statute.14

a
It is clear that the presumption favoring determinations
of the plan sponsor shifts a burden of proof or persuasion
to the employer. The hard question is what the employer

must show under the statute to rebut the plan sponsor's
factual determinations, that is, how and to what degree of
probability the employer must persuade the arbitrator that
the sponsor was wrong. The question is hard because the
statutory text refers to three different concepts in identifying this burden: "preponderance," "clearly erroneous," and
"unreasonable."

Joint Council No. 83 of Virginia Pension Fund, 718 F. 2d 628, 639-641
(CA4 1983), cert. denied, 467 U. S. 1259 (1984), with United Retail &
Wholesale Employees Teamsters Union Local No. 115 Pension Plan v.

equally divided Court sub nom. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
v. Yahn & McDonnell, Inc., 481 U. S. 735 (1987).

14 There is no utility in attempting to construe $ 1401(a)(3)(A) finely to

apply the "unreasonable" standard to certain determinations possible
under $$ 1381-1399 and 1405, and the "clearly erroneous" formulation to
others. These distinctions are not relevant in light of the relationship in
this context of both of these terms to the statutory phrase requiring a
showing "by a preponderance," which we explain below.

622 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of the Court

The burden of showing something by a "preponderance ofthe evidence," the most common standard in the civil law,

"simply requires the trier of fact `to believe that the exist-ence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before
[he] may find in favor of the party who has the burden to
persuade the [ judge] of the fact's existence.' " In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 371-372 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring) (brackets in original) (citation omitted). "A finding is`clearly erroneous' when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing [body] on the entire evidence is leftwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed." United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,
333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948). A showing of "unreasonableness"
would require even greater certainty of error on the part of
a reviewing body. See, e. g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,
Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 252 (1986).

In creating the presumption at issue, these terms are combined in a very strange way. As our descriptions indicate,
the first, "preponderance," is customarily used to prescribe
one possible burden or standard of proof before a trier of fact
in the first instance, as when the proponent of a proposition
loses unless he proves a contested proposition by a preponderance of the evidence. The term thus belongs in the same
category with "clear and convincing" and "beyond a reasonable doubt," which are also used to prescribe standards of
proof (but when greater degrees of certainty are thought
necessary). Before any such burden can be satisfied in the
first instance, the factfinder must evaluate the raw evidence,
finding it to be sufficiently reliable and sufficiently probative
to demonstrate the truth of the asserted proposition with
the requisite degree of certainty.

The second and third terms differ from the first in an important way. They are customarily used to describe, not a
degree of certainty that some fact has been proven in the
first instance, but a degree of certainty that a factfinder in
the first instance made a mistake in concluding that a fact

623Cite as: 508 U. S. 602 (1993)
Opinion of the Court
had been proven under the applicable standard of proof.They are, in other words, standards of review, and they are

normally applied by reviewing courts to determinations offact made at trial by courts that have made those determinations in an adjudicatory capacity (unlike the trustees here).
See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a). As the terms readilyindicate, a reviewing body characteristically examines prior

findings in such a way as to give the original factfinder'sconclusions of fact some degree of deference. This makes
sense because in many circumstances the costs of providingfor duplicative proceedings are thought to outweigh the benefits (the second would render the first ultimately useless),
and because, in the usual case, the factfinder is in a better
position to make judgments about the reliability of some
forms of evidence than a reviewing body acting solely on the
basis of a written record of that evidence. Evaluation of the
credibility of a live witness is the most obvious example.

Thus, review under the "clearly erroneous" standard is significantly deferential, requiring a "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." And application
of a reasonableness standard is even more deferential than
that, requiring the reviewer to sustain a finding of fact unless
it is so unlikely that no reasonable person would find it to be
true, to whatever the required degree of proof.

The strangeness in the statutory language creating the
first presumption arises from the combination of terms from
the first category (burdens of proof) with those from the second (standards of review). It is true, of course, that this
apparent confusion of categories may have resulted from the
hybrid nature of the arbitrator's proceeding in which it is
supposed to be applied. The arbitrator here does not function simply as a reviewing body in the classic sense, for he
is not only obliged to enquire into the soundness of the sponsor's determinations when they are challenged, but may receive new evidence in the course of his review and adopt his
own conclusions of fact. He may conduct proceedings in the

same manner and with the same powers as an arbitrator maydo under Title 9 of the United State Code, see 29 U. S. C.

$ 1401(b)(3), being authorized, for example, to hear (indeedto subpoena) witnesses and to take evidence. See 9 U. S. C.

$ 7; 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(b)(3) (making specific reference to subpoena power). He is, then, a reviewing body (as is clearfrom his obligation, absent a contrary showing, to deem certain determinations by the plan sponsor correct), but a re-viewing body invested with the further powers of a finder of
fact (as is clear from his power to take evidence in the courseof his review and from the presumption of correctness that a
district court is bound to give his "findings of fact," $ 1401(c)).
The arbitrator may thus provide a dual sort of trial and review, ultimately empowered to draw his own conclusions,
and it would make sense to describe his different functions
respectively by the language of trial and the language of
review.

It does not, however, make sense to use the language of
trial and the language of review as the statute does, for the
statute does not refer to different arbitrator's functions in
language appropriate to each; it refers, rather, to one single
conclusion that must be drawn about a determination previously made by a plan sponsor. By its terms the statute
purports to provide a standard for reviewing the sponsor's
findings, and it defines the nature of the conclusion the arbitrator must draw by using a combination of terms that are
categorically ill-matched. They are also inconsistent with
each other on any reading. As used here, as distinct from
its more usual context, the statutory phrase authorizing the
arbitrator to reject a factual conclusion upon proof by a "preponderance" implies review of the sponsor's determination
on the basis of the record, supplemented by any new evidence, for simple error. If this statutory phrase were given
effect, and the arbitrator concluded from a review of the record and of new evidence that a finding of fact was more probably wrong than not, it would be rejected, and a different

finding might be substituted. On the other hand, requiringa showing that the sponsor's determination was "clearly erroneous" or "unreasonable" would grant the plan sponsor'sfactual findings a great deal of deference. But to say in this
context that one must demonstrate that something is moreprobably clearly erroneous than not or more probably than
not unreasonable is meaningless. One might as intelligiblysay, in a trial court, that a criminal prosecutor is bound to
prove each element probably true beyond a reasonabledoubt. The statute is thus incoherent with respect to the
degree of probability of error required of the employer toovercome a factual conclusion made by the plan sponsor.

The proper response to this incomprehensibility is obvi-ously important in deciding this case. If it permitted an employer to rebut the plan sponsor's factual conclusions by a

15 Justice Thomas reads the statute not to be about the standard of
review of the plan sponsor's findings of fact at all. On his reading,
"clearly erroneous" is not a term of art, but an attempt at independent
literal description. Under his reading, if the arbitrator concludes a factual determination of a plan sponsor is probably wrong, it will nonetheless
be permitted to stand, unless the error is "obvious, plain, gross, significant,
or manifest." See post, at 652 (citation omitted). Justice Thomas does
not adequately explain what purpose would be served by a statute that
let some erroneous (and presumably material) factual determinations
stand even when they were "clearly erroneous" in the legal sense or "unreasonable," merely because of the degree to which they happened to deviate from the true facts, even when the latter are supported by overwhelming evidence. He does refer to a possible congressional desire to avoid
disputes over "insignificant errors," post, at 655, but under his reading a
factual error could be significant, in the sense that it was both material
and undeniably incorrect, and yet still stand because it was not that far
different from the truth.

Justice Thomas cites the presumption of innocence for the proposition
that the presumption at issue here does not imply a standard of review.
See post, at 652. But just because some presumptions do not imply standards of review does not mean that this one does not. Here, by its terms,
the statutory presumption says that factual findings of the plan sponsor
will stand unless some showing is made, necessarily implying a standard
of review of those findings.

preponderance, merely placing a burden of persuasion on theemployer, and permitting adjudication of the facts by the

arbitrator without affording deference to the plan sponsor'sdeterminations, the provision would be constitutionally unremarkable. For although we have observed that "[w]here
the burden of proof lies on a given issue is, of course, rarelywithout consequence and frequently may be dispositive to

the outcome of the litigation or application, . . . [o]utside thecriminal law area, where special concerns attend, the locus of
the burden of persuasion is normally not an issue of federalconstitutional moment."

Lavine v. Milne, 424 U. S. 577, 585
(1976) (footnote omitted). Concrete Pipe points to no special
interest that would distinguish this from the normal case.
It is indeed entirely sensible to burden the party more likely
to have information relevant to the facts about its withdrawal from the Plan with the obligation to demonstrate that
facts treated by the Plan as amounting to a withdrawal did
not occur as alleged. Such was the rule at common law.
W. Bailey, Onus Probandi 1 (1886) (citing Powell on Evidence
167-171) ("In every case the onus probandi lies on the party
who wishes to support his case by a particular fact which
lies more peculiarly within his knowledge, or of which he is
supposed to be cognizant").

On the other hand, if the employer were required to show
the trustees' findings to be either "unreasonable or clearly
erroneous," there would be a substantial question of procedural fairness under the Due Process Clause. In essence,
the arbitrator provided for by the statute would be required
to accept the plan sponsor's findings, even if they were probably incorrect, absent a showing at least sufficient to instill
a definite or firm conviction that a mistake had been made.
Cf. Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S., at 58. In light of our assumption of possible bias, the employer would seem to be
deprived thereby of the impartial adjudication in the first
instance to which it is entitled under the Due Process Clause.

Having found the statutory language itself incoherent, weturn, as we would in the usual case of textual ambiguity, to

the legislative purpose as revealed by the history of the stat-ute, for such light as it may shed.

16 Unsurprisingly, we have

found no direct discussion in the legislative history of thedegree of certainty on the part of the arbitrator required for

the employer to overcome the sponsor's factual conclusions.The Report of the House Committee on Education and Labor
on the bill that became the MPPAA describes the presump-tion as applying to "a determination of withdrawal liability
by a plan," and lumps it together with the statutory pre-sumption, discussed below, that applies to the choice of actuarial assumptions and methods. See H. R. Rep. No. 96-869,pt. 1, p. 86 (1980); 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(B).

17 The Report

states that

16 The textual incomprehensibility concerns a very narrow matter, and
we find nothing in the structure of the statutory scheme that provides
elucidation.

17 The presumption at issue here was included in a new $ 4221 added by

the MPPAA to ERISA. In the text of the version of the bill to which the
House Report refers the presumption was contained in $ 4203, and the
provision began: "For purposes of this part, a determination made with
respect to a plan under section 4201 [relating to employer withdrawals]
is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination
shows . . . ." See H. R. Rep. No. 96-869, pt. 1, p. 17 (1980). As enacted,
this text was replaced with "For purposes of any proceeding under this
section, any determination made by a plan sponsor under sections 4201
through 4219 and section 4225 is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination shows . . . ." Pub. L. 93-406, title IV, $ 4221,
as added, Pub. L. 96-364, title I, $ 104(2), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1239, 29
U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(A). The text of what was called $ 4201 differs somewhat from the text of the sections to which the enacted bill refers, which
are now codified at 29 U. S. C. $$ 1381-1399 and 1405. Our concern with
legislative history here goes only to the question of what degree of certainty of error Congress intended to require in this situation. While the
change in referent that took place might have some implications for this
question, we do not think anything relevant in the legislative history turns
on the different scope of the earlier version of the bill.

Opinion of the Court

"[t]hese rules are necessary in order to ensure theenforceability of employer liability. In the absence of

these presumptions, employers could effectively nullifytheir obligation by refusing to pay and forcing the plan
sponsor to prove every element involved in making anactuarial determination. The committee believes it is
extremely important that a withdrawn employer beginmaking the annual payments even though the period of
years for which payments must continue will be basedon the actual liability allocated to the employer." H. R.
Rep. 96-869, pt. 1, supra, at 86.
The only other comment that we have found in the legislativehistory occurs in a Report prepared by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which first purports tospeak about both statutory presumptions, but directs its
brief discussion to problems unique to "technical actuarialmatters." See

S. 1076: The Multiemployer Pension PlanAmendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Consideration, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 20-21 (Comm. Print 1980)(hereinafter Committee Print); see also infra, at 635, and
n. 20.The legislative history thus sheds little light on the odd
language chosen to describe the employer's burden. All ittells us is that the provision's purpose is to prevent the employer from "forcing the plan sponsor to prove every elementinvolved in making an actuarial determination." Since this
purpose would be served simply by placing the burden ofproof as to historical fact on the employer, however light or
heavy that burden may be, the legislative history does noth-ing to make sense of the drafter's failure to choose among
the standards included in the text.

The only way out of the muddle is by a different rule ofconstruction. It is a hoary one that, in a case of statutory

a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, theCourt will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless

such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Con-gress."

Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575
(1988). "Federal statutes are to be so construed as to avoidserious doubt of their constitutionality. `When the validity

of an act of Congress is drawn in question, and even if aserious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal
principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a con-struction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.' Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62
[(1932)]." Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 749-750
(1961). Cf. Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448-449 (1830)
(Story, J.) (a construction that would render a statute unconstitutional should be avoided); Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804) (Marshall, C. J.).

Although we are faced here not with ambiguity within the
usual degree, but with incoherence, we have a common obligation in each situation to resolve the uncertainty in favor
of definite meaning, and the canon for resolving ambiguity
applies with equal force when terminology renders a statute
incoherent. In applying that canon here, we must give effect to the one conclusion clearly supported by the statutory
language, that Congress intended to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer in a dispute over a sponsor's factual
determination. This objective can be realized without raising serious constitutional concerns simply by construing the
presumption to place the burden on the employer to disprove
a challenged factual determination by a preponderance. In
so construing the statute we make no pretense to have read
the congressional mind to perfection. We would not, indeed,
even have this problem if an argument could not obviously
be made that Congress intended greater deference than the
preponderance standard extends. But one could hardly call
the intent clear after wondering why the preponderance

standard was also included. In these circumstances it isenough that the choice to attain coherence by obviating constitutional problems is not "plainly contrary to the intent ofCongress." DeBartolo, supra, at 575.

Because the statute as we construe it does not forecloseany factual issue from independent consideration by the arbitrator (the presumption is, again, assumed by all to be inap-plicable to issues of law), there is no constitutional infirmity
in it. For the same reason, that an employer may avail itselfof independent review by the concededly neutral arbitrator,
we find no derivative constitutional defect infecting the fur-ther presumption that a district court must afford to an arbitrator's findings of fact. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(c).

d
Before applying the presumption to this case, one mustrecognize that in spite of Concrete Pipe's contention to the

contrary, determining the date of "complete withdrawal"presents not a mere question of fact on which the arbitrator
was required in the first instance to apply the $ 1401(a)(3)(A)presumption, but a mixed question of fact and law. The relevant facts are about the closure of the Shafter plant (suchas the intent of Concrete Pipe with respect to the plant, its
expression of that intent, its activities while the plant wasnot operating, and the circumstances of the plant's reopening), while the question whether these facts amount to a"complete withdrawal" is one of law.

As to the truly factual issues, the arbitrator's decision failsto reveal the force with which factual conclusions by the
trustees here were presumed correct, and in such a case wewould ordinarily reverse the judgment below for consideration of the extent to which the arbitrator's application ofthe presumption was contrary to the construction we adopt
today. But two reasons (urged upon us by neither party)persuade us not to take this course: the Plan's letter to Concrete Pipe contains no statement of facts justifying the trust508us2$95N 02-14-97 17:54:25 PAGES OPINPGT

ees' demand, and the parties entered into a factual stipu-lation in the District Court prior to commencing the

arbitration. Because of these two circumstances, therewere virtually no contested factual determinations to which
the arbitrator might have deferred. And, on the one ques-tion of fact that may have been disputed, the arbitrator
found, apparently in the first instance, that Concrete Pipe'sintent in closing the Shafter plant had been to cease operations permanently. App. 213-214.18While we express no opinion on whether the facts in this
case constitute a "complete withdrawal" within the meaningof the statute, a question not before us today, the approach
taken by the arbitrator and the courts below is not inconsist-ent with our interpretation of the first presumption. The
determination of the date of withdrawal by the arbitratordid not involve a misapplication of the statutory presumption, and it did not deprive Concrete Pipe of its right to pro-cedural due process.

2
The second presumption at issue attends the calculationof the amount of withdrawal liability. The statute provides that in the absence of more particular PBGC regula-tions, the plan is required to use "actuarial assumptions and
methods which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking intoaccount the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) and which, in combination, offer the actuary's bestestimate of anticipated experience under the plan." 29
U. S. C. $ 1393(a)(1). The presumption in question arisesunder $ 1401(a)(3)(B), which provides that

18 Despite this favorable finding, Concrete Pipe still lost, of course. The
arbitrator treated subjective intent as irrelevant. See App. 213-215.
While the District Court and the Court of Appeals, which relied on the
District Court's reasoning, did not go so far, see id., at 419-420, any factual
deference in their decisions would be to the arbitrator's finding, itself
untainted by the force of any presumption. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(c);

632 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of the Court

"the determination of a plan's unfunded vested benefitsfor a plan year, [is] presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance ofevidence that--

"(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in thedetermination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable
(taking into account the experience of the plan and rea-sonable expectations), or

"(ii) the plan's actuary made a significant error inapplying the actuarial assumptions or methods."

Concrete Pipe's concern is with the presumptive force of theactuarial assumptions and methods covered by subsection (i).

While this provision is like its counterpart creating thepresumption as to factual determinations in placing the burden of proof on the employer, the issues implicated in apply-ing it to the actuary's work are not the same. As the text
plainly indicates, the assumptions and methods used in calcu-lating withdrawal liability are selected in the first instance
not by the trustees, but by the plan actuary. For a varietyof reasons, this actuary is not, like the trustees, vulnerable
to suggestions of bias or its appearance. Although plansponsors employ them, actuaries are trained professionals
subject to regulatory standards. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1241,1242; 26 U. S. C. $ 7701(a)(35). The technical nature of an
actuary's assumptions and methods, and the necessity forapplying the same assumptions and methods in more than
one context, as a practical matter limit the opportunity anactuary might otherwise have to act unfairly toward the
withdrawing employer. The statutory requirement (of "ac-tuarial assumptions and methods--which, in the aggregate,
are reasonable . . . ") is not unique to the withdrawal liabilitycontext, for the statute employs identical language in 29
U. S. C. $ 1082(c)(3) to describe the actuarial assumptions andmethods to be used in determining whether a plan has satisfied the minimum funding requirements contained in thestatute. The use of the same language to describe the actu508us2$95N 02-14-97 17:54:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
arial assumptions and methods to be used in these differentcontexts tends to check the actuary's discretion in each of

them.

"Using different assumptions [for different purposes]could very well be attacked as presumptively unreasonable both in arbitration and on judicial review."[This] view that the trustees are required to act in a
reasonably consistent manner greatly limits their discre-tion, because the use of assumptions overly favorable
to the fund in one context will tend to have offsettingunfavorable consequences in other contexts. For example, the use of assumptions (such as low interest rates)that would tend to increase the fund's unfunded vested
liability for withdrawal liability purposes would alsomake it more difficult for the plan to meet the minimum
funding requirements of $ 1082." United Retail &
Wholesale Employees Teamsters Union Local No. 115Pension Plan v. Yahn & McDonnell, Inc., 787 F. 2d, at

146-147 (Seitz, J., dissenting in part).
This point is not significantly blunted by the fact that theassumptions used by the Plan in its other calculations may

be "supplemented by several actuarial assumptions unique towithdrawal liability." Brief for Respondent 26. Concrete
Pipe has not shown that any method or assumption uniqueto the calculation of withdrawal liability is so manipulable as
to create a significant opportunity for bias to operate, andarguably the most important assumption (in fact, the only
actuarial assumption or method that Concrete Pipe attacksin terms, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-20) is the critical
interest rate assumption that must be used for other pur-poses as well.

19 It may be that the trustees could, in theory, replace the actuary's
assumptions with their own, but that would involve a different case from
this, and while we are aware of at least one case in which a plan sponsor
exercised decisive influence over an actuary whose initial assumptions it

634 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of the Court

The second major difference attending the two presump-tions lies in the sense of reasonableness that must be disproven by an employer attacking the actuary's methods andassumptions, as against the reasonableness of the trustees'
determinations of historical fact. Following the usual pre-sumption of statutory interpretation, that the same term
carries the same meaning whenever it appears in the sameAct, see

Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States,286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932), we might expect "reasonable" in

$ 1401(a)(3)(B) to function here just as it did in $ 1401(a)(3)(A), to denote a certain range of probability that a factual
determination is correct. For several reasons, however, wethink it clear that this second presumption of reasonableness
functions quite differently.First, of course, the statute does not speak in terms of
disproving the reasonableness of the calculation of the em-ployer's share of the unfunded liability, which would be the
finding of future fact most obviously analogous to the find-ings of historical fact to which the $ 1401(a)(3)(A) presumption applies. Section 1401(a)(3)(B) speaks instead of theaggregate reasonableness of the assumptions and methods
employed by the actuary in calculating the dollar liabilityfigure. Because a "method" is not "accurate" or probably
"true" within some range, "reasonable" must be understoodhere to refer to some different kind of judgment, one that it
would make sense to apply to a review of methodology as
disliked, see Huber v. Casablanca Industries, Inc., 916 F. 2d 85, 93 (CA3
1990), we know of none in which a plan sponsor was found to have replaced
an actuary's actuarial methods or assumptions with different ones of its
own. Although we express no view on the question whether a plan sponsor must adopt the assumptions used by the actuary, we note that the
legislative history of $ 1082, which was enacted as part of ERISA in 1974,
suggests that the actuarial assumptions must be "independently determined by an actuary," and that it is "inappropriate for an employer to
substitute his judgment . . . for that of a qualified actuary" with respect
to these assumptions. S. Rep. No. 93-383, p. 70 (1973); see also H. R. Rep.
No. 93-807, p. 95 (1974).

Opinion of the Court
well as of assumptions. Since the methodology is a subjectof technical judgment within a recognized professional discipline, it would make sense to judge the reasonableness of amethod by reference to what the actuarial profession considers to be within the scope of professional acceptability inmaking an unfunded liability calculation. Accordingly, an
employer's burden to overcome the presumption in question(by proof by a preponderance that the actuarial assumptions
and methods were in the aggregate unreasonable) is simplya burden to show that the combination of methods and assumptions employed in the calculation would not have beenacceptable to a reasonable actuary. In practical terms it is
a burden to show something about standard actuarial prac-tice, not about the accuracy of a predictive calculation, even
though consonance with professional standards in makingthe calculation might justify confidence that its results are
sound.As thus understood, the presumption in question supports
no due process objection. The employer merely has a bur-den to show that an apparently unbiased professional, whose
obligations tend to moderate any claimed inclination to comedown hard on withdrawing employers, has based a calculation on a combination of methods and assumptions that fallsoutside the range of reasonable actuarial practice. To be
sure, the burden may not be so "mere" when one considersthat actuarial practice has been described as more in the
nature of an "actuarial art" than a science, Keith Fulton &Sons v. New England Teamsters, 762 F. 2d 1137, 1143 (CA1
1985) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), and thatthe employer's burden covers "technical actuarial matters
with respect to which there are often several equally `cor-rect' approaches," Committee Print 20-21.

20 But since im20 Indeed, our view of the problem of imprecision in reviewing actuarial
methods and assumptions seems to have been the very reason for including the presumption in the statute. The Senate Committee Report states

precision inheres in the choice of actuarial methods and as-sumptions, the resulting difficulty is simply in the nature of

the beast. Because it must fall on whichever party bearsthe burden of persuasion on such an issue, at least where the
interests at stake are no more substantial than ConcretePipe's are here, its allocation to one party or another does
not raise an issue of due process. See supra, at 625-626.

IV
Concrete Pipe argues next that, as applied, the MPPAAviolates substantive due process and takes Concrete Pipe's

property without just compensation, both in violation of theFifth Amendment. As to these issues, our decisions in

Grayand Connolly provide the principal guidance.

A
In Gray we upheld the MPPAA against substantive dueprocess challenge. Unlike the employer in Gray, Concrete

Pipe here has no complaint that the MPPAA has been retro-actively applied by predicating liability on a withdrawal decision made before passage of the statute. To be sure, sincethere would be no withdrawal liability without prewithdrawal contributions to the Plan, some of which were madebefore the statutory enactment, some of the conduct upon
which Concrete Pipe's liability rests antedates the statute.But this fact presents a far weaker premise for claiming a
substantive due process violation even than the Gray em-ployer raised, and rejection of Concrete Pipe's contention is
compelled by our decisions not only in Gray, but in Usery v.Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1 (1976), upon which
the Gray Court relied.
the presumption to reduce the likelihood of dispute and delay over technical actuarial matters with respect to which there are often several equally
`correct' approaches. Without such a presumption, a plan would be helpless to resist dilatory tactics by a withdrawing employer--tactics that
could, and could be intended to, result in prohibitive collection costs to the
plan." Committee Print 20-21.

To avoid this reasoning, Concrete Pipe relies not merelyon a claim of retroactivity, but on one of irrationality. Since
the company contributed to the plan for only 31/2 years, itargues, none of its employees had earned vested benefits
through employment by Concrete Pipe at the time of itswithdrawal. See Brief for Petitioner 28. Concrete Pipe
argues that, consequently, no rational relationship existsbetween its payment of past contributions and the imposition of liability for a share of the unfunded vested benefits.But this argument simply ignores the nature of multiemployer plans, which, as we have said above, operate by

Opinion of the Court

pooling contributions and liabilities. An employer's contri-butions are not solely for the benefit of its employees or

employees who have worked for it alone. Thus, ConcretePipe's presupposition that none of its employees had vested
benefits at the time of its withdrawal may be wrong. An
employee whose benefits had vested before coming to workfor Concrete Pipe may have earned additional vested benefits by the subsequent covered service. Another may havehad sufficient prior service credit to obtain vesting of benefits during employment at Concrete Pipe. A third may haveattained vesting while working for other employers but
based in part on service credits earned at Concrete Pipe.

But even if Concrete Pipe is correct and none of its employees had earned enough service credits for entitlement to
vested benefits by the time of Concrete Pipe's withdrawal,
as a Concrete Pipe employee each had earned service credits
that could be built upon in future employment with any other
participating employer. In determining whether the imposition of withdrawal liability is rational, then, the relevant
question is not whether a withdrawing employer's employees
have vested benefits, but whether an employer has contributed to the plan's probable liability by providing employees
with service credits. When the withdrawing employer's liability to the plan is based on the proportion of the plan's
contributions (and coincident service credits) provided by the
employer during the employer's participation in the plan, the
imposition of withdrawal liability is clearly rational.

It is true that, depending on the future employment of
Concrete Pipe's former employees, the withdrawal liability
assessed against Concrete Pipe may amount to more (or less)
than the share of the Plan's liability strictly attributable to
employment of covered workers at Concrete Pipe. But this
possibility was exactly what Concrete Pipe accepted when it
joined the Plan. A multiemployer plan has features of an
insurance scheme in which employers spread the risk that
their employees will meet the plan's vesting requirements

Opinion of the Court
and obtain an entitlement to benefits. A rational employerhopes that its employees will vest at a rate above the average for all employees of contributing employers, and that, inthis way, it will pay less than it would have by creating
a single-employer plan. But the rational employer alsoappreciates the foreseeable risk that circumstances may
produce the opposite result.21 Since the MPPAA spreadsthe unfunded vested liability among employers in approximately the same manner that the cost would have beenspread if all of the employers participating at the time of
withdrawal had seen the venture through, the withdrawalliability is consistent with the risks assumed on joining a
plan (however inconsistent that liability may be with the em-ployer's hopes). In any event, under the deferential standard of review applied in substantive due process challengesto economic legislation there is no need for mathematical
precision in the fit between justification and means. SeeTurner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 19.

Concrete Pipe's substantive due process claim is notenhanced by its argument that the MPPAA imposes obligations upon it contrary to limitations on liability variouslycontained in the 1962 Trust Agreement,

22 in a collective21 An employer's calculation whether to join a plan will include these
factors as well as a determination of the other benefits it can hope to
receive from its participation in the plan. See supra, at 606-607.

" `Section 4.07. Neither the Association or (sic) any officer, agent, employee or (sic) committee member of the Associations shall be liable to

Even assuming that all these provisions apply to Concrete

Agreement provides:
" `The parties recognize and agree that the Pension Trust and Plan was
created, negotiated, and is intended to continue to be if permitted by law
under ERISA, a defined contribution plan and trust and that the individual Contractors' liability with regard to the pension has been and remains
limited exclusively to payment of the contributions specified from time to
time in collective bargaining agreements.' " Id., at 82, || 34.

1977-1980 states:

" `IMPORTANT.

process review only for rationality, which, as we have said, issatisfied in the application of the MPPAA to Concrete Pipe.

Nor does the possibility that trustee decisions made "be-fore [Concrete Pipe] entered [the Plan]" may have led to the
unfunded liability alter the constitutional calculus. SeeBrief for Petitioner 31. Concrete Pipe's decision to enter
the Plan after any such decisions were made was voluntary,and Concrete Pipe could at that time have assessed any implications for the Plan's future liability. Similarly, ConcretePipe cannot rely on any argument based on the fact that,
because it was not a member of any of the contractors' asso-ciations represented among the Plan's trustees, it had no control over decisions of the trustees after it entered the Planthat may have increased the unfunded liability. Again, Concrete Pipe could have assessed the implications for futureliability of the identity of the trustees of the Plan before it
decided to enter.26 The imposition of withdrawal liabilityhere is rationally related to the terms of Concrete Pipe's participation in the Plan it joined and that suffices for substan-tive due process scrutiny of this economic legislation.

Opinion of the Court

the collective-bargaining agreements, which we find no more
helpful to Concrete Pipe than those adduced in the facial
challenge brought in Connolly, as described in that opinion:

"By the express terms of the Trust Agreement and the
Plan, the employer's sole obligation to the Pension Trust
is to pay the contributions required by the collectivebargaining agreement. The Trust Agreement clearly
states that the employer's obligation for pension benefits
to the employee is ended when the employer pays the
appropriate contribution to the Pension Trust. This is
true even though the contributions agreed upon are insufficient to pay the benefits under the Plan." Id., at
218 (citations and footnotes omitted).

Indeed, one provision of the Trust Agreement on which Concrete Pipe primarily relies is substantially identical to the
one at issue in Connolly. Compare n. 22, supra, with Connolly, supra, at 218, n. 2.

We said in Connolly that

"[a]ppellants' claim of an illegal taking gains nothing
from the fact that the employer in the present litigation
was protected by the terms of its contract from any liability beyond the specified contributions to which it had
agreed. `Contracts, however express, cannot fetter the
constitutional authority of Congress. Contracts may
create rights of property, but when contracts deal with
a subject matter which lies within the control of Congress, they have a congenital infirmity. Parties cannot
remove their transactions from the reach of dominant
constitutional power by making contracts about them.'

"If the regulatory statute is otherwise within the
powers of Congress, therefore, its application may not
be defeated by private contractual provisions." 475

Opinion of the Court
Nothing has changed since these words were first written.27Following Connolly, the next step in our analysis is to subject the operative facts, including the facts of the contractualrelationship, to the standards derived from our prior Takings
Clause cases. See id., at 224-225. They have identifiedthree factors with particular significance for assessing the
results of the required "ad hoc, factual inquir[y] into the cir-cumstances of each particular case."

Id., at 224. The firstis the nature of the governmental action. Again, our analysis in Connolly applies with equal force to the facts beforeus today.

"[T]he Government does not physically invade or perma-nently appropriate any of the employer's assets for its
own use. Instead, the Act safeguards the participantsin multiemployer pension plans by requiring a withdrawing employer to fund its share of the plan obliga-tions incurred during its association with the plan.
This interference with the property rights of an em-ployer arises from a public program that adjusts the
benefits and burdens of economic life to promote thecommon good and, under our cases, does not constitute
a taking requiring Government compensation." Id.,at 225.

We reject Concrete Pipe's contention that the appropriateanalytical framework is the one employed in our cases dealing with permanent physical occupation or destruction ofeconomically beneficial use of real property. See

Lucas v.
South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1015 (1992).While Concrete Pipe tries to shoehorn its claim into this

analysis by asserting that "[t]he property of [Concrete Pipe]which is taken, is taken in its entirety," Brief for Petitioner

27 To the extent that Concrete Pipe's argument could be characterized
as a challenge to the determination that, notwithstanding the contractual
language, it is a "defined benefits plan" under the statute, this is a question
on which Concrete Pipe did not seek review. See supra, at 607.

644 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of the Court

37, we rejected this analysis years ago in Penn Central
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 130-131 (1978),
where we held that a claimant's parcel of property could notfirst be divided into what was taken and what was left for

the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be
complete and hence compensable. To the extent that anyportion of property is taken, that portion is always taken in

its entirety; the relevant question, however, is whether theproperty taken is all, or only a portion of, the parcel in question. Accord, Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497 (1987) ("[O]ur test for regulatory
taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken
from the property with the value that remains in the property, [and] one of the critical questions is determining how
to define the unit of property `whose value is to furnish the
denominator of the fraction' ") (citation omitted).

There is no more merit in Concrete Pipe's contention that
its property is impermissibly taken "for the sole purpose of
protecting the PBGC [a government body] from being forced
to honor its pension insurance." Brief for Petitioner 38; see
also Brief for Midwest Motor Express, Inc., et al. as Amici
Curiae 12. That the solvency of a pension trust fund may
ultimately redound to the benefit of the PBGC, which was set
up in part to guarantee benefits in the event of plan failure, is
merely incidental to the primary congressional objective of
protecting covered employees and beneficiaries of pension
trusts like the Plan. "[H]ere, the United States has taken
nothing for its own use, and only has nullified a contractual
provision limiting liability by imposing an additional obligation that is otherwise within the power of Congress to impose." Connolly, supra, at 224.

Nor is Concrete Pipe's argument about the character of
the governmental action strengthened by the fact that Concrete Pipe lacked control over investment and benefit decisions that may have increased the size of the unfunded
vested liability. The response to the same argument raised

Opinion of the Court
under the substantive Due Process Clause is appropriatehere: although Concrete Pipe is not itself a member of any

of the management associations that are represented amongthe trustees of the fund, Concrete Pipe voluntarily chose
to participate in the Plan, notwithstanding this fact. See
supra, at 641, and n. 26.As to the second factor bearing on the taking determination, the severity of the economic impact of the Plan, Con-crete Pipe has not shown its withdrawal liability here to be
"out of proportion to its experience with the plan," 475 U. S.,at 226, notwithstanding the claim that it will be required to
pay out 46% of shareholder equity. As a threshold matter,
the Plan contests this figure, arguing that Concrete Pipe, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Concrete Pipe & Products Co.,
Inc., was simply "formed to facilitate the purchase . . . of
certain assets of Cen-Vi-Ro," Brief for Respondent 2, and
that the relevant issue turns on the diminution of net worth
of the parent company, not Concrete Pipe. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 29. But this dispute need not be resolved, for even
assuming that Concrete Pipe has used the appropriate measure in determining the portion of net worth required to be
paid out, our cases have long established that mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient
to demonstrate a taking. See, e. g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 384 (1926) (approximately 75%
diminution in value); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394,
405 (1915) (92.5% diminution).

The final factor is the degree of interference with Concrete
Pipe's "reasonable investment-backed expectations." 475
U. S., at 226. Again, Connolly controls. At the time Concrete Pipe purchased Cen-Vi-Ro and began its contributions
to the Plan, pension plans had long been subject to federal
regulation, and " `[t]hose who do business in the regulated
field cannot object if the legislative scheme is buttressed by
subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end.'

the Plan was already subject to ERISA, and a withdrawingemployer faced contingent liability up to 30% of its net
worth. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1364 (1976 ed.); see also 29 U. S. C.$ 1362(b) (1976 ed.);

Connolly, supra, at 226-227; Gray, 467U. S., at 721. Thus while Concrete Pipe argues that requiring it to pay a share of promised benefits "ignores expressand bargained-for conditions on [its contractual] promises,"
Connolly, 475 U. S., at 235 (O'Connor, J., concurring), itcould have had no reasonable expectation that it would not
be faced with liability for promised benefits. Id., at 227(opinion of the Court). Because "legislation readjusting
rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsetsotherwise settled expectations . . . even though the effect of
the legislation is to impose a new duty or liability based onpast acts,"

Turner Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 16, Concrete Pipe'sreliance on ERISA's original limitation of contingent liability

to 30% of net worth is misplaced,28 there being no reasonablebasis to expect that the legislative ceiling would never be
lifted.29"The employe[r] in the present litigation voluntarily negotiated and maintained a pension plan which was determinedto be within the strictures of ERISA." Connolly, supra, at
227. In light of the relationship between Concrete Pipe andthe Plan, we find no basis to conclude that Concrete Pipe is

28 See Brief for Petitioner 36-37 ("The ERISA contingent liabilities
were substantially different in scope from the liabilities of MPPAA so that
[Concrete Pipe] had no reasonable notice that 46% of its net worth would
be seized").

Justice O'Connor does not join the statement to which this footnote
is attached.

29 Nor do the contractual provisions on which Concrete Pipe would rely

provide the support it seeks. Indeed, one such provision, Article X, $ E(4)
of the 1977-1980 Laborers' Craft Master Labor Agreement, provides that
liability will be limited to contributions specified in collective-bargaining
agreements "if permitted by law under ERISA." App. 82, || 34.

V
Having concluded that the statutory presumptions workno deprivation of procedural due process, and that the statute, as applied to Concrete Pipe, violates no substantive con-straint of the Fifth Amendment, we affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join all of the Court's opinion, except for the statementthat petitioner cannot "rel[y] on ERISA's original limitation

of contingent liability to 30% of net worth." Ante, at 646.The Court's reasoning is generally consistent with my own
views about retroactive withdrawal liability, which I ex-plained in

Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corpora-tion, 475 U. S. 211, 228-236 (1986) (concurring opinion), and

which I need not restate at length here. In essence, myposition is that the "imposition of this type of retroactive
liability on employers, to be constitutional, must rest onsome basis in the employer's conduct that would make it rational to treat the employees' expectations of benefits underthe plan as the employer's responsibility."

Id., at 229.The Court does not hold otherwise. Rather, it reasons

that, although "the withdrawal liability assessed againstConcrete Pipe may amount to more . . . than the share of the
Plan's liability strictly attributable to employment of coveredworkers at Concrete Pipe," this possibility "was exactly
what Concrete Pipe accepted when it joined the Plan."
Ante, at 638. I agree that a withdrawing employer can beheld responsible for its statutory "share" of unfunded vested

benefits if the employer should have anticipated the prospectof withdrawal liability when it joined the plan. In such a

case, the "basis in the employer's conduct that would makeit rational to treat the employees' expectations of benefits

under the plan as the employer's responsibility" would bethe very act of joining the plan.

I am not sure that petitioner did in fact "accept" the prospect of withdrawal liability when it joined the ConstructionLaborers Pension Trust (Plan) in 1976. As of that date,

Congress had not yet promulgated the Multiemployer Pen-sion Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA); the kind of
"withdrawal liability" imposed on petitioner did not yetexist. Although the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA) was in effect, and did create a contingent liability for the employer that withdrew from a multiemployer defined benefit plan, such liability was limited to
30% of the employer's net worth. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1364,
1362(b)(2) (1976 ed.). Petitioner's withdrawal liability under
the MPPAA amounts to 46% of its net worth. See ante,
at 646, n. 28. In addition, the Plan apparently is a hybrid
"Taft-Hartley" plan, which provides for fixed employee benefits and fixed employer contributions. It remains an open
question whether hybrid Taft-Hartley plans are indeed "defined benefit" rather than "defined contribution" plans, and
therefore subject to withdrawal liability. See Connolly,
supra, at 230, 232-235 (O'Connor, J., concurring). We do
not decide that question today. See ante, at 607, 643, n. 27.

But petitioner has not argued that its withdrawal liability,
even if otherwise permissible, cannot exceed the 30% cap
that was in effect in 1976. Nor has petitioner claimed that
the Plan is a defined contribution plan. In short, petitioner
has failed to adduce the two features of this case that might
have demonstrated why it did not "accept" the prospect of
full withdrawal liability when it joined the Plan. I therefore
agree with the Court's result as well as most of its reasoning.

I cannot, however, agree that petitioner is precluded from
"rely[ing] on ERISA's original limitation of contingent liability to 30% of net worth." Ante, at 646. The Court seizes

upon a passing reference in petitioner's brief, see ante, at646, n. 28, to justify issuing this unnecessary statement about

a difficult issue that the parties essentially have ignored. Iwould not decide without adversary briefing and argument
whether ERISA's 30% cap might prevent retroactive withdrawal liability above 30% of the employer's net worth foran employer that joined a multiemployer plan after the passage of ERISA but before the passage of the MPPAA. Ialso note that the Court's opinion should not be read to imply
that employers may be subjected to retroactive withdrawalliability simply because "pension plans [have] long been subject to federal regulation." Ante, at 645. Surely the em-ployer that joined a multiemployer plan before

ERISA had
been promulgated--before Congress had made employers
liable for unfunded benefits--might have a strong constitutional challenge to retroactive withdrawal liability. The
issue is not presented here--again, petitioner joined the Plan
after the passage of ERISA--and the Court does not address
it. It remains to be resolved in a future case.

Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I join all of the Court's opinion except Part III-B-1--the
portion of the opinion in which the Court grapples with the
trustee presumption in 29 U. S. C. $ 1401(a)(3)(A). The
Court finds the presumption "incoherent with respect to the
degree of probability of error required of the employer to
overcome a factual conclusion made by the plan sponsor."
Ante, at 625. And because, in the Court's view, "there
would be a substantial question of procedural fairness under
the Due Process Clause" if employers had to show that sponsors' findings were unreasonable or clearly erroneous, ante,
at 626, the Court proceeds to interpret the statute as if it
required an unconstrained evidentiary hearing into "any factual issue" concerning the employer's withdrawal liability,
ante, at 630.

650 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

Until today, $ 1401(a)(3)(A) provided:

"For purposes of any [arbitration] proceeding underthis section, any determination made by a plan sponsor

under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title and section1405 of this title

is presumed correct unless the party
contesting the determination shows by a preponderanceof the evidence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erroneous." (Emphasis added.)
Now the statute provides, in effect, that "any factual deter-mination made by a plan sponsor shall be rejected by the

arbitrator if the party contesting the determination showsby a preponderance of the evidence that the determination
was erroneous." There is no meaningful presumption ofcorrectness and no examination for reasonableness or clear
error. I decline to participate in this redrafting of a fed-eral law.

As I see it, there are three missteps in the analysis.First, the Court believes the statutory text is "incomprehensib[le]," ante, at 625, because it refers to three different, andmutually inconsistent, "degree[s] of certainty," ante, at 622,
or of "probability," ante, at 625. This is incorrect--in largepart because the Court overlooks the grammatical structure
of the statute. Section 1401(a)(3)(A) sets up no parallel-ism between the phrase "by a preponderance of the evidence," which establishes the standard of proof for the arbi-tration proceeding, and the critical terms "unreasonable" and
"clearly erroneous." "[B]y a preponderance of the evi-dence" (emphasis added) is an adverbial phrase that modifies
the "show[ing]" required of the employer. "Unreasonable"and "clearly erroneous," on the other hand, are predicate adjectives used to describe what it is the employer must show.The incoherence identified by the Court follows from the
assumption that Congress has "confus[ed]" burdens of proofwith standards of review. Ante, at 623. The Court believes that the terms "clearly erroneous" and "unreasonable"must signify standards of review.

Ante, at 622-623. Stand-ards of proof and standards of review are entirely unrelated

concepts (as the Court intimates, see ante, at 622-625). The
Court's reading leads to the conclusion that $ 1401(a)(3)(A) is
"meaningless," ante, at 625, because the statute (as so interpreted) "defines the nature of the conclusion the arbitrator
must draw by using a combination of terms that are categorically ill-matched," ante, at 624.*

The Court's preoccupation with standards of review is understandable, at least with respect to "clearly erroneous,"
a term with an established legal usage. See Anderson v.
Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 573-575 (1985); Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 52(a). But such a reading is not compelled. As used
in this statutory provision, "unreasonable" and "clearly erroneous" cannot signify standards applicable to the review of
prior findings, since the arbitrator himself is undeniably a
factfinder, not an appellate tribunal. See $ 1401(c) (establishing a presumption of correctness for "the findings of fact
made by the arbitrator"). That the arbitrator is to undertake his examination "by a preponderance of the evidence"
explicitly establishes his role as factfinder; appellate review

*Regrettably, the Court compounds and further muddles the textual
difficulty by suggesting that in some sense, "preponderance of the evidence," "unreasonable," and "clearly erroneous" are comparable--that
they all refer to relative "degree[s] of certainty." Ante, at 622. There
is, in fact, no basis for comparing any particular standard of proof with any
particular standard of review. An appellate tribunal could be required to
determine whether it was "clearly erroneous" to find a disputed fact "by
a preponderance of the evidence," or it could ask whether any "reasonable"
factfinder could have found "probable cause" to believe, or "clear and convincing evidence" supporting, the fact in question. See, e. g., Anderson v.
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 252 (1986) ("If the defendant in a . . .
civil case moves for summary judgment or for a directed verdict . . . , [the
inquiry is] whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of
the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict") (emphasis added);
Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 318-319 (1979) ("[T]he critical inquiry
on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction . . . is whether [a] rational trier of fact could have found the essential
elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt") (emphasis added).
Any combination of evidentiary and review standards is possible.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

does not occur "by" a taking of "evidence." The Court seesthe arbitrator as a "hybrid," who acts as both a trier of fact

and a reviewer of facts found. Ante, at 623-624. But thepresumption of correctness that applies to the plan sponsor's
determinations does not make the arbitrator a "reviewing
body," ante, at 624, any more than the presumption of inno-cence in a criminal trial renders the jury a reviewer, rather

than a trier, of fact.The way out of the conundrum is apparent. The terms
"unreasonable" and "clearly erroneous" must refer to whatare, in effect,

elements of the employer's claim in the arbitration proceeding. To prevail in its action before the arbitrator, in other words, the employer must show by a preponderance of the evidence, first, that the plan sponsor has made
a determination under one of the relevant provisions and,
second, that that determination was either unreasonable or
clearly erroneous. This construction requires us to put
aside the technical definition of "clearly erroneous" and focus
on the literal meaning of the phrase. "Clear" error can
simply mean an obvious, plain, gross, significant, or manifest
error or miscalculation. See Black's Law Dictionary 250
(6th ed. 1990). That may not be the most natural reading
(for a court, that is) of this legal term of art, but if we do
not drop the assumption that "clearly erroneous" must be a
reference to the Bessemer City standard of review, we cannot avoid the incoherence that has trapped the majority.
The term "unreasonable," of course, is even more readily
construed to refer to something other than a standard of review, since it can hardly be thought to have a sharply defined
meaning that is limited to the context of appellate review.
There is, for example, nothing unusual about requiring a
party to show as an element of a substantive claim that
something--an interstate carrier's filed rate, for example,
see Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S. 258 (1993)--is "unreasonable."
Section 1401(a)(3)(A) is thus susceptible of a reading that
gives it a coherent meaning.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
This interpretation also conforms neatly with the verysimilar language and structure of the actuarial presumption

in $ 1401(a)(3)(B), which the Court today finds unproblematic.See

ante, at 631-636. That presumption provides that the
actuary's determination of unfunded vested benefits will
be presumed correct unless the employer shows "by a pre-ponderance of the evidence" that the actuarial assumptions

and methods were "unreasonable" or that the actuary madea "significant error." The Court offers no persuasive explanation as to why this presumption does not suffer from thesame incoherence. In addition, my reading of the term
"clearly erroneous" in $ 1401(a)(3)(A) renders it virtually
indistinguishable from the term "significant error" in

$ 1401(a)(3)(B).

The second false step in the Court's analysis is the use
of the rule of construction applied in Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). Ante, at 628-630. This
rule, which requires a court to adopt a reasonable alternative
interpretation of a statute when necessary to avoid serious
constitutional problems, does not provide authority to construe the statute in a way that "is plainly contrary to the
intent of Congress." DeBartolo, supra, at 575. The rule
"cannot be stretched beyond the point at which [the alternative] construction remains `fairly possible.' " Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 481 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original)
(quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932)). "And it
should not be given too broad a scope lest a whole new range
of Government action be proscribed by interpretive shadows
cast by constitutional provisions that might or might not
invalidate it." Public Citizen, supra, at 481. Here it is
plain, in my view, that Congress intended to shield the plan
sponsor's factual determinations behind a presumption of
correctness and intended that withdrawing employers would
have to show something more than simple error. The

654 CONCRETE PIPE & PRODUCTS OF CAL., INC. v. CONSTRUCTION LABORERS PENSION TRUST FOR SOUTHERN CAL.

Opinion of Thomas, J.

Court's construction is plainly contrary to this intent and isnot "fairly possible" under the terms of the statute. Rather

than a reasonable alternative reading, therefore, the inter-pretation adopted by the Court today is effectively a declaration that the statute as written is unconstitutional.

Which leads to my final, and perhaps most fundamental,disagreement with the Court. Before a court can appropriately invoke the Crowell/DeBartolo rule of construction, itmust have a significantly higher degree of confidence that
the statutory provision would be unconstitutional should theproblematic interpretation be adopted. The potential due
process problem troubling the Court is the supposed lack of
a neutral or "impartial" arbitration hearing. Ante, at 626.
This potential is based on an "assumption" about a "risk" or
"possibility" of trustee bias, ante, at 617, 618--bias that, if it
existed, might be "preserve[d]" during the arbitration proceeding by the presumption of correctness. Ante, at 620.
Petitioner has not established that the trustees were biased
in fact. And whatever structural bias may flow from the
trustees' fiduciary obligations or from the fact that the trustees are appointed by interested parties, see ante, at 616-617,
will likely be nullified by the elaborately detailed criteria
that channel and cabin their exercise of discretion. See 29
U. S. C. $$ 1381-1399 (1988 ed. and Supp. III). Such bias
may be checked, in particular, by the requirement of consistency that governs the trustees' choice of a method for
calculating liability. See Keith Fulton & Sons, Inc. v. New
England Teamsters & Trucking Industry Pension Fund,
Inc., 762 F. 2d 1137, 1142 (CA1 1985) (en banc). And the
very fiduciary duty the trustees owe to the fund should
simultaneously prevent them from imposing excessive withdrawal liability that will discourage other employers from
joining the fund in the future. Id., at 1142-1143. The
Court does not consider these countervailing forces.

But even if there is a real risk that structural bias may
distort the trustees' factual determinations, I am inclined

Opinion of Thomas, J.
to believe that the arbitration proceeding--presumptionand all--provides adequate process for the employer. Cf.

Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 334-335 (1976) (adequacyof specific procedures involves consideration of private and
public interests and risk of erroneous deprivation). Thisconclusion rests principally on the nature of the particular
statutory determinations to which the presumption applies(those described in $$ 1381-1399 and 1405). Many of these
determinations, such as the mathematical computations thetrustees must perform under $$ 1386, 1388, and 1391, involve
little or no discretion. As a result, the employer will havecorrespondingly little difficulty proving the existence of any
significant error made by the trustees (either inadvertentlyor because of bias). The same can be said of withdrawaldate determinations under $$ 1381 and 1383, especiallywhere all the information relevant to the determination is
better known to the employer than to the trustees.To me, the public interest is plain on the face of the statute: Congress did not want withdrawing employers to avoidtheir obligations by engaging in a lengthy arbitration over
relatively insignificant errors. At the same time, the em-ployer's interest in correcting miscalculations that are significant is adequately protected by the opportunity for arbi-tration afforded by $ 1401.

For these reasons, I concur only in the Court's judgmentthat the application of $ 1401(a)(3)(A) "did not deprive Concrete Pipe of its right to procedural due process." Ante,at 631.

NORTHEASTERN FLORIDA CHAPTER OF THE

ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF

AMERICA v. CITY OF JACKSONVILLE,

FLORIDA, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-1721. Argued February 22, 1993--Decided June 14, 1993
Respondent city enacted an ordinance requiring that 10% of the amount

spent on city contracts be set aside each fiscal year for so-called "Minority Business Enterprises" (MBE's). Petitioner construction contractors' association, most of whose members did not qualify as MBE's, filed
suit in the District Court against the city and respondent mayor, alleging that many of its members regularly bid on, and performed, construction work for the city and "would have . . . bid on . . . designated set
aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed" by the ordinance in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.
Ultimately the court entered summary judgment for petitioner, but the
Court of Appeals vacated the judgment, ruling that petitioner lacked
standing to challenge the ordinance because it had "not demonstrated
that, but for the program, any . . . member would have bid successfully
for any of [the] contracts." After certiorari was granted, the city repealed its MBE ordinance, replacing it with another ordinance which,
although different from the repealed ordinance, still set aside certain
contracts for certified black- and female-owned businesses. Subsequently, this Court denied respondents' motion to dismiss the case as
moot.

Held:

1. The case is not moot. It is well settled that the voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its
power to determine the practice's legality, because a defendant is not
precluded from reinstating the practice. Here, there is more than a
mere risk that the city will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; it
has already done so. Insofar as the city's new ordinance accords preferential treatment in the award of city contracts, it disadvantages petitioner's members in the same way that the repealed ordinance did.
Pp. 661-663.

2. Petitioner has standing to sue the city. Pp. 663-669.

(a) When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members
of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge
the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but
for the barrier in order to establish standing. See, e. g., Regents of
Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265. The "injury in fact" element of
standing in such an equal protection case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier--here, the inability to
compete on an equal footing in the bidding process--not the ultimate
inability to obtain the benefit. To establish standing, therefore, petitioner need only demonstrate that its members are able and ready to
bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy prevents them from
doing so on an equal basis. Pp. 663-666.

(b) Respondents' reliance on Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490--in
which a construction association was denied standing to challenge a
town's zoning ordinance--is misplaced. Unlike petitioner, the association in Warth claimed that its members could not obtain variances and
permits, not that they could not apply for the variances and permits on
an equal basis, and did not allege that any members had applied for a
permit or variance for a current project. Pp. 666-668.

(c) Petitioner's allegations that its members regularly bid on city
contracts and would have bid on the contracts set aside under the ordinance were unchallenged and are assumed to be true. Pp. 668-669.

CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLE

Opinion of the Court

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
A Jacksonville, Florida, ordinance accords preferential
treatment to certain minority-owned businesses in the award
of city contracts. In this case we decide whether, in order
to have standing to challenge the ordinance, an association
of contractors is required to show that one of its members
would have received a contract absent the ordinance. We
hold that it is not.

I

A

In 1984, respondent Jacksonville enacted an ordinance
entitled "Minority Business Enterprise Participation," which
required that 10% of the amount spent on city contracts be
set aside each fiscal year for so-called "Minority Business
Enterprises" (MBE's). City of Jacksonville Purchasing
Code $$ 126.604(a), 126.605(a) (1988). An MBE was defined
as a business whose ownership was at least 51% "minority"
or female, $ 126.603(a), and a "minority" was in turn defined
as a person who is or considers himself to be black, Spanishspeaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, or handicapped,

$ 126.603(b). Once projects were earmarked for MBE
bidding by the city's chief purchasing officer, they were
"deemed reserved for minority business enterprises only."

$$ 126.604(c), 126.605(c). Under the ordinance, "[m]athematical certainty [was] not required in determining the amount
of the set aside," but the chief purchasing officer was required to "make every attempt to come as close as possible to

the ten percent figure." $$ 126.604(a)(4), 126.605(a)(4). The
ordinance also provided for waiver or reduction of the 10%
set-aside under certain circumstances. $ 126.608.

Petitioner, the Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), is an
association of individuals and firms in the construction industry. Petitioner's members do business in Jacksonville,
and most of them do not qualify as MBE's under the city's
ordinance. On April 4, 1989, petitioner filed an action,
pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, against the city and its
mayor (also a respondent here) in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida. Claiming that
Jacksonville's ordinance violated the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (both on its face and
as applied), petitioner sought declaratory and injunctive
relief. In its complaint, petitioner alleged that many of
its members "regularly bid on and perform construction
work for the City of Jacksonville," Complaint || 9, and that
they "would have . . . bid on . . . designated set aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed" by the ordinance,
id., || 46.

On April 6, 1989, the District Court entered a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the city from implementing the
MBE ordinance, and, on April 20, it issued a preliminary injunction. Respondents appealed. Concluding that petitioner had not demonstrated irreparable injury, the Court
of Appeals reversed the issuance of the preliminary injunction, and remanded the case for an expedited disposition on
the merits. 896 F. 2d 1283 (CA11 1990). Chief Judge
Tjoflat concurred in the judgment. In his view the suit
should have been dismissed for lack of standing, because
petitioner's complaint did not "refer to any specific contract
or subcontract that would have been awarded to a nonminority bidder but for the set-aside ordinance." Id., at
1287.

CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLE

Opinion of the Court

In the meantime, both petitioner and respondents had
moved for summary judgment.1 On May 31, 1990, the District Court entered summary judgment for petitioner, concluding that the MBE ordinance was inconsistent with the
equal protection criteria established by this Court in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989). Once again
respondents appealed, and once again they obtained a favorable ruling. 951 F. 2d 1217 (1992). Rather than addressing
the merits of petitioner's equal protection claim, the Court
of Appeals held that petitioner "lacks standing to challenge
the ordinance establishing the set-aside program," id., at
1218, because it "has not demonstrated that, but for the program, any AGC member would have bid successfully for any
of these contracts," id., at 1219. The Court of Appeals accordingly vacated the District Court's judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss petitioner's
complaint without prejudice.

Because the Eleventh Circuit's decision conflicts with decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit and the Ninth
Circuit, see O'Donnell Constr. Co. v. District of Columbia,
295 U. S. App. D. C. 317, 320, 963 F. 2d 420, 423 (1992);
Coral Constr. Co. v. King County, 941 F. 2d 910, 930 (CA9
1991), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1033 (1992), we granted certiorari. 506 U. S. 813 (1992).

B

On October 27, 1992, 22 days after our grant of certiorari,
the city repealed its MBE ordinance and replaced it with an
ordinance entitled "African-American and Women's Business
Enterprise Participation," which became effective the next
day. This ordinance differs from the repealed ordinance in
three principal respects. First, unlike the prior ordinance,

1 In their motion for summary judgment, respondents claimed only that
they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the merits; they did
not challenge petitioner's standing. See 2 Record, Exh. 33.

Opinion of the Court
which applied to women and members of seven different mi-nority groups, the new ordinance applies only to women and

blacks. Jacksonville Purchasing Code $ 126.601(b) (1992).Second, rather than a 10% "set aside," the new ordinance
has established "participation goals" ranging from 5 to 16%,depending upon the type of contract, the ownership of the
contractor, and the fiscal year in which the contract isawarded. $ 126.604. Third, the new ordinance provides not
one but five alternative methods for achieving the "participa-tion goals." $$ 126.605, 126.618. Which of these methods
the city will use is decided on a "project by project basis,"$ 126.605, but one of them, the "Sheltered Market Plan," is
(apart from the percentages) virtually identical to the priorordinance's "set aside." Under this plan, certain contracts
are reserved "for the exclusive competition" of certifiedblack- and female-owned businesses. $ 126.605(b).

2

Claiming that there was no longer a live controversy withrespect to the constitutionality of the repealed ordinance,

respondents filed a motion to dismiss the case as moot onNovember 18, 1992. We denied that motion on December
14. 506 U. S. 1031 (1992). II

In their brief on the merits, respondents reassert theirclaim that the repeal of the challenged ordinance renders the
case moot. We decline to disturb our earlier ruling, how-ever; now, as then, the mootness question is controlled by

2 The four other methods are (1) a "Participation Percentage Plan,"
under which contractors are required to subcontract with black- or femaleowned businesses, $$ 126.605(a), 126.612; (2) a "Direct Negotiation Plan,"
pursuant to which the city engages in "direct negotiations" with black- or
female-owned businesses, $ 126.605(c); (3) a "Bid Preference Plan," which
provides for the award of a contract to the black- or female-owned business whose bid is within a certain percentage or dollar amount of the
lowest bid, $ 126.605(d); and (4) an "Impact Plan," under which "point values" are awarded to black- and female-owned businesses and to businesses
that use black- or female-owned subcontractors or suppliers or have a
specified employment program for black and female employees, $ 126.618.

CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLE

Opinion of the Court

City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283(1982), where we applied the "well settled" rule that "a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice doesnot deprive a federal court of its power to determine the
legality of the practice." Id., at 289. Although the chal-lenged statutory language at issue in

City of Mesquite hadbeen eliminated while the case was pending in the Court of

Appeals, we held that the case was not moot, because thedefendant's "repeal of the objectionable language would not
preclude it from reenacting precisely the same provision ifthe District Court's judgment were vacated." Ibid.

This is an a fortiori case. There is no mere risk that Jack-sonville will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; it has already done so. Nor does it matter that the new ordinancediffers in certain respects from the old one.

City of Mes-quite does not stand for the proposition that it is only the

possibility that the selfsame statute will be enacted that pre-vents a case from being moot; if that were the rule, a defendant could moot a case by repealing the challenged statuteand replacing it with one that differs only in some insignificant respect. The gravamen of petitioner's complaint is thatits members are disadvantaged in their efforts to obtain city
contracts. The new ordinance may disadvantage them to alesser degree than the old one, but insofar as it accords preferential treatment to black- and female-owned contractors--and, in particular, insofar as its "Sheltered Market Plan" is
a "set aside" by another name--it disadvantages them in thesame fundamental way.

3

3 At bottom, the dissent differs with us only over the question whether
the new ordinance is sufficiently similar to the repealed ordinance that it
is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues--or, as the
dissent puts it, whether the ordinance has been "sufficiently altered so as
to present a substantially different controversy from the one the District
Court originally decided." Post, at 671. We believe that the ordinance has
not been "sufficiently altered"; the dissent disagrees. As for the merits
of that disagreement, the short answer to the dissent's argument that this
case is controlled by Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami,

Opinion of the Court
We hold that the case is not moot, and we now turn to thequestion on which we granted certiorari: whether petitioner

has standing to challenge Jacksonville's ordinance.

III
The doctrine of standing is "an essential and unchangingpart of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III,"

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992),which itself "defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the
idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Govern-ment is founded," Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750 (1984).
It has been established by a long line of cases that a partyseeking to invoke a federal court's jurisdiction must demonstrate three things: (1) "injury in fact," by which we meanan invasion of a legally protected interest that is "(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not con-jectural or hypothetical,"

Lujan, supra, at 560 (citations,footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted); (2) a causal

relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct,by which we mean that the injury "fairly can be traced to
the challenged action of the defendant," and has not resulted"from the independent action of some third party not before
the court," Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976); and (3) a likelihoodthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision, by

which we mean that the "prospect of obtaining relief from
Inc., 404 U. S. 412 (1972) (per curiam), and Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U. S.
379 (1975)--both of which predate City of Mesquite--is that the statutes
at issue in those cases were changed substantially, and that there was
therefore no basis for concluding that the challenged conduct was being
repeated. See Diffenderfer, supra, at 413-414 ("crux of [the] complaint"
was that old statute violated Constitution insofar as it authorized tax exemption "for church property used primarily for commercial purposes";
new statute authorized exemption "only if the property is used predominantly for religious purposes"); Fusari, 419 U. S., at 380 (challenged statute was "significantly revised"); id., at 385 (legislature enacted "major
revisions" of statute).

the injury as a result of a favorable ruling" is not "too specu-lative," Allen v. Wright, supra, at 752. These elements are

the "irreducible minimum," Valley Forge Christian Collegev. Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982), required by the Constitution.The Court of Appeals held that petitioner could not establish standing because it failed to allege that one or more ofits members would have been awarded a contract but for
the challenged ordinance. Under these circumstances, theCourt of Appeals concluded, there is no "injury." 951 F. 2d,
at 1219-1220. This holding cannot be reconciled with ourprecedents.

A
In Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346 (1970), a Georgia lawlimiting school board membership to property owners was

challenged on equal protection grounds. We held that aplaintiff who did not own property had standing to challenge
the law, id., at 361, n. 23, and although we did not say soexplicitly, our holding did not depend upon an allegation that
he would have been appointed to the board but for the prop-erty requirement. All that was necessary was that the
plaintiff wished to be considered for the position. Accord,

Clements v. Fashing, 457U. S. 957 (1982). There, a number of officeholders claimed

that their equal protection rights were violated by the "auto-matic resignation" provision of the Texas Constitution, which
requires the immediate resignation of some (but not all)state officeholders upon their announcement of a candidacy
for another office. Noting that the plaintiffs had allegedthat they would have announced their candidacy were it not
for the consequences of doing so, we rejected the claim thatthe dispute was "merely hypothetical," and that the allegations were insufficient to create an "actual case or contro508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:27 PAGES OPINPGT

versy." Id., at 962. Citing Turner v. Fouche, we emphasized that the plaintiffs' injury was the "obstacle to [their]
candidacy," 457 U. S., at 962 (emphasis added); we did not
require any allegation that the plaintiffs would actually have
been elected but for the prohibition.

The decision that is most closely analogous to this case,
however, is Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265
(1978), where a twice-rejected white male applicant claimed
that a medical school's admissions program, which reserved
16 of the 100 places in the entering class for minority applicants, was inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause.
Addressing the argument that the applicant lacked standing
to challenge the program, Justice Powell concluded that the
"constitutional requirements of Art. III" had been satisfied,
because the requisite "injury" was the medical school's "decision not to permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in the
class, simply because of his race." Id., at 281, n. 14 (emphasis added) (principal opinion). Thus, "even if Bakke had
been unable to prove that he would have been admitted in
the absence of the special program, it would not follow that
he lacked standing." Id., at 280-281, n. 14 (emphasis added).
This portion of Justice Powell's opinion was joined by four
other Justices. See id., at 272.4

4 Although Bakke came to us from state court, our decision in ASARCO
Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605 (1989), does not retroactively render Bakke's
discussion of standing dictum. See Brief for Public Citizen et al. as Amici
Curiae 7, n. 4 (suggesting that it might). In ASARCO we held that we
had jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court even though the
respondents (plaintiffs in the trial court) "had no standing to sue under
the principles governing the federal courts," 490 U. S., at 623, because
the petitioners (defendants in the trial court) "allege[d] a specific injury
stemming from the state-court decree," id., at 617. But we did not hold
that it was irrelevant whether the state-court plaintiffs met federal standing requirements; instead we made it clear that a determination that the
plaintiffs satisfied those requirements would have "obviated any further
inquiry." Id., at 623, n. 2. Thus, while Bakke's standing was not a necessary condition for our exercise of jurisdiction, it was sufficient.

CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA v. JACKSONVILLE

Opinion of the Court

Singly and collectively, these cases stand for the followingproposition: When the government erects a barrier that

makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain abenefit than it is for members of another group, a member of
the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need notallege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the
barrier in order to establish standing. The "injury in fact"in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of
equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier,not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. See,

e. g.,Turner v. Fouche, supra, at 362 ("We may assume that the

[plaintiffs] have no right to be appointed to the . . . board ofeducation. But [they] do have a federal constitutional right
to be considered for public service without the burden ofinvidiously discriminatory disqualifications") (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). And in the context of a challenge toa set-aside program, the "injury in fact" is the inability to
compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not theloss of a contract. See

Croson, 488 U. S., at 493 (principalopinion of
O'Connor, J.) ("The [set-aside program] deniescertain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely upon their race")(emphasis added). To establish standing, therefore, a party
challenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville's need onlydemonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and
that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on anequal basis.

would "redress" the injury.

Opinion of the Court
it had the effect of preventing people of low and moderateincome from living in the town. Seeking to intervene in the

suit, an association of construction firms alleged that the zon-ing restrictions had deprived some of its members of business opportunities and profits. We held that the association
lacked standing, and we provided the following explanationfor our holding:

"The complaint refers to no specific project of any of [the
association's] members that is currently precluded eitherby the ordinance or by respondents' action in enforcing

it. There is no averment that any member has applied
to respondents for a building permit or a variance withrespect to any current project. Indeed, there is no indication that respondents have delayed or thwarted anyproject currently proposed by [the association's] members, or that any of its members has taken advantage ofthe remedial processes available under the ordinance.
In short, insofar as the complaint seeks prospective relief, [the association] has failed to show the existence ofany injury to its members of sufficient immediacy and

ripeness to warrant judicial intervention." Id., at 516.
We think Warth is distinguishable. Unlike the other casesthat we have discussed,

Warth did not involve an allegation
that some discriminatory classification prevented the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing in its quest for abenefit. In

Turner v. Fouche, Quinn v. Millsap, and Clements v. Fashing, the plaintiffs complained that they could notbe considered for public office. And in both

Bakke and this
case, the allegation was that the plaintiff (or the plaintiff 's
membership) was excluded from consideration for a certain
portion of benefits--in Bakke, places in a medical school
class; here, municipal contracts. In Warth, by contrast,
there was no claim that the construction association's members could not apply for variances and building permits on
the same basis as other firms; what the association objected

to were the "refusals by the town officials to grant variancesand permits." 422 U. S., at 515 (emphasis added). See also

id., at 530 (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("[T]he claim is that re-spondents will not approve any project") (emphasis deleted).
The firms' complaint, in other words, was not that they couldnot compete equally; it was that they did not win. Thus,
while there is undoubtedly some tension between Warth andthe aforementioned line of cases, this case is governed by
the latter.In any event, the tension is minimal. Even assuming that
the alleged injury in Warth was an inability to compete forvariances and permits on an equal basis, and that

Warth, too,is analogous to this case, it is distinguishable nonetheless.

Unlike petitioner, which alleged that its members regularlybid on contracts in Jacksonville and would bid on those that
the city's ordinance makes unavailable to them, the construc-tion association in

Warth did not allege that "any memberha[d] applied . . . for a building permit or a variance with

respect to any current project." Id., at 516. Thus, unlikethe association in

Warth, petitioner has alleged an "injury . . .of sufficient immediacy . . . to warrant judicial intervention."

Ibid. Furthermore, we did not hold in Warth, as the Courtof Appeals--mutatis mutandis--did here, that the association was required to allege that but for a discriminatory pol-icy, variances or permits would have been awarded to its
members. An allegation that a "specific project" was "pre-cluded" by the existence or administration of the zoning ordinance, ibid., would certainly have been sufficient to establishstanding, but there is no suggestion in

Warth that it wasnecessary.

a motion for summary judgment, for example), we mustassume that they are true. See Lucas v. South Carolina

Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1012-1013, n. 3 (1992); Pen-nell v. San Jose, 485 U. S. 1, 7 (1988). Given that assumption, and given the legal standard we have reaffirmed today,it was inappropriate for the Court of Appeals to order that
petitioner's complaint be dismissed for lack of standing.6The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.

So ordered.
Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmunjoins, dissenting.

When a challenged statute expires or is repealed or sig-nificantly amended pending review, and the only relief sought
is prospective, the Court's practice has been to dismiss thecase as moot. Today the Court abandons that practice, relying solely on our decision in City of Mesquite v. Aladdin'sCastle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283 (1982). See ante, at 661-663. I
believe this case more closely resembles those cases in whichwe have found mootness than it does

City of Mesquite. Ac-cordingly, I would not reach the standing question decided

by the majority. I

A
Earlier this Term, the Court reaffirmed the longstandingrule that a case must be dismissed as moot "if an event occurs [pending review] that makes it impossible for the courtto grant `any effectual relief whatever' to a prevailing party."

6 There has been no suggestion that even if petitioner's members have
standing to sue, petitioner itself does not, because one or more of the
prerequisites to "associational standing" have not been satisfied. See
Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 343
(1977). Nor, given the current state of the record, do we have any basis
for reaching that conclusion on our own.

Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9,12 (1992) (quoting

Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895)).
That principle applies to challenges to legislation that hasexpired or has been repealed, where the plaintiff has sought

only prospective relief. If the challenged statute no longer
exists, there ordinarily can be no real controversy as to itscontinuing validity, and an order enjoining its enforcement

would be meaningless. In such circumstances, it is well set-tled that the case should be dismissed as moot. See,

e. g.,
New Orleans Flour Inspectors v. Glover, 160 U. S. 170 (1895)(repeal). Accord,

Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363-365
(1987) (expiration); cf. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.
469, 478, n. 1 (1989) (expiration of set-aside law did not moot
case where parties had continuing controversy over question
whether prior application of ordinance entitled plaintiff to
damages).

The analysis varies when the challenged statute is
amended or is repealed but replaced with new legislation. I
agree with the Court that a defendant cannot moot a case
simply by altering the law "in some insignificant respect."
Ante, at 662. We have recognized, however, that material
changes may render a case moot. See, e. g., Princeton Univ.
v. Schmid, 455 U. S. 100, 103 (1982) (per curiam) ("substantia[l] amend[ment]" of challenged regulation mooted controversy over its validity). It seems clear, for example, that
when the challenged law is revised so as plainly to cure the
alleged defect, or in such a way that the law no longer applies
to the plaintiff, there is no live controversy for the Court to
decide. Such cases functionally are indistinguishable from
those involving outright repeal: Neither a declaration of the
challenged statute's invalidity nor an injunction against its
future enforcement would benefit the plaintiff, because the
statute no longer can be said to affect the plaintiff. See,
e. g., Department of Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U. S. 556, 559-

Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U. S. 119,
128-130 (1977) (challenge to law permitting parents to com-mit juveniles under 18 to mental hospital mooted, with respect to those over 13, by new legislation permitting such

Berry v. Davis, 242 U. S. 468, 470
(1917) (suit to enjoin mandatory vasectomy on plaintiff dismissed after statute requiring operation was replaced by law
inapplicable to plaintiff).

A more difficult question is presented when, after we have
granted review of a case, the challenged statute is replaced
with new legislation that, while not obviously or completely
remedying the alleged infirmity in the original act, is more
narrowly drawn. The new law ultimately may suffer from
the same legal defect as the old. But the statute may be
sufficiently altered so as to present a substantially different
controversy from the one the district court originally decided. In such cases, this Court typically has exercised
caution and treated the case as moot.

In Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Inc.,
404 U. S. 412 (1972) (per curiam), for example, plaintiffs
challenged a Florida statute that exempted from taxation
certain church property used in part as a commercial parking lot as violative of the Religion Clauses of the First
Amendment. After this Court noted probable jurisdiction,
the Florida Legislature repealed the statute and replaced
it with new legislation exempting from taxation only
church property used predominantly for religious purposes.
Observing that the church property in question might not be
entitled to an exemption under the new law, we concluded
that the controversy before us was moot. We reasoned:

O'Connor, J., dissenting

"The only relief sought in the complaint was a declara-tory judgment that the now repealed [statute] is unconstitutional as applied to a church parking lot used forcommercial purposes and an injunction against its
application to said lot. This relief is, of course, inappro-priate now that the statute has been repealed."

Id.,at 414-415.

Recognizing that the plaintiffs might wish to challenge thenewly enacted legislation, we declined simply to order dismissal, as is our practice when a controversy becomes mootpending a decision by this Court. See United States v.
Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39, and n. 2 (1950). In-stead, we vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded
with leave to the plaintiffs to amend their pleadings. 404U. S., at 415.

The Court took a similar approach in Fusari v. Steinberg,419 U. S. 379 (1975), in which plaintiffs challenged Connecticut's procedures for determining continuing eligibility for un-employment compensation. A three-judge District Court
held that the scheme violated due process because it failedto provide an adequate hearing and because administrative
review of the hearing examiner's decision took an unreason-ably long time. After this Court noted probable jurisdiction, the state legislature amended the relevant statutes, es-tablishing additional procedural protections at the hearing
stage and altering the structure of administrative review tomake it quicker and fairer. Because these changes "[might]
alter significantly the character of the system considered bythe District Court," id., at 386-387, and because it was unclear how the new procedures would operate, id., at 388-389,we vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded for
reconsideration in light of the intervening changes in statelaw. See

id., at 390; see also Allee v. Medrano, 416 U. S. 802,818-820 (1974) (where criminal statutes declared unconstitutional were replaced by "more narrowly drawn" versions,case was moot absent pending prosecutions).

These precedents establish that, where a challenged stat-ute is replaced with more narrowly drawn legislation pending our review, and the plaintiff seeks only prospective relief,we generally should decline to decide the case. The controversy with respect to the old statute is moot, because a dec-laration of its invalidity or an injunction against the law's
future enforcement would not benefit the plaintiff. Wherewe cannot be sure how the statutory changes will affect the
plaintiff 's claims, dismissal avoids the possibility that our de-cision will prove advisory.

B
Like Diffenderfer, this case concerns a law that was re-pealed and replaced after this Court granted review. Petitioner's complaint requests only declaratory and injunctiverelief from a set-aside ordinance that no longer exists. The
Court acknowledges that Jacksonville's new ordinance ismore narrowly drawn than the last. See

ante, at 662 ("Thenew ordinance may disadvantage [petitioner's members] to a

lesser degree than the old one"). But the majority believesthat Diffenderfer and similar cases are inapposite because,
in the majority's view, Jacksonville's new ordinance does notdiffer substantially from the one challenged in petitioner's
complaint. See ante, at 662-663, n. 3. I cannot agree."The gravamen of petitioner's complaint,"

ante, at 662, asI read it, was that the original set-aside law violated the

Equal Protection Clause for two reasons: The law "[lacked]an adequate factual basis," in that the city had not undertaken studies to determine whether past discrimination orits continuing effects made a preference program necessary,
App. 15-17; and the ordinance "[was] not narrowly tailoredto remedy any prior racial discrimination," because the program was not limited in time, the 10% set-aside figure wasnot rationally related to any relevant statistic, and preferences were awarded to groups against whom no discrimina-tion ever had occurred in the city,

id., at 17-18. The DistrictCourt invalidated the ordinance on the authority of Rich508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:28 PAGES OPINPGT

mond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), in which weheld that a set-aside program deficient in similar respects

violated the Equal Protection Clause. App. to Pet. for Cert.10-13. The District Court concluded that Jacksonville had
not made sufficient findings of past discrimination; it therefore did not reach the "narro[w] tailor[ing]" question. Id.,at 12.

The new ordinance clearly was written to remedy the con-stitutional defects that petitioner alleged and the District
Court found in the original program. The new law waspassed after completion of an independent study, which the
city commissioned, and after a select committee of the Jacksonville City Council conducted numerous public hearings.
The new ordinance expressly adopts the select committee's
findings concerning "the present effects of past discrimination" in city contracting. Jacksonville Purchasing Code

$ 126.601 (1992).

The city's effort to make the law more narrowly tailored
also is evident. By its terms, the new program will expire
in 10 years. $ 126.604(a). In addition, as the Court explains, all but two of eight previously favored groups have
been eliminated from the list of qualified participants; the
participation goals vary according to the type of contract and
the ownership of the contractor; and there are now five alternative methods for achieving the participation goals. See
ante, at 660-661. Only one of the five methods for complying with the participation goals, the "Sheltered Market
Plan," resembles the earlier set-aside law. Ante, at 661. It
is unclear how the city will decide when, if ever, to use the
Sheltered Market Plan, rather than an alternative method, for
a particular project. As in Fusari, "we can only speculate
how the new system might operate." 419 U. S., at 388-389.

Whether or not the new ordinance survives scrutiny under
the Fourteenth Amendment--a question on which I express
no view--I cannot say that these changes are "insignificant,"
ante, at 662, to petitioner's equal protection claim. The ma508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:28 PAGES OPINPGT

jority avoids this difficulty by characterizing petitioner'scomplaint in the most general terms possible: "The gravamen of petitioner's complaint is that its members are disad-vantaged in their efforts to obtain city contracts." Ibid.
We did not undertake such a generalized approach in Diffenderfer or our other cases involving more narrowly drawnstatutory changes. There, as here, any challenge to the

new law "presents a different case," Allee, 416 U. S., at 818,and the proper course therefore is to decline to render a
decision.That the only issue before us--and the only question decided by the Court of Appeals--concerns petitioner's stand-ing does not compel a different result. Cf.

Burke v. Barnes,479 U. S., at 363 (declining to reach standing question where

expiration of law mooted controversy). A determinationthat petitioner has standing to challenge the repealed law
avails it nothing, since that law no longer exists. Petitionercan benefit only from a determination that it has standing to
challenge the new ordinance. But even assuming that thestanding questions are identical under the old and new ordinances, the Court's decision in this case, in my view, remainsinappropriate. Petitioner has not yet attempted to amend
its pleadings or to file another complaint to challenge thenew ordinance. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. Thus, today's ruling
on the standing question could prove advisory. For thatreason, I believe the wiser course, and the one most consistent with our precedents, would be to follow Diffenderfer.On the authority of that case, I would vacate the Court of
Appeals' judgment and remand to that court with instruc-tions to remand the case to the District Court to permit the
petitioner to challenge the new ordinance.

II
I also cannot agree with the majority's assertion that City
of Mesquite "control[s]" this case. Ante, at 661. I under-stand City of Mesquite to have created a narrow exception to

O'Connor, J., dissenting

the general principles I have described--an exception that
clearly is inapplicable here.

The plaintiff in City of Mesquite challenged a licensing
ordinance governing coin-operated amusement establishments. One of the factors considered in determining
whether to grant a license under the ordinance was whether
the applicant has "connections with criminal elements." 455
U. S., at 287 (internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court held that this phrase was unconstitutionally
vague, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. While the case
was pending before the Court of Appeals, however, the contested language was eliminated from the ordinance.

When the case came before us, we concluded that it need
not be dismissed as moot. We relied on the voluntarycessation doctrine, which provides that "a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a
federal court of its power to determine the legality of the
practice." Id., at 289. If it did, defendants forever could
avoid judicial review simply by ceasing the challenged practice, only to resume it after the case was dismissed. In such
cases, we have said that the defendant, to establish mootness, bears a heavy burden of "demonstrat[ing] that there is
no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated."
United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633 (1953)
(internal quotation marks omitted).

In City of Mesquite, we decided to reach the merits of the
plaintiff 's claim because "the city's repeal of the objectionable language would not preclude it from reenacting precisely the same provision if the District Court's judgment
were vacated." 455 U. S., at 289. We expressly noted that
the city in fact had announced an intention to do exactly that,
just as it already had eliminated and then reinstated another
aspect of the same ordinance in the course of the same litigation, obviously in response to prior judicial action. Id., at
289, and n. 11. These circumstances made it virtually im508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:28 PAGES OPINPGT

677Cite as: 508 U. S. 656 (1993)

possible to say that there was "no reasonable expectation"
that the city would reenact the challenged language.

City of Mesquite did not purport to overrule the long line
of cases in which we have found repeal of a challenged statute to moot the case. Significantly, we have not referred to
the voluntary-cessation doctrine in any other case involving
a statute repealed or materially altered pending review.
The reason seems to me obvious. Unlike in City of Mesquite, in the ordinary case it is not at all reasonable to suppose that the legislature has repealed or amended a challenged law simply to avoid litigation and that it will reinstate
the original legislation if given the opportunity. This is especially true where, as here, the law has been replaced--
no doubt at considerable effort and expense--with a more
narrowly drawn version designed to cure alleged legal infirmities. We ordinarily do not presume that legislative
bodies act in bad faith. That is why, other than in City of
Mesquite, we have not required the government to establish
that it cannot be expected to reenact repealed legislation
before we will dismiss the case as moot.

At most, I believe City of Mesquite stands for the proposition that the Court has discretion to decide a case in which
the statute under review has been repealed or amended.
The Court appropriately may render judgment where circumstances demonstrate that the legislature likely will reinstate the old law--which would make a declaratory judgment
or an order enjoining the law's enforcement worthwhile.
But such circumstances undoubtedly are rare. And the majority points to nothing in the record of this case to suggest
that we are dealing with the same sort of legislative improprieties that concerned us in City of Mesquite.

The majority is therefore quite unconvincing in its assertion that the mootness question in this case "is controlled by"
City of Mesquite. Ante, at 661. By treating that exceptional case as announcing a general rule favoring the exer508us2$96N 02-21-97 22:32:28 PAGES OPINPGT

cise of jurisdiction, moreover, today's decision casts doubt onour other statutory-change cases and injects new uncertainty into our mootness jurisprudence. In my view, theprinciples developed in the other decisions I have described
should continue to apply in the ordinary case. Where, ashere, a challenged statute is replaced with a more narrowly
drawn version pending review, and there is no indication thatthe legislature intends to reenact the prior version, I would
follow Diffenderfer, vacate the lower court judgment, anddirect that the plaintiff be permitted to challenge the new
legislation. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

679OCTOBER TERM, 1992
Syllabus

SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLAND, individually and as

chairman of the CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUXTRIBE,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 91-2051. Argued March 2, 1993--Decided June 14, 1993
In 1868, the Fort Laramie Treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation

and provided that it be held for the "absolute and undisturbed use and
occupation" of Sioux Tribes. The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorized
the establishment of a comprehensive flood control plan along the eastern border of the Cheyenne River Reservation, which is part of what
was once the Great Sioux Reservation, and mandated that all water
project lands be open for the general public's use and recreational enjoyment. Subsequently, in the Cheyenne River Act, the Cheyenne River
Sioux Tribe conveyed all interests in 104,420 acres of former trust lands
to the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The
United States also acquired an additional 18,000 acres of reservation
land previously owned in fee by non-Indians pursuant to the Flood Control Act. Among the rights the Cheyenne River Act reserved to the
Tribe or tribal members was a "right of free access [to the taken lands,]
including the right to hunt and fish, subject . . . to regulations governing
the corresponding use by other [United States] citizens," $ 10. Until
1988, the Tribe enforced its game and fish regulations against all violators, while petitioner South Dakota limited its enforcement to nonIndians. However, when the Tribe announced that it would no longer
recognize state hunting licenses, the State filed this action against tribal
officials, seeking to enjoin the Tribe from excluding non-Indians from
hunting on nontrust lands within the reservation and, in the alternative,
a declaration that the federal takings of tribal lands for the Oahe Dam
and Reservoir had reduced the Tribe's authority by withdrawing the
lands from the reservation. The District Court ruled, inter alia, that

$ 10 of the Cheyenne River Act clearly abrogated the Tribe's right to
exclusive use and possession of the former trust lands and that Congress

Syllabus
Congress' intent to divest the Tribe of its treaty right to do so. As for
the 18,000 acres of former fee lands, the court held that Montana v.
United States, 450 U. S. 544, and Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and
Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, controlled, and therefore that
the Tribe's regulatory authority was divested unless one of the Montana exceptions was met.

Held: Congress, in the Flood Control and Cheyenne River Acts, abrogated

the Tribe's rights under the Fort Laramie Treaty to regulate non-Indian
hunting and fishing on lands taken by the United States for construction
of the Oahe Dam and Reservoir. Pp. 687-698.

(a) Congress has the power to abrogate Indians' treaty rights, provided that its intent is clearly expressed. The Tribe's original treaty
right to exclude non-Indians from reservation lands (implicit in its right
of "absolute and undisturbed use and occupation"), and its incidental
right to regulate non-Indian use of these lands were eliminated when
Congress, pursuant to the Cheyenne River and Flood Control Acts, took
the lands and opened them for the use of the general public. See
Montana v. United States, supra; Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and
Bands of Yakima Nation, supra. Section 4 of the Flood Control Act
opened the water project lands for "recreational purposes," which includes hunting and fishing. The Cheyenne River Act declared that the
sum paid by the Government to the Tribe for the 104,420 acres "shall
be in final and complete settlement of all [of the Tribe's] claims, rights,
and demands." Had Congress intended to grant the Tribe the right to
regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing, it would have done so by an
explicit statutory command, as it did with other rights in $ 10 of the
Cheyenne River Act. And since Congress gave the Army Corps of
Engineers regulatory control over the area, it is irrelevant whether respondents claim the right to exclude nonmembers or only the right to
prevent nonmembers from hunting or fishing without tribal licenses.
Montana cannot be distinguished from this case on the ground that the
purposes of the transfers in the two cases differ, because it is a transfer's effect on pre-existing tribal rights, not congressional purpose,
that is the relevant factor. Moreover, Congress' explicit reservation of
certain rights in the taken area does not operate as an implicit reservation of all former rights. See United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734.
Pp. 687-694.

(b) The alternative arguments--that the money appropriated in the
Cheyenne River Act did not include compensation for the Tribe's loss of
licensing revenue, that general principles of "inherent sovereignty" enable the Tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing in the area,
and that Army Corps regulations permit the Tribe to regulate non508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT

I
In 1868, the Fort Laramie Treaty, 15 Stat. 635, establishedthe Great Sioux Reservation, which comprised most of what

is now western South Dakota and part of North Dakota.Article II of the treaty provided that the reservation was to
be held for the "absolute and undisturbed use and occupa-tion" of Sioux Tribes and that no non-Indians (except authorized government agents) would "ever be permitted to passover, settle upon, or reside in" the Great Sioux Reservation.
Id., at 636. The Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 405, 25 Stat. 888,removed a substantial amount of land from the reservation
and divided the remaining territory into several reserva-tions, including the Cheyenne River Reservation, which is
located in north-central South Dakota. The 1889 Act pre-served those rights of the Sioux under the Fort Laramie
Treaty that were "not in conflict" with the newly enactedstatute. $ 19, 25 Stat. 896. The land designated for the
Cheyenne River Reservation was held in trust by the UnitedStates for the benefit of the Tribe. 949 F. 2d 984, 987
(CA8 1991).The 1889 Act also authorized the President to allot parcels
of land within the reservation to individual Indians. $ 8, 25Stat. 890. Some of these allotted lands were subsequently
acquired by persons not members of the Cheyenne RiverSioux Tribe. Non-Indians also acquired fee title to some of
the unallotted and "surplus" lands on the reservation pursu-ant to the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, ch. 119, 24
Stat. 388, and the Act of May 29, 1908, ch. 218, 35 Stat. 460.The Indian General Allotment Act allowed surplus lands to
be sold to non-Indians; the Act of 1908 authorized the Secre-tary of the Interior to open for non-Indian settlement more
than 1.6 million acres previously held in trust by the UnitedStates. These enactments vastly reduced the amount of

reservation land held in trust by the United States for theTribe and its members. Today trust lands comprise less

than 50% of the reservation. App. 64.After severe floods devastated the lower Missouri River
basin in 1943 and 1944, Congress passed the Flood ControlAct of 1944, ch. 665, 58 Stat. 887. This Act authorized the
establishment of a comprehensive flood control plan alongthe Missouri River, which serves as the eastern border of
the Cheyenne River Reservation. The Act also directed theArmy Chief of Engineers to "construct, maintain, and operate public park and recreational facilities in reservoir areas,"and provided that the "reservoirs shall be open to public use
generally," subject to "such rules and regulations as the Sec-retary of War may deem necessary." $ 4, 58 Stat. 889-890.
Seven subsequent Acts of Congress authorized limited tak-ings of Indian lands for hydroelectric and flood control dams
on the Missouri River in both North and South Dakota. SeeLower Brule Sioux Tribe v. South Dakota, 711 F. 2d 809,
813, n. 1 (CA8 1983), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1042 (1984). Oneof the largest of these takings involved the Oahe Dam and
Reservoir Project, for which Congress required the Chey-enne River Sioux Tribe to relinquish 104,420 acres of its
trust lands, including roughly 2,000 acres of land underlyingthe Missouri River.

1 The Tribe's agreement to "convey to

the United States all tribal, allotted, assigned, and inheritedlands or interests" needed for the project is memorialized

in the Cheyenne River Act of Sept. 3, 1954, 68 Stat. 1191.2

1 Congress authorized the Departments of the Army and the Interior to
negotiate contracts with the Cheyenne River Tribe and the Standing Rock
Sioux Tribe for land needed for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir. See ch.
1120, 64 Stat. 1093.

2 The Tribe received a total of $10,644,014 in exchange for the 104,420

acres of land and interests therein taken by the United States. This
amount included compensation for the loss of wildlife, the loss of revenue
from grazing permits, the costs of negotiating the agreement, and the costs
of "complete rehabilitation" of all resident members and the restoration of
tribal life. See $$ 2, 5, and 13, 68 Stat. 1191-1194.

684 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLAND

Opinion of the Court
Pursuant to the Flood Control Act, the United States alsoacquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project an additional 18,000 acres that were owned in fee by non-Indians.3Although the Tribe conveyed all interests in the 104,420
acres of former trust lands to the United States,4 the Chey-enne River Act reserved to the Tribe or tribal members
certain rights respecting the use of these lands. Section 6reserved "mineral rights" to the Tribe or individual tribal
landowners, "subject to all reasonable regulations, whichmay be imposed by the [Army's] Chief of Engineers."

Id.,at 1192. Section 7 gave tribal members the right "without

charge to cut and remove all timber and to salvage . . . im-provements" until the dam area was impounded. Ibid. Section 9 allowed tribal members to continue residing on thetaken land until closure of the dam's gates.

Id., at 1192-1193. Section 10 provided that the Tribe would have the

right to "graze stock" on the taken lands and that:

"[The] Tribal Council and the members of said IndianTribe shall have, without cost, the right of free

accessto the shoreline of the reservoir including the right

to hunt and fish in and on the aforesaid shoreline andreservoir, subject, however, to regulations governing

the corresponding use by other citizens of the United
States." Id., at 1193 (emphasis added).5

3 The record does not reflect how these lands had come to be owned by
non-Indians.

4 The question on which we granted certiorari assumes the United

States acquired these lands in fee, and the District Court referred to the
"transfer of fee ownership from the Tribe to the United States." App.
125. The Court of Appeals, however, referred to the lands as "neither
non-Indian-owned fee land nor trust land." 949 F. 2d 984, 990 (CA8 1991).
Because the nature of the Government's title is not relevant to our analysis, we may assume that the United States owns the 104,420 acres in fee.

5 The Cheyenne River Act became effective upon confirmation and acceptance in writing by "three-quarters of the adult Indians of the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota." 68 Stat. 1191. Of the Indians
eligible to vote, 75.35% approved the Act; of those who actually voted,
92% voted for approval. See App. 266.

Opinion of the Court
Before this dispute arose, both the Tribe and the State ofSouth Dakota enforced their respective game and fish regulations in the taken area. The Tribe enforced its regulationsagainst all violators; the State limited its enforcement to
non-Indians. In 1988, following a dispute between the Stateand the tribal respondents regarding the 1988 deer hunting
season, the Tribe announced that it would no longer recog-nize state hunting licenses and that hunters within the reservation would be "subject to prosecution in tribal court" un-less licensed by the Tribe. App. 58. In response, the State
filed this action against the Chairman of the Cheyenne RiverSioux Tribe and the Director of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe
Game, Fish and Parks. In its complaint, the State soughtto enjoin the Tribe from excluding non-Indians from hunting
on nontrust lands within the reservation. In the alterna-tive, the State sought a declaration that the federal takings
of tribal lands for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir had reducedthe Tribe's authority by withdrawing these lands from the
reservation. Id., at 39-40 (Second Amended Complaint).The District Court concluded that the Cheyenne River Act
"did not disestablish the Missouri River boundary of theCheyenne River Reservation."

Id., at 103. Nevertheless,relying on Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981),

the District Court held that $ 10 of the Cheyenne River Actclearly abrogated the Tribe's right to exclusive use and possession of the former trust lands. App. 125. The court fur-ther found that "Congress has not expressly delegated to the
Tribe hunting and fishing jurisdiction over nonmembers" onthe taken lands.

6 Id., at 149. The District Court perma6 Although the District Court ruled on the issue of the Tribe's regulatory
jurisdiction over Indians who are not members of the Cheyenne River
Sioux, the Court of Appeals vacated that portion of the opinion. It noted
that the "issue of tribal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians was neither
pled nor tried; the complaint was limited to the question of jurisdiction
over non-Indians." 949 F. 2d, at 990. The State did not raise this issue
in its petition for certiorari, and hence the only question before us is
whether the Tribe may regulate non-Indians who hunt and fish in the
taken area.

Opinion of the Court
nently enjoined the Tribe and its members from exertingsuch authority.

The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part,and remanded. 949 F. 2d 984 (CA8 1991). The court distinguished between the 104,420 acres of former trust lands ac-quired pursuant to the Cheyenne River Act and the 18,000
acres of former non-Indian fee lands acquired pursuant to
the Flood Control Act. As to the former trust lands, thecourt held that the Tribe had authority to regulate nonIndian hunting and fishing because the Cheyenne River Actdid not clearly reveal Congress' intent to divest the Tribe of
its treaty right to do so. As to the 18,000 acres of former
fee lands, however, the court found that Montana v. United
States and Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408 (1989), controlled. Assuming
the 18,000 acres had previously been held in fee by nonIndians pursuant to one of the Allotment Acts, the Court of
Appeals noted that:

"Since Montana held that tribes have been divested of
their regulatory authority over non-Indians hunting and
fishing on land held in fee by non-Indians pursuant to an

7 The District Court found no evidence that the Tribe has ever imposed
criminal sanctions on a nonmember who violated tribal hunting or fishing
ordinances. App. 87. Throughout this litigation, respondents have disavowed any criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers, asserting instead that
the sanctions they seek to impose on unlicensed hunters and fishermen are
purely civil in nature. Id., at 85. The State, however, has contended
that these tribal regulations will be enforced through criminal sanctions.
The District Court dismissed the State's request for a declaration that the
Tribe has "no jurisdiction" to arrest and try non-Indians on the reservation, on the ground that the "purported controversy lacks sufficient immediacy and reality." Id., at 88 (internal quotation marks omitted). In any
event, we have previously held that "the inherent sovereignty of the Indian tribes does not extend to criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who
commit crimes on the reservation." Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 684
(1990) (emphasis added). See also Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S.

The Eighth Circuit therefore remanded the case for a de-termination whether the Tribe could regulate non-Indian

hunting and fishing on the former fee lands pursuant to oneof the exceptions to the general rule that an Indian tribe's
inherent sovereign powers do not extend to non-Indian activ-ity. We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 813 (1992), and now
reverse. II

Congress has the power to abrogate Indians' treaty rights,see,

e. g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 594(1977), though we usually insist that Congress clearly express its intent to do so. See Menominee Tribe v. UnitedStates, 391 U. S. 404, 412-413 (1968); United States v. Dion,
476 U. S. 734, 738 (1986). See also County of Yakima v.
Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S.251, 269 (1992) (" `[S]tatutes are to be construed liberally in

favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpretedto their benefit' ") (citations omitted). Our reading of the
relevant statutes persuades us that Congress has abrogatedthe Tribe's rights under the Fort Laramie Treaty to regulate
hunting and fishing by non-Indians in the area taken for theOahe Dam and Reservoir Project.

The Fort Laramie Treaty granted to the Cheyenne RiverSioux Tribe the unqualified right of "absolute and undis8 Although respondents did not cross-petition for review of this portion
of the Court of Appeals' decision, the State argues that the Court of Appeals' general approach in distinguishing between the 18,000 acres of nonIndian fee lands and the 104,420 acres of former trust lands was "without
basis in this Court's rulings," and thus "wrong and unworkable." Brief
for Petitioner 48. We read the question presented as fairly encompassing
the issue of the Tribe's regulatory authority over both the 18,000 acres of
former non-Indian fee lands and the 104,420 acres of former trust lands.

turbed use and occupation" of their reservation lands. 15Stat. 636. We have interpreted identical language in a parallel treaty between the United States and the Crow Tribeas embracing the implicit "power to exclude others" from
the reservation and thereby "arguably conferr[ing] upon the
Tribe the authority to control fishing and hunting on thoselands."

Montana v. United States, supra, at 558-559 (construing the second Fort Laramie Treaty, 15 Stat. 649).Thus, we may conclude that pursuant to its original treaty

with the United States, the Cheyenne River Tribe possessedboth the greater power to exclude non-Indians from, and
arguably the lesser included, incidental power to regulate
non-Indian use of, the lands later taken for the Oahe Dam
and Reservoir Project.

Like this case, Montana concerned an Indian Tribe's
power to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on lands
located within a reservation but no longer owned by the
Tribe or its members. Under the General Allotment Act of
1887, ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U. S. C. $ 332 et
seq., and the Crow Allotment Act of 1920, ch. 224, 41 Stat.
751, Congress had provided for certain Crow lands to be conveyed in fee to non-Indians for homesteading. We held that
because the Tribe thereby lost the right of absolute use and
occupation of lands so conveyed, the Tribe no longer had the
incidental power to regulate the use of the lands by nonIndians. See 450 U. S., at 559. Similarly, six Members of
this Court, in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, determined
that at least with regard to the "open" portion of the Yakima
Reservation, the Yakima Tribe had lost the authority to zone
lands that had come to be owned in fee by non-Indians. 492
U. S., 423-424 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 444-445 (opinion
of Stevens, J.). Because significant portions of that part of
the reservation had been allotted under the General Allotment Act and had passed to non-Indians, those Justices concluded that the treaty's "exclusive use and benefit" provision
was inapplicable to those lands and therefore could not con508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
fer tribal authority to regulate the conduct of non-Indiansthere. Id., at 422, 445.

Montana and Brendale establish that when an Indiantribe conveys ownership of its tribal lands to non-Indians,
it loses any former right of absolute and exclusive use andoccupation of the conveyed lands. The abrogation of this
greater right, at least in the context of the type of area atissue in this case,

9 implies the loss of regulatory jurisdiction

over the use of the land by others. In taking tribal trustlands and other reservation lands for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, and broadly opening up those lands for publicuse, Congress, through the Flood Control and Cheyenne
River Acts eliminated the Tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from these lands, and with that the incidental regulatory jurisdiction formerly enjoyed by the Tribe.The Flood Control Act authorized the construction, management, and operation of public recreational facilities on thelands taken for the Oahe Reservoir. $ 4, 58 Stat. 889, as
amended, 16 U. S. C. $ 460d. Section 4 of the Act providesthat "all such projects shall be open to public use generally"
for various "recreational purposes, . . . when such use is de-termined by the Secretary of the Army not to be contrary
to the public interest, all under such rules and regulations asthe Secretary of the Army may deem necessary." Section 4
further mandates "ready access to and exit from such waterareas . . . for general public use." Thus, the clear effect of
the Flood Control Act is to open the lands taken for the OaheDam and Reservoir Project for the general recreational use
of the public. Because hunting and fishing are "recreationalpurposes," the Flood Control Act affirmatively allows nonIndians to hunt and fish on such lands, subject to federal

9 The District Court found that the taken area is not a "closed" or pristine area, and the Court of Appeals did not disturb that finding. 949 F. 2d,
at 995. We agree that the area at issue here has been broadly opened to
the public. Thus, we need not reach the issue of a tribe's regulatory authority in other contexts.

Opinion of the Court
regulation. The Act also clearly prohibits any "use" of the
lands "which is inconsistent with the laws for the protection
of fish and game of the State in which such area is situated"
or which is determined by the Secretary of the Army to be
"contrary to the public interest." Ibid.

If the Flood Control Act leaves any doubt whether the
Tribe retains its original treaty right to regulate non-Indian
hunting and fishing on lands taken for federal water projects,
the Cheyenne River Act extinguishes all such doubt. Section II of that Act declares that the sum paid by the Government to the Tribe for former trust lands taken for the Oahe
Dam and Reservoir Project, "shall be in final and complete
settlement of all claims, rights, and demands" of the Tribe
or its allottees. 68 Stat. 1191. This provision reliably indicates that the Government and the Tribe understood the Act
to embody the full terms of their agreement, including the
various rights that the Tribe and its members would continue to enjoy after conveying the 104,420 acres to the Government.10 The Tribe's $ IX "right of free access to the
shoreline of the reservoir includ[es] the right to hunt and
fish" but is "subject . . . to regulations governing the corresponding use by other citizens of the United States." Id.,
at 1193 (emphasis added). If Congress had intended by this
provision to grant the Tribe the additional right to regulate
hunting and fishing, it would have done so by a similarly
explicit statutory command. The rights granted the Tribe
in $ IX stand in contrast to the expansive treaty right originally granted to the Tribe of "absolute and undisturbed use,"
which does encompass the right to exclude and to regulate.
See Montana, 450 U. S., at 554, 558.

10 The dissent apparently finds ambiguity in this provision, on the
ground that it "does not address the question of which rights Congress
intended to take." Post, at 703. The self-evident answer is that when
Congress used the term "all claims, rights, and demands" of the Tribe, 68
Stat. 1191, it meant all claims, rights, and demands.

Opinion of the Court
At oral argument, respondents insisted that they did notclaim the right to exclude nonmembers from the taken area,

but only the right to prevent nonmembers from hunting orfishing without appropriate tribal licenses. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 27-28, 30-31. It is ultimately irrelevant whether re-spondents claim a power to exclude.

11 Congress gave the

Army Corps of Engineers, not the Tribe, regulatory controlover the taken area. And as we have noted, an abrogated

treaty right of unimpeded use and occupation of lands "canno longer serve as the basis for tribal exercise of the lesser
included power" to regulate. Brendale, 492 U. S., at 424.In the absence of applicable Army Corps regulations allowing the Tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction over the proj-ect lands, we conclude that the Flood Control Act's openaccess mandate and the Cheyenne River Act's relevantprovisions affirmatively abrogate the Tribe's authority to
regulate entry onto or use of these lands.12The Court of Appeals found Montana inapposite with respect to the 104,420 acres of former trust lands because "[t]hepurpose of the [Cheyenne River] Act, unlike that of the Allotment Act at issue in Montana, was not the destruction oftribal self-government, but was only to acquire the property
rights necessary to construct and operate the Oahe Dam andReservoir." 949 F. 2d, at 993. To focus on purpose is to
misread Montana. In Montana, the Court did refer to thepurpose of the Allotment Acts and discussed the legislative
debates surrounding the allotment policy, as well as Con-gress' eventual repudiation of the policy in 1934 by the In11 Certainly, the power to regulate is of diminished practical use if it
does not include the power to exclude: Regulatory authority goes hand in
hand with the power to exclude. See Brendale v. Confederated Tribes

White, J.).

12 We do not address whether South Dakota has regulatory control over

hunting and fishing in the taken area. In its declaratory judgment action,
the State sought only a judicial determination regarding the Tribe's claim
to regulatory jurisdiction.

450 U. S., at 559-560, n. 9. However, at the end of this discussion, the Court unequivocally stated that "what is relevant . . . is the effect of the land alienation occasioned by
that policy on Indian treaty rights tied to Indian use and
occupation of reservation land." 450 U. S., at 560, n. 9 (emphasis added). Thus, regardless of whether land is conveyed
pursuant to an Act of Congress for homesteading or for flood
control purposes, when Congress has broadly opened up such
land to non-Indians, the effect of the transfer is the destruction of pre-existing Indian rights to regulatory control.13 Although Montana involved lands conveyed in fee to nonIndians within the Crow Reservation, Montana's framework
for examining the "effect of the land alienation" is applicable
to the federal takings in this case.

The takings at issue here do differ from the conveyances
of fee title in Montana, however, in that the terms of the

and Brendale is misplaced and insists that in Montana we did not reject
the relevance of congressional purpose, but merely "specifie[d] which congressional purpose is relevant--i. e., its purpose at the time Indian land is
alienated." Post, at 702. We are unable to wring such meaning out of
Montana's simple statement that "what is relevant . . . is the effect of the
land alienation." 450 U. S., at 560, n. 9 (emphasis added).

Moreover, even when the dissent engages in the congressional purpose
inquiry that Montana eschews, it errs in stating that Congress "simply
wished to build a dam." Post, at 698. In fact, as the dissent acknowledges, post, at 702, Congress in the Flood Control Act also mandated that
the water projects serve as recreational facilities for the general public
for activities such as "boating, swimming, bathing, [and] fishing," subject
to such "rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Army may deem
necessary." 16 U. S. C. $ 460d. Contrary to the dissent's reasoning, see

Opinion of the Court
Cheyenne River Act preserve certain limited land-use rightsbelonging to the Tribe. It could be argued that by reserving these rights, Congress preserved the right to regulateuse of the land by non-Indians. Thus, the Court of Appeals
treated the mineral, grazing, and timber rights retained bythe Tribe under the Cheyenne River Act as evidence that
the taking "was not a simple conveyance of land and allattendant interests in the land," 949 F. 2d, at 993, and the
court accordingly concluded that Congress had not abrogatedthe Tribe's pre-existing regulatory authority. We disagree.
Congress' explicit reservation of certain rights in the takenarea does not operate as an implicit reservation of all former rights.Our decision in United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734 (1986),
supports this conclusion. In Dion, we considered whetheran Indian who takes an eagle on tribal land violates the Bald
Eagle Protection Act.14 We demanded "clear evidence thatCongress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights onthe other, and chose to resolve that conflict by abrogating
the treaty." Id., at 740. The Bald Eagle Protection Actcontains an exemption allowing the Secretary of the Interior
to permit the taking of an eagle "for the religious purposesof Indian tribes" and for other narrow purposes found to be
compatible with the goal of eagle preservation. 16 U. S. C.$ 668a. We found this exemption "difficult to explain except
as a reflection of an understanding that the statute otherwisebans the taking of eagles by Indians." 476 U. S., at 740.
Likewise, we cannot explain $ X of the Cheyenne River Actand $ 4 of the Flood Control Act except as indications that
Congress sought to divest the Tribe of its right to "absoluteand undisturbed use and occupation" of the taken area.
When Congress reserves limited rights to a tribe or its mem14 The Bald Eagle Protection Act makes it a federal crime to "take, possess, sell, purchase, [or] barter . . . any bald eagle . . . or any golden eagle."

Opinion of the Court
bers, the very presence of such a limited reservation ofrights suggests that the Indians would otherwise be treated

like the public at large. III

Respondents and their amici raise several alternativearguments, none of which undercuts our statutory analysis.
Respondents argue, for example, that their right to regulatehunting and fishing in the taken area was not abrogated because the $10,644,014 appropriated in the Cheyenne RiverAct did not include compensation for the Tribe's loss of licensing revenue. This sum, respondents argue, did includepayment for,

inter alia, the loss of grazing permit revenuesand the destruction of wildlife, wild fruit, and other natural

resources, as those losses were itemized in the House Reporton the Cheyenne River Act. See Brief for Respondents 9
(citing H. R. Rep. No. 2484, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1954)).To hold their regulatory authority divested, respondents contend, would imply that Congress breached its duty to com-pensate the Tribe for all taken resources. The Act itself,
however, does not itemize the losses covered by the compen-sation but rather plainly states that the appropriated funds
constitute a "final and complete settlement of all claims,rights, and demands" of the Tribe arising out of the Oahe
Dam and Reservoir Project. $ II, 68 Stat. 1191. Given theexpress text of the Act, we will not conclude that the Act
reserved to the Tribe the right to regulate hunting and fish-ing simply because the legislative history does not include
an itemized amount for the Tribe's loss of revenue from li-censing those activities.

General principles of "inherent sovereignty" also do notenable the Tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing
in the taken area. Although Indian tribes retain inherentauthority to punish members who violate tribal law, to regulate tribal membership, and to conduct internal tribal rela-tions,

United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 326 (1978), the"exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect

Opinion of the Court
tribal self-government or to control internal relations is in-consistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so

cannot survive without express congressional delegation,"Montana, 450 U. S., at 564. Having concluded that Congress clearly abrogated the Tribe's pre-existing regulatorycontrol over non-Indian hunting and fishing, we find no evidence in the relevant treaties or statutes that Congress in-tended to allow the Tribe to assert regulatory jurisdiction
over these lands pursuant to inherent sovereignty.15The question remains, however, whether the Tribe may
invoke other potential sources of tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians on these lands.

Montana discussed two exceptionsto "the general proposition that the inherent sovereign

powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities ofnonmembers of the tribe." Id., at 565. First, a tribe may
license or otherwise regulate activities of nonmembers whoenter "consensual relationships" with the tribe or its members through contracts, leases, or other commercial dealings.
Ibid. Second, a "tribe may . . . retain inherent power toexercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on

fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatensor has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." Id.,at 566. The District Court made extensive findings that neither of these exceptions applies to either the former trustlands or the former fee lands. See App. 142-149. And although the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court

15 The dissent's complaint that we give "barely a nod" to the Tribe's
inherent sovereignty argument, post, at 698, is simply another manifestation of its disagreement with Montana, which announced "the general
proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not
extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe," 450 U. S., at 565.
While the dissent refers to our "myopic focus," post, at 701, on the Tribe's
prior treaty right to "absolute and undisturbed use and occupation" of the
taken area, it shuts both eyes to the reality that after Montana, tribal
sovereignty over nonmembers "cannot survive without express congressional delegation," 450 U. S., at 564, and is therefore not inherent.

Opinion of the Court
to undertake a new analysis of the Montana exceptions onremand as to the 18,000 acres, it did not pass upon the District Court's previous findings regarding the taken area as awhole. See 949 F. 2d, at 995. Thus, we leave this to be
resolved on remand.

Finally, respondents contend that Army Corps regulationspermit the Tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing.

Although Congress abrogated the Tribe's right to regulatorycontrol in the taken area through the Flood Control and
Cheyenne River Acts, it gave primary regulatory authorityover the water project lands to the Army Corps of Engineers. 16 U. S. C. $ 460d. See 36 CFR $ 327.1(a) (1992).
The Corps has authority to promulgate regulations "not inconsistent with . . . treaties and Federal laws and regulations" concerning "the rights of Indian Nations." $ 327.1(f).
The Corps permits "[h]unting, fishing and trapping . . . except in areas where prohibited by the District Engineer."

$ 327.8. This regulation provides that "[a]ll Federal, state
and local laws governing these activities apply on project
lands and waters, as regulated by authorized enforcement
officials." Ibid. (emphasis added). See also $ 327.26. Respondents argue that these regulations "not only allow for
tribal regulation of hunting and fishing, they affirmatively
establish the primacy of tribal treaty rights over both public
use rights and state and federal regulatory interests."
Brief for Respondents 33 (emphasis in original) (footnote
omitted). Insisting that "tribal" law is a subset of "local"
law, respondents contend that the Tribe's hunting and fishing
laws apply to all who pass through the taken area. Id., at
33, n. 39.

Respondents did not rely on the Army Corps' regulations
in the proceedings below. And although the United States
as amicus curiae asserted at oral argument that $ 327.8
leaves all pre-existing state, local, and tribal hunting and
fishing regulations in effect on project lands, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 50, it did not even mention the Army Corps regulation

in its brief. Moreover, it is inconsistent with evidence in therecord that the Corps in fact believed that jurisdiction over

non-Indian hunting and fishing on water project lands isa matter of state law.

this argument undeveloped. Under these circumstances, wedecline to defer to the Government's litigating position.

"[T]reaty rights with respect to reservation lands must beread in light of the subsequent alienation of those lands."

Montana, 450 U. S., at 561. In this case, the United Statestook former trust lands pursuant to the Flood Control Act,
which mandated that all water project lands be open for thegeneral public's use and recreational enjoyment. The Cheyenne River Act reserved some of the Tribe's original treatyrights in the former trust lands (including the right to hunt
and fish) but not the right to exert regulatory control.These statutes clearly abrogated the Tribe's "absolute and
undisturbed use and occupation" of these tribal lands, 15Stat. 636, and thereby deprived the Tribe of the power to
license non-Indian use of the lands. Accordingly, the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case

16 The dissent simply assumes that the phrase "local laws" in 36 CFR

$ 327.8 (1992) includes "tribal" laws. Post, at 702-703. However, an
Army Corps regulation outlining the procedures for evaluating Department of the Army water use permit applications indicates that the Army
Corps, in fact, distinguishes between the terms "tribal" and "local." See
33 CFR $ 320.4( j)(2) (1992) ("[t]he primary responsibility for determining
zoning and land use matters rests with state, local and tribal governments") (emphasis added). Furthermore, we are bewildered that the dissent cites $ 327.1(f) for the proposition that "the regulations themselves
provide that tribal rights prevail." Post, at 702-703. Section 327.1(f)
provides that the regulations in part 327 apply "to the extent that [they]
are not inconsistent with . . . treaties and Federal laws and regulations."
This is simply to say that the regulations do not purport to abrogate treaty
rights--not a startling proposition. The regulation says nothing about
whether the Flood Control Act or Cheyenne River Act has already terminated those rights.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

The land at issue in this case is part of the Cheyenne RiverSioux Reservation.

1 The United States did not take this

land with the purpose of destroying tribal government oreven with the purpose of limiting tribal authority. It simply

wished to build a dam. The Tribe's authority to regulatehunting and fishing on the taken area is consistent with the
uses to which Congress has put the land, and, in my view,that authority must be understood to continue until Congress
clearly decides to end it.The majority's analysis focuses on the Tribe's authority to
regulate hunting and fishing under the Fort Laramie Treatyof 1868, 15 Stat. 635, see ante, at 687-694, with barely a nod
acknowledging that the Tribe might retain such authority asan aspect of its inherent sovereignty, see ante, at 694-695.
Yet it is a fundamental principle of federal Indian law thatIndian tribes possess " `inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished.' " United Statesv.

Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 322 (1978) (emphasis omitted), quot-ing F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 122 (1945).

This Court has recognized that the inherent sovereignty ofIndian tribes extends " `over both their members and their
territory.' " 435 U. S., at 323 (emphasis added), quoting
United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 557 (1975). In-herent tribal sovereignty "exists only at the sufferance of

Congress and is subject to complete defeasance. But until

Dakota did not appeal that determination. See also 949 F. 2d 984, 990

Congress acts, the tribes retain their existing sovereignpowers. In sum, Indian tribes still possess those aspects of

sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by impli-cation as a necessary result of their dependent status." 435
U. S., at 323 (emphases added). This Court has found im-plicit divestiture of inherent sovereignty necessary only
"where the exercise of tribal sovereignty would be inconsist-ent with the overriding interests of the National Government, as when the tribes seek to engage in foreign relations,alienate their lands to non-Indians without federal consent,
or prosecute non-Indians in tribal courts which do not accordthe full protections of the Bill of Rights."

Washington v.
Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134,153-154 (1980).

2

The Fort Laramie Treaty confirmed the Tribe's sover-eignty over the land in question in the most sweeping terms

by providing that it be "set apart for the absolute and undis-turbed use and occupation of the [Sioux]." 15 Stat. 636.
The majority acknowledges that this provision arguably con-ferred " `upon the Tribe the authority to control hunting and
fishing on those lands.' " Ante, at 688, quoting Montana v.United States, 450 U. S. 544, 558-559 (1981). Because "treaties should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians,"

2 Neither South Dakota nor the majority is able to identify any overriding federal interest that would justify the implicit divestiture of the
Tribe's authority to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing. In rejecting
the Tribe's inherent sovereignty argument, the majority relies on the
suggestion in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544 (1981), that "the
`exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation.' " Ante, at 694-695, quoting Montana, 450 U. S.,
at 564. I already have had occasion to explain that this passage in Montana is contrary to 150 years of Indian-law jurisprudence and is not supported by the cases on which it relied. See Brendale v. Confederated
Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 450-456 (1989) (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting). There is no need to repeat
that explanation here.

700 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLAND

Blackmun, J., dissenting
County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U. S. 226,247 (1985), the majority is right to proceed on the assumption

that authority to control hunting and fishing is included inthe Fort Laramie Treaty.

The question, then, is whether Congress intended to abrogate the Tribe's right to regulate non-Indian hunting andfishing on the taken area--a right flowing from its original

sovereign power that was expressly confirmed by treaty.This Court does not lightly impute such an intent to Congress. There must be "clear evidence that Congress actu-ally considered the conflict between its intended action on
the one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose
to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty." United
States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 740 (1986); see also Wheeler,
435 U. S., at 323 (implicit withdrawal of inherent sovereignty
only where "necessary"); Colville, 447 U. S., at 153-154
(same).

The majority, however, points not even to a scrap of evidence that Congress actually considered the possibility that
by taking the land in question it would deprive the Tribe of
its authority to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on
that land. Instead, it finds Congress' intent implicit in the
fact that Congress deprived the Tribe of its right to exclusive use of the land, that Congress gave the Army Corps of
Engineers authority to regulate public access to the land,
and that Congress failed explicitly to reserve to the Tribe
the right to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing. Despite its citation of Dion, supra, Menominee Tribe v. United
States, 391 U. S. 404 (1968), and County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251
(1992), see ante, at 687, the majority adopts precisely the
sort of reasoning-by-implication that those cases reject.

The majority supposes that the Tribe's right to regulate
non-Indian hunting and fishing is incidental to and dependent
on its treaty right to exclusive use of the area and that the
Tribe's right to regulate was therefore lost when its right to

701Cite as: 508 U. S. 679 (1993)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
exclusive use was abrogated. See ante, at 689. This rea-soning fails on two counts. First, treaties " `must . . . be

construed, not according to the technical meaning of [their]words to learned lawyers, but in the sense in which they
would naturally be understood by the Indians.' " Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing
Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 676 (1979), quoting Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1, 11 (1899). I find it implausible that theTribe here would have thought every right subsumed in the

Fort Laramie Treaty's sweeping language to be defeated themoment they lost the right to exclusive use of their land.
Second, the majority's myopic focus on the Treaty ignores
the fact that this Treaty merely confirmed the Tribe's preexisting sovereignty over the reservation land. Even on the
assumption that the Tribe's treaty-based right to regulate
hunting and fishing by non-Indians was lost with the Tribe's
power to exclude non-Indians, its inherent authority to regulate such hunting and fishing continued.

The majority's reliance on Montana and Brendale in this
regard is misplaced. In those cases, the reservation land at
issue had been conveyed in fee to non-Indians pursuant to
the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, which
aimed at the eventual elimination of reservations and the
assimilation of Indian peoples. See Montana, 450 U. S., at
559, n. 9. In Montana, the Court concluded: "It defies common sense to suppose that Congress would intend that nonIndians purchasing allotted lands would become subject to
tribal jurisdiction when an avowed purpose of the allotment
policy was the ultimate destruction of tribal government."
Id., at 560, n. 9. See also Brendale v. Confederated Tribes
and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 423 (1989) (opinion of White, J.). The majority finds the purpose for which
the land is alienated irrelevant, relying on Montana's statement that " `what is relevant . . . is the effect of the land
alienation occasioned by that policy on Indian treaty rights
tied to Indian use and occupation of reservation land.' "

702 SOUTH DAKOTA v. BOURLAND

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Ante, at 692, quoting Montana, 450 U. S., at 560, n. 9 (empha-sis added by Court). This statement, however, simply responded to an argument that "[t]he policy of allotment andsale of surplus reservation land was . . . repudiated in 1934."
Ibid. Read in context, the language on which the majority
relies in no way rejects Congress' purpose as irrelevant butrather specifies

which congressional purpose is relevant--
i. e., its purpose at the time Indian land is alienated.In this case, as the majority acknowledges, see

ante, at
683-684, Congress' purpose was simply to build a dam. Con-gress also provided that the taken area should be open to

non-Indians for "recreational purposes." See ante, at 689.
But these uses of the land are perfectly consistent with continued tribal authority to regulate hunting and fishing by
non-Indians. To say that non-Indians may hunt and fish in
the taken area is not to say that they may do so free of tribal
regulation any more than it is to say that they may do so
free of state or federal regulation. Even if the Tribe lacks
the power to exclude, it may sanction with fines and other
civil penalties those who violate its regulations.

Apparently the majority also believes that tribal authority
to regulate hunting and fishing is inconsistent with the fact
that Congress has given the Army Corps of Engineers authority to promulgate regulations for use of the area by the
general public. See ante, at 691, 692, and n. 13. I see no
inconsistency. The Corps in fact has decided not to promulgate its own hunting and fishing regulations and instead has
provided that "[a]ll Federal, state and local laws governing
[hunting, fishing, and trapping] apply on project lands and
waters." 36 CFR $ 327.8 (1992); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.
This regulation clearly envisions a system of concurrent jurisdiction over hunting and fishing in the taken area. The
majority offers no explanation why concurrent jurisdiction
suddenly becomes untenable when the local authority is an
Indian tribe. To the extent that such a system proves unworkable, the regulations themselves provide that tribal

rights prevail, for part 327 applies to "lands and waterswhich are subject to treaties and Federal laws and regulations concerning the rights of Indian Nations" only to theextent that part 327 is "not inconsistent with such treaties
and Federal laws and regulations." $ 327.1(f).In its search for a statement from Congress abrogating the
Tribe's right to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing inthe taken area, the majority turns to a provision in the Cheyenne River Act that the compensation paid for the taken area" `shall be in final and complete settlement of all claims,
rights, and demands' of the Tribe." Ante, at 690, quotingPub. L. 776, $ II, 68 Stat. 1191. But this provision simply
makes clear that Congress intended no further compensationfor the rights it took from the Tribe. It does not address
the question of which rights Congress intended to take or,more specifically, whether Congress intended to take the
Tribe's right to regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians.The majority also relies on the fact that $ IX of the Act
expressly reserved to the Tribe the right to hunt and fishbut not the right to regulate hunting and fishing. See

ante,at 690. To imply an intent to abrogate Indian rights from

such congressional silence once again ignores the principlesthat "Congress' intention to abrogate Indian treaty rights
be clear and plain," Dion, 476 U. S., at 738, and that " `stat-utes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians,
with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.' "
County of Yakima, 502 U. S., at 269, quoting Montana v.Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759, 766 (1985). Congress' failure

to address the subject of the Tribe's regulatory authorityover hunting and fishing means that the Tribe's authority
survives and not the reverse.3

3 The majority's assertion that this Court's decision in United States v.
Dion, 476 U. S. 734 (1986), supports its conclusion here, see ante, at 693,
is difficult to fathom. In Dion, this Court found that an exemption in the
Bald Eagle Protection Act permitting the taking of eagles for religious
purposes was "difficult to explain except as a reflection of an understand508us2$97N 02-21-97 22:33:49 PAGES OPINPGT

It is some small consolation that the Court's decision per-mits the Federal Government to remedy this situation with

ing that the statute otherwise bans the taking of eagles by Indians." 476
U. S., at 740. The Court correctly notes that $ X of the Cheyenne River
Act and $ 4 of the Flood Control Act cannot be understood except as indications that Congress intended to divest the Tribe of its right to exclusive
use of the taken area. See ante, at 693. It does not follow, however, that
Congress intended to divest the Tribe of its right to regulate the hunting
and fishing of non-Indians in the taken area. As already noted, continued
tribal authority over hunting and fishing is consistent with public access.
And it certainly does not follow from Dion, that "[w]hen Congress reserves limited rights to a tribe or its members, the very presence of such
a limited reservation of rights suggests that the Indians would otherwise
be treated like the public at large." Ante, at 693-694. Indeed, Dion
stands for the directly opposite presumption that implicit abrogation of
treaty rights is disfavored and that "clear evidence" is required "that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the
one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose to resolve that
conflict by abrogating the treaty." 476 U. S., at 740.

Opinion of Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmunand Justice Stevens join, respecting the denial of the petition

for writ of certiorari.

Syvasky Poyner, an inmate sentenced to die in Virginia's elec-tric chair, brought this case as a class action under 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983 and the Eighth Amendment, challenging Virginia's use ofelectrocution as a method of executing people sentenced to death.
Before filing this suit, he had already brought a petition for fed-eral habeas corpus, on which relief was denied by the District
Court: The Court of Appeals affirmed, Poyner v. Murray, 964 F.

508ord$pt1 12-27-96 10:10:51 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)
932 OCTOBER TERM, 1992

Opinion of Souter, J. 508 U. S.
2d 1404 (CA4), and this Court denied certiorari, 506 U. S. 958(1992).

On the day this action was begun, the District Court orallycertified a class of all present and future Virginia capital murderers. See Brief in Opposition 4. The following month, Poynerfiled discovery requests seeking to videotape the execution of
another inmate, Charles Stamper, to videotape the routine pre-electrocution testing of the electric chair at Virginia's Greensville
Correctional Center, and to permit a neuropathologist to observeStamper's autopsy and collect samples of the executed inmate's
brain tissue after it was removed and sectioned by the State'spathologist. At that time, the State's motion to dismiss was
pending in the District Court.The District Court denied the motion to tape the execution,
but granted Poyner's two other requests. The State appealed,and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit not only reversed
the District Court's order, but without briefs or arguments remanded with instructions to dismiss the underlying action withprejudice. It is from this order that certiorari was sought in the

instant petition.

Subsequent to the Fourth Circuit's action, Poyner's own execu-tion was scheduled. On March 18, 1993, this Court denied his

application for stay of execution of his sentence of death, Poynerv.

Murray, 507 U. S. 981, and he was executed. The Court did
not, however, act on the petition for certiorari, which seeks re-view on behalf of the entire class. The Court denies their petition today.

I write separately to note that, because of the procedure usedby the Court of Appeals, the members of the class will not be

precluded by the Court of Appeals's judgment from bringing an-other action in the District Court raising the same constitutional
challenge presented in this case, if they so desire. To begin with,
it is clear that the Court of Appeals acted in this case withoutsubject-matter jurisdiction. The only arguable basis for jurisdiction over the appeal from the District Court's interlocutory orderat issue here was 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(a)(1). However, under a long
line of authority the underlying discovery order of the DistrictCourt was not appealable as an injunction, because it did not
provide " `some or all of the substantive relief sought by [the]
complaint' in more than preliminary fashion." 16 C. Wright, A.

States, 440 U. S. 147, 153 (1979); accord, Blonder-Tongue Labora-tories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 329

(1971). (In this regard, I hardly need observe that the Court'saction on the petition for certiorari today does not act as a disposition on the merits.)Of course I do not mean to imply any opinion about other
procedural defenses to which any such further action may besubject, or about its underlying merits, beyond the suggestion
conveyed by my separate writing that the claim should not beforeclosed. The Court has not spoken squarely on the underlying
issue since In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436 (1890), and the holdingof that case does not constitute a dispositive response to litigation
of the issue in light of modern knowledge about the method ofexecution in question.

No. 92-1213. Virginia Military Institute et al. v. United
States. C. A. 4th Cir. Certiorari denied. Justice Thomastook no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. Reported below: 976 F. 2d 890.

Opinion of Justice Scalia, respecting the denial of the petitionfor writ of certiorari.

Whether it is constitutional for a State to have a men-onlymilitary school is an issue that should receive the attention of
this Court before, rather than after, a national institution as ven-erable as the Virginia Military Institute is compelled to transform
itself. This present petition, however, seeks our intervention be-fore the litigation below has come to final judgment. The Court
of Appeals vacated the judgment that had been entered in favorof petitioners, and remanded the case to the District Court for
determination of an appropriate remedy. It expressly declinedto rule on the "specific remedial course that the Commonwealth
should or must follow hereafter," and suggested permissible reme-dies other than compelling the Virginia Military Institute to abandon its current admissions policy. United States v. Virginia, 976F. 2d 890, 900 (CA4 1992).

We generally await final judgment in the lower courts be-fore exercising our certiorari jurisdiction. See,

e. g., AmericanConstr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148 U. S. 372, 384

(1893); Locomotive Firemen v. Bangor & Aroostook R. Co., 389U. S. 327, 328 (1967)

(per curiam); see generally R. Stern, E.Gressman, & S. Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice $ 4.18, pp. 224-

226 (6th ed. 1986). I think it prudent to take that course here.Our action does not, of course, preclude VMI from raising the
same issues in a later petition, after final judgment has beenrendered. See,

e. g., Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Broth-ers & Co., 240 U. S. 251, 257-259 (1916); Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans

World Airlines, Inc., 409 U. S. 363, 365-366, n. 1 (1973); Stern,Gressman, & Shapiro, supra, $ 4.18, at 226; 17 C. Wright, A.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICEIN CHAMBERS
BLODGETT, SUPERINTENDENT, WASHINGTONSTATE PENITENTIARY

v. CAMPBELL

on application to vacate order

No. A-851. Decided May 14, 1993
An application to vacate an order by the Ninth Circuit en banc, remanding

this case to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing on whether
hanging is cruel and unusual punishment, is dismissed without prejudice. Although the progress in this case has been glacial, see In re
Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236, it would exceed a Circuit Justice's authority--
which is limited to providing or vacating stays and other temporary
relief where necessary or appropriate in aid of this Court's jurisdiction--
to vacate an en banc court's remand order, thereby barring the case's
return to district court and prohibiting the taking of more evidence.

Justice O'Connor, Circuit Justice.
I have before me an application requesting that I vacate aremand order issued by an en banc panel of the United

States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This is notthe first time that applicant James Blodgett, who is Superintendent of the Washington State Penitentiary, has sought re-lief here with respect to Charles Campbell's second petition
for a writ of habeas corpus. Last Term applicant sought awrit of mandamus to compel the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to issue a decision in Campbell'sappeal from a District Court decision denying the petition.
In re Blodgett, 502 U. S. 236 (1992). Campbell's appeal,which had been argued and submitted on June 27, 1989, still
had not been resolved in January 1992, a delay of well overtwo years.

Id., at 237. Although we declined to issue awrit of mandamus--applicant had failed to seek appropriate

relief from the Court of Appeals before seeking extraordi1301

relief again if the panel did not handle the case expeditiously.Id., at 240-241. In fact, we cautioned that "[i]n view of the
delay that has already occurred any further postponementsor extensions of time will be subject to a most rigorous scrutiny in this Court if [applicant] files a further and meritoriouspetition for relief."

Ibid. Approximately three monthslater, the Ninth Circuit panel issued an opinion in applicant's favor.That, however, did not end the matter. If applicant's account is correct, the Ninth Circuit since then has extendedthe time for filing a petition for rehearing in Campbell's case,
granted rehearing en banc, and denied applicant's motion forexpedited review. After vacating submission of the case so
it could receive and review supplemental briefs, the NinthCircuit en banc panel issued an order remanding the case
to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing on whetherhanging is cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth
Amendment. The court, however, did not indicate that thehearings the District Court already had held were inadequate. Nor did it conclude that the District Court wouldhave erred had it denied Campbell a hearing altogether. Instead, the en banc court stated that, because it had "chosento address whether hanging is cruel and unusual punishment," it would be helpful to have "the benefit of an eviden-tiary hearing, with findings and conclusions by the district
court." Campbell v. Blodgett, No. 89-35210 (Apr. 28, 1993),p. 1. Applicant moved for reconsideration of that order, and
the en banc court denied the motion. Judges O'Scannlainand Kleinfeld dissented:

"Over a year ago, the Supreme Court reminded usthat the State of Washington has sustained `severe prejudice' by the stay of execution in this case, which is nowover four years old.

In re Blodgett, [502 U. S. 236(1992)]. While the further delay to be caused by this

Opinion in Chambers
remand order may not be egregious, it is symptomaticof this court's handling of this case. . . . Absent any indication by this court that the district court erred--byholding that Campbell was [wrongfully] denied a hearing
on this issue altogether or that the hearing given wassomehow inadequate as a matter of law--I can see no
basis to remand for a new evidentiary hearing." Campbell v. Blodgett, No. 89-35210 (May 7, 1993), pp. 2-3.

Frustrated with the slow rate of progress and the addi-tional delay occasioned by the en banc court's April 28 remand order, Blodgett has submitted an application that asksme to vacate that order. Although I am concerned about
the glacial progress in this case, I have grave doubts aboutmy authority to offer such relief by way of application.
After all, most applications seek temporary relief, such as astay of judgment, vacation of a stay, or a temporary injunction, and only where necessary or appropriate in aid of thisCourt's jurisdiction. See, e. g., Drummond v. Acree, 409
U. S. 1228 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers) (application forstay); O'Brien v. Skinner, 409 U. S. 1240 (1972) (Marshall, J.,
in chambers) (application for stay); see also Coleman v. Pac-car Inc., 424 U. S. 1301 (1976) (

Rehnquist, J., in chambers)(application to vacate lower court stay);

American Trucking
Assns., Inc. v. Gray, 483 U. S. 1306 (1987) (Blackmun, J., inchambers) (application for injunction requiring that funds be

escrowed pending outcome of case). Applicant, however,does not seek interim relief. Nor has he filed with this
Court a petition for either a writ of certiorari or an extraor-dinary writ. Rather, he requests that I act alone to vacate
the remand order of the en banc court, thereby barring thecase's return to district court and prohibiting the taking of
more evidence. I have not located a single published orderin which a Circuit Justice has vacated or reversed a court of
appeals' order, other than an order providing interim relief;indeed, it appears that such an action would exceed my authority, which is limited to providing or vacating stays and

other temporary relief where necessary or appropriate in aidof this Court's jurisdiction. See Kimble v. Swackhamer, 439

U. S. 1385 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) ("It scarcelyrequires reference to authority to conclude that a single Circuit Justice has no authority to `summarily reverse' a judg-ment of the highest court of a State; a single Justice has
authority only to grant interim relief in order to preservethe jurisdiction of the full Court to consider an applicant's
claim on the merits"). Because I do not believe I have theauthority to vacate the Court of Appeals' remand order unilaterally in my capacity as Circuit Justice, the application isdismissed without prejudice.
